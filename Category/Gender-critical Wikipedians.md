Userboxes

The following userboxes use :Category:Gender-Critical Wikipedians, and inserting them into your userpage _should_ automatically add you to this category. If it doesn't, place [[Category:Gender-critical_Wikipedians|YOUR NAME]] in your user page, replacing YOUR NAME with the name you wish to be listed under (your preferred name). To add yourself to this category without using a userbox, place [[Category:Gender-critical_Wikipedians|YOUR NAME]] in your user page, replacing YOUR NAME with the name you wish to be listed under (your preferred name). The nameless are listed under U for user.
