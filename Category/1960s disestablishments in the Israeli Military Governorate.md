Organizations, places or other things closed or disestablished in the ISRAELI MILITARY GOVERNORATE in the 1960S.

The Israeli Military Governorate was a military government established following the Six Day War in June 1967, in order to govern the civilian population of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. The Egyptâ€“Israel Peace Treaty led Israel to give up the Sinai Peninsula in 1982 and transform the military rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into the Israeli Civil Administration in 1981. The Western part of Golan Heights was effectively annexed by Israel the same year, thus abolishing the Military Governorate system entirely.
