Rather than speed, of patrolling and the use of CORRECT CSD CRITERIA are essential to good reviewing. Please, pay attention to:

-   USING THE PAGE CURATION SCRIPT - if you would like a link to Special:NewPagesFeed in your top toolbar.
-   NOT OVER-TAGGING - many maintenance queues continuously grow, and many tags won't necessarily bring additional attention to the article.
-   MAKING USE OF THE MESSAGE AND WIKILOVE FEATURES - communicating specific feedback with new articles creators creates a more welcoming and constructive environment.

If you don't know what to do, ASK FOR HELP or leave the article for another reviewer.

If you want to review particular TYPES, CATEGORIES OR TOPICS OF ARTICLES, consider using the NPP Browser tool on Labs. To view new files, see Special:NewFiles. For all new pages, see Special:NewPages.
