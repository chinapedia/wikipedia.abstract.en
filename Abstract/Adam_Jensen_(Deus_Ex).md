ADAM JENSEN is a fictional character in the _Deus Ex_ series, the player character of Eidos Montr√©al's _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ (2011) and _Deus Ex: Mankind Divided_ (2016). Initially an ex-cop turned Chief of Security for Sarif Industries, Jensen is mortally wounded at the beginning of _Human Revolution_ by an assault on the facilities. As part of his contract Jensen is forcibly "augmented" with mechanical parts that replace much of his body.
