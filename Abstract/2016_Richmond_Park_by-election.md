The RICHMOND PARK BY-ELECTION was a UK parliamentary by-election in the constituency of Richmond Park which was held on 1 December 2016.[1][2] It was triggered by the resignation of the Conservative Member of Parliament Zac Goldsmith on 25 October 2016 over the Government's proposal for a third runway at the nearby Heathrow Airport. It was won by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, after a campaign focused on opposition to Brexit.
