The _NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION'' (_NIV'') is an English translation of the Bible first published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society). The _NIV_ was published to meet the need for a modern translation done by Bible scholars using the earliest, highest quality manuscripts available. Of equal importance was that the Bible be expressed in broadly understood modern English.
