JOSEPH CONRAD (; born JÓZEF TEODOR KONRAD KORZENIOWSKI; 3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer[1][2] regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language.[3] Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature.[4] Conrad wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe.[5]
