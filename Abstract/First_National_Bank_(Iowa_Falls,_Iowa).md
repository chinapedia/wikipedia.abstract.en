FIRST NATIONAL BANK is a historic building located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States. The bank traces its founding to 1882 when the Commercial Bank of Iowa Falls was established. Its name was changed to First National when they built a two-story brick building at this location two years later. In 1917 the bank decided it needed a new facility, so they turned to the Lytle Company of Sioux City, Iowa, which specialized in designing bank buildings.[1] They designed this two-story brick Neoclassical structure. A rich surface pattern on the building was achieved with the use of terra cotta and special colors of brick.[2] First National continued in business here until December 21, 1932 when it closed its doors. Iowa Falls State Bank was organized and opened in this building on May 25, 1933. In more recent years they expanded into the modern building immediately to the west.
