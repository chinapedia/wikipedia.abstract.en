Bind}} BIND (), or NAMED (pronounced _name-dee_: , short for _name daemon_), is the most widely used Domain Name System (DNS) software on the Internet.[1][2][3] On Unix-like operating systems it is the _de facto_ standard.[4][5] It performs both of the main DNS server roles â€“ acting as an authoritative name server for one or more specific domains, and acting as a recursive resolver for the DNS system generally.
