In Greek mythology, LETHE (Greek: , _Lḗthē_; , ) was one of the five rivers of the underworld of Hades. Also known as the _Ameles potamos_ (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld, where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often identified.
