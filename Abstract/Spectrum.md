Rainbow_above_Kaviskis_Lake,_Lithuania.jpg]] A SPECTRUM (plural _spectra_ or _spectrums_)[1] is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
