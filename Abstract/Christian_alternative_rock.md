CHRISTIAN ALTERNATIVE ROCK is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic,[1] though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.
