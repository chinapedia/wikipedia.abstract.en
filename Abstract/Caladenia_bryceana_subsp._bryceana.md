_CALADENIA BRYCEANA_ SUBSP. _BRYCEANA_, commonly known as the DWARF SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and a single green to apricot-coloured flower. It is a small orchid and difficult to find, even when quite abundant in a particular location. It is found in the far south-west corner of the state, unlike subspecies _cracens_ which grows near Kalbarri.
