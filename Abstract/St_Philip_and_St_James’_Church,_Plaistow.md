ST PHILIP AND ST JAMESâ€™ CHURCH is a Church of England church in Plaistow, east London.[1] It originated as two churches before being merged into the joint parish of St Philip and St James in 1955. That parish in its turn has now become part of the Parish of the Divine Compassion along with three other parishes in Plaistow and Canning Town - St Mary's, St Matthias' and St Martin's.[2]
