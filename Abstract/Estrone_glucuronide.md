ESTRONE GLUCURONIDE, or ESTRONE-3-D-GLUCURONIDE, is a conjugated metabolite of estrone.[1] It is formed from estrone in the liver by UDP-glucuronyltransferase via attachment of glucuronic acid and is eventually excreted in the urine by the kidneys.[2] It has much higher water solubility than does estrone.[3] Glucuronides are the most abundant estrogen conjugates and estrone glucuronide is the dominant metabolite of estradiol.[4]
