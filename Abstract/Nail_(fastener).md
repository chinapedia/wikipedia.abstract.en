In woodworking and construction, a NAIL is a small object made of metal (or wood, called a tree nail or "trunnel") which is used as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration.[1] Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a _wire nail_. Other types of nails include _pins_, _tacks_, _brads_, _spikes_, and _cleats._
