On September 11, 1951, an Egyptian newspaper, _al-Ahram_, published a fatwa on whether or not the consumption of the soft drinks Coca-Cola and Pepsi were allowed under Islamic law. The mufti, or Islamic judge, Hasanayn al-Makhluf was the individual who ruled on this matter.[1] The reason that this was investigated under Islamic law was because of rumors and conspiracies spreading among the public about these brands. One of these conspiracies was that the Coca-Cola logo, when reflected in a mirror, spelled out "No Mohammed no Mecca" in Arabic.[2]
