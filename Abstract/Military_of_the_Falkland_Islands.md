The FALKLAND ISLANDS are a British overseas territory and, as such, rely on the UK for the guarantee of their security. The other UK territories in the South Atlantic, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, fall under the protection of BRITISH FORCES SOUTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS (BFSAI), formerly known as BRITISH FORCES FALKLAND ISLANDS (BFFI), which includes commitments from the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.[1] They are headed by the Commander of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (CBFSAI).[2]
