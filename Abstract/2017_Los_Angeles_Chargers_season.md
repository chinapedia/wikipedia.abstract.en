The 2017 LOS ANGELES CHARGERS SEASON was the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League (NFL), the 58th overall, the second in the Greater Los Angeles Area and the first under head coach Anthony Lynn. It was the Chargers' first season in Los Angeles since their inaugural 1960 season, when they were in the AFL, as the team exercised its option to move back to the city and join the Los Angeles Rams on January 12, 2017.[1] The 2017 season was the first of three seasons played at StubHub Center prior to the new stadium in Inglewood being completed in 2020.
