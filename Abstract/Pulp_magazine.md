Spicy_Mystery_Stories_February_1936.jpg PULP MAGAZINES (often referred to as "THE PULPS") were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term _pulp_ derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called "glossies" or "slicks". The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was wide by high, and thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges.
