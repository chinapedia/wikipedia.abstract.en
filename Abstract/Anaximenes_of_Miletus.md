ANAXIMENES OF MILETUS (; ; ) was an Ancient Greek Pre-Socratic philosopher active in the latter half of the 6th century BC.[1][2] The details of his life are obscure and undocumented because none of his work has been preserved. Anaximenes's ideas and philosophies are known today because of comments made by Aristotle and other writers on the history of Greek Philosophy.[3] Apollodurus noted the dates Anaximander was alive in relation to defining historical events, and estimated Anaximenes's lifespan to occur in same time period that Cyrus beat Croesus in the Battle of Thymbra in 546 BCE.[4] Some of his writings survived the Hellenistic Age, but no record of these documents currently exist.[5] As one of the three Milesian philosophers that were considered the first revolutionary thinkers of the Western world,[6] he is best known and identified as a younger friend or student of Anaximander.[7][8] Much of his astronomical thought was based on Anaximander's, but he altered Anaximander's astrological ideas to better fit his own philosophical views on physics and the natural world.[9] The Ionian school was the first school on record that encouraged their pupils to constructively criticize their master's teachings,[10] which aptly demonstrated a tolerance toward new ideas and logic for their time. Thales taught Anaximander, and Anaximander taught Anaximenes.[11] Each philosopher developed a distinct system of cosmology without completely rejecting their teacher's view of universe or creating major disagreement between them.[12] Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practiced material monism.[13][14] This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today. Anaximenes was the last known Milesian philosopher, as Miletus was taken over by the Persian army in 494 BC.[15] Because none of his works contain theological references, there is no evidence as to whether or not he practiced religion or if he was an atheist.[16] Milesian
