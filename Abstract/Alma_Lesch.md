ALMA LESCH (March 12, 1917 â€“ May 15, 1999) was an American fiber artist known for her fiber portraits.[1] She was "the undisputed grande dame of Kentucky textile arts."[2] A historic marker notes her achievements in Shepherdsville, where Lesch lived and had her studio.[3] Lesch's quilt, _Bathshebas Bedspread_, was included in the _Objects USA_ exhibit in 1969, which was organized by S.C. Johnson and Son.[4]
