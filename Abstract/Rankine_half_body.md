Rankine_half_body_flow_schematic.svg In the field of fluid dynamics, a RANKINE HALF BODY is a feature of fluid flow discovered by Scottish physicist and engineer William Rankine that is formed when a fluid source is added to a fluid undergoing potential flow. Superposition of uniform flow and source flow yields the rankine half body flow. A practical example of this type of flow is a bridge pier or a strut placed in a uniform stream. The resulting stream function (ψ) and velocity potential (ϕ) are obtained by simply adding the stream function and velocity potential for each individual flow.
