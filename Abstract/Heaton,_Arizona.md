HEATON is a populated place situated in Pinal County, Arizona.[1] Originally called MARICOPA STATION, it served as a stop on the railroad line, where passengers transferred to stagecoach. The post office at this location was simply named MARICOPA. During a land boom in the late 1880s, it was thought that this stop would become a railway stop on the line directly connecting to Phoenix. As expansion into a town was being considered if the planned rail connection became reality, the expanded community was to be named MARICOPAVILLE.[2] In 1887, when the rail line connection went to Maricopa Junction (present day Maricopa) instead, the town's expansion was abandoned, and the name of the town was changed to its current Heaton.[3] It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[4]
