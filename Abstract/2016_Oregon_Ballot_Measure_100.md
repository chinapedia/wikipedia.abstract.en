OREGON BALLOT MEASURE 100, titled the WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PREVENTION ACT, is a ballot measure in the 2016 election in the U.S. state of Oregon. The measure prohibited the purchase, sale, or possession with intent to sell products and parts from specified nonnative wildlife species, specifically elephant, rhinoceros, whale, tiger, lion, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, pangolin, sea turtle, shark, and ray.[1] The ballot measures created several exceptions for activities for law enforcement purposes, activities authorized by federal law, transfers of certain antiques and musical instruments, certain donations for scientific or educational purposes, and non-commercial transfers through gifts or inheritance, and well as for possession by enrolled members of federally recognized tribes.[2] The ballot measure largely banned, among other things, the ivory trade in the state.[3]
