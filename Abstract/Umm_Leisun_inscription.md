The UMM LEISUN INSCRIPTION () is the Old Georgian _limestone_ _tombstone_ slab inscription written in the Georgian _Asomtavruli_ script which was discovered in 2002, after the renewal of 1996[1] excavation, at a Georgian monastery of the Byzantine period, in the neighborhood of Umm Leisun, 4.5 km southeast of the Old City of Jerusalem,[2] found in a burial crypt under the polychrome[3] mosaic floor.[4]
