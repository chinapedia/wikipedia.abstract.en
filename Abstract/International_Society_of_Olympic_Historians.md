The INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF OLYMPIC HISTORIANS (ISOH) is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games. The majority of recent books on the Olympic Games have been written by ISOH members.[1] The ISOH publishes the _JOURNAL OF OLYMPIC HISTORY_ (JOH, formerly _Citius, Altius, Fortius_) three times a year.
