RRC_sign.JPG, Wyncote, Pennsylvania.]] RECONSTRUCTIONIST JUDAISM ( or ) is a modern Jewish movement that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization and is based on the conceptions developed by Mordecai Kaplan (1881â€“1983). The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, before it seceded in 1955[1] and established a rabbinical college in 1967.[2]
