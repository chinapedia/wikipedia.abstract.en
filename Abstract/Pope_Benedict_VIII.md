POPE BENEDICT VIII (; c. 980[1] – 9 April 1024) reigned from 18 May 1012 to his death in 1024. He was born THEOPHYLACTUS to the noble family of the counts of Tusculum (son of Gregory, Count of Tusculum, and brother of future Pope John XIX), descended from Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, like his predecessor Pope Benedict VII (973–974). Horace Mann considered him "...one of the few popes of the Middle Ages who was at once powerful at home and great abroad."[2]
