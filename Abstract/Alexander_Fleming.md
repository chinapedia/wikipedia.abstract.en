SIR ALEXANDER FLEMING [1] (6 August 1881 â€“ 11 March 1955) was a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist. His best-known discoveries are the enzyme lysozyme in 1923 and the world's first antibiotic substance benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) from the mould _Penicillium notatum_ in 1928, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain.[2][3][4] He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy.
