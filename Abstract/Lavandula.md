_LAVANDULA_ (common name LAVENDER) is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia, China (_Plectranthus mona lavender_) to southeast India.[1] Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils.[2] The most widely cultivated species, _Lavandula angustifolia_, is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the flowers of this species.
