VORTEX BLADELESS LTD. is a Spanish tech startup that is developing a type of wind turbine without blades nor gears or shafts. The Vortex's wind turbine is not actually a turbine since it does not rotate. It is based on the phenomenon of aeroelastic resonance, harnessing energy from the wind on the emission of Von Karman's vortexes. This process is called Vortex Shedding or Vortex Street Effect, and it is usually a problem for architecture and aeronautics. Thanks to this phenomenon the device is able to oscillate with a little movement which needs no lubricants.[1][2]
