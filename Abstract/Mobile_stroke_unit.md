2016.05.04_MSU,_Mobile_Stroke_Unit_interior.jpgA MOBILE STROKE UNIT is an ambulance that furnishes services to diagnose, evaluate, and/or treat symptoms of an acute Stroke.[1] It may contain, in addition to the normal ambulance equipment, a device for brain imaging (computerized tomography), a point-of-care laboratory and telemedical interaction between ambulance and hospital (videoconferencing, exchange of videos of patient examination and CT scans). Thus, this specialized ambulance includes all the tools necessary for hyperacute assessment and treatment of stroke patients and diagnosis-based triage directly at the emergency site.
