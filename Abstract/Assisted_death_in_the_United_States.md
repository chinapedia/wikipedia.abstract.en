Assisted death, known as medical aid in dying to proponents and assisted suicide to opponents, is a practice in which a terminally ill adult with less than six months to live may request a lethal dose of drugs from their doctor for self-administration to bring about death if they feel that the dying process has become unbearable. Data from the Oregon Health Authority, which publishes annual reports on its first-in-the-nation assisted death law, approximately two thirds of patients who qualify and receive a prescription take it.[1]
