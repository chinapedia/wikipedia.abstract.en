MTV (originally an initialism of MUSIC TELEVISION) is an American pay television channel that serves as the flagship property of owner Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and is headquartered in New York City. The channel was launched on August 1, 1981,[1] and originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as "video jockeys" (VJs).[2] At first, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily teenagers, particularly high school and college students.
