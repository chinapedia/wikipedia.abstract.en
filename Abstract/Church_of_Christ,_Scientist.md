The CHURCH OF CHRIST, SCIENTIST was founded in 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts, by Mary Baker Eddy, author of _Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,_ and founder of Christian Science. The church was founded "to commemorate the word and works of [Christ Jesus]" and "reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing". Sunday services are held throughout the year and weekly testimony meetings are held on Wednesday evenings, where following brief readings from the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, those in attendance are invited to give testimonies of healing brought about through Christian Science prayer.
