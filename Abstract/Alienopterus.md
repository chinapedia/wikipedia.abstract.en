_ALIENOPTERUS BRACHYELYTRUS_ is an extinct insect described from a 99 million year old fossil found in amber from the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar. It was the first known member of the order Alienoptera until 2018, when the second and third members of the order, _Caputoraptor elegans_, and _Alienopterella stigmatica_ were described.[1][2] _A. brachyelytrus_ has characters that are shared with cockroaches and mantids and is thought to represent either the sister taxon, or an ancestor to mantids.[3]
