The FOREIGN POLICY OF THE ANGELA MERKEL GOVERNMENT has been the foreign policy of Germany since Merkel took office as Chancellor of Germany in November 2005. During Merkel's chancellorship, Merkel has personally been highly active in the field of the foreign policy. She named Frank-Walter Steinmeier to serve as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2009; the office was subsequently held by Guido Westerwelle from 2009 to 2013, and again by Steinmeier from 2013. He was suceeded by Sigmar Gabriel in 2017, who was himself suceeded by Heiko Maas in 2018.
