_MY OWN PRIVATE RIVER_ is a re-contextualized adventure drama film of _My Own Private Idaho_ (1991).[1] Using footage shot and directed by Gus Van Sant in 1990, the new edit gives James Franco and Van Sant a shared director credit.[2] The project is in tribute to Franco's favorite actor, River Phoenix. Franco called "_Idaho_" one of his favorite movies and praised River's performance as the actor's best.[3]
