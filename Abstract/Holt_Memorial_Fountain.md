The HOLT MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN is a fountain located in Stafford Springs, Connecticut. The fountain was built in 1894 in memorial of Charles Holt, the owner of the Phoenix Woolen Co, a local mill.[1] The fountain causes a roundabout to form with Route 32 and Route 190 intersecting. The fountain water system had been broken due to a truck crash some time before 1996.[2] The fountain was proposed to be moved in 1990 to help traffic, but it was greatly opposed by the town.[3] The former railroad station is located less than 100 feet away.[4]
