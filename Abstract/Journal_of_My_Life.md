_JOURNAL OF MY LIFE_ () is an autobiography by Jacques-Louis Ménétra, an eighteenth-century master glazier in Paris. Begun in 1764, when Ménétra returned from a journeyman's tour of the French provinces, Ménétra's text intersperses accounts of his life on the road and in Paris with tall tales, braggadocio, jokes, and accounts of his seductions and pranks. In the words of historian Robert Darnton, Ménétra's narrative "restores the human dimension to the study of social conditions and brings flesh and blood to lifeless sociological categories. What we can finally see, with the help of these memoirs, is ordinary, everyday life."
