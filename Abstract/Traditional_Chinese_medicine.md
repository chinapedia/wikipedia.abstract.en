TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) is a style of traditional medicine based on more than 2,500 years of Chinese medical practice that includes various forms of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy,[1] but recently also influenced by modern Western medicine. TCM is widely used in Sinosphere[2][3][4][5] where it has a long history, and recently it has begun "gaining global recognition".[6][7] One of the basic tenets of TCM is that "the body's vital energy (_ch'i_ or _qi_) circulates through channels, called _meridians_, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions."[8] Concepts of the body and of disease used in TCM reflect its ancient origins and its emphasis on dynamic processes over material structure, similar to European humoral theory.[9]
