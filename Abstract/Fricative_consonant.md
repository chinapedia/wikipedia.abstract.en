FRICATIVES are consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together[1]. These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of ; the back of the tongue against the soft palate, in the case of German (the final consonant of _Bach_); or the side of the tongue against the molars, in the case of Welsh (appearing twice in the name _Llanelli_). This turbulent airflow is called FRICATION.
