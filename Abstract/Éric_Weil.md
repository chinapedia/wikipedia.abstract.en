ÉRIC WEIL (/veɪl/; French: [vɛjl]; 4 June 1904 - 1 February 1977) was a French-German philosopher noted for the development of a theory that places the effort to understand violence at the center of philosophy. Calling himself a post-Hegelian Kantian, Weil was a key figure in the 20th century reception of Hegel in France, as well as the renewed interest in Kant in that country that has continued to this day. The author of major original works, critical studies, and numerous essays in French his adopted language, as well as German and English, Weil was both an active academic as well as public intellectual. Involved in various fecund moments of French intellectual life, Weil was, for example, a participant in the famous lectures given by Alexandre Kojève on Hegel's _Phenomenology of Spirit_, and would go on to play an instrumental role at the journal _Critique_ during its start and then serve as one of its editors for a number of years.[1] An influential teacher, his students, such as Bourdieu, have noted Weil's formative role in their intellectual development.[2] This influence was also at the origin of the creation of the _Institut Éric Weil_, a foundation and research library created by a group of his former students after his death.
