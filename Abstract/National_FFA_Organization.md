NATIONAL FFA ORGANIZATION is an American 501(c)(3) youth organization, specifically a career and technical student organization, based on middle and high school classes that promote and support agricultural education. It was founded in 1925 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, by agriculture teachers, Henry C. Groseclose,[1] Walter Newman, Edmund Magill and Harry Sanders as FUTURE FARMERS OF VIRGINIA. In 1928, it became a nationwide organization known as FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA. In 1988 the name was changed to the National FFA Organization, now commonly referred to as FFA, to recognize that the organization is for those with diverse interests in the food, fiber and natural resource industries, encompassing science, business and technology in addition to production agriculture.[2] Today FFA is among the largest youth organizations in the United States, with 669,989 members in 8,630 chapters[3] throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. FFA is the largest of the career and technical student organizations in U.S. schools.
