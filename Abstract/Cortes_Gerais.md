The CORTES GERAIS (Portuguese: _General Courts_; pre-1911: CORTES GERAES[1]) were the legislature of the Kingdom of Portugal during the Constitutional Monarchy period.[2] The Cortes were established by provision of the 1822 Portuguese Constitution as a unicameral parliament.[3] However, the Constitutional Charter of 1826 reformed the Cortes as a bicameral legislature, with the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers of the Kingdom as its upper house and the Chamber of Gentlemen Deputies of the Portuguese Nation as its lower house.[4]
