DEVIL MOUNTAIN, sometimes mistakenly called DEVIL'S MOUNTAIN, is a wooded mountain in the Municipality of Temagami, Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It overlies Devil Island in Lake Temagami with an elevation of above sea level. A short trail from Angus Point leads to an overlook some above Lake Temagami. From here, Maple Mountain can be seen on a clear day.[1]
