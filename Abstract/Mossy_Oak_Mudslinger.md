MOSSY OAK MUDSLINGER #790 (1997â€“2012) was a Professional Bull Riders (PBR) 2006 World Champion bucking bull. In 2017, the PBR honored the bull with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor, which is the equivalent of a hall of fame. This is the highest honor the PBR can award to a bull. He is only the seventh bull to receive this honor. His owners retired Mossy Oak Mudslinger after the 2006 season ended, while he was still in his peak. Mossy Oak Mudslinger died in 2012 when he was almost 15 years old. His owners buried him on their ranch.
