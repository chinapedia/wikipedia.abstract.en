SANITY (from ) refers to the soundness, rationality, and health of the human mind, as opposed to insanity. A person is sane if they are rational. In modern society, the term has become exclusively synonymous with _COMPOS MENTIS_ (, having mastery of, and , mind), in contrast with _non compos mentis_, or insane, meaning troubled conscience. A sane mind is nowadays considered healthy both from its analytical - once called _rational_ - and emotional aspects.[1] Furthermore, according to Chesterton,[2] sanity involves wholeness, whereas insanity implies narrowness and brokenness.
