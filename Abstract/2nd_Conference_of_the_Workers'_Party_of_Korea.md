The 2ND CONFERENCE OF THE WORKERS PARTY OF KOREA was held in Pyongyang in October 1966. At the time the domestic and international situation of the Korean Worker's Party was complicated by the Sino-Soviet split, which had caused a rift among communist countries and parties. Kim Il-sung delivered the report _The Present Situation and the Tasks of Our Party_ which emphasized unity between socialist countries and within the international communist movement, as well as directing the main blow to United States imperialism, particularly with regards to the Vietnam War. He also emphasized the need for "politico-ideological unity of the revolutionary ranks".[1]
