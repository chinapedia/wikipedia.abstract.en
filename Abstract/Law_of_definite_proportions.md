In chemistry, the LAW OF DEFINITE PROPORTION, sometimes called PROUST'S LAW or THE LAW OF DEFINITE COMPOSITION, or LAW OF CONSTANT COMPOSITION states that a given chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio (by mass) and does not depend on its source and method of preparation. For example oxygen makes up about ⁸/₉ of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining ¹/₉ of the mass. Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry.[1]
