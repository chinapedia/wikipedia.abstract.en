KARIPÚNA FRENCH CREOLE, also known as AMAPÁ FRENCH CREOLE and _LANC-PATUÁ_, is a French-based creole language spoken by the Karipúna community, which lives in the Uaçá Indian Reservation in the state of Amapá, on the Curipi and Oyapock rivers.[1] It is mostly French-lexified except for flora and fauna terms, with a complex mix of substratum languages—most notably the extinct Tupian Karipúna language.
