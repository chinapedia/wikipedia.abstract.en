The MASTER OF THE DRAPERY STUDIES (), also known as MASTER OF THE COBURG ROUNDELS () is the notname given to the "very productive"[1] and "multifaceted"[2] late 15th-century author of some 30 surviving paintings and over 150 surviving drawings.[3] Indeed, according to the J. Paul Getty Museum, up to 180 surviving drawings "have been attributed to this master, comprising one of the most extensive bodies of drawn work of any northern European artist before Albrecht DÃ¼rer."[4] Conversely, it has been suggested at least once that both the Master of the Drapery Studies and the Master of the Coburg Roundels may be two separate persons and that their body of work is attributable to a whole circle of artists.[5]
