__ MEASUREMENT is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events.[1][2] The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In the natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the _International vocabulary of metrology_ published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.[3] However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.[4][5]
