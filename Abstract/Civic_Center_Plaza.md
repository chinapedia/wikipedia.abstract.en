CIVIC CENTER PLAZA, also known as JOSEPH ALIOTO PIAZZA, is the plaza immediately east of San Francisco City Hall in Civic Center, San Francisco, in the U.S. state of California.[1][2] Civic Center Plaza occupies two blocks bounded by McAllister, Larkin, Grove, and Carlton B. Goodlett (the section of Polk between City Hall and the plaza was renamed for Dr. Goodlett in 1999), divided into a north block and south block by the former alignment of Fulton Street. The block north of Fulton is built over a three-story parking garage (completed in 1960); the block south of Fulton lies over a former exhibition space, Brooks Hall (completed in 1958).
