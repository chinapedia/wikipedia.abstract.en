The word _piezoelectricity_ means electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat. It is derived from the Greek word ; _piezein_, which means to squeeze or press, and _Ä“lektron_, which means amber, an ancient source of electric charge.[2][3] French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie discovered piezoelectricity in 1880.[4]
