JEAN-FRANÇOIS STEINER is a French-Jewish writer born on 17 February 1938 in Paris, France. He is best known for his controversial non-fiction novel _Treblinka: The Revolt of an Extermination Camp_ first published in 1966 as _Treblinka: la révolte d'un camp d'extermination_;[1][2] translated a year later by Helen Weaver for Simon & Schuster.[3] Written in the first person, the book blames members of the Jewish _Sonderkommando_ for assisting the German SS in perpetrating a genocide. Following outrage among French, Jewish and foreign academics,[4] Steiner agreed to republish his book (which became a bestseller),[5] by presenting it as a fictional account of the Treblinka extermination camp operation. The book remains very popular in France.[6][7]
