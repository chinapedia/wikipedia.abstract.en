The MONTEVIDEO CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES is a treaty signed at Montevideo, Uruguay, on December 26, 1933, during the Seventh International Conference of American States. The Convention codifies the declarative theory of statehood as accepted as part of customary international law.[1] At the conference, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the _Good Neighbor Policy_, which opposed U.S. armed intervention in inter-American affairs. The convention was signed by 19 states. The acceptance of three of the signatories was subject to minor reservations. Those states were Brazil, Peru and the United States.[2]
