(; English translation: "Forward!",[1][2] "Onward!",[3] "Working!" or "On The Move!"),[4] is a centrist,[5] liberal[6] and social-liberal[7] political party in France. It was founded on 6 April 2016 by Emmanuel Macron, a former Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs, who was later elected President of the French Republic in the 2017 election with 66.1% of the second-round vote.[8] Macron considers La République En Marche! to be a progressive movement, uniting both the left and the right.[9]
