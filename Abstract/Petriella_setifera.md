_PETRIELLA SETIFERA_ is a fungus commonly found in soil and feces.[1] The fungus has also been located on wood rot, plant species, and compost.[2][3][4] A significant portion of _P. setifera_ reports are found on sources with no previous association with the fungus. There are no known human cases of fungal infection, but one reported case of a dolphin infection.[5] The fungus may have immunosuppressive characteristics, but it has not been confirmed.[6] Many properties of the fungus are unknown, requiring further research.
