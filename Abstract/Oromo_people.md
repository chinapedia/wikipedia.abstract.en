They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia and represent 34.5% of Ethiopia's population.[2] Oromos speak the Oromo language as a mother tongue (also called _Afaan Oromoo_ and _Oromiffa_), which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. The word _Oromo_ appeared in European literature for the first time in 1893 and slowly became common in the second half of the 20th century.[3][4]
