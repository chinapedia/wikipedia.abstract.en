The FIRST RESPONDER ANTHRAX PREPAREDNESS ACT is a law introduced in the United States Senate by U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire). The law will set up a pilot program that provides anthrax vaccines from the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile to first responders, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would create a tracking system for those who receive the vaccine, and the government would prioritize vaccines close to the end of their labeled dates. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementing the law would cost about $4 million over the 2016-2020 period.[1][2]
