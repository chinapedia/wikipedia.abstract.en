AFROASIATIC (AFRO-ASIATIC), also known as _AFRASIAN_ and in older sources as _HAMITO-SEMITIC'' (_CHAMITO-SEMITIC'')[1] or _SEMITO-HAMITIC_,[2] is a large language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel.[3] Though estimations vary widely, it is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago, making it the oldest established language family in the world.
