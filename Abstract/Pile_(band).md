PILE is an American indie rock band originally from Boston, Massachusetts now based in Nashville, Tennessee. Starting as the solo act of Rick Maguire in the late 2000s, Pile has been a collective since the release of "Magic Isn't Real" in 2010.[1] To date, Pile has released seven full-length albums. In recent years the band has gained increasing popularity, becoming a prominent part of the Boston indie rock scene and frequently touring through both the US and Europe.[2][3] While remaining outside of the mainstream, the band has been repeatedly recognized for captivating a particularly enthusiastic and dedicated fan base.[4][5] Their sound has been described by _The Village Voice_ as a "distinct blend of melted guitars" with "howling-wolf vocals and shred-free guitar harmonies".[6]
