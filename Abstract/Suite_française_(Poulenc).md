_SUITE FRANÇAISE_ (French Suite), FP 80, is an orchestral suite for wind instruments, drum and harpsichord (or harp _ad libitum_) by Francis Poulenc. It was composed in a neoclassical style in 1935 for Édouard Bourdet's _la Reine Margot_, and it was inspired by Claude Gervaise's dance collection _Le livre de danceries_.
