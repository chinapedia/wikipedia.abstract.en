Fabled_diamond_mines.jpg region. Published in 1725]] The {{'}}GOLCONDA DIAMONDS{{'}} are Indian diamonds mined in a specific geographic area within the historic Golconda Sultanate (present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states of India). Diamonds from these mines were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading center and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name 'Golconda Diamond' became synonymous with Golconda itself.
