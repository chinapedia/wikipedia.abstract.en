ANDRONIKOS III PALAIOLOGOS (; 25 March 1297 – 15 June 1341), commonly Latinized as ANDRONICUS III PALAEOLOGUS, was the Byzantine emperor from 1328 to 1341. Born ANDRONIKOS DOUKAS ANGELOS KOMNENOS PALAIOLOGOS (), he was the son of Michael IX Palaiologos and Rita of Armenia. He was proclaimed co-emperor in his youth, before 1313, and in April 1321 he rebelled in opposition to his grandfather, Andronikos II Palaiologos. He was formally crowned co-emperor in February 1325, before ousting his grandfather outright and becoming sole emperor on 24 May 1328.
