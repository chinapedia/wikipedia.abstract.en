JOSHUA GILPIN (1765â€“1840) was an American merchant and manufacturer who toured industrial Britain at the very end of the eighteenth century. On his return home (in 1801), he introduced to America the technique of chemically bleaching paper-stuff in 1804 and following his second trip, 1811-1815, his brother, Thomas Gilpin, jr, manufactured in 1817 the first paper-making machine in America.
