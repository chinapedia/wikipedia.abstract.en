A plough may be made of wood, iron, or steel frame with an attached blade or stick used to cut and loosen the soil. It has been a basic instrument for most of history[2], and is one of the most significant inventions. The earliest ploughs were wheelless, with the Romans using a wheelless plough called the _aratrum_, but Celtic peoples began using wheeled ploughs during the Roman era.[3]
