The CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL (CMM) is a development model created after a study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term "maturity" relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from _ad hoc_ practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes.
