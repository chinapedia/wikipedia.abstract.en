The 2017 INDIANAPOLIS COLTS SEASON was the franchise's 65th season in the National Football League, the 34th in Indianapolis and the tenth playing their home game at Lucas Oil Stadium. It was also the sixth and final season under head coach Chuck Pagano, who was fired at the end of the season. It was also the first under new general manager Chris Ballard, the former Kansas City Chiefs' Director of Football Operations, following the dismissal of Ryan Grigson. The Colts were looking to improve on their 8â€“8 record from last year and make the playoffs for the first time since 2014. However, star quarterback Andrew Luck suffered an injury before the regular season began and was placed on the injured reserve list, putting the season in doubt.
