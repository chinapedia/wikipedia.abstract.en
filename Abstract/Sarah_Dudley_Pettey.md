SARAH DUDLEY PETTEY was an African American political activist in North Carolina devoted to the causes of gender and racial equality, temperance, and women's participation in the public sphere. Dudley Pettey represents female political activism at a time of spreading white supremacy in the era of Jim Crow. Elizabeth Lundeen writes of Dudley Pettey's views, "Sarah Dudley Pettey’s promotion of women’s public work and middle-class values served as an inspiration to subsequent black leaders who fought to secure improvements, however meager, for African Americans during the nadir of race relations in North Carolina."[1]
