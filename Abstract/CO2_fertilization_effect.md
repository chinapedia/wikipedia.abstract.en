The FERTILIZATION EFFECT or CARBON FERTILIZATION EFFECT is the increased rate of photosynthesis in plants that results from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The effect varies depending on the plant species, the temperature, and the availability of water and nutrients.[1] However, enhanced rates of photosynthesis in plants due to fertilization are only partially transferred to enhanced plant growth and any hypothesized CO₂ fertilization response is unlikely to significantly reduce the human-made increases in atmospheric CO₂ concentration over the next century.[2]
