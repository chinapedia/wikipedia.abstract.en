_MICROSERFS_, published by HarperCollins in 1995, is an epistolary novel by Douglas Coupland. It first appeared in short story form[1] as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of _Wired_ magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length.[2] Set in the early 1990s, it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95, and anticipates the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.
