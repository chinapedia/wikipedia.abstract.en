An ALFORD PLEA (also called a KENNEDY PLEA in West Virginia,[1] an ALFORD GUILTY PLEA[2][3][4] and the ALFORD DOCTRINE),[5][6][7] in United States law, is a guilty plea in criminal court,[8][9][10] whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence.[11][12][13] In entering an Alford plea, the defendant admits that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.[14][15][16][17][18]
