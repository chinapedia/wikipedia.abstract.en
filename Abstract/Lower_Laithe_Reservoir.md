LOWER LAITHE RESERVOIR is a man-made upland reservoir that lies west of Haworth, West Yorkshire, England.[1] The reservoir was initially approved under the Keighley Waterworks and Improvement Act of 1869[2] but work did not begin on its construction until 1911 and even then was delayed because of the First World War. The reservoir was officially opened in August 1925 in front of a crowd of over 8,000 people. Its final tally on cost was Â£500,000.[3] The reservoir lies in the Sladen Valley.
