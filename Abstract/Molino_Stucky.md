Molino_Stucky_(Venice).jpg The MOLINO STUCKY is a Neo-Gothic building in Venice, on the western end of Giudecca island, near the ancient village Fortuny. It was built between 1884 and 1895 by the Swiss businessman Giovanni Stucky, whose father had married into the Italian Forti family and moved to the Veneto, and designed by Ernst Wullekopf. It was first built as a flour mill supplied by boats across the lagoon and also operated as a pasta factory.
