INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect.[1][2] The most prominent types of intellectual property are copyrights, patents, and trademarks, though many other types also exist, and some countries recognize more types than others.[3][4][5][6][7] It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.[8]
