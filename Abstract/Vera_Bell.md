VERA BELL or VERA ALBERTA[1] or ALBERTHA[2] BELL (born 1906; date of death unknown) was a Jamaican poet, short-story writer and playwright.[3][4] Her 1948 poem "Ancestor on the Auction Block" has been anthologized several times[5][6] although a 2005 review of _The Oxford Book of Caribbean Verse_ says "some of the earlier poems survive only as amusing museum pieces, such as Vera Bell's "Ancestor on the Auction Block"".[7] The poem is described by Laurence A. Breiner in his _An Introduction to West Indian Poetry_ (1998) as "a poem whose crux is the poet's troubled relation to the poet's ancestral subject/object", and Breiner cites George Lamming as placing the poem "squarely at a liminal moment in the process of establishing contact with a previously objectified or fetishized Other".[8]
