In computer science, REGISTER TRANSFER LANGUAGE (RTL) is a kind of intermediate representation (IR) that is very close to assembly language, such as that which is used in a compiler. It is used to describe data flow at the register-transfer level of an architecture. Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral assembly language. RTL is used as the name of a specific intermediate representation in several compilers, including the Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC), Zephyr, and the European compiler projects CerCo and CompCert.
