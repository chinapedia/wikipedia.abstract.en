DANNY'S REASONS were an American garage rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1962. The band, well known for a longevity which outlasted most garage bands of the era, released five singles throughout their recording career, including covers of "Little Diane" and "Under My Thumb". Although Danny's Reasons' popularity never precipitated to much national chart success, they performed regularly across the United States and have since been featured on compilation albums.
