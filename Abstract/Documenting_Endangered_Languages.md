The DOCUMENTING ENDANGERED LANGUAGES (DEL) program is a joint effort between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to help fund fieldwork, research, and community activities that are involved in recording, documenting, and archiving endangered human languages.[1] Linguists estimate that more than 3,000 of the 6,000-7,000 languages currently spoken will soon be extinct due to the diminishing number of speakers who pass along knowledge of their first languages to their children, and fewer daily activities that occur in these home languages.[2] To address this issue, the NSF and NEH—in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) serving as a research host, but in a non-funding role—announced the first DEL awards in 2005, in an attempt to preserve records of endangered languages in use.[3][4][5]
