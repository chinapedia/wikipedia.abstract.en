The _KITÁB-I-AQDAS_ or _AQDAS_ is the central book of the Bahá'í Faith written by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the religion, in 1873.[1] The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title __ ( / _al-Kitāb al-ʾaqdās_), but it is commonly referred to by its Persian title, _Kitáb-i-Aqdas_ ( / _Ketâb Âqdas_), which was given to the work by Bahá'u'lláh himself. It is sometimes also referred to as "the Most Holy Book", "the Book of Laws" or the BOOK OF AQDAS. The word Aqdas has a significance in many languages as the superlative form of a word with its primary letters Q-D-Š.
