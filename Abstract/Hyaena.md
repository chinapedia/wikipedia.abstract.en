_HYAENA_ is a genus comprising two of the living species of hyenas: the striped hyena (_Hyaena hyaena_) from western Asia and northern Africa and the brown hyena (_Hyaena brunnea_) from southern Africa. The brown hyena has sometimes been placed in a separate genus _Parahyaena_, or even included in the otherwise fossil genus _Pachycrocuta_, but recent sources have tended to place it in _Hyaena_.
