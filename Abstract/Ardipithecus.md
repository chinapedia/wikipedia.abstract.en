_ARDIPITHECUS_ is a genus of an extinct hominine that lived during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene epochs in the Afar Depression, Ethiopia. Originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the chimpanzees, the relation of this genus to human ancestors and whether it is a hominin is now a matter of debate.[1] Two fossil species are described in the literature: _A. ramidus_, which lived about 4.4 million years ago[2] during the early Pliocene, and _A. kadabba_, dated to approximately 5.6 million years ago (late Miocene).[3] Behavioral analysis showed that _Ardipithecus_ could be very similar to chimpanzees, indicating that the early human ancestors were very chimpanzee-like in behavior.[4]
