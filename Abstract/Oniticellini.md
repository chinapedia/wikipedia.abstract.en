ONITICELLINI are a tribe of scarab beetles, in the true dung beetle subfamily (Scarabaeinae).[1] Nearly all species of this tribe feed on and nest in dung, mainly that of large herbivores. Most are tunnelers; dung is buried at the ends of tunnels dug below a dropping, and used as food by both adults and larvae; others, known as dwellers (including _Oniticellus_ and _Tragiscus_) make brood cavities within or just beneath the dung.[2]
