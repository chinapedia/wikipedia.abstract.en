Concealed_hinge_jig.JPG A CONCEALED HINGE DRILLING JIG is a type of support jig, designed for drilling 3Â cm holes to fit concealed hinges into modern wardrobe doors. As many of the complementary tools used in woodworking, it uses an electric hand-drill for its operation, making a Forstner bit to turn.[1][2]
