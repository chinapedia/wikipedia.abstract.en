INFUSORIA is a collective term for minute aquatic creatures such as ciliates, euglenoids, protozoa, unicellular algae and small invertebrates that exist in freshwater ponds. Some authors (e.g., BÃ¼tschli) used the term as a synonym for Ciliophora. In modern formal classifications, the term is considered obsolete; the microorganisms previously included in the Infusoria are mostly assigned to the kingdom Protista. Researchers have proposed that infusoria reproductive rates periodically increase and decrease over periods of time.[1]
