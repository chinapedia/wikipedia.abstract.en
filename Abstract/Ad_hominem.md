_AD HOMINEM_ (Latin for "to the person"[1]), short for _ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM_, typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.[2] The terms _ad mulierem_[3] and _ad feminam_[4] have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.
