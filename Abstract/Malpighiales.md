Aspidopterys_cordata_W_IMG_2632.jpg'' (Malpighiaceae)]] The MALPIGHIALES comprise one of the largest orders of flowering plants, containing about species, about 7.8% of the eudicots.[1] The order is very diverse, containing plants as different as the willow, violet, poinsettia, and coca plant, and are hard to recognize except with molecular phylogenetic evidence. It is not part of any of the classification systems based only on plant morphology. Molecular clock calculations estimate the origin of stem group Malpighiales at around 100 million years ago (Mya) and the origin of crown group Malpighiales at about 90 Mya.[2]
