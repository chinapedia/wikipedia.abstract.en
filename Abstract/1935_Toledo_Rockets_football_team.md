The 1935 TOLEDO ROCKETS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Toledo University (renamed the University of Toledo in 1967) in the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) during the 1935 college football season. In their fifth season under head coach Jim Nicholson, the team compiled a 6–2–1 record, held all opponents to 32 points, and outscored opponents by a combined total of 185 to 32. The team's victories included games against Bowling Green (63–0) and Louisville (41–7).[1] The defense held opponents to 3.6 points per game and allowed only five touchdowns and zero passing touchdowns, each of which remains a program record.[2] The 63-point margin of victory over Bowling Green remains the third largest in program history.[3] The Bowling Green–Toledo football rivalry, dating back to 1919, was terminated after the 1935 season and was not revived until 1948.[4] Jerry Welling was the team captain.[5]
