The FCA WINNERS' CHAMPIONSHIP ()[1] was a Greek football league competition contested annually by the most recent winners of all local Football Clubs' Associations championships in Greece. It is not considered part of the Greek football league system, due to a lack of formal structure, requiring all local FCA championships to have been completed prior to its start. The FCA Winners' Championship was ←founded in 1960, and held annually until 1962, as an experimental format for a 2nd tier in the Greek football league system. The competition was once again established and held annually during 1968−1977 going by the name "Amateur Championship" as a means of achieving promotion to the formally-structured _Beta Ethniki_ (the official 2nd tier of the Greek football league system, renamed in 2010 to _Football League_).
