NOTAKTO is a tic-tac-toe variant, also known as NEUTRAL or IMPARTIAL TIC-TAC-TOE[1][2]. The game is a combination of the games tic-tac-toe and Nim,[3][4] played across one or several boards with both of the players playing the same piece (an "X" or cross). The game ends when all the boards contain a three-in-a-row of Xs,[5][6][7] at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game.[8] However, in this game, unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins any game of Notakto.[9]
