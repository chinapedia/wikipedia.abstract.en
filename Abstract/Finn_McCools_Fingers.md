Finn_McCool_Fingers.jpg Five_fingers,_Shantemon,_Co_Cavan.jpg FINN MCCOOLS FINGERS (or "Shantemon Stone Row") are a set of five standing stones on Shantemon mountain in County Cavan.[1] The name is derived from the story that giant Celtic warrior Fionn mac Cumhaill lost a hand in battle. The stones are arranged in a south-east/north-west orientation.[2]
