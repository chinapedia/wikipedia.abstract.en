Royal_Pavilion_Aldershot_1905.jpg The ROYAL PAVILION, also known as the QUEEN'S PAVILION, was a royal residence located at Aldershot in Hampshire. The most unpretentious of all royal residences,[1] it was built by George Myers as a wooden structure in 1855 for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for use by members of the Royal Family when in Aldershot to attend military reviews and other occasions. Located off the Farnborough Road opposite the former West Cavalry Barracks, nearby are the Royal Garrison Church and the Wellington Statue. It was dismantled in the early 1960s. Today the site is the location of the Royal Pavilion Office Park.
