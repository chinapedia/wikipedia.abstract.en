DiffusionMicroMacro.gif from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. Initially, there are solute molecules on the left side of a barrier (purple line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container. TOP: A single molecule moves around randomly. MIDDLE: With more molecules, there is a clear trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly. BOTTOM: With an enormous number of solute molecules, randomness becomes undetectable: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. This smooth flow is described by Fick's laws.]] FICK'S LAWS OF DIFFUSION describe diffusion and were derived by Adolf Fick in 1855. They can be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient, . Fick's first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the diffusion equation.
