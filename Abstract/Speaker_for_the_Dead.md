_SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD_ is a 1986 science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card, an indirect sequel to the novel _Ender's Game_. The book takes place around the year 5270, some 3,000 years after the events in _Ender's Game_. However, because of relativistic space travel at near light speed, Ender himself is only about 35 years old.
