MULTI-LEAF SPRINGS are widely used for the suspension of cars, trucks and railway wagons. A multi-leaf spring consists of a series of flat plates, usually of semi-elliptical shape. The flat plates are called LEAVES of the spring. The leaf at the top has maximum length. The length gradually decreases from the top leaf to the bottom leaf. The longest leaf at the top is called MASTER LEAF. It is bent at both ends to form the spring eyes. Two bolts are inserted through these eyes to fix the leaf spring to the automobile body. The leaves are held together by means of two U-bolts and a center clip. Rebound clips are provided to keep the leaves in alignment and prevent lateral shifting of the leaves during operation. At the center, the leaf spring is supported on the axle. Multi-leaf springs are provided with one or two extra full-length leaves in addition to the master leaf and the graduated length leaves. The extra full-length leaves are provided to support the transverse sheer force.
