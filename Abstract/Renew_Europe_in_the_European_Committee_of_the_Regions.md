RENEW EUROPE[1][2] is a political group in the EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS [3][4] bringing together liberal and democrat city mayors, regional presidents and ministers, and local and regional councillors to contribute to the European Union's legislative procedure.[5][6] The group is the successor to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Committee of the Regions (ALDE-CoR) which existed from 2005-2019[7][8], which in turn succeeded the ELDR-CoR group which had existed since 1998. The group consists of members from several European political parties, including Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Democratic Party.[9]
