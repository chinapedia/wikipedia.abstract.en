Identification of genomic regulatory elements is essential for understanding the dynamics of developmental, physiological and pathological processes. Recent advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) have provided powerful ways to identify genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins and histone modifications.[1][2] The application of ChIP-seq methods has reliably discovered transcription factor binding sites and histone modification sites.
