COLORADO NATURAL AREAS PROGRAM is a program of Colorado Parks and Wildlife that identifies and protects public, and in some cases private, areas with at least one unique or high-quality natural feature of statewide significance. It was established in 1977 by statute. There are 93 designated sites that in total protect more than 250 endangered, rare, or threatened species. Land management agreements are made with landowners concerning private property.[1]
