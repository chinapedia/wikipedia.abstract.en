In computing, INTERRUPT LATENCY is the time that elapses from when an interrupt is generated to when the source of the interrupt is serviced.[1] For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's interrupt handler is executed. Interrupt latency may be affected by microprocessor design, interrupt controllers, interrupt masking, and the operating system's (OS) interrupt handling methods.
