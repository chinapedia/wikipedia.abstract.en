Recursive_Flood_Fill_4_(aka).gif FLOOD FILL, also called SEED FILL, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared.
