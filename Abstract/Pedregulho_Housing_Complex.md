The PEDREGULHO HOUSING COMPLEX (Portuguese: _Conjunto Residencial Prefeito Mendes de Moraes_, commonly known as PEDREGULHO) is an apartment complex and planned community in the Benfica neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was designed by the architect Affonso Eduardo Reidy (1909-1964). The project was planned in 1946 to house lower-paid civil servants of the city, which was then the Federal District of Brazil. Work commenced on the complex in 1949 and inaugurated in 1951/1952.
