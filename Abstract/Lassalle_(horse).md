LASSALLE (28 February 1969 – after 1981) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was a specialist stayer who recorded all of his major wins over distances of 3000 m or longer. He showed promise as a two-year-old when he won one minor race and was placed in both the Prix de Condé and the Critérium de Saint-Cloud. In the following year, he developed into a high-class stayer, recording Group Three wins in the Prix de l'Esperance and Prix Berteux, as well as being placed in the Prix Greffulhe, Prix Hocquart, and Prix Royal-Oak. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1973, when he completed a rare double by winning both the Prix du Cadran and the Ascot Gold Cup before ending his season with a win in the Prix Gladiateur. He retained most of his ability as a five-year-old, when he was narrowly beaten in the Prix du Cadran and ran third in the Ascot Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing, he was exported to stand at stud in Japan, but had little success as a breeding stallion.
