HENRIETTE HARDENBERG (February 5, 1894 â€“ October 26, 1993), born MARGARETE ROSENBERG, was a German-Jewish poet who emigrated to Britain in the late 1930s. In the 1910s, she was part of the circle of writers around the magazine _Die Aktion_, which championed literary Expressionism. In her poems, she examined the relationship between people and their bodies, especially the skin as both an interface between self and world and a limiting factor.[1] In a late interview, she said that her work expressed a desire to transcend the limits of the body.[2] Hardenberg was one of the few women among German Expressionist writers, and one recent reevaluation of her oeuvre ranks her work among the best of the Expressionists.[3]
