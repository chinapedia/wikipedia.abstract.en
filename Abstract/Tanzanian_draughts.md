TANZANIAN DRAUGHTS (or simply TZ DRAUGHTS; and DRAFTI in Swahili) is a variant of draughts (checkers) board game played usually in Tanzania. This is the strategy game that is played by two people using pieces on board. The game is very similar to Czech draughts but in this type the player can capture using king or men, there is no priority for that. Apart from that they are completely similar in any way. The game is also somehow similar American checkers[1] and Shashki in case of starting position however rules of playing Tanzanian checkers differ. Like many other kinds of draughts, there is possibility that either player can win the game or draw can be offered but this is based on the negotiations of players or supporters of the game.
