In statistics, a CENTRAL TENDENCY (or MEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDENCY) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution.[1] It may also be called a CENTER or LOCATION of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called _averages._ The term _central tendency_ dates from the late 1920s.[2]
