In mathematics, and, particularly, in algebra, a FIELD EXTENSION is a pair of fields E ⊆ F, such that the operations of _E_ are those of _F_ restricted to _E_. In this case, _F_ is an EXTENSION FIELD of _E_ and _E_ is a SUBFIELD of _F_.[1][2][3] For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers.
