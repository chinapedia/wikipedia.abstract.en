The term FELONY originated from English common law (from the French medieval word "f√©lonie"), to describe an offense that resulted in the confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods, to which additional punishments including capital punishment could be added.[1] Other crimes were called _misdemeanors_. A felony is traditionally considered a crime of high seriousness, whereas a misdemeanor is regarded as less serious.[2] A FELON is a person who has committed a felony. Following conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person may be described as a CONVICTED FELON.
