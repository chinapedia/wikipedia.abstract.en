PDB_1hzx_7TM_Sketch_Membrane.png]] G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCRS), also known as SEVEN-(PASS)-TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN RECEPTORS, 7TM RECEPTORS, HEPTAHELICAL RECEPTORS, SERPENTINE RECEPTOR, and G PROTEINâ€“LINKED RECEPTORS (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times.[1]
