FAILURE OF ERUPTION OF TEETH happens when a single or multiple teeth fail to erupt in the mouth. This can happen due to many reasons which may include obstruction from primary teeth, bone surrounding the unerupted tooth or other mechanical factors. The two types of failure of eruption are primary failure of eruption and mechanical failure of eruption. Primary failure of eruption has been known to be associated with Parathyroid hormone 1 receptor mutation.[1]
