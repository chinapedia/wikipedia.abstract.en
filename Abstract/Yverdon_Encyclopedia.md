The _ENCYCLOPEDIA, THE DICTIONARY OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE_, or _ENCYCLOPÉDIE OU DICTIONNAIRE UNIVERSEL RAISONNÉ DES CONNAISSANCES HUMAINES_, was an Encyclopedia compiled by Fortunato Bartolomeo de Félice, 2nd Count di Panzutti, published between 1770 and 1780 in Yverdon. Increasingly anti-religious, in comparison to that of Diderot and d'Alembert on which it was based, this difference earned him the alternative title _Protestant Encyclopedia_, and ensured a strong distinction in Northern Europe.
