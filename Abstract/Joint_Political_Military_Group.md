On November 29, 1983 a memorandum of agreement was set up between Israel and the United States regarding political, military and economic cooperation. Part of the agreement was for a JOINT POLITICAL MILITARY GROUP (JPMG) as a high-level planning forum to discuss and implement combined planning, joint exercises, and logistics.[1] The JPMG is co-chaired by the director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. The JPMG meets biannually, alternating between Israel and the United States.
