JOHN ADAM BELUSHI (January 24, 1949 â€“ March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor, and singer who is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude"[1] that he displayed as one of the seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show _Saturday Night Live_ (_SNL_). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow _SNL_ star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.[2]
