The ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIRECTIVE 2012/27/EU (abbreviated EED) is a European Union directive which mandates energy efficiency improvements within the European Union.[1] It was approved on 25 October 2012 and entered into force on 4 December 2012.[2] The directive introduces legally binding measures to encourage efforts to use energy more efficiently in all stages and sectors of the supply chain. It establishes a common framework for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU in order to meet its energy efficiency headline target of 20% by 2020. It also paves the way for further improvements thereafter.[3]
