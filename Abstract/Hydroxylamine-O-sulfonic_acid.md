HYDROXYLAMINE-_O_-SULFONIC ACID ("HOSA") is the inorganic compound with molecular formula H₃NO₄S that is formed by the sulfonation of hydroxylamine with oleum.[1] It is a white, water-soluble and hygroscopic, solid, commonly represented by the condensed structural formula H₂NOSO₃H, though it actually exists as a zwitterion[2] and thus is more accurately represented as ⁺H₃NOSO₃^(−). It is used as a reagent for the introduction of amine groups (–NH₂), for the conversion of aldehydes into nitriles and alicyclic ketones into lactams (cyclic amides), and for the synthesis of variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.[3][4][5]
