The PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION examines the goals, forms, methods, and meaning of education. The term is used to describe both fundamental philosophical analysis of these themes and the description or analysis of particular pedagogical approaches. Considerations of how the profession relates to broader philosophical or sociocultural contexts may be included.[1][2][3] The philosophy of education thus overlaps with the field of education and applied philosophy.
