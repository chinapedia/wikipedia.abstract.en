FAKE NEWS WEBSITES (also referred to as HOAX NEWS WEBSITES)[1][2] are Internet websites that deliberately publish fake news—hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation purporting to be real news—often using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect.[3][4][5] Unlike news satire, fake news websites deliberately seek to be perceived as legitimate and taken at face value, often for financial or political gain.[6][7] Such sites have promoted political falsehoods in Germany,[8][9] Indonesia and the Philippines,[10] Sweden,[11][12] Myanmar,[13] and the United States.[14][15] Many sites originate in, or are promoted by, Russia,[16][17] North Macedonia,[18][19] Romania,[20] and some individuals in the United States.[21][22]
