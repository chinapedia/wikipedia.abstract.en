The ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA () comprise two services: the Army, and the Air Force and Air Defense (a unified branch).[1] Though it was partially formed out of the former Soviet Army forces stationed in the Armenian SSR (mostly units of the 7th Guards Army of the Transcaucasian Military District), the military of Armenia can be traced back to the founding of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918. Being a landlocked country, Armenia has no navy.
