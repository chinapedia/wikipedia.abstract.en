The FROG BRIDGE (Officially the THREAD CITY CROSSING) is a bridge located in Willimantic, Connecticut which carries South Street (CT 661) across the Willimantic River. It is known as the Frog Bridge because it has 4 copper frogs located on each end of the bridge, sitting on top of concrete thread spools. They were designed and created by artist Leo Jensen of Ivoryton, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
