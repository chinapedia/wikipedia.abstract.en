INTERNET RELAY CHAT (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web based applications running either locally in the browser or on a 3rd party server. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.[1] IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels,[2] but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages[3] as well as chat and data transfer,[4] including file sharing.[5]
