CLARENCE LEROY VAN CLEEF JR. (January 9, 1925 â€“ December 16, 1989), was an American actor best known for his roles in Spaghetti Westerns such as _For A Few Dollars More_ and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_. Hatchet-faced with piercing eyes, he declined to have his nose altered to play a sympathetic character in his film debut, _High Noon_, and was relegated to a non-speaking outlaw as a result. For a decade he was typecast as a minor villain, his "sinister" features overshadowing his acting skills. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef had begun to lose interest in his declining career by the time Sergio Leone gave him a major role in _For a Few Dollars More_. The film made him a box-office draw, especially in Europe.
