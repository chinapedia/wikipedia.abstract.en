The _SEJM'' OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND (; ) IS THE LARGER, MORE POWERFUL LOWER HOUSE OF THE POLISH PARLIAMENT. IT CONSISTS OF 460 DEPUTIES (_POSŁOWIE'', literally "envoys", in Polish) elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the "Marshal of the _Sejm_ of the Republic of Poland" (_Marszałek Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej_). In the Kingdom of Poland, "_Sejm_" referred to the entire two-chamber parliament of Poland, comprising the Chamber of Envoys (), the Senate (Polish: _Senat_) and the King. It was thus a three-estate parliament. Since the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939), "_Sejm_" has referred only to the larger house of the parliament; the upper house is called the _Senat Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej_ ("Senate of the Republic of Poland").
