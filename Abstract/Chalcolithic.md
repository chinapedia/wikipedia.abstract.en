The CHALCOLITHIC (),[1] a name derived from the _khalkós_, "copper" and from _líthos_, "stone"[2] or COPPER AGE,[3] also known as the ENEOLITHIC[4] or AENEOLITHIC[5] (from Latin _aeneus_ "of copper") is an archaeological period which researchers usually regard as part of the broader Neolithic (although scholars originally defined it as a transition between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age). In the context of Eastern Europe, archaeologists often prefer the term "Eneolithic" to "Chalcolithic" or other alternatives.
