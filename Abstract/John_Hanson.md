JOHN HANSON ( – November 15, 1783) was a merchant and public official from Maryland during the era of the American Revolution. In 1779, Hanson was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress after serving in a variety of roles for the Patriot cause in Maryland. He signed the Articles of Confederation in 1781 after Maryland finally joined the other states in ratifying them. In November 1781, he was elected as first President of the Confederation Congress (sometimes styled _President of the United States in Congress assembled_), following ratification of the articles. For this reason, some of Hanson's biographers have argued that he was actually the first holder of the office of president.
