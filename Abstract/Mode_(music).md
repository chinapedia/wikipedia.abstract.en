In the theory of Western music, a MODE is a type of musical scale coupled with a set of characteristic melodic behaviors. Musical modes have been a part of western musical thought since the Middle Ages, and were inspired by the theory of ancient Greek music. The name _mode_ derives from the Latin word _modus,_ "measure, standard, manner, way, size, limit of quantity, method" (; OED).
