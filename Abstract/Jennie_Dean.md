JANE SEREPTA DEAN (15 April 1848 â€“ May 3, 1913) (nicknamed "Jennie" or "Miss Jennie") was born into slavery in northern Virginia, freed as a result of the American Civil War, and became an important founder of churches and Sunday Schools for African Americans in northern Virginia. Dean founded the Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth, which for more than four decades was the only institution of secondary education available to African American youth in Northern Virginia, and one of only two in the state without overt religious affiliation.[1][2]
