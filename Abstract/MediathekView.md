MEDIATHEKVIEW is a free open-source software designed to manage the online multimedia libraries of several German public broadcasters as well as an Austrian, a Swiss and a Franco-German public broadcaster. The software comes with a German user interface that lists broadcasts available online. In October 2016, the developer announced that maintenance of the project would be discontinued at the end of the year.[1][2] Three weeks later, the user community had formed a team to continue the project, and the software continues to remain freeware.[3]
