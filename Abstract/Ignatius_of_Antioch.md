IGNATIUS OF ANTIOCH (; Greek: Ἰγνάτιος Ἀντιοχείας, _Ignátios Antiokheías_; c. 50  – c. 108/140),[1][2][3][4][5] also known as IGNATIUS THEOPHORUS (, _Ignátios ho Theophóros_, lit. "the God-bearing") or IGNATIUS NURONO (lit. "The fire-bearer"), was an early Christian writer and bishop of Antioch. En route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters. This correspondence now forms a central part of the later collection known as the Apostolic Fathers, of which he is considered one of the three chief ones together with Pope Clement I and Polycarp. His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology. Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops.
