PEAK FARMLAND is the maximum usable amount of land needed for crop cultivation (agricultural land) for a given region (country or an entire world).[1][2] Supporters of the peak farmland theory argue that even with the growing world population, the need for more farmland is decreasing, as food production yields per acre of farmland are rising faster than the global demand for food.[3] This is supported by the fact that the area dedicated to farmland in some countries, both developed (e.g. Finland) and developing (e.g. India, China), has already begun to decline.[4][5] Globally, while the total amount of arable land is still increasing, the area of permanent pasture has been in decline since 1998, with at least 60 million hectares no longer grazed.[6] It is argued that other countries, such as the United States, are at their peak farmland now.[7]
