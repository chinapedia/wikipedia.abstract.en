In condensed matter physics and materials science, an AMORPHOUS (from the Greek _a_, without, _morph√©_, shape, form) or NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLID is a solid that lacks the long-range order that is characteristic of a crystal. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with glass. Nowadays, "glassy solid" or "amorphous solid" is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: Glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition.[1] Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include gels, thin films, and nanostructured materials such as glass. Bulk_Metallic_Glass_Sample.jpgs have low toughness, but high strength]]
