DINOSTERANE is a steroidal alkane, also known as 4Î±,23,24-trimethylcholestane.[1] It is used in geochemistry as a biomarker, interpreted as an indication of dinoflagellate presence[2] due to its derivative dinosterol high occurrence in extant dinoflagellate species[3] and its rarity in other taxa,[4] although it has been shown to be produced by a single species of marine diatom as well.[5]
