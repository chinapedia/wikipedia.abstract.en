'' IN RE OPINIONS AND ORDERS OF THIS COURT CONTAINING NOVEL OR SIGNIFICANT INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW'', Misc 16-01, United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, (October 19, 2016), or _MOTION OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOR THE RELEASE OF COURT RECORDS_, or _ACLU MOTION FOR RELEASE OF COURT RECORDS_, is a legal case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union before the Fisa court.[1][2] The motion requests that the FISA court release numerous rulings on "novel" interpretations of the law, made since from the court's inception through 2015, at which time such rulings were statutorily mandated to be made public under the USA Freedom Act.[3][4] The court had interpreted the meaning of a broad swath of surveillance and cybersecurity laws without public disclosure, thereby creating a body of FISA court common law as precedent for subsequent cases, and which provides legal parameters for restricting and allowing actual surveillance practices.[5]
