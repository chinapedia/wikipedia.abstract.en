SHIRRIFF is the brand name of several food products first produced by the defunct Shirriff family food products company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Francis Shirriff founded a food extracts company in the 1880s. The company would go on develop a line of food products including marmalades, dessert toppings and jelly and pudding mixes. The company remained a family business until the 1950s when it was sold to the owner of the Dominion Stores chain. Later, the firm was bought by Kelloggs of Canada. In 1988 and 1992, Kelloggs sold its interests. Many of the Shirriff brand products are still in production, although now by other companies: The J. M. Smucker Company and Dr. Oetker. The company's most well-known product was likely its "Good Morning Marmalade", the best-selling marmalade in Canada.[1] Francis Shirriff was also one of the founders of the Niagara Falls Wine Company, later known as Bright's and Vincor International.
