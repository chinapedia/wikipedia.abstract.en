The DURATIONATOR is a copyright tool developed at Tulane Law School by Dr. Elizabeth Townsend Gard and her team of law students.[1] The purpose of the tool is to determine the term, or duration, of copyright.[2] It is now licensed to Limited Times, a social venture, to develop into a product. The Durationator takes research done at the law school and transforms it into code using what is designed to be an accessible tool, to determine the copyright status of a work.[3]
