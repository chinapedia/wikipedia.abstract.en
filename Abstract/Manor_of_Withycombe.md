CourtPlace_Withycombe_Somerset.JPG of Withycombe Hadley]] The MANOR OF WITHYCOMBE was a historic manor in Somerset, England. It was centred on the village of Withycombe, south east of Dunster, and from Minehead and was largely co-terminous with the parish of Withycombe. In about 1212[1] the manor was split into two separate sub-manors, which took various names over time, dependent on the family name of their lords. By the 16th century the names of the two manors were "Withycombe Wyke" (or Weeke, etc.) and "Withycombe Hadley". The former manor house of Withycombe Hadley survives as Court Place in the village of Withycombe.
