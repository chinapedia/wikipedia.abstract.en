The 2008 THOMAS & UBER CUPS PRELIMINARIES FOR AFRICA were held in Rose Hill, Mauritius, between 17â€“21 February and organised by Mauritius Badminton Association. Kenya was scheduled to host the events, but domestic unrest has led to them being moved to Mauritius.[1][2] South Africa was the defending champion in men's and women's team events. This tournament serves as qualification stage for African countries for the 2008 Thomas & Uber Cup.[3]
