He collected in Belize from 1929 to 1935 when he returned to Australia because of failing health, living ultimately in New South Wales. His health improved in Australia where he was later employed as a landscape gardener by Norman Lindsay. In 1967 William Augustus Schipp living in retirement in a country town in New South Wales die, leaving his few possessions to the local Horticultural Society, in which he was keenly interested.
