STANDISH PARK ARBORETUM is a 3.3 acre park located in Downtown Galesburg, Illinois. Located just north of Knox College, Standish Park Arboretum has a collection of 137 trees of 67 different species. The park is used by the Galesburg community for many events such as the annual Art in the Park festival.[1] Walkways criss-cross the park and along all four sides of its perimeter. A gazebo at the center serves as the focal point. Surrounding the Standish Park Arboretum are sites such as, to the south, Old Main (on the Knox College campus) which was the location of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates (1858), the Knox County, Illinois Courthouse (erected in 1884-1886) to the east,[2] and the Galesburg City Hall to the north.[3]
