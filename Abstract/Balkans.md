The BALKANS, also known as the BALKAN PENINSULA, is a geographic area in southeastern Europe with various definitions and meanings,[1][2] including geopolitical and historical.[3] The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea coast. The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Aegean Sea in the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast. The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined.[4] The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala, , in the Rila mountain range.
