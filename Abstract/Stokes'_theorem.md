In vector calculus, and more generally differential geometry, STOKES' THEOREM (sometimes spelled STOKES'S THEOREM, and also called the GENERALIZED STOKES THEOREM or the STOKESâ€“CARTAN THEOREM[1]) is a statement about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from vector calculus. Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form over the boundary of some orientable manifold is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative over the whole of , i.e.,
