An INSTRUCTIONAL THEORY is "a theory that offers explicit guidance on how to better help people learn and develop."[1] It provides insights about what is likely to happen and why with respect to different kinds of teaching and learning activities while helping indicate approaches for their evaluation.[2] Instructional designers focus on how to best structure material and instructional behavior to facilitate learning.[3]
