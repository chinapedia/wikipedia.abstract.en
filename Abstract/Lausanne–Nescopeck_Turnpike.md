The LAUSANNE–NESCOPECK TURNPIKE or SUSQUEHANNA & LEHIGH TURNPIKE[1] (1804–1840s) also mentioned often as the LEHIGH–SUSQUEHANNA TURNPIKE (or _Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike_) and opened in 1805 was a highly profitable foot traffic toll road established during the earliest days of the American canal age—one of the many _privately funded_ road (and transport infrastructure) projects established after the 1790s in the first years of the young United States era to open up and promote growth along either side of the American Frontiers by building connecting transport infrastructure.[2] To the new Homesteader, a road meant a way to send excess product east for monies, a way to buy necessaries and desired goods to ease the strains of a hard life. The needs of the easterners left behind were for foods, raw materials, while to the manufacturing industrialists, the settlers represented a market in need of their wares. Both needed a way to convey their respective needs, and the manifold ways such needs are slaked are what makes commerce superior to barter.
