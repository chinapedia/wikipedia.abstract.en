The 2017 NEW YORK GIANTS SEASON was the franchise's 93rd season in the National Football League, the eighth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and the second and final under head coach Ben McAdoo. Coming fresh off an 11–5 season from one year ago, the Giants had high hopes of a Super Bowl championship and were an expected playoff contender by many critics. However, things quickly fell apart after key injuries and controversial decisions towards the team. A disastrous and unexpected 0–5 start to their season (their second in 5 years), coupled with major injuries to the team, including star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., had the Giants suffer to a franchise worst 3–13 record. By Week 10, after losing to the previously winless 49ers, the Giants were standing at 1–8, their worst record since 1980. The Giants were officially eliminated from playoff contention on November 26, 2017 when the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers 34–20, the Panthers defeated the Jets 35–27 and the Eagles defeated the Bears 31–3.
