GEORGE W. COLE (March 26, 1827 â€“ December 9, 1875) was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. His wartime commands included the 2nd United States Colored Cavalry, and he attained the rank of major general by brevet. In 1867 Cole was accused of murder after he killed L. Harris Hiscock, a member of the New York State Assembly. Cole accused Hiscock of an affair with Mrs. Cole; his first trial ended with a hung jury, and he was acquitted at the second on the grounds of "momentary insanity".
