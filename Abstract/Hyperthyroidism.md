HYPERTHYROIDISM is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland.[1] THYROTOXICOSIS is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.[2] Some, however, use the terms interchangeably.[3] Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss.[4] Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy.[5] An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death.[6] The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.[7]
