The THAMES TORSO MURDERS, often called the THAMES MYSTERIES or the EMBANKMENT MURDERS, was a series of unsolved murders that took place in London from 1887 to 1889. The series included four incidents which were filed as belonging to the same series. None of the cases were solved, and only one of the four victims was identified. Speculations have linked the Thames murder series to that of the contemporary Whitechapel murders of Jack the Ripper.
