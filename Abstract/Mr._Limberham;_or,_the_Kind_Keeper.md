MR. LIMBERHAM; OR, THE KIND KEEPER was written by John Dryden in 1677, shortly after completing his best known work All for Love; first performed on 11 March 1678, 'The Kind Keeper' closed after only three performances and has been described as 'his most abject failure.' Dryden later removed 'objectionable material' from the original, before submitting the manuscript for publication, hence the date of 1680.[1]
