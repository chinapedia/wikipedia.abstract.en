ELIAS 2-27 (2MASS J16264502-2423077)[1] is a YSO star[2] with a protoplanetary disc around it, located in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud (œÅ Oph Cld, 5 Oph Cld, Ophiuchus Dark Cloud), a star-forming region in the Ophiuchus constellation, some away. This star system became the first ever observed with density waves in the disc, giving it a spiral structure. Elias 2-27 is located near the double star Rho Ophiuchi (5 Ophiuchi).[3][4]
