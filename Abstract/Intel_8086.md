The 8086[1] (also called IAPX 86 )[2] is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and June 8, 1978, when it was released. The Intel 8088, released July 1, 1979,[3] is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus (allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting ICs[4]), and is notable as the processor used in the original IBM PC design, including the widespread version called IBM PC XT.
