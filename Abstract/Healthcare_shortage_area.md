HEALTHCARE SHORTAGE AREAS are two types of designation within the United States determined by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS) designate geographic areas or subgroups of the populations or specific facilities within them as lacking professionals in primary care, mental health, or dental care. MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS and POPULATIONS (MUAS and MUPS) only designate geographic areas or populations, and only for their lack of access to primary care services. Geographic areas can designate single or multiple counties, parts of cities, or other civil divisions depending on the state. Populations typically designate those subgroups which face barriers to healthcare access in an otherwise well-served population, such as homeless or low-income groups. Facilities designate specific healthcare locations such as clinics, mental hospitals, or prisons.
