In mathematics, a PERMUTATION GROUP is a group _G_ whose elements are permutations of a given set _M_ and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in _G_ (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set _M_ to itself). The group of _all_ permutations of a set _M_ is the symmetric group of _M_, often written as Sym(_M_).[1] The term _permutation group_ thus means a subgroup of the symmetric group. If then, Sym(_M_), the _symmetric group on n letters_ is usually denoted by S_(_n_).
