The precise TAXONOMY OF THE GENUS _ALLIUM_ is still poorly understood with incorrect descriptions being widespread. With over 850 species distributed over the Northern hemisphere _Allium_ is the sole genus in the Allieae, one of four tribes of subfamily Allioideae (Amaryllidaceae). New species continue to be described and _Allium_ is both highly variable and one of the largest monocotyledonous genera, but the precise taxonomy of _Allium_ is poorly understood, with incorrect descriptions being widespread. The difficulties arise from the fact that the genus displays considerable polymorphism and has adapted to a wide variety of habitats. Furthermore, traditional classications had been based on homoplasious characteristics (the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages). However, the genus has been shown to be monophyletic, containing three major clades, although some proposed subgenera are not. Some progress is being made using molecular phylogenetic methods, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, including the 5.8S rDNA and the two spacers ITS1 and ITS2, is one of the more commonly used markers in the study of the differentiation of the _Allium_ species.
