In probability theory, an EVENT is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned.[1] A single outcome may be an element of many different events,[2] and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes.[3] An event defines a complementary event, namely the complementary set (the event _not_ occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?
