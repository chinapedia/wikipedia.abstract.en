HEXAMETER is a metrical line of verses consisting of six feet. It was the standard epic metre in classical Greek and Latin literature, such as in the _Iliad_, _Odyssey_ and _Aeneid_. Its use in other genres of composition include Horace's satires, Ovid's _Metamorphoses,_ and the Hymns of Orpheus. According to Greek mythology, hexameter was invented by Phemonoe, daughter of Apollo and the first Pythia of Delphi.[1][2]
