A __ ( __, , collectively _/_ "the people of the _dhimma_") is a historical[1] term referring to non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection.[2][3] The word literally means "protected person",[4] referring to the state's obligation under sharia to protect the individual's life, property, and freedom of religion, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the jizya tax, which complemented the zakat, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects.[5] Dhimmis were exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims, and did not enjoy certain privileges and freedoms reserved for Muslims, but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.[6][7][8]
