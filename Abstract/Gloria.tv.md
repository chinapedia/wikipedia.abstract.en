GLORIA.TV is an internet-based self-identified Catholic video-sharing and news site created in Switzerland in 2005. As of 2017 it appeared to be based in Moldova with a contact address in Moscow. A number of news sources have identified it as "aggressively right-wing". The posting of false or misleading content has also been noted. In 2013 the German bishops' conference withdrew use of their website material to Gloria.tv. In 2017, the registered office was moved to Dover in the state of Delaware in the USA. As of 2019 Gloria.tv is a production of Church Social Media Inc.
