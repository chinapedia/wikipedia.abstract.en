The MINIMUM INCOME STANDARD (MIS) is a research method developed in the UK, and now applied in other countries, to identify what incomes different types of households require to reach a socially acceptable living standard. The term has also been used to describe political criteria used openly or implicitly by some governments to assess the adequacy of income levels.[1] MIS is the basis for the calculation of the UK living wage.[2]
