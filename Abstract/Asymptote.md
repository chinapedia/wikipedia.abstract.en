In analytic geometry, an ASYMPTOTE () of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the _x_ or _y_ coordinates tends to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors.[1] In projective geometry and related contexts, an asymptote of a curve is a line which is tangent to the curve at a point at infinity.[2][3]
