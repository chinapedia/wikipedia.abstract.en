Umspannwerk_Theresienh√∂he-1.JPG]] BUNTKICKTGUT is an intercultural street football league for children and young people. Unique in Europe,[1] the non-profit organisation brings children, young people and adults together from different cultures and social backgrounds in a playful way through its ongoing pioneering work. The approach develops boys and girls all year round in summer as well as in winter, through continuous leagues in several different age categories. With its special form of participation, integration and identification, buntkicktgut harnesses the power of street football to enhance the social prospects of children and young people, based on the premise that football is a common language that it is understood worldwide.[2]
