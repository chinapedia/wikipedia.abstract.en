_GARAGE INC._ is a compilation album of cover songs by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on November 24, 1998, through Elektra Records. Over 2.5 million copies have been sold in the U.S. as certified by the RIAA. It includes cover songs, B-side covers, and _The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited_, which had gone out of print since its original release in 1987. The title is a combination of _Garage Days Revisited_ and their song "Damage, Inc.", from _Master of Puppets_, and the album's graphical cover draws heavily from the 1987 EP. The album features songs by artists that have influenced Metallica, including many bands from the new wave of British heavy metal movement, hardcore punk bands and popular songs. As of August 2013, the album has sold more than 6 million copies worldwide. It marks the last album to feature bassist Jason Newsted who would quit the band three years later in 2001.
