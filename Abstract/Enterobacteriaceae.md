The family ENTEROBACTERIACEAE is a very large family of Gram-negative bacteria that has been studied and characterized for almost a hundred years. It was first proposed by Rahn in 1936 and now included over 50 genera and over 200 species. Its classification above the level of family is a subject of debate, but one classification has it in the order Enterobacteriales of the class Gammaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria.[1][2][3][4]
