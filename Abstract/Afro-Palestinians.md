AFRICANS IN PALESTINE self-identify deeply with both their original African ancestry and the Palestinian nationality. A minority of African Palestinians which number around 400-500 reside in the Muslim quarter located in the city of Jerusalem. There are also thousands of Palestinians of African descent in cities all over historic Palestine: Gaza, Akka, Tulkarm, Jenin and most notably Jericho.
