The WEST NEWBURY VILLAGE HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses the modest rural country village of West Newbury, Vermont. It is located at the junction of Tucker Mountain, Snake, and Tyler Farm Roads, and is relatively little altered since its 19th-century development. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]
