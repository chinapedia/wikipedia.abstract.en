The BATTERIE MIRUS is located in Saint Peter and Saint Saviour, Guernsey. Originally called BATTERIE NINA, it comprised four 30.5 cm guns. The battery was constructed from November 1941 and through the first half of 1942, it was the largest battery in the Channel Islands, the guns having a maximum range of 51 km. The guns were removed in the early 1950s, however the reinforced concrete structures and associated positions remain intact.
