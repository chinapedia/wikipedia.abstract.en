In graph theory, the SHORTNESS EXPONENT is a numerical parameter of a family of graphs that measures how far from Hamiltonian the graphs in the family can be. Intuitively, if e is the shortness exponent of a graph family ℱ, then every n-vertex graph in the family has a cycle of length near n^(e) but some graphs do not have longer cycles. More precisely, for any ordering of the graphs in ℱ into a sequence G₀, G₁, …, with h(G) defined to be the length of the longest cycle in graph G, the shortness exponent is defined as[1]
