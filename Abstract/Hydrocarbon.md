Methane-3D-balls.png of the methane molecule, CHâ‚„. Methane is part of a homologous series known as the alkanes, which contain single bonds only.]] In organic chemistry, a HYDROCARBON is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.[1] Hydrocarbons are examples of group 14 hydrides. Hydrocarbons, from which, one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups called HYDROCARBYLS.[2] Because carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell (and because each covalent bond requires a donation of 1 electron, per atom, to the bond) carbon has exactly four bonds to make, and is only stable if all 4 of these bonds are used. Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons.
