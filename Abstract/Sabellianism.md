In Christianity, SABELLIANISM in the Eastern church or Patripassianism in the Western church is the belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three different _modes_ or _aspects_ of God, as opposed to a Trinitarian view of three distinct persons within the Godhead.[1] The term _Sabellianism_ comes from Sabellius, who was a theologian and priest from the 3rd century. None of his writings have survived and so all that is known about him comes from his opponents. All evidence shows that Sabellius held Jesus to be deity while denying the plurality of persons in God and holding a belief similar to modalistic monarchianism. Modalistic monarchianism has been generally understood to have arisen during the second and third centuries, and to have been regarded as heresy after the fourth, although this is disputed by some.[2]
