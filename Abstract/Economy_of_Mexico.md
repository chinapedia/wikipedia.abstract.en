The ECONOMY OF MEXICO is the 15th largest in the world in nominal terms and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity, according to the International Monetary Fund.[1] Since the 1994 crisis, administrations have improved the country's macroeconomic fundamentals. Mexico was not significantly influenced by the 2002 South American crisis, and maintained positive, although low, rates of growth after a brief period of stagnation in 2001. However, Mexico was one of the Latin American nations most affected by the 2008 recession with its Gross Domestic Product contracting by more than 6% in that year.
