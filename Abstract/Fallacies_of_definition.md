FALLACIES OF DEFINITION are the various ways in which definitions can fail to explain terms. The phrase is used to suggest an analogy with an informal fallacy. Definitions may fail to have merit, because they: are overly broad, use obscure or ambiguous language, or contain circular reasoning; those are called fallacies of definition.[1] Three major fallacies are: overly broad, overly narrow, and mutually exclusive definitions,[2] a fourth is: incomprehensible definitions,[3] and one of the most common[4] is circular definitions.[5]
