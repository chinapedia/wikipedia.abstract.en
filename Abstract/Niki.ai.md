NIKI is India's first voice and vernacular enabled commerce platform focussed on empowering the next billion users with a simplified online experience to manage household expenses. Built for Bharat, by IIT Kharagpur graduates Sachin Jaiswal, Keshav Prawasi, Shishir Modi and Nitin Babel, Niki was officially registered on June 4, 2015. It was then launched to the public, a month later at YourStoryâ€™s TechSparks, being one of the Tech30 companies.
