RED EVIE (foaled 4 March 2003) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After finishing unplaced in her only start as a two-year-old in 2005 she improved to become a top class miler in the following year, when she won seven consecutive races including the Sandringham Handicap, Oak Tree Stakes and Matron Stakes. She defeated male opposition to win the Lockinge Stakes in 2007 and added a win in the Hungerford Stakes later that year before being retired from racing. As a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud she has made a considerable impact, producing several winners including the outstanding racemare Found.
