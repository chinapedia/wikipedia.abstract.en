The INTERNET PROTOCOL SUITE is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) MODEL because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.
