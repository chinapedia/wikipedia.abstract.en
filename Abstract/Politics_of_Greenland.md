The POLITICS OF GREENLAND, a "constituent country" (, ) of the Kingdom of Denmark, function in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, whereby the prime minister is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament _Inatsisartut_. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
