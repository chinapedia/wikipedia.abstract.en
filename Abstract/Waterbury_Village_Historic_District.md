The WATERBURY VILLAGE HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses most of the central commercial and residential area of Waterbury, Vermont. Located along United States Route 2 and Stowe Street south of Thatcher Branch of the Winooski River, the sprawling village has been shaped by changes in transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries, and by key economic developments such as the founding of the Vermont State Hospital, which anchors the village's southern end. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[1]
