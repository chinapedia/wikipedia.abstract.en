NORTHERN INTERNATIONAL LIVESTOCK EXPOSITION (NILE) originated as an idea from the livestock committee of the Billings Chamber of Commerce in 1966. In 1967 the Public Auction Yards hosted an event to showcase the regionâ€™s vast livestock industry. By the fall of 1968, a full-fledged livestock show with 250 exhibitors and 600 entries was underway. The first NILE consisted of livestock shows, horse shows, and rodeo and today those traditions continue as the NILE Stock Show and ProRodeo has become one of the largest agricultural events of the Northwest. NILE_office_sign.jpg Through the years the NILE Stock Show has always been a show with some of the purest and most influential genetics in the world. The NILE is host to several national cattle breed shows and sales. Additionally, the NILE Gold Buckle Select Horse Sales features a weanling/yearling sale, performance horse sale, as well as six different futurities.
