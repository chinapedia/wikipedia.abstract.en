The SWEAT-COMINGS COMPANY HOUSE is a historic two-family house at 10â€“12 Powell Street in Richford, Vermont. Built in 1909, it is a rare surviving example of an early company-built boarding house. It was sold into private ownership in 1924, and is a good local example of vernacular Colonial Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[1]
