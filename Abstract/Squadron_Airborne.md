_SQUADRON AIRBORNE_ (also titled "Squadron Airborn") is a 1955 novel by Elleston Trevor. The plot revolves around the fighter pilots and auxiliary personnel of a fictional Spitfire squadron in September 1940. At the beginning of the story a newly trained 19-year-old pilot, Peter Stuyckes (pronounced "Stewks") arrives at Westhill (a fictitious Home Counties aerodrome near a fictitious town called Melbury), joining an established squadron already in the thick of the fighting. Less than a week later, after a number of aerial battles and many sub-plots concerning airmen and ground staff alike, the squadron is rotated to Lincolnshire for rest and refit, having taken heavy casualties.
