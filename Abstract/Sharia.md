SHARIA (, ), ISLAMIC LAW or SHARIA LAW is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition.[1] It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith. In Arabic, the term _sharīʿah_ refers to God's immutable divine law and is contrasted with _fiqh_, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.[2] The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim fundamentalists and modernists.[3]
