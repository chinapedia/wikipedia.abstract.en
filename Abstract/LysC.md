LYSC is a prokaryotic aspartokinase involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid lysine. It is found in a variety of bacteria, including _Bacillus subtilis_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Corynebacterium glutamicum_.[1] It is notable for containing a riboswitch, a structure in its messenger RNA that prevents its translation when bound to lysine.[2] Such lysine riboswitch thus acts as a mechanism of negative feedback.[3]
