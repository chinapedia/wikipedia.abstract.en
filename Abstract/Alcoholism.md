ALCOHOLISM, also known as ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems.[1] The disorder was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.[2][3] In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions are present: a person drinks large amounts of alcohol over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use.[4] Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex, among other things.[5] Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body, but it particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system.[6][7] This can result in mental illness, Wernickeâ€“Korsakoff syndrome, irregular heartbeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk, among other diseases.[8][9][10] Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.[11] Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful physical and mental effects of alcohol.[12]
