In 2016, nine U.S. states proposed CANNABIS REFORM LEGISLATION for medical marijuana and non-medical adult use.[1][2][3] , the state laws are still at odds with the Federal status of cannabis, which is classified as a Schedule I narcotic. _The Los Angeles Times_ stated that if all the measures passed, nine states encompassing a quarter of the U.S. population would have legalized recreational use, and "The presence of legalization measures on the ballot in Arkansas and North Dakota — both staunchly conservative states — illustrate the power of the trend toward legalization" and Federal reforms on banking are "increasingly looking inevitable".[4]
