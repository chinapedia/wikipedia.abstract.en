JEAN DIDES (5 August 1915, Paris â€“ 2 April 2004, Paris) was a police commissioner and member of General Intelligence (RG) under the government Mendes France, French Poujadist councilor and MP. He is in charge of the fifth section of RG whose mission was to hunt foreign Resistance under the Vichy regime. After the liberation he joined the anti-communist struggle, becoming the main assistant in the mission of the police prefect of Paris Jean Baylot. Dismissed from his commissioner following the "leak case" of 1954, destabilizing the Interior Minister Francois Mitterrand considered too favorable to decolonization, he was elected in January 1956 under the banner of the Union French and brotherhood. Jean Dides however, retains its influence in the police, especially during the crisis of May 1958.
