Mang2.png A CATAPULT is a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great distance without the aid of explosive devicesâ€”particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines.[1] In use since ancient times, the catapult has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare. In modern times the term can apply to devices ranging from a simple hand-held implement (also called a "slingshot") to a mechanism for launching aircraft from a ship.
