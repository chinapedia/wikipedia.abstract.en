The KINGSLAND SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in Northeast Florida.[1] The line begins in Jacksonville at a junction with the A Line near Moncrief Yard. From there, it heads east and then turns north near Panama Park. From Panama Park, the Kingsland Subdivision heads north to Yulee on a discontinuous piece of CSX's S Line. In Yulee, the line connects with the First Coast Railroad, which operates north to Seals, Georgia on tracks that were previously part of the Kingsland Subdivision prior to 2005 (First Coast also operates from Yulee northeast to Fernandina Beach on tracks that were previously the Fernandina Subdivision).[2][3]
