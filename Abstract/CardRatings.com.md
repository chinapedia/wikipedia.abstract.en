Curtis Arnold founded the websites in August 1998, amid national concerns about credit card debt. Arnold had more than $40,000 in credit card debt at one point in his life, but developed a deep understanding of the credit card industry to improve his finances. Arnold is a recognized expert on credit card and consumer debt, having published multiple books including "How You Can Profit from Credit Cards: Using Credit to Improve Your Financial Life and Bottom Line" (FT Press, 2008[1]). Arnold has also been cited by multiple news outlets over the years, for his views on consumer debt[2]
