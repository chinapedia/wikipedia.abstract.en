FIONA KUMARI CAMPBELL (born April, 1963) is a leading disability studies researcher and theorist, focusing on disability in relation to the law, technology, advocacy, and desire. She is currently Senior Lecturer In the School of Education and Social Work at the University of Dundee, Scotland. She is also an Adjunct Professor in Disability Studies with the Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. Her specific research of ableism focuses on how notions of disabled and able-bodies are recited with the dominant discourse of society. In particular, her book, _Contours of Ableism,_ attempts to challenge "notions of what constitutes 'normal' and 'pathological' bodies"[1] and what truly distinguishes the "abled body" from the "disabled body."
