WILLIAM HENRY BAGLEY (July 5, 1833 â€“ February 21, 1886) was an American military officer, politician, and newspaperman. He served as clerk of the North Carolina Supreme Court, having been elected January 18, 1869, and holding that position until his death, a little more than 17 years thereafter. He was appointed to the post of superintendent of the United States Mint at Charlotte, but could not accept the appointment as he did not qualify for it. He served as state senator for North Carolina's First Senatorial District.
