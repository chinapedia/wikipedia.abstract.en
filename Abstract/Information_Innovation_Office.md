The INFORMATION INNOVATION OFFICE (I2O) is one of the seven technical offices within DARPA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense that is responsible for the development of advanced technology for national security. I2O was created in 2010 by combining the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) and the Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO).[1] The office focuses on basic and applied research in the areas of cyber security, data analytics, and human-machine symbiosis.[2][3]
