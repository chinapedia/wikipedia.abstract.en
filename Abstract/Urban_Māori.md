URBAN MĀORI are a group of Māori based in urban areas outside the _rohe_ (traditional tribal lands) of their _iwi_ (tribe) or _hapū_ (sub-tribe). The 2013 New Zealand census showed 84% of Māori in New Zealand lived in urban areas, 25% lived in Auckland, and most others lived in other metropolitan centres like Wellington and Christchurch. Many Māori continued to associate with their iwi and their rohe, but more than 15% did not know their tribal affiliation.[1]
