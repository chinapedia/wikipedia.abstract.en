PETHER'S MOON (foaled 15 April 2010) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for his win in the 2015 Coronation Cup. After showing some promise as a juvenile in 2012 he became a successful handicapper in the following year and ended his season with a win in the Listed Floodlit Stakes. As a four-year-old in 2014 he became a Group race performer, winning the Glorious Stakes and the Cumberland Lodge Stakes in England and the Bosphorus Cup in Turkey. In 2015 he was beaten in his first two races but then recorded his biggest win in the Group One Coronation Cup. He did not race again and was retired to become a breeding stallion.
