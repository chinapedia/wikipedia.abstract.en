SIMA QIAN (; ; c. 145 – c. 86 BC) was a Chinese historian of the early Han dynasty (206AD220). He is considered the father of Chinese historiography for his _Records of the Grand Historian_, a general history of China in the _Jizhuanti_ style (紀傳體) covering more than two thousand years beginning from the rise of the legendary Yellow Emperor and the formation of the first Chinese polity to the reigning sovereign of Sima Qian's time, Emperor Wu of Han. As the first universal history of the world as it was known to the ancient Chinese, the _Records of the Grand Historian_ served as a model for official history-writing for subsequent Chinese dynasties and the Chinese cultural sphere (Korea, Vietnam, Japan) up until the 20th century.[1]
