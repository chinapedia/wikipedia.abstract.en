The GUTTENBERG NATIONAL FISH HATCHERY AND AQUARIUM HISTORIC DISTRICT is a nationally recognized historic district located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of four resources, all of which are contributing buildings.[1] This district also contributes to the Front Street (River Park Drive) Historic District.[2] The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had a long history of involvement with wildlife conservation in Iowa, especially fisheries. They established fish rescue program along the Mississippi River in 1903 and a research station at Fairport in 1910. The development of the lock and dam system in the 1930s brought the fish rescue operations to an end because they eliminated of the backwaters that trapped them. The fish hatchery was developed at that time.
