The ASSOCIATION OF RUGBY LEAGUE CLUBS (Russian: _Ассоциация Регбилиг Клубов_) is the governing body for rugby league in Russia. The association was formed in 2010, bringing together amateur clubs and regional RRLF clubs after the expulsion of the Russian Rugby League Federation and essentially rugby league itself by the Order of the Ministry of Tourism RUSSIA № 21 from State Register of Sports of Russia.
