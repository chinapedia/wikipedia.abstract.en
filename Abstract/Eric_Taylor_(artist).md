Eric Taylor}} ERIC WILFRED TAYLOR (6 August 1909â€“1999) was a British artist and teacher.[1] Although he had a long career encompassing painting, printmaking and the production of sculptures, murals, and ceramics, he is now perhaps best known for the works he created during the Second World War and in particular the paintings he produced when he was among the British troops that liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
