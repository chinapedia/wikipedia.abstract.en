ANSEAU (ALSO ANSELM) DE GARLANDE (1069–1118), son of Adam de Garlande and his wife Havoise. His titles included: Count of Rochefort-en-Yvelines, Seigneur of Gournay-sur-Marne, and Pontault and Berchères. De Garlande served as seneschal of France under Louis VI from 1108 to 1118. It is unclear when Anseau was count, although it is likely that he assumed the title after his brother-in-law Guy II the Red died in 1108.
