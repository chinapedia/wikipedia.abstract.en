HOKAGLISH (or PHILIPPINE HYBRID HOKKIEN), also known by locals as _Sa-lam-tsam oe_ (mixed language), is an oral contact language primarily resulting among three languages: (1) Hokkien Chinese, (2) Tagalog and (3) English.[1] (Other languages that have relative influence include Spanish, Cantonese and other local peripheral languages.)[2] Typically used by Filipino Chinese or Chinese Filipinos, Hokaglish is used in quite a number of domains including corporations, academic institutions, restaurants, religious institutions, phone calls and houses.[3] Some note that this is a result of having to maintain command of all three languages in the spheres of home, school and greater Philippine society. Although used by Chinese Filipinos in general, this form of code switching is very popular with the younger generation (Tsinoys).[4]
