The hamlet is one mile north of the centre of Helston. The hamlet is built around the River Cober. The hamlet used to be an industrial village, with mills, mines, train stations, shops and churches; all of which have been closed down. The hamlet used to be described as one of the "worst and dirtiest places you could imagine". Lowertown is now said to be one of the nicest places.
