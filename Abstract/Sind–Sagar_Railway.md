In 1886 the Sind–Sagar Railway was amalgamated with other railways to form the North Western State Railway and railway line from was converted to broad gauge.[1][2] The Chak Nizam Bridge, also known as Victoria Bridge, was completed in early 1887 over the Jhelum river in Shahpur District and connected Jhelum to Lahore. The _NWR Sind-Sagar Branch Line_ was the new name for the line and continued to be extended with branch lines and designated as part of the 'Frontier Section - Military Line'.[3]
