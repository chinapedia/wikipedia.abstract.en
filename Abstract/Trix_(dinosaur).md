TRIX is a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ specimen excavated in 2013 in Montana, USA by a team of paleontologists from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden in the Netherlands. This _Tyrannosaurus_, over thirty years old—the oldest known _Tyrannosaurus_ specimen—lived over 67 million years ago. It has been considered the third most complete _Tyrannosaurus_ found, with between 75% to 80% of its bone volume recovered. The specimen was named Trix after the Dutch former Queen Beatrix and is one of the only two genuine _Tyrannosaurus_ specimens that are on permanent exhibit in Europe.[1][2][3][4][5] The other one is the specimen known as Tristan, currently on exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Berlin although destined to be installed at the Natural History Museum of Denmark (Copenhagen) in the future.[6]
