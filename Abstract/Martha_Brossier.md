MARTHA BROSSIER (1556- d. after 1578) was a French woman, infamous for feigning demonic possession at the age of 22.[1] The fraud was discovered by Charles Miron, bishop of either the Diocese of Angers or the Diocese of Orl√©ans. According to Augustin Calmet, Martha, the daughter of a weaver in Romorantin, claimed to have been demonically possessed, drawing considerable notoriety. Her case of demonic possession is often cited by theological historians along with the Loudun possessions because both cases consist of notorious accounts of apparent demonic possession which are now presumed to have been fraudulent.[2]
