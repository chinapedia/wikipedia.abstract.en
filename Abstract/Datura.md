_DATURA_ is a genus of nine species of poisonous vespertine flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae. They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as DEVIL'S TRUMPETS[1] (not to be confused with angel's trumpets, its closely related genus _Brugmansia_). They are also sometimes called MOONFLOWERS, JIMSONWEED, DEVIL'S WEED, HELL'S BELLS, THORN-APPLE and many more. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the Americas and North Africa, however, is most likely restricted to the United States, Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and Tunisia in Africa where the highest species diversity occurs.
