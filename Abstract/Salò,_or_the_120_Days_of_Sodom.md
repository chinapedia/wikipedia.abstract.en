_SALÒ, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM_ (), titled _PASOLINI'S 120 DAYS OF SODOM_ on English-language prints[1] and commonly referred to as simply _SALÒ_ (), is a 1975 period horror art film directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The film is a loose adaptation of the book _The 120 Days of Sodom_ by the Marquis de Sade reset during WWII. The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines, during WWII in the time of the fascist Republic of Salò (1943–1945). The libertines kidnap eighteen teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, murder, sadism and sexual and mental torture. The film explores the themes of political corruption, murder, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality and fascism. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante's _Divine Comedy_: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Excrement, and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 book _On the Genealogy of Morality_, Ezra Pound's poem _The Cantos_ and Marcel Proust's novel sequence _In Search of Lost Time_.
