A LEAP YEAR (also known as an INTERCALARY YEAR or BISSEXTILE YEAR) is a calendar year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar calendars, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year.[1] Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called _intercalating_) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.
