ROMYLOS OF VIDIN (), also known as ROMYLOS OF RAVANICA () was a Bulgarian cleric, a disciple of Gregory of Sinai. He was born in Vidin, Bulgaria c. 1330 and died in the Ravanica Monastery, Serbia c. 1385. Romylos was among the brightest followers of the Hesychast tradition in the Eastern Orthodox Church in the 14th century. In the wake of the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria Romylos was among the many Bulgarian intellectuals who emigrated to neighbouring Orthodox countries and brought their talents and texts.[1] His tomb is in the church narthex of the Monastery of Ravanica in Serbia.
