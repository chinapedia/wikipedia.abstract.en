THE ANTISEPTIC DOUCHE was one of the most popular forms of birth control in the early 1900s. It was similar in function to the conventional vaginal douche, but was filled with a chemical mixture instead of saline. The purpose of using a chemical mixture was to interrupt the path of sperm and stop a woman from getting pregnant.[1] Family sizes in the previous generations had always been large, with many women having six or more children. Frequent miscarrages and many deaths were also common before modern medicine.[2] For these women, being given the hope that there was a reasonably priced and safe alternative to countless pregnancies gave many women something they had never had in the past: control of their bodies and in turn their lives.
