DEEP-SEA HYDROTHERMAL VENT EURYARCHAEOTA 2 (DHVE2) is a lineage of Archaea ubiquitous in hydrothermal vent systems. Members of this clade are widespread in deep-sea hydrothermal environments are believed to be crucial components of microbial communities and hydrothermal ecosystems. Culture independent laboratory techniques have revealed that this group accounts for up to 15% of all archaeal sequences in 16S rRNA gene analyses.[1]
