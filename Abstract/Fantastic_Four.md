The FANTASTIC FOUR is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in _The Fantastic Four_ #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby and editor/co-plotter Stan Lee, who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.
