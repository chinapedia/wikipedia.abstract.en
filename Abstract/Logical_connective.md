In logic, a LOGICAL CONNECTIVE (also called a LOGICAL OPERATOR, SENTENTIAL CONNECTIVE, or SENTENTIAL OPERATOR) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective.
