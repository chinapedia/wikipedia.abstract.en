In the _Star Trek_ science fiction franchise, THE MAQUIS are a 24th-century paramilitary organization-terrorist group (like the World War II Maquis in the French Resistance and the Spanish Maquis that emerged in the Spanish Civil War) first introduced in the 1994 episode "The Maquis" of the television series _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, and subsequently appeared in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and _Star Trek: Voyager_. The Maquis story debuted when three _Star Trek_ television shows running from the late 1980s to 2001 took place in the same fictional science-fiction universe at the same time in the future (The 2360s-70s). As a result, the Maquis story was told across dozens of episodes with many more shows providing the context in the wider _Star Trek_ narrative.
