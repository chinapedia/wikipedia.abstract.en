_BALZAC IN THE ROBE OF A DOMINICAN MONK_ is a bronze sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, one of the studies made in preparation to the Monument to Balzac, a tribute to novelist Honor√© Balzac commissioned by the Society of Men of Letters of France in 1891.[1] This sculpture was a particular challenge to the artist due to his preference to portray his subjects in great detail, and the fact that Balzac was already dead. Rodin then started to research about the life and times of his subject, only to find, according to Kenneth Clark, that he had been a short, fat and unremarkable-looking man.[2]
