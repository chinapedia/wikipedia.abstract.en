The ROXBURY FISH HATCHERY, established in 1891, is the oldest state-run fish hatchery in Vermont. It is located on Vermont Route 12A in Roxbury, adjacent to Flint Brook, a tributary of the White River. Its early buildings and landscape were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.[1] It is generally open to visitors, but has been closed to visitation since its facilities were damaged by Hurricane Irene.
