The BERRY PARADOX is a self-referential paradox arising from an expression like "The smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters" (a phrase with fifty-seven letters). Bertrand Russell, the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G. G. Berry (1867â€“1928),[1] a junior librarian at Oxford's Bodleian library.
