AARHUS FEMALE SEMINARY (Danish: _Aarhus Kvindeseminarium_) is a building and a former women's teachers' seminary in Aarhus, Denmark situated on Tr√∏jborgvej 82. The building was constructed for the religious Christian organization Indre Mission in 1910 to house a teachers' seminary for women. The building has housed educational institutions since it was built although Indre Mission no longer owns the building. The name of the school has changed over the years as it has transitioned through different operators but VIA University College may be the last as the college will eventually relocate to CeresByen. The building was designed by the architect Frits Jensen who gave it a French palace-expression.[1][2]
