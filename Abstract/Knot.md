thumb|upright=2|Some knots Knopar_-_2017.jpg with different knots.]] A KNOT is an intentional complication in cordage which may be useful or decorative. Practical knots may be classified as hitches, bends, splices, or knots. A _hitch_ fastens a rope to another object; a _bend_ unites two rope ends; a _splice_ is a multi-strand bend or loop.[1] A _knot_ in the strictest sense serves as a stopper or knob at the end of a rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.
