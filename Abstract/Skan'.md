Filigree1.JPG A SKAN' (Old Russian: съкань, _s''kan'_, which is in turn from the verb съкати, _s''kati_, "twist", "twist into a single or a few strands"[1]) is the Russian counterpart of a filigree.[2] It is a kind of jewelry art with a thin layer of gold, silver or copper wire wound in cords or soldered on a metal background. Skan's are often supplemented by tiny silver or gold beads and enamel.
