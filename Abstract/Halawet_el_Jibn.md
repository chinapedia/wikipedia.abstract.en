HALAWET EL-JIBN ( / _Ḥalāwat al-jibn_) (cheese confection) is a Levantine Arabic dessert made of a Semolina and cheese dough, filled with cream.[1] Its origin has been given as the city of Hama in Syria,[2][3] though it is sometimes claimed to be the city of Homs,[4] where it is considered a specialty.[5] It is found in other regions in the Middle East, including Lebanon and Turkey,[6][7] and other countries around the world.[8][9]
