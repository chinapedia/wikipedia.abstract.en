The RED WOLF (_Canis lupus rufus_[1][2] or _Canis rufus_[3]) is a canine native to the southeastern United States. The subspecies is the product of ancient genetic admixture between the gray wolf and the coyote,[4][5] however it is regarded as unique and therefore worthy of conservation by evolutionary biologists.[6] Morphologically it is intermediate between the coyote and gray wolf, and is of a reddish, tawny color.[7][8] The US Endangered Species Act of 1973 currently does not provide protection for endangered admixed individuals and researchers argue that these should warrant full protection under the Act.[9][10] However, the red wolf when considered as a species is listed as an endangered species under this Act and is protected by law.[11] Although _Canis rufus_ is not listed in the CITES Appendices of endangered species,[12] since 1996 the IUCN has listed it as a critically endangered species.[13]
