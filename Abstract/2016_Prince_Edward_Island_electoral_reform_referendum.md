The 2016 PLEBISCITE ON DEMOCRATIC RENEWAL[1] was a non-binding[2] referendum on electoral reform held in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island between 27 October â€“ 7 November 2016. This was the second electoral reform referendum to be held in Prince Edward Island, following a vote to maintain the status quo in 2005. The referendum asked which of five voting systems residents would prefer to use in electing members to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island.[3][4][5] The referendum, after four instant run-off rounds, indicated mixed member proportional representation was the preferred choice with 55.03% support on the final ballot (52.42% of total voters).[6]
