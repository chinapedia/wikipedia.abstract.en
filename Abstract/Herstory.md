Her story}} HERSTORY is a term for history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. The principal aim of herstory is to bring women out of obscurity from the historical record . It is a neologism coined as a pun with the word "history", as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography, which in their opinion is traditionally written as "his story", i.e., from the masculine point of view.[1] (The word "history"—from the Ancient Greek ἱστορία, or _historia_, meaning "knowledge obtained by inquiry"—is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun _his_.[2]) This movement has led to an increase in activity in other female-centric disciplines such as _femistry_ and _galgebra_.[3]
