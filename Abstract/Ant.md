ANTS are eusocial insects of the family FORMICIDAE and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 140 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified.[1][2] They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.
