FORT RIPLEY was a United States Army outpost on the upper Mississippi River in north-central Minnesota from 1848 to 1877. It was situated near government agencies for the Ho-Chunk and Ojibwe. By its very presence, however, the fort spurred immigration into the area by whites. The post, initially named FORT MARCY, was briefly renamed FORT GAINES and in 1850 was renamed again after Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley, a distinguished soldier from the War of 1812.[1] It was the second major military fort established in what would become Minnesota, after Fort Snelling in 1819.
