_KINGSLAND V. DORSEY_, 338 U.S. 318 (1949), like _Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co._, is another patent fraud decision of the United States Supreme Court growing out of the antitrust cartel case described in _Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States_.[1] _Kingsland_ is widely quoted for its statement that the prosecution of patent applications in the Patent Office "requires the highest degree of candor and good faith" because the Patent Office "must rely upon [patent attorneys'] integrity and deal with them in a spirit of trust and confidence.[2]
