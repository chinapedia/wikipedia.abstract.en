The MERCEDES-BENZ X-CLASS is a luxury pickup truck produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a division of German company Daimler AG. Unveiled at a world premiere in Cape Town in July 2017, the new Mercedes-Benz pickup takes its chassis from the Nissan Navara and employs many Mercedes-specific features and technologies (including some engines not shared with the Navara). It went on sale in early 2017.[1]
