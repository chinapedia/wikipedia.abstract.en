ESKIMO ( ) or ESKIMOS are the indigenous peoples who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern Siberia (Russia) to Alaska (of the United States), Canada, and Greenland.[1][2] The two main peoples known as "Eskimo" are: (1) the Inuit, including the Alaskan IÃ±upiat peoples, the Greenlandic Inuit, and the mass-grouping Inuit peoples of Canada, and (2) the Yupik of eastern Siberia[3] and Alaska. A third northern group, the Aleut, is closely related to both. They share a relatively recent common ancestor, and a language group (Eskimo-Aleut).
