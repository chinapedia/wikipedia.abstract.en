Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg In mathematics, the SLOPE or GRADIENT of a line is a number that describes both the _direction_ and the _steepness_ of the line.[1] Slope is often denoted by the letter _m_; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter _m_ is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844)[2] who wrote the equation of a straight line as and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888)[3] who wrote it as "_y_ = _mx_ + _c_".[4]
