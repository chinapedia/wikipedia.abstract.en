PEDALS (died October 2016, New Jersey, United States) was an American black bear (_Ursus americanus_) that walked upright on its hind legs due to injuries on his front paws. After videos of the bear were posted on the internet, more than 300,000 people signed a petition to move the bear to a wildlife sanctuary. Pedals appears to have been killed in October 2016 in New Jersey's first sanctioned bow and arrow hunt in four decades. During the hunt, which also included muzzle-loading rifles, a total of 562 bears were killed.
