In small arms, a _long gun_ is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand. In the context of cannons and mounted firearms an artillery _long gun_ would be contrasted with a howitzer or carronade.[1][2]
