NETSCAPE is a brand name associated with the development of the Netscape web browser. It is now owned by Verizon Media, a subsidiary of Verizon. The brand belonged to the NETSCAPE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (formerly MOSAIC COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION), an independent American computer services company, whose headquarters were in Mountain View, California, and later Dulles, Virginia.[1] The browser was once dominant but lost to Internet Explorer and other competitors after the so-called first browser war, its market share falling from more than 90 percent in the mid-1990s[2] to less than 1 percent in 2006.[3]
