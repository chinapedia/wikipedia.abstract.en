Thrawn_Janet_Illustration_-_Image_from_page_311_of_"William_Strang;_catalogue_of_his_etched_work"_(1906)_(14803149913).jpg "THRAWN JANET" is a short story, written in Scots, by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. He wrote the story in the summer of 1881 while he stayed at the rented Kinnaird Cottage in Kinnaird, a hamlet near Pitlochry, with his parents and wife. When he read the story to his wife Fanny, she said of it that it "sent a cauld grue [shudder] along my bones" and "fair frightened" Stevenson himself. It was first published in the October 1881 issue of the _Cornhill Magazine_. It is a dark tale of satanic possession.[1][2][3][4]
