In theoretical computer science, a NON-DETERMINISTIC TURING MACHINE is a theoretical model of computation. They are used in thought experiments to examine the abilities and limitations of computers. One of the most important open problems in theoretical computer science is the P vs. NP problem, which concerns the question of how difficult it is to simulate non-deterministic computation with a deterministic computer.
