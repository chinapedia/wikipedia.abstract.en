WACKY RACELAND is a comic book series that reimagines the cast of _Wacky Races_ competing in a desert wasteland, reminiscent of the _Mad Max_ film series, filled with all kinds of obstacles, towards one single goal, Utopia, mankind's last safe haven. It is also one of four comic books introduced by DC Comics in 2016 as part of the comic book initiative _Hanna-Barbera Beyond_, among with _Scooby Apocalypse_, _Future Quest_ and _The Flintstones_.[1]
