MARY ROTHES MARGARET CECIL, 2nd Baroness Amherst of Hackney, (_née_ MARY ROTHES MARGARET TYSSEN-AMHERST; 25 April 1857 – 21 December 1919) was a British hereditary peer, charity worker, amateur archaeologist and ornithologist. Thirty-two of the Tombs of the Nobles at Aswan were uncovered in her excavations and for many years were known as the "Cecil Tombs". She was one of the few English women to have held a peerage in her own right. The black crowned crane, _balearica pavonia ceciliae_ was named in her honour.
