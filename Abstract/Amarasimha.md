Amarakosha.jpg AMARASIMHA (IAST: AMARA-SIṂHA, c. CE 375) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet from ancient India, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been "one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya," and according to the evidence of Xuanzang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished about CE 375.[1] Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of Vikramaditya of 7th century.[2][3] Most of Amarasiṃha's work was destroyed, with the exception of the celebrated _Amara-Kosha_ (IAST: _Amarakośa_) (_Treasury of Amara_). The first reliable mention of the _Amarakosha_ is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of Amoghavarsha (814-867CE)[4]
