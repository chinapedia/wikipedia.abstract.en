Lactococcus_lactis.jpg MICROBIAL DRUG DELIVERY is an emerging form of drug administration characterized by the use of commensal microbes that have been genetically modified to produce medications for chronic diseases in humans.[1][2][3] Only proteinaceous drugs can be produced by microbes, as DNA encodes for protein. Research into microbial drug delivery refers to this route of administration as topical, since the microbes release the drug directly to the surface of affected tissues, namely the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium.[4][5] Microbial drug delivery is not currently used as a standard route of drug administration due to its experimental nature. During clinical trials, it has been used to treat forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[6][7] The most prominently studied vehicles of microbial drug administration are the bacterial species, _Lactococcus lactis_ and _Bacteroides ovatus._[8][9][10]
