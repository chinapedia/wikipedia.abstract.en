CLAUDIUS AELIANUS (;[1] c. 175c. 235 AD), commonly AELIAN (), born at Praeneste, was a Roman author and teacher of rhetoric who flourished under Septimius Severus and probably outlived Elagabalus, who died in 222. He spoke Greek so fluently that he was called "honey-tongued" (μελίγλωσσος _meliglossos_); Roman-born, he preferred Greek authors, and wrote in a slightly archaizing Greek himself. This cites:
