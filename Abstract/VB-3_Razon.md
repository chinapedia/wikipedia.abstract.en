The VB-3 RAZON was a high-angle freefall guided bomb developed by the United States Army Air Force during the 1940s. Razon (for Range and AZimuth Only) was a standard AN-M65 1,000-pound general purpose bomb, the same basic ordnance unit used for its AZimuth-ONly guided predecessor, the VB-1 Azon guided ordnance, with the Razon concept fitted with flight control surfaces that also enabled adjustment in the vertical plane, like the Luftwaffe's heavier Fritz X armored anti-ship guided ordnance. Development of the Razon began in 1942, but it did not see use during World War II[1] although it was combat ready in the summer of 1945. The VB-4 used a 2,000-pound bomb.[2][3]
