L_Old_London.svg _L_]] In common law legal systems, BLACK LETTER LAWS are the well-established legal rules that are no longer subject to reasonable dispute.[1] Some examples are the "black-letter law" that the formation of a contract requires consideration, or the "black-letter law" that the registration of a trademark requires established use in the course of trade. Black-letter law can be contrasted with legal theory or unsettled legal issues.
