METHANDRIOL PROPIONATE (brand name METILBISEXOVIS), or METHYLANDROSTENEDIOL PROPIONATE, also known as 17Α-METHYLANDROST-5-ENE-3,17Β-DIOL 3-PROPIONATE, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 5-androstenediol that is or was marketed by Vister in Italy.[1][2][3] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C3,17β propionate ester of methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol) – and acts as a prodrug of methandriol in the body.[4] Methandriol propionate is administered by intramuscular injection and, relative to methandriol, has an extended duration via this route due to a depot effect afforded by its ester.
