500px|thumb|upright=1.75|alt= A vector field with diverging vectors, a vector field with converging vectors, and a vector field with parallel vectors that neither diverge nor converge|The divergence of different vector fields. The divergence of vectors from point (x,y) equals the sum of the partial derivative-with-respect-to-x of the x-component and the partial derivative-with-respect-to-y of the y-component at that point: $\nabla\!\cdot(\mathbf{V}(x,y))=\frac{\partial\ {\mathbf{V}_x(x,y)}}{\partial{x}}+\frac{\partial\ {\mathbf{V}_y(x,y)}}{\partial{y}}$
