HOBART ()[1] is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania. With a population of approximately 240,000 (over 40% of Tasmania's population), it is the least populated Australian state capital city, and second smallest if territories are taken into account (after Darwin, Northern Territory).[2] Founded in 1804 as a British penal colony,[3] Hobart, formerly known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, is Australia's second oldest capital city after Sydney, New South Wales. Prior to British settlement, the Hobart area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years,[4] by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe, a sub-group of the Nuennone, or South-East tribe.[5] The descendants of these Aboriginal Tasmanians often refer to themselves as 'Palawa'.
