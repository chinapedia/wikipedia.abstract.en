_LIVE FROM HERE_, formerly known as _A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION WITH CHRIS THILE_, is an American variety radio show known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Hosted by Chris Thile, it airs on Saturday evenings and is usually recorded in front of a live audience at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, although the show frequently goes on tour to cities around the United States. Those locations include New York City, where the show is slated to make its new home in the forthcoming 2019-2020 season at The Town Hall.[1]
