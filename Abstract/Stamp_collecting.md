Fran√ßois_Barraud_-_Le_Philateliste.jpg (1929).]] STAMP COLLECTING is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately, which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service,[1] as a never-ending stream of new stamps was produced by countries that sought to advertise their distinctiveness through their stamps.
