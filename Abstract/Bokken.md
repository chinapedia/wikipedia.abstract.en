Various_bokken_or_bukuto.jpg A _BOKKEN_ (, _bok(u)_, "wood", and _ken_, "sword") (or a _bokutō_ , as they are instead called in Japan) is a Japanese wooden sword used for training. It is usually the size and shape of a _katana_, but is sometimes shaped like other swords, such as the _wakizashi_ and _tantō_. Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings. Sometimes it is spelled "boken" in English. _Bokken_ should not be confused with _shinai_, practice swords made of flexible bamboo.
