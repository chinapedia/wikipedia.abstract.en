A STATE OF EMERGENCY was declared on Sunday, October 9, 2016 by Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, although the state of emergency reportedly took effect on Saturday, October 8, 2016.[1] The state of emergency authorizes the military to enforce security nationwide.[2] It also imposes restrictions on freedom of speech and access to information.[3] Media have reported the state of emergency’s duration was announced for six months. The Constitution of Ethiopia provides for a six-month state of emergency under certain conditions.[4] The government’s declaration of state of emergency followed massive protests by the Oromo and Amhara ethic groups against the government, which is controlled by people in the Tigrayan ethnic group, a smaller ethnic minority.[5] It is the first time in approximately 25 years that a state of emergency has been declared in Ethiopia.[6] In March 2017, Ethiopia’s parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another four months.[7]
