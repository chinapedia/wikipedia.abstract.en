Arvid_Liljelund_-_Man_Singing_Hymn_-_A_I_187_-_Finnish_National_Gallery.jpg A HYMN is a type of song, usually religious, specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer, and typically addressed to a deity or deities, or to a prominent figure or personification. The word _hymn_ derives from Greek (_hymnos_), which means "a song of praise". A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist. The singing or composition of hymns is called HYMNODY. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.
