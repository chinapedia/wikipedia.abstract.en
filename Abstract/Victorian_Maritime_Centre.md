The VICTORIAN MARITIME CENTRE is an Australian maritime museum near Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is currently located at the former BP administration building at Crib Point, Victoria. There are plans to establish a larger maritime centre in Hastings, Victoria. The new site would feature HMAS Otama, an Oberon-class submarine operated by the Royal Australian Navy from 1978 to 2000. The Otama is currently moored offshore at Crib Point. She has been moored nearby since 2002.[1] The ship Wyuna is also planned to be displayed at the centre. For a time she was docked at Beauty Point, Tasmania, and after being refurbished for 18 months she was to be moved to Docklands in Melbourne, Victoria.[2] After this berth became unavailable, the vessel was docked at Inspection Head Wharf in Beauty Point. After a period there, she was towed into Bell Bay where she lays at anchor as of January 2016.[3]
