The ORANGUTANS (also spelled ORANG-UTAN, ORANGUTANG, or ORANG-UTANG) are three extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are currently only found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus _PONGO_, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (_P. pygmaeus_, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (_P. abelii_). In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (_P. tapanuliensis_).
