BARBRA CASBAR SIPERSTEIN (November 20, 1942 – February 3, 2019) was an American transgender and political activist. She came out as a trans woman in the late 1980’s. When her wife died in 2001 she channeled the grief into activism. She served in numerous Democratic Party political organizations including the New Jersey Stonewall Democrats, Garden State Equality and the Democratic National Committee Eastern Caucus. She advocated for gender inclusion in discrimination and hate crime laws in New Jersey. In 2009 she became the only openly transgender member of the Democratic National Committee serving in various roles until 2017.[1][2]
