AREA 51 is the common name of a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. Officially, the facility is called HOMEY AIRPORT (KXTA) or GROOM LAKE, named after the salt flat situated next to its airfield. Although details of the facility's operations are not publicly known, the USAF says it as an open training range[1] and it most likely supports the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems based on historical evidence.[2][3] The USAF acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft.[4]
