The ABLATIVE CASE (sometimes abbreviated ) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the grammar of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses. The word "ablative" derives from the Latin _ablatus_, the (irregular) perfect passive participle of _auferre_ "to carry away".[1] The ablative case is found in ancient languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, as well as modern languages like Turkish and Hungarian. There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as German. There was an ablative case in Ancient Greek in the early stages of the language, which quickly fell into disuse by the classical period.
