In poker, the strength of a hand (how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played) is often called its VALUE; however, in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic, a BET FOR VALUE. This bet (or raise) is intended to increase the size of the pot, by inducing opponents to call. A BET FOR VALUE is in contrast to a _bluff_ or a _protection bet_ (though some bets may have a combination of these motives).
