MICHELANGELO MERISI (MICHELE ANGELO MERIGI or AMERIGHI) DA CARAVAGGIO (, , ; 28 September 1571[1] â€“ 18 July 1610) was an Italian painter active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily from the early 1590s to 1610. His paintings combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, which had a formative influence on Baroque painting.[2][3][4]
