The ECONOMY OF GEORGIA is an emerging free market. Its gross domestic product fell sharply following the collapse of the Soviet Union but recovered in the mid-2000s, growing in double digits thanks to the economic and democratic reforms brought by the peaceful Rose Revolution. Georgia continued its economic progress since, "moving from a near-failed state in 2003 to a relatively well-functioning market economy in 2014".[1] In 2007, the World Bank named Georgia the World's number one economic reformer,[2][3] and has consistently ranked the country at the top of its ease of doing business index.
