_CALADENIA ARRECTA_, commonly known as the REACHING SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three red, yellow and green flowers on a flowering stem up to high. It is distinguished from the similar _C. longiclavata_ and _C. magniclavata_ by its upswept petals and distinctive calli. Although not common, it is widespread in south-eastern coastal areas.
