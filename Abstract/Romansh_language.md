ROMANSH(; sometimes also spelled _Romansch_, _Rumantsch_, or _Romanche_; Romansh: _rumantsch_, _rumàntsch_, _romauntsch_ or _romontsch_) is a Romance language spoken predominantly in the southeastern Swiss canton of Grisons (Graubünden), where it has official status alongside German and Italian. It is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. Romansh has also been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language in correspondence with Romansh-speaking citizen since 1996, along with German, French and Italian.[1] It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as a Rhaeto-Romance language, though this is disputed.
