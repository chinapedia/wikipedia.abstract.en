DARTMOOR PRESERVATION ASSOCIATION (DPA) is one of the oldest environmental or amenity bodies in the UK. It was founded in 1883.[1] It concerns itself with Dartmoor, a National Park in Devon, south-west England. It began with two main areas of concern. Firstly, commonersâ€™ rights were being eroded through army use, including the firing of live artillery shells, and piecemeal enclosure of land around the margins.[2] Secondly, there was increasing public interest in Dartmoor's scenery, archaeology, history and wildlife[3]
