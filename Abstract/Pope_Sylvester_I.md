POPE SYLVESTER I (also SILVESTER, died 31 December 335), was Pope of the Catholic Church from 314 to his death in 335. He succeeded Pope Miltiades as the 33rd Pope.[1] He filled the See of Rome at an important era in the history of the Western Church, yet very little is known of him.[2] The accounts of his papacy preserved in the _Liber Pontificalis_ (seventh or eighth century) contain little more than a record of the gifts said to have been conferred on the Church by Constantine I,[3] although it does say that he was the son of a Roman named _Rufinus_.[4] His feast is celebrated as Saint Sylvester's Day in Western Christianity on December 31, while Eastern Christianity commemorates it on January 2.[5]
