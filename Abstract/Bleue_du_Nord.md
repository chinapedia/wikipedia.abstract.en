Jielbeaumadier_bleue_du_nord_agr_paris_2013,_cropped_and_darkened.jpeg in Paris, 2013]] The BLEUE DU NORD is a French breed of dual-purpose cattle from the former region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais in the north-east of the country, on the border with Belgium. It shares the origins of the Belgian Blue, but unlike that breed is selectively bred both for meat and for dairy use. The "double-muscling" characteristic of the Belgian Blue, caused by a genetic myostatin deficiency, is present also in the Bleue du Nord, but to a limited and controlled extent.
