METHADONE, sold under the brand name DOLOPHINE among others, is an opioid used for opioid maintenance therapy in opioid dependence and for chronic pain management.[1] Detoxification using methadone can either be done relatively rapidly in less than a month or gradually over as long as six months.[2] While a single dose has a rapid effect, achieving maximum effect can take up to five days of use.[3] The pain-relieving effects last about six hours after a single dose.[4] [5] After long-term use, in people with normal liver function, effects last 8 to 36 hours.[6][7] Methadone is usually taken by mouth and rarely by injection into a muscle or vein.[8]
