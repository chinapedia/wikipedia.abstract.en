In July 2006, DIANA MILLER and her husband James Miller, were robbed at gunpoint by three men in their family home in The Villages, Florida. Both James and Diana were shot in the back of the head with Diana's shooting proving fatal. Sheila Miller, the disabled daughter of the couple, was kidnapped by the three men (one of whom was Sheila's former drug dealer) and taken in the family van to Ocala, Florida. The group entered a mall where the men used Sheila to withdraw cash from the family's personal bank accounts from several ATM machines.[1] Officers eventually caught up with the men and chased them down in a recorded high-speed pursuit which resulted in a violent crash. One of the suspects was ejected from the vehicle during the crash and became pinned and trapped under the van. The robber who was identified as the shooter and killer of Diana Miller, Renaldo McGirth, was sentenced to death for the crime two years later, becoming the youngest person on death row in Florida at the time.[2]
