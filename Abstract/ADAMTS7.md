A DISINTEGRIN AND METALLOPROTEINASE WITH THROMBOSPONDIN MOTIFS 7 (ADAMTS7) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the _ADAMTS7_ gene on chromosome 15.[1] It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types.[2] This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) degradation.[3] ADAMTS7 has been associated with cancer and arthritis in multiple tissue types.[4][5] The _ADAMTS7_ gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.[6]
