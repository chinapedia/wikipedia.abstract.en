LAMMAS DAY (Anglo-Saxon _hlaf-mas_, "loaf-mass"), is a holiday celebrated in some English-speaking countries in the Northern Hemisphere, usually between 1 August and 1 September. It is a festival to mark the annual wheat harvest, and is the first harvest festival of the year. On this day it was customary to bring to church a loaf made from the new crop, which began to be harvested at LAMMASTIDE, which falls at the halfway point between the summer Solstice and Autumn September Equinox.
