LILLE TORV (lit. LITTLE SQUARE) is a cobbled public square located in the Indre By neighborhood in Aarhus, Denmark.[1] It is situated between the squares of Store Torv and Immervad in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood and it is one of the oldest public squares in Aarhus. The streets of Vestergade, _Guldsmedgade_, _Immervad_ and _Badstuegade_ radiates from Lille Torv. It is today a venue for public events and gatherings in the city. The square is home to some notable buildings such as the storied _Meulengracht's House_ and the listed Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland.[2]
