RIBEIRA GRANDE DE SANTIAGO is a stream in the southern part of the island of Santiago in Cape Verde. In its upper part it is called _Ribeira Cadacina_. Its source is in the central mountain range of the island, near Monte Tchota, west of Rui Vaz, in the municipality of SÃ£o Domingos. It flows towards the south, and joins the Atlantic Ocean in Cidade Velha. Villages along its course are Achada Loura, Salineiro and Calabaceira. A reservoir for irrigation was built near Salineiro in 2013.[1]
