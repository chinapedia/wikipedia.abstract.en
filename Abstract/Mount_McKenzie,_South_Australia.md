The current boundaries of the locality were set in May 2003 for the long-established name for the area.[1] The school opened in 1882, but has long since closed. The community hall founded in 1926 is still active.[2][3] Mount McKenzie Post Office opened as a postal receiving office on 2 January 1914, became a regular post office in June 1915, and closed in 1965.[4]
