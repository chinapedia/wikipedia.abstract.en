CHIVARRETO BOXING, also known as BOXEO A PUÃ‘O LIMPIO, is a type of boxing that is practiced in the Chivarreto villa in San Francisco El Alto, Totonicapan, Guatemala. It is a popular activity in town and there is an annual tournament, held during Semana Santa every year, with fights held on good friday.[1] The tournaments began as a punishment to criminals who'd then have to fight it out amongst themselves; since 1900, it developed into an open contest in which anyone can participate, and winners receive trophies.[2]
