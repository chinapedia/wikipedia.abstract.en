The Swiss-designed Thury screw thread (alternatively called the Fili√®re Suisse (FS) screw thread) is a metric thread standard that was developed in the late nineteenth century for screws used in scientific and horological instruments. The thread is named after Marc Thury, an engineer and professor at the University of Geneva who contributed heavily to the standard's development.[1]
