The GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP is the European Union’s biggest scientific research initiative. With a budget of €1 billion, it represents a new form of joint, coordinated research initiative on an unprecedented scale.[1] Through a combined academic-industrial consortium, the research effort covers the entire value chain, from materials production to components and system integration, and targets a number of specific goals that exploit the unique properties of graphene.[2] There are some critics of this and similar initiatives, arguing that excessive funding of graphene-related research and innovation is disproportional to estimates of industrial potential.[3][4]
