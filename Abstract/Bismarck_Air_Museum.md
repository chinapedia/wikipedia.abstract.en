The BISMARCK AIR MUSEUM is an effort to preserve the large municipal hangar, now known as Hangar #5, at Bismarck, North Dakota. In the 1930s and 1940s a terminal building, a large hangar and the runways were constructed as a part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) airport development project. Hangar #5 is the last remaining evidence of this effort and it is the goal of the Bismarck Air Museum Foundation to preserve this structure and create an aviation venue for Central and Western North Dakota.
