In grammar, the GENITIVE CASE (abbreviated ),[1] also called the SECOND CASE, is the grammatical case that marks a word, usually a noun, as modifying another word, also usually a nounâ€”thus, indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun.[2] A genitive can also serve purposes indicating other relationships. For example, some verbs may feature arguments in the genitive case; and the genitive case may also have adverbial uses (see adverbial genitive).
