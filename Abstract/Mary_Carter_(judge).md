MARY YVONNE CARTER (1923â€“2010) was a Saskatchewan judge. She is notable as the second female magistrate appointed in Saskatchewan history (in 1960) and one of the earliest female law graduates in that province (in 1947). She was later elevated to the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, where she sat for many years.[1]
