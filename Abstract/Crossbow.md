Armborst,_1500-tal_-_Livrustkammaren_-_106745.tif Crossbow_TenPoint_Stealth_SS.png A CROSSBOW is a type of elastic ranged weapon in similar principle to a bow, consisting of a bow-like assembly called a _prod_, mounted horizontally on a main frame called a _tiller_, which is handheld in a similar fashion to the stock of a long gun. It shoots arrow-like projectiles called bolts or quarrels. The medieval European crossbow was called by many other names including crossbow itself, most of which were derived from the word _ballista_, an ancient Greek torsion siege engine similar in appearance.[1]
