MALARIA is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals.[1] Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.[2] In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.[3] Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.[4] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[5] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[6] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[7]
