THE FOUR-TUBE TELEVISION CAMERA, intended for color television studio use, was first developed by RCA in the early 1960s.[1][2] In this camera, in addition to the usual complement of three tubes for the red, green and blue images, a fourth tube was included to provide luminance (black and white) detail of a scene. With such a camera, a sharp black and white picture was always assured, as it was not necessary to combine signals from the three colour tubes to provide the luminance detail.
