Speed_Rack_3.jpg SPEED RACK is a speed bartending competition for women in the United States that was cofounded by bartenders Ivy Mix and Lynnette Marrero. In 2011, Mix approached Marrero, who was the president of the New York City chapter of LUPEC (Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails), about creating a competition to showcase talented women in the craft cocktail world.[1] The competition raises funds for Breast Cancer education, prevention and research, while promoting women bartenders in an largely male promoted industry.[2]
