_NEMATUS LEUCOTROCHUS_ is a species of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae, known as the PALE-SPOTTED GOOSEBERRY SAWFLY. Widespread throughout central and northern Europe, this insect is best known as a pest of gooseberries. The larvae feed on the foliage of the plant, defoliating it. Unlike _Nematus ribesii_, the common gooseberry sawfly, the species has a single brood. Adults appear in early May and larvae in May and June.[1]
