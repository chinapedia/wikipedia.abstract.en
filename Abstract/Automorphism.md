Automorphic}} In mathematics, an AUTOMORPHISM is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself. It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the AUTOMORPHISM GROUP. It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object.
