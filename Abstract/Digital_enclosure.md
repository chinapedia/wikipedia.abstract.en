DIGITAL ENCLOSURE is a model of interrogating the relationship that has arisen between surveillance and the new emerging interactive economy developed by Mark Andrejevic, an associate professor at the University of Iowa.[1][2] The new interactivity-enhanced spaces born of the new digital era has create “digital enclosures” in both a physical and virtual sense. It is this enclosure that allows for individuals or companies to own, operate, and claim ownership over the information generated by the users who interact within their boundaries.[3]
