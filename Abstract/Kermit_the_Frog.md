KERMIT THE FROG is a Muppet character and Jim Henson's best-known creation. Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the straight man protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably _Sesame Street_ and _The Muppet Show_, as well as in other television series, films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. Henson performed Kermit until his death in 1990; Steve Whitmire performed Kermit from that time until his dismissal in 2016. Kermit is currently performed by Matt Vogel.[1] He was also voiced by Frank Welker in _Muppet Babies_ and occasionally in other animation projects, and is voiced by Matt Danner in the 2018 reboot of _Muppet Babies_.
