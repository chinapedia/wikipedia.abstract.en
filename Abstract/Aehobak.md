AEHOBAK (), also called KOREAN ZUCCHINI or KOREAN COURGETTE,[1][2] is an edible, green to yellow-green summer squash. Although nearly all summer squashes are varieties of _Cucurbita pepo_,[3] aehobak belongs to the species _Cucurbita moschata_.[4] Commonly used in Korean cuisine, an _aehobak_ has the shape of zucchini, but with thinner, smoother skin, and more delicate flesh.[5] It is usually sold in shrink-wrapped plastic.[6]
