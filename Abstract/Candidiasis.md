CANDIDIASIS is a fungal infection due to any type of _Candida_ (a type of yeast).[1] When it affects the mouth, it is commonly called THRUSH.[2] Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat.[3] Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing.[4] When it affects the vagina, it is commonly called a YEAST INFECTION.[5] Signs and symptoms include genital itching, burning, and sometimes a white "cottage cheese-like" discharge from the vagina.[6] Yeast infections of the penis are less common and typically present with an itchy rash.[7] Very rarely, yeast infections may become invasive, spreading to other parts of the body.[8] This may result in fevers along with other symptoms depending on the parts involved.[9]
