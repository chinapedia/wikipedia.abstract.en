EUPHORIA is a programming language originally created by Robert Craig of Rapid Deployment Software[1] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Initially developed (though not publicly released) on the Atari ST,[2] the first commercial release[3] was for the 16-bit DOS platform and was proprietary. In 2006, with the release of version 3,[4] Euphoria became open-source software. The openEuphoria Group continues to administer and develop the project.[5] In December 2010, the openEuphoria Group released version 4[6] of openEuphoria along with a new identity and mascot for the project. OpenEuphoria is currently available for Windows, Linux, macOS and three flavors of *BSD.
