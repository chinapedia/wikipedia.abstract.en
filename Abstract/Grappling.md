From the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in Munich.]] GRAPPLING, in hand-to-hand combat, is the act of gripping or seizing the opponent, as in wrestling.[1] Grappling is used at close range to gain a physical advantage such as improving relative position, or to cause injury to the opponent. Grappling covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles and martial arts that are practiced both as combat sports and for self-defense. Grappling contests often involve takedowns and ground control, and may end when a contestant concedes defeat, also known as a submission or tap out.[2]
