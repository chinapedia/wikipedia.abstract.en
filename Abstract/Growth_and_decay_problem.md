This article discusses an important problem from application of view. The document does not go into much depth but it has enough information to make you familiar with these problem.The result of this problem is used in many fields like nuclear chemistry, biology,etc. in one or another form. In our daily life, often we come across problems related with growth and decay like decay of organic matter, growth of plants,etc.But some growth and decay phenomenon can be described in terms of differential equations like decay of radioactive element like Uranium, growth of certain bacteria,etc. How this can be done, is described here.
