JuengeresMathildenkreuz.jpg, a _crux gemmata_ made for Mathilde, Abbess of Essen (973â€“1011), who is shown kneeling before the Virgin and Child in the enamel plaque. The figure of Christ is slightly later. Probably made in Cologne or Essen, the cross demonstrates several medieval techniques: cast figurative sculpture, filigree, enamelling, gem polishing and setting, and the reuse of Classical cameos and engraved gems.]]
