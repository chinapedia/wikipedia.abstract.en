Knights_of_labor_seal.gif KNIGHTS OF LABOR (K OF L), officially NOBLE AND HOLY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR, was an American labor federation active in the late 19th century, especially the 1880s. It operated as well in Canada,[1] and had chapters also in Great Britain and Australia.[2] Its most important leaders were Terence V. Powderly and step-brother Joseph Bath. The Knights promoted the social and cultural uplift of the working man, rejected socialism and anarchism, demanded the eight-hour day, and promoted the producers' ethic of Republicanism in the United States. In some cases it acted as a labor union, negotiating with employers, but it was never well organized or funded. After a rapid expansion in the mid-1880s, it suddenly lost its new members and became a small operation again.
