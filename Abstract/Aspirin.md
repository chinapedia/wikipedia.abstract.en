ASPIRIN, also known as ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASA), is a medication used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation.[1] Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.[2] Aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death.[3] Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.[4] It may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.[5] For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes.[6] Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.[7]
