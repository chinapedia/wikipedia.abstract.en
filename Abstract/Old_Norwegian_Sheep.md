Old_Norwegian_Sheep_at_Prestøya,_Brønnøy,_Norway.JPG The OLD NORWEGIAN SHEEP (Norwegian: Gammelnorsk sau) is likely the breed that most closely resembles the original Northern European short-tailed sheep in Norway.[1][2] Although the breed almost went extinct at several points in the last century,[3] conservation efforts have succeeded in growing the population to around 30,000 animals and the breed is no longer considered threatened.[4] The breed is particularly suited for being kept outside all year, a practice that stems back to the Viking Age.[5]
