SCOTTISH GAELIC ( ) or SCOTS GAELIC, sometimes also referred to simply as GAELIC, is a Goidelic language of the Celtic and Indo-European language family, native to the Gaels of Scotland. As a Goidelic language, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century, although a common literary language was shared by Gaels in both Ireland and Scotland down to the 16th century.[1] Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames.
