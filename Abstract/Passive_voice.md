PASSIVE VOICE is a grammatical voice common in many languages. In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the _theme_ or _patient_ of the main verb â€“ that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.[1] This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence "The tree was pulled down", the subject (_the tree_) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences "Someone pulled down the tree" and "The tree is down" are active sentences.
