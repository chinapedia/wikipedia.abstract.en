The A.A. MARAMIS BUILDING is a historic building and a national heritage located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The building is currently the headquarters of the Indonesian Ministry of Finance. The building was built following Daendels's intention to move the official residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from the decaying Old Town to the southern suburb of Weltevreden, although it was never used as an official residence of the Governor-General. The turn of the 19th-century building is the second oldest surviving building in Central Jakarta (after Istana Negara on Jalan Veteran) in terms of when the construction was started.
