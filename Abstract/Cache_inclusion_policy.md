Multi-level caches can be designed in various ways depending on whether the content of one cache is present in other level of caches. If all blocks in the higher level cache are also present in the lower level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be INCLUSIVE of the higher level cache. If the lower level cache contains only blocks that are not present in the higher level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be EXCLUSIVE of the higher level cache. If the contents of the lower level cache are neither strictly inclusive nor exclusive of the higher level cache, then it is called NON-INCLUSIVE NON-EXCLUSIVE (NINE) cache.[1][2]
