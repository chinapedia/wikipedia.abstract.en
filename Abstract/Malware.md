MALWARE (a portmanteau for MALICIOUS SOFTWARE) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.[1] Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a target's computer and can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software.[2] The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer userâ€”and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency, which is typically described as a software bug.
