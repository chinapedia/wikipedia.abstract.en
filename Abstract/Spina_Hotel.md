The SPINA HOTEL is a historic former hotel building in Ironton, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1913 with multiple commercial spaces and grandly designed architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and commerce.[1] It was nominated for illustrating the scale of civic development anticipated but never fully achieved during the boom years of iron mining on the Cuyuna Range.[2]
