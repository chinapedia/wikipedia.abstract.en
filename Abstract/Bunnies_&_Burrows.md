_BUNNIES & BURROWS'' (_B&B'') is a role-playing game (RPG) inspired by the novel _Watership Down_.[1] Published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976, the game centered on intelligent rabbits. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, and the first to have detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official _GURPS_ supplement in 1992.
