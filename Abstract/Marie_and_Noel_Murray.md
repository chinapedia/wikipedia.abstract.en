MARIE AND NOEL MURRAY were an anarchist married couple who were among the last people to be sentenced to death in the Republic of Ireland.[1] The couple were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in June 1976 for the murder of Garda Michael Reynolds the previous September. The sentences led to an outcry and a campaign to stop the executions received international attention. The sentences were quashed and the pair were convicted of common murder. They were both released in 1992.
