ANDREAS CAPELLANUS (_Capellanus_ meaning "chaplain"), also known as ANDREW THE CHAPLAIN, and occasionally by a French translation of his name, ANDRÃ‰ LE CHAPELAIN, was the 12th-century author of a treatise commonly known as _De amore_ ("About Love"), and often known in English, somewhat misleadingly, as _The Art of Courtly Love_, though its realistic, somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to courtly love. Little is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of Marie de Champagne, and probably of French origin.
