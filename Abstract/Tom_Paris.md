THOMAS EUGENE "TOM" PARIS, played by Robert Duncan McNeill, is a character in the American science fiction television series _Star Trek: Voyager_. In that show, which aired on UPN between 1995 and 2001, Paris serves as the chief helmsman and an auxiliary medic aboard the Federation of Planets starship USS _Voyager_, which must make its way home after being stranded on the opposite of the Galaxy as Earth with a motley collection of Starfleet, Maquis, and aliens as crew. The character's middle name, "Eugene", is a tribute to _Star Trek_ creator Gene Roddenberry.[1]
