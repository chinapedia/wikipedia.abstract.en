The CONFEDERATION CUP PACE is a harness race for Standardbred pacers run annually at Flamboro Downs in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Set at a distance of one mile, it was first run in 1977 and through 2012 it was a race for three-year-olds. Placed on hiatus for 2013 and 2014, upon reinstatement in 2015, the Confederation Cup Pace was changed to an event for four-year-olds.[1] The Confederation cup is the most important race for three-year-olds at Flamboro Downs. Over the years it has attracted the some of the very best horses in North America including U.
