MARILYN MONROE (born NORMA JEANE MORTENSON; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was an American actress, model, and singer. Famous for playing comic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's changing attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.[1] More than half a century later, she continues to be a major popular culture icon.
