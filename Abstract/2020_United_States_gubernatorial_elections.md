UNITED STATES GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS will be held on November 3, 2020, in 11 states and two territories. In addition, special elections may take place (depending on state law) if other gubernatorial seats are vacated. The last regular gubernatorial elections for nine of the eleven states took place in 2016. The last gubernatorial elections for New Hampshire and Vermont took place in 2018, as the governors of both states serve two-year terms. All state governors will be eligible for reelection except for Steve Bullock of Montana, although other governors may choose to retire. The 2020 gubernatorial elections will take place concurrently with several other federal, state, and local elections, including the presidential election.
