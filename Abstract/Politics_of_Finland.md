The POLITICS OF FINLAND take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. Finland is a republic whose head of state is President Sauli Niinist√∂, who leads the nation's foreign policy and is the supreme commander of the Finnish Defence Forces.[1] Finland's head of government is the Prime Minister, who leads the nation's executive branch, called the Finnish Government.[2] Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Finland (, ),[3] and the Government has limited rights to amend or extend legislation. Because the Constitution of Finland vests power to both the President and Government, the President has veto power over parliamentary decisions, although this power can be overruled by a majority vote in the Parliament.[4]
