The __ (German for "March on the (river) Drava") was a historical territory of the Holy Roman Empire and its predecessors during the Middle Ages. It came into being during the second half of the 10th century, covering an area from the eastern border of the Carolingian Carantanian __ of (that is, the Drava valley between the mouth of the Vellach and Schwabegg) to Pettau (modern Ptuj) in the territory of Friedau (Ormo≈æ). After 1147 it was attached to the __ forming the March of Styria/Carantania, which later gave rise to the Duchy of Styria. Other designations for the territory include __ ('March of Pettau'), __ ('March beyond the Drava forest'), __ ('County beyond the Drava forest'), __,[1] __,[2] and __ ('lower Carantanian March').
