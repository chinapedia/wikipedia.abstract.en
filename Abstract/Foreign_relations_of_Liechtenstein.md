Honorary_Consulate_of_Mexico_in_Liechtenstein.JPG Maltese_Consulate,_Schaan_(1Y7A2240).jpg Liechtenstein's foreign economic policy has been dominated by its customs union with Switzerland (and with Austria-Hungary until World War I). This union also led to its independent membership in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1991. Unlike Switzerland however (where citizens rejected membership in a referendum), Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area.
