TONE POLICING (also TONE TROLLING, TONE ARGUMENT, and TONE FALLACY) is an _ad hominem_ (personal attack) and antidebate tactic based on criticizing a person for expressing emotion. Tone policing detracts from the validity of a statement by attacking the tone in which it was presented rather than the message itself.
