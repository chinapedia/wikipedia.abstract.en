MARVELOUS MAUREEN is a comic book character created by Lori Walls[1] who appeared in comics published by Archie Comics. She first appeared in _Pep Comics_ #383 (Apr. 1982). Her adventures were all scripted and penciled by Walls, with most stories being inked by Jon D'Agostino. Marvelous Maureen's adventures are in the vein of a humorous science fiction soap opera, with an ongoing storyline that ultimately stretched over twenty episodes.[2] Trina Robbins & Catherine Yronwode described the Marvelous Maureen stories as "light-hearted and fanciful," but ultimately felt that the feature bore "little resemblance to the Archie school humor-style."[3] After appearing in almost every issue of _Pep_ from Apr. 1982 to Sept. 1985, the character never appeared again.
