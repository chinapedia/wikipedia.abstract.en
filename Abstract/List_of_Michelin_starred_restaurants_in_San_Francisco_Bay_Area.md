This article contains a complete LIST OF MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANTS IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA and Northern California since 2007. The San Francisco guide was the second North American city chosen to have its own Michelin Guide. Unlike the other US guides which focus mainly in the city proper, the San Francisco guide includes all the major cities in the Bay Area: San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and Berkeley, as well as Wine Country, which includes Napa and Sonoma.[1] In 2019, the guide was expanded to cover the whole state of California.[2]
