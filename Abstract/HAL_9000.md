HAL 9000 is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Arthur C. Clarke's _Space Odyssey_ series. First appearing in the 1968 film _2001: A Space Odyssey_, HAL (Heuristically Programmed ALgorithmic Computer) is a sentient computer (or artificial general intelligence) that controls the systems of the _DiscoveryÂ One_ spacecraft and interacts with the ship's astronaut crew. Part of HAL's hardware is shown toward the end of the film, but he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red or yellow dot, instances of which are located throughout the ship. HAL 9000 is voiced by Douglas Rain in the two feature film adaptations of the _Space Odyssey_ series. HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and a conversational manner, in contrast to the crewmen, David Bowman and Frank Poole.
