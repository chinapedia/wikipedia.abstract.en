The PROCTOR MAPLE RESEARCH CENTER is an agricultural research center of the University of Vermont specializing in the study of sugar maples, particularly with respect to the production of sap for use in maple syrup. It is the only facility of this type in the United States. Its facilities are located on Harvey Road in Underhill, Vermont, on a rural property previously known as the HARVEY FARM, given to the state in 1946 by Governor of Vermont Mortimer Proctor. The center's early facilities and century-old sugar bush are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1]
