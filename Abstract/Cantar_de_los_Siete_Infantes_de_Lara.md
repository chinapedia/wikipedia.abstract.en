The legend survives in prose form in medieval chronicles, the oldest being in the extended version of the _Estoria de España_ (History of Spain) compiles during the reign of Sancho IV of Castile, before 1289 (edited by Ramón Menéndez Pidal under the name _Primera Crónica General_).[1] From the account found in this chronicle as well as mention in the _Crónica de 1344_ (_Segunda Crónica General_) and interpolations into a copy of the _Tercera Crónica General_ dating from 1512, Menéndez Pidal found evidence for the existence of an ancient _cantar de gesta_, lost but partially reconstructed, dating back to the year 1000, that would, along with the _Cantar de Mio Cid_ and the _Poema de Fernán González_, represent one of the most important epic _cantares_ of Castilian literature, and the most primitive example of the Spanish epic. The legendary tradition of the _Infantes de Lara_ has also been developed though ballads. Some more recent scholars have rejected this, dating the story to shortly before the surviving prose versions.[2] The _Infantes de Lara_ were the children of Castilian nobleman Gonzalo Gustioz of Lara or Salas and his wife "_Doña Sancha_" (lady Sancha). The story revolves around a family feud, an escalating tit-for-tat cycle of revenge, between their family and that of Sancha's brother, Ruy Velázquez and his wife _Doña_ Lambra.[3]Barton, pp. 137–138
