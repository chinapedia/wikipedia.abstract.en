HOSHIN KANRI (Japanese: 方針管理, "policy management")[1] is a 7-step process used in strategic planning in which strategic goals are communicated throughout the company and then put into action.[2][3] The Hoshin Kanri strategic planning system originated from post-war Japan, but has since spread to the U.S. and around the world.[4][5] Translated from Japanese, Hoshin Kanri aptly means "compass management".[6] The individual words "hoshin" and "kanri" mean direction and administration, respectively.[7]
