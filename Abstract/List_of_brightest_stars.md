This is a list of stars down to magnitude +2.50, as determined by their _maximum_, _total_, or _combined_ visual magnitudes as viewed from Earth. Although several of the brightest stars are known binary or multiple star systems and are relatively close to Earth, they appear to the naked eye as single stars. The list below combines/adds the magnitudes of bright individual components. Most of the proper names in this list are those approved by the Working Group on Star Names.[1] Popular star names here that have not been approved by the IAU appear with a short note.
