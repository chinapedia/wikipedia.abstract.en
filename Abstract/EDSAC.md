The ELECTRONIC DELAY STORAGE AUTOMATIC CALCULATOR (EDSAC) was an early British computer.[1] Inspired by John von Neumann's seminal _First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC_, the machine was constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service.[2]
