_THE ROCK SHOW_ was a musical theatrical production which toured Australia between 2009 and 2012. Created by Stuart Smith, the production starred Smith, Jon English, Isaac Hayward, Paul Toole, Amy Vee, Andrew Sampford, Joe Kalou, Shaun Tarring, Kita Kerford, Natalya Bing and Jonathan Sora-English. The production was a tribute to rock music from 1965 to 1980, and contained tracks originally recorded by AC/DC, Bob Dylan, The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and David Bowie among many other artists from the time period. English said, "I'm amazingly proud to be a part of this show. People come along to see me, not really knowing what to expect, but invariably leave saying they are just blown away by the world class young talent on stage."[1]
