ETA (; ), an acronym for EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA (; "Basque Homeland and Liberty"[1] or "Basque Country and Freedom"[2]) was an armed leftist Basque nationalist and separatist organization in the Basque Country (in northern Spain and southwestern France). The group was founded in 1959 and later evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group engaged in a violent campaign of bombing, assassinations and kidnappings in the Southern Basque Country and throughout Spanish territory. Its goal was gaining independence for the Basque Country.[3][4] ETA was the main group within the Basque National Liberation Movement and was the most important Basque participant in the Basque conflict.
