BIPOLAR DISORDER, previously known as MANIC DEPRESSION, is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood.[1][2][3] The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present.[4] During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable.[5] Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences.[6] The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases.[7] During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.[8] The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30â€“40 percent.[9] Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated with bipolar disorder.[10]
