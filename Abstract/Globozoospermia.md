GLOBOZOOSPERMIA is a rare and severe form of monomorphic teratozoospermia. This means that the spermatozoa show the same abnormality, and over 85% of spermatozoa in sperm have this abnormality.[1] Globozoospermia is responsible for less than 0.1% of male infertility.[2] It characterised by round-headed spermatozoa without acrosome, an abnormal nuclear membrane and midpiece defects.[3] Affected males therefore suffer from either reduced fertility or infertility.[4] Studies suggest that globozoospermia can be either total (100% round-headed spermatozoa without acrosomes) or partial (20-60% round acrosomeless spermatozoa with normal sperm also identified in the sperm count,[5]) however it is unclear whether these two forms are variations on the same syndrome, or actually different syndromes.[6]
