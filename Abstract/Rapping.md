Myl3z_raps_in_a_garage_-_July_-_2019.jpg RAPPING (or RHYMING, SPITTING,[1] EMCEEING, MCING) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular",[2] which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.[3] The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track.[4] Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians",[5] or "praise-singers",[6] would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to "praise or critique individuals."[7] Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets.[8] Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum",[9] and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies.[10] The person credited with originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music",[11] that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from Harlem, New York.[12]
