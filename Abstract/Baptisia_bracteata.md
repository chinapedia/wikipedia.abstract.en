_BAPTISIA BRACTEATA_, otherwise known as LONGBRACT WILD INDIGO,[1] LONG-BRACT WILD INDIGO, LONG-BRACTED WILD INDIGO, or CREAM FALSE INDIGO, is a perennial herbaceous plant that is native to the central and eastern United States.[2] It is one of the earliest blooming species of _Baptisia_, beginning to bloom in March in certain areas of the United States.[3] The bloom color ranges from white to creamy yellow.[4] The flower clusters (racemes) spread out sideways or sprawl across the ground, unlike most other _Baptisia_ species, which have vertical racemes. The flowers are visited by bumblebees.[5] The caterpillars of several skippers eat the leaves, including the wild indigo duskywing and hoary edge. The plant is poisonous to mammalian herbivores.[6]
