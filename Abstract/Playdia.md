The (developed under the codename "BA-X"[1]) is a home video game console released exclusively in Japan in 1994[2] at the initial price of Â¥24,800.[3] It was intended for a young audience and, like many consoles of the era (e.g. the LaserActive and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer), was marketed more as a multimedia home entertainment system than as a dedicated gaming console,[4] with anime quiz software and edutainment making up most of the game library. The Playdia uses a single infrared joypad with simple controls. Bandai, the Playdia's manufacturer, was the only software publisher to support this console (except for VAP who published _Ie Naki Ko - Suzu no Sentaku_ instead of Bandai).
