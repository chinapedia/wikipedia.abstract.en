143 HIGHLAND AVENUE is a well-preserved late 19th-century tenement house in the town of Hardwick, Vermont. It was built about 1889 to serve as housing for workers in the area's granite quarries, and preserves a number of the utilitarian features that characterize these types of worker housing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[1]
