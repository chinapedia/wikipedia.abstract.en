In computing, an APPLET is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in.[1] The term is frequently used to refer to a Java applet, a program written in the Java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page. Applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's attention. Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible.
