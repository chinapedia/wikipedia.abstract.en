BAYFIELD HALL is a Grade II*[1] listed building which stands in a small estate close to the village of Letheringsett and the hamlet of Glandford in the English county of Norfolk within the United Kingdom.[2] The house that stands today was built in the last part of the 18 century[3] replacing an earlier manor house thought to have been built in the 16 century. That house had been constructed of an early medieval manor house.
