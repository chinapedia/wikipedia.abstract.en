11-KETODIHYDROTESTOSTERONE (11-KDHT), also known as 5Α-ANDROSTAN-17Β-OL-3,11-DIONE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring steroid and androgen prohormone that is produced primarily, if not exclusively, in the adrenal glands.[1] It is closely related to 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11β-KA4), adrenosterone (11-ketoandrostenedione; 11-KA4), and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), which are also produced in the adrenal glands.[2]
