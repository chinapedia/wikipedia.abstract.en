THE DODO is a fictional character appearing in Chapters 2 and 3 of the book _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). The Dodo is a caricature of the author. A popular but unsubstantiated belief is that Dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer, and thus would accidentally introduce himself as "Do-do-dodgson".
