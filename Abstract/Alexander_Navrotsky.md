ALEXANDER ALEXANDRROVICH NAVROTSKY (, 13 March 1839 – 10 June 1914) was a Russian writer, poet and playwright, known also under his pen name N. A. VROTSKY. His best-known poem, "The Stenka Razin Cliff" (Утёс Стеньки Разина), set to music by himself, became popular among Russian revolutionaries in the late 19th-early 20th century and is now considered part of Russian musical folklore.[1]
