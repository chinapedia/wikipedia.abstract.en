Stickmuster_1735.jpg, Germany]] Modern_cross_stitching_by_Caterpillar_Cross_Stitch.jpg CROSS-STITCH is a form of sewing and a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called COUNTED CROSS-STITCH in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch.[1] Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (STAMPED CROSS-STITCH); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.[2] Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth[3] whose weave creates a plainly visible grid of squares with holes for the needle at each corner.
