DACTYLIC HEXAMETER (also known as "heroic hexameter" and "the meter of epic") is a form of meter or rhythmic scheme in poetry. It is traditionally associated with the quantitative meter of classical epic poetry in both Greek and Latin and was consequently considered to be _the_ grand style of Western classical poetry. Some premier examples of its use are Homer's _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, Virgil's _Aeneid_, and Ovid's _Metamorphoses_. Hexameters also form part of elegiac poetry in both languages, alternating with dactylic pentameters.
