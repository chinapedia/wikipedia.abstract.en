Magnetic_Drilling_Machine_From_BDS_Maschinen.jpg A MAGNETIC DRILLING MACHINE is a portable drilling machine with a magnetic base (either electromagnetic or permanent magnet). It can use twist drill bits, annular cutters, milling cutters, and other rotary cutters. With suitable bits it can also tap threads, ream, and countersink. Its combination of a stable magnetic base and low RPMs help resist or reduce torque forces created by large diameter bits.[1]
