SAINTS CYRIL AND METHODIUS (826–869, 815–885; (_Kýrillos kaí Methódios_), Old Church Slavonic: Кѷриллъ и Меѳодїи) were two brothers who were Byzantine Christian theologians and Christian missionaries. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title "_Apostles to the Slavs_".[1] They are credited with devising the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet used to transcribe Old Church Slavonic.[2] After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Orthodox Church as saints with the title of "_equal-to-apostles_". In 1880, Pope Leo XIII introduced their feast into the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1980, Pope John Paul II declared them co-patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia.[3]
