STEAMBOAT ROCK CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS BUILDING, also known as the STEAMBOAT ROCK COMMUNITY SCHOOL, is a historic building located in Steamboat Rock, Iowa, United States. The first school in town was a one-room school that opened a year after the town was platted in 1855. A two-story brick school building was completed in 1869. Beginning in 1919 rural school districts began to merge with the Steamboat Rock district, which began to substantially increase the student population.[1] The main part of this school building was completed in 1928. The gymnasium/music room/shop building was added in 1956 to accommodate the post World War II baby boom. As the 20th century continued the population in rural areas declined, which affected enrollment.[2] The Steamboat Rock School merged with the Wellsburg and Ackley-Geneva districts in 1997, and this building was left empty. The city acquired it in 1999, and it now houses a variety of retail businesses and offices. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[3]
