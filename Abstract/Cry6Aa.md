CRY6AA is a toxic crystal protein generated by the bacterial family _Bacillus thuringiensis_ during sporulation.[1] This protein is a member of the alpha pore forming toxins family, which gives it insecticidal qualities advantageous in agricultural pest control. Each Cry protein has some level of target specificity; Cry6Aa has specific toxic action against coleopteran insects and nematodes. The corresponding _B. thuringiensis_ gene, _cry6aa_, is located on bacterial plasmids. Along with several other Cry protein genes, _cry6aa_ can be genetically recombined in Bt corn and Bt cotton so the plants produce specific toxins. Insects are developing resistance to the most commonly inserted proteins like Cry1Ac.[2] Since Cry6Aa proteins function differently than other Cry proteins, they are combined with other proteins to decrease the development of pest resistance. Recent studies suggest this protein functions better in combination with other virulence factors such as other Cry proteins and metalloproteinases.[3][4] Crystal_structure_of_Cry6Aa_toxin.gif
