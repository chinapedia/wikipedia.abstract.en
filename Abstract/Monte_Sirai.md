MONTE SIRAI is an archaeological site near Carbonia, in the province of South Sardinia, Sardinia, Italy. It's a settlement built at the top of a hill by the Phoenicians of Sulci (today's Sant'Antioco). The history of studies in Monte Sirai has a very precise date: the fall of 1962, when a local boy casually found a female figure carved on a stele of the tophet. Following further inspections, in August 1963, the local Soprintendenza and the Institute of Near Eastern Studies of the Sapienza University of Rome started excavations,[1] leading to a fairly comprehensive study of the entire town.
