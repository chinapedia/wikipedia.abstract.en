MOCTEZUMA II (c. 1466 – 29 June 1520), variant spellings include MONTEZUMA, MOTEUCZOMA, MOTECUHZOMA, MOTĒUCZŌMAH, MUTECZUMA, and referred to in full by early Nahuatl texts as MOTECUHZOMA XOCOYOTZIN (_Moctezuma the Younger_, ),[1] was the ninth _tlatoani_ or ruler of Tenochtitlán, reigning from 1502 to 1520. The first contact between indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica and Europeans took place during his reign, and he was killed during the initial stages of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, when conquistador Hernán Cortés and his men fought to take over the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan.
