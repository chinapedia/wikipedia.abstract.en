16Α-LE2, or 16Α-LACTONE-ESTRADIOL, also known as 3,17Β-DIHYDROXY-19-NOR-17Α-PREGNA-1,3,5-(10)-TRIENE-21,16Α-LACTONE, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen featuring a estradiol core. It is a highly potent and selective agonist of the ERα that is used in scientific research to study the function of the ERα.[1][2] It has 265-fold higher potency in transactivation assays of the ERα relative to the ERβ and 70-fold preference in binding affinity for the ERα over the ERβ.[3]
