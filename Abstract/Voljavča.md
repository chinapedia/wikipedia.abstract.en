Voljavca.jpg VOLJAVČA () is a Serbian Orthodox monastery situated in a dense forest near the Voljavča creek on the northeastern slope of the Rudnik, near the village of Stragari in central Serbia. The monastery church, dedicated to saints Michael and Gabriel, was an endowment of Mihailo Končinović, a nobleman of Despot Stefan Lazarević (r. 1402–27), reconstructed at the beginning of the 15th century on the ruins of an older church dating to 1050.
