_CASTLE OF THE WINDS_ (also known as "Castle of the Winds: Vanquish the Dark Forces")[1] is a tile-based roguelike video game for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by Rick Saada in 1989[2] and distributed by Epic MegaGames in 1993.[3] The game was given around 1998 into the public domain and provided as Freeware download by the author.[4][5] Though it is secondary to its hack and slash gameplay, _Castle of the Winds_ has a plot loosely based on Norse mythology, told with setting changes, unique items, and occasional passages of text. The game is composed of two parts: _A QUESTION OF VENGEANCE_, released as shareware, and _LIFTHRANSIR'S BANE_, sold commercially. A combined license for both parts was also sold.
