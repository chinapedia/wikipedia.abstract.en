The KANDAHAR STATE RAILWAY opened c.1881, originally ran from Sibi and then on wards to Rindli, with the intention to reaching Quetta and onwards to Kandahar.[1] However, the line never reached Quetta.[2] The Kandahar State Railway joined with the southern section of the Sindâ€“Pishin State Railway and in 1886 amalgamated, with other railways, to form North Western State Railway (NWR).
