The BAYKONURIAN GLACIATION is a glacial episode dating to around the Proterozoic–Phanerozoic boundary – precise dates are difficult to constrain but has been proposed — and thus posited as a contributor to the Cambrian explosion. Its deposits are known in regions of Asia and Africa, and it apparently affected both palaeohemispheres. It is named for the Baykonur Formation in Central Asia.[1][2][3][4]
