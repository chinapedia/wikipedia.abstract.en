ONE PLAYER TO A HAND is an important poker rule designed to promote fair play that is universally applied in casino play. It states that all game decisions about the play of each hand must be made by one player without any assistance. This means, for example, that a player may not ask for advice from any other player or non-player during the play of the hand, nor should anyone offer such advice.[1] The phrase is often used as a warning to players making what might be perceived as minor violations, such as commenting upon other players' possible hands.
