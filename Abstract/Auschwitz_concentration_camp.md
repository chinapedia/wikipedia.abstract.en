The AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP (_Konzentrationslager Auschwitz_) was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust. It consisted of Auschwitz I, the main camp (_Stammlager_) and administrative headquarters in Oświęcim; Auschwitz II–Birkenau, a combined concentration and extermination camp three kilometers away in Brzezinka; , a labor camp created to staff an IG Farben synthetic-rubber factory; and dozens of other subcamps.[1]
