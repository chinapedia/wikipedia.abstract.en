The R-1 VISA is a non-immigrant visa which allows travel to United States for service as a minister or other religious occupation.[1] The institution must be a registered non-profit organization in the United States, or authorized for the use of a group tax exemption.[2] The individual must have worked for at least the preceding two years as a member of a religious denomination, and work at least 20 hours a week for the institution while in the US.[3][4] In addition to clergy, religious brothers, religious sisters, and lay missioners may receive visas.[5]
