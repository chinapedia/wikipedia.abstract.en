ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY is the aspect of Islamic theology concerning ideas of life after death, matters of the soul, and the "Day of Judgement," known as _Yawm al-Qiyāmah_ (, , "the Day of Resurrection") or _Yawm ad-Dīn_ (, , "the Day of Judgment").[1] The Day of Judgement is characterized by the annihilation of all life, which will then be followed by the resurrection and judgment by God. It is not specified when al-Qiyamah will happen, but according to prophecy elaborated by hadith-literature, there are major and minor signs that will foretell its coming.[2][3] Multiple verses in the Qur'an mention the Last Judgment.[4][5]
