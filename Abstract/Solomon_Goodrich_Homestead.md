The SOLOMON GOODRICH HOMESTEAD is a historic house at 4787 Ethan Allen Highway (United States Route 7) in Georgia, Vermont. With its oldest section dating to the late 1780s, it is one of the community's oldest surviving buildings. Its later and more prominent brick front is a good early example of Federal period architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[1]
