_SPAIN IN FLAMES_ is a 1937 compilation film made by Helen van Dongen during the Spanish Civil War.[1] Hal Erickson has written that the film "... is remarkable in its willingness to offer both sides of the conflict -- though its sympathies are firmly with the Loyalists."[2] The film consists of two parts. The first, "The Fight for Freedom", was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary _Spain and the Fight for Freedom_.[3]
