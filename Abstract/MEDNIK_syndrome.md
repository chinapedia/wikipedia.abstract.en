MEDNIK SYNDROME (OMIM#609313)[1], also known as "syndrome de Kamouraska" (syndrome from Kamouraska), is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations to the AP1S1 gene. Transmission of the disease is believed to be autosomal recessive. Symptoms of the syndrome are intellectual disability, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (MEDNIK).[2][3] The disorder was discovered by Dr. Patrick Cossette and his research team from the Université de Montréal. MEDNIK syndrome was initially reported in a few French-Canadian families near Quebec who all shared common ancestors.[4]
