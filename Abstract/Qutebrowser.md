QUTEBROWSER (pronounced "cute browser") is a web browser for Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems with vim-style key bindings and a minimal GUI.[1] It is keyboard-driven and is inspired by similar software such as Vimperator and dwb.[2] It uses DuckDuckGo as the default search engine. Qutebrowser is included in the native repositories of Linux distributions such as Fedora and Arch Linux.[3]
