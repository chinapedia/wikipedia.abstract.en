Two rounds of a GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION were held in Jakarta as part of the 2017 simultaneous elections on 15 February and 19 April 2017 to elect the Governor of Jakarta to a five-year term. Incumbent governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly referred to as "Ahok", and his deputy Djarot Saiful Hidayat were running for re-election to a second term. Basuki, who inherited his current position from his running mate Joko Widodo when he won the 2014 Indonesian presidential election, would have become the first elected Chinese-Christian governor of Jakarta had he won.
