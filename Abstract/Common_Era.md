COMMON ERA (CE) is one of the notation systems for the world's most widely used calendar era. BCE (BEFORE THE COMMON ERA or BEFORE THE CURRENT ERA) is the era before CE. BCE and CE are alternatives to the Dionysian BC and AD system respectively. The Dionysian era distinguishes eras using AD (__, "[the] year of [the] Lord")[1] and BC ("before Christ"). Since the two notation systems are numerically equivalent, " CE" corresponds to "AD " and "400 BCE" corresponds to "400 BC".[2][3][4] Both notations refer to the Gregorian calendar (and its predecessor, the Julian calendar). The year-numbering system used by the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world today, and is an international standard for civil calendars.[5]
