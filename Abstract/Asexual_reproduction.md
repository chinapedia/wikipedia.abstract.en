caduco.jpg: a caducous phylloid germinating]] ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION[1] is a type of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes, and almost never changes the number of chromosomes. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as archaea and bacteria. Many plants and fungi sometimes reproduce asexually. Some asexual cells die when they are very young.
