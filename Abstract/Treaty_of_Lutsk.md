The TREATY OF THE LUTSK was a secret agreement signed in Lutsk, Poland-Lithuania (now in Ukraine) between the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Protectorate of Moldavia on 13 April 1711, shortly after the outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1710â€“11, by which the Ottoman Protectorate of Kara Bogdan (Moldavia) supported Russia in its war against the Ottomans with troops, and by allowing the Russian army to cross its territory and place garrisons in Moldavian fortresses.[1] The Moldavian party was represented by the Metropolitan of Moldavia Ghedeon. The text of the treaty was elaborated entirely by Ottoman Hospodar Dimitrie Cantemir former musician of the Sultan.[2] who broke his oath to the Sultan and promised to become the suzeran of the Russian Tsar.
