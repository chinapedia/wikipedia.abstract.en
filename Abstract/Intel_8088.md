The INTEL 8088 ("_eighty-eighty-eight_", also called IAPX 88)[1][2][3] microprocessor is a variant of the Intel 8086. Introduced on June 1, 1979,[4][5][6][7] the 8088 had an eight-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086. The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged, however. In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit (EU)â€”only the bus interface unit (BIU) is different. The original IBM PC was based on the 8088, as were its clones.
