The ULM EINSATZKOMMANDO TRIAL (1958) was the first major trial of Nazi crimes under West German law (rather than by an international or military tribunal). Ten suspects, former members of the Einsatzkommando _Tilsit_, were charged for their involvement in war crimes committed in Lithuania in 1941.[1] All were convicted as accessories to mass murder and sentenced to various terms in prison, the chief perpetrators being held to be those from whom the orders had come down.[2]
