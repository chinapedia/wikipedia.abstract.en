RISK CONTROL STRATEGIES are the defensive measures utilized by IT and InfoSec communities to limit vulnerabilities and manage risks to an acceptable level. There are a number of strategies that can be employed as one measure of defense or in a combination of multiple strategies together. A risk assessment is an important tool that should be incorporated in the process of identifying and determining the threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact resources and assets to help manage risk. Risk management is also a component of a risk control strategy because Nelson et al. (2015) state that "risk management involves determining how much risk is acceptable for any process or operation, such as replacing equipment".[1]
