SIR CHARLES LYELL, 1ST BARONET, (14 November 1797 – 22 February 1875) was a Scottish geologist who demonstrated the power of existing natural causes in explaining Earth history. He is best known as the author of _Principles of Geology_ (1830-33 and later editions), which presented for a wide public audience the idea that the Earth was shaped by the same natural processes still in operation today, operating at similar intensities. The philosopher William Whewell termed this gradualistic view "uniformitarianism" and contrasted it with catastrophism, which had been championed by Georges Cuvier and was better accepted in Europe. The combination of evidence and eloquence in _Principles_ convinced a wide range of readers of the significance of "deep time" for understanding the Earth and environment.[1]
