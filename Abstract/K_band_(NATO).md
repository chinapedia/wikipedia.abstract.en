EHF (ITU)}} }} The NATO K BAND is the obsolete designation given to the radio frequencies from 20 to 40 GHz (equivalent to wavelengths between 1.5 and 0.75Â cm) during the cold war period. Since 1992 frequency allocations, allotment and assignments are in line to NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).[1] However, in order to identify military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for crises management planning, training, electronic warfare activities, or in military operations, this system is still in use.
