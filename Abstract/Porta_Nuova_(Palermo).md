It represents the entrance of the Cassaro (the main and most ancient street of the city) from Corso Calatafimi (the way to Monreale) and is located beside Palazzo dei Normanni, royal palace of Palermo. The gate was built to celebrate the Charles V's conquest of Tunis (1535) and his visit to the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily.[1]
