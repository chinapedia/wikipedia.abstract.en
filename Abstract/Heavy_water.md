HEAVY WATER (DEUTERIUM OXIDE, , ) is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium ( or D, also known as _heavy hydrogen_), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope ( or H, also called protium) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water.[1] The presence of deuterium gives the water different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it slightly different physical and chemical properties when compared to normal water.
