RUPERT STANLEY TRIMMINGHAM (August 17, 1899 â€“ May 9, 1985) was a corporal in the United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War II who is noted for writing a letter that was published in _Yank, the Army Weekly_ that attracted wide attention to the plight of black American soldiers in World War II. It was an early step in the process that, along with other publicized outrages involving black American soldiers, eventually resulted in President Harry S. Truman issuing Executive Order 9981, which desegregated the United State armed forces. Beginning within months of publication, the letter has been an inspiration for literature and the performing arts highlighting racial inequality.
