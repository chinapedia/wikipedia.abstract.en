WMAP_2010.png image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation]] ANISOTROPY () is the property of being directionally dependent, which implies different properties in different directions, as opposed to isotropy. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)
