The _KOTO_ () is a Japanese stringed musical instrument derived from the Chinese , and similar to the Mongolian , the Korean , and the Vietnamese . The koto is the national instrument of Japan.[1] Koto are about length, and made from _kiri_ wood (_Paulownia tomentosa_). They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument. There is also a 17-string variant. Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing. To play the instrument, the strings are plucked using three finger picks (thumb, index finger, and middle finger).[2]
