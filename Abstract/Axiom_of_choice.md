of sets indexed over the real numbers R; that is, there is a set S_(_i_) for each real number _i_, with a small sample shown above. Each set contains at least one, and possibly infinitely many, elements. The axiom of choice allows us to arbitrarily select a single element from each set, forming a corresponding family of elements (_x__(_i_)) also indexed over the real numbers, with _x__(_i_) drawn from S_(_i_). In general, the collections may be indexed over any set _I_, not just R.]]
