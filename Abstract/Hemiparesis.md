HEMIPARESIS, or unilateral paresis, is weakness of one entire side of the body (_hemi-_ means "half"). HEMIPLEGIA is, in its most severe form, complete paralysis of half of the body. Hemiparesis and hemiplegia can be caused by different medical conditions, including congenital causes, trauma, tumors, or stroke.[1]
