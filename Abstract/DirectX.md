MICROSOFT DIRECTX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. The name _DirectX_ was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the _X_ standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the _X_ was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology.[1] The _X_ initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.
