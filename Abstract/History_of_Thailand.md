The Thai people, who originally lived in southwestern China, migrated into mainland Southeast Asia over a period of many centuries. The word _Siam_ ( ) may have originated from Pali (_suvaṇṇabhūmi_, "land of gold") or Sanskrit श्याम (_śyāma_, “dark”) or Mon ရာမည (_rhmañña_, "stranger"), probably the same root as Shan and Ahom. was the name for the northern kingdom centred on Sukhothai and Sawankhalok, but to the Thai themselves, the name of the country has always been _Mueang Thai_.[1]
