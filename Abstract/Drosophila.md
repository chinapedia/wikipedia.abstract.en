_DROSOPHILA_ () is a genus of flies, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or (less frequently) pomace flies, vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as "true fruit flies"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly. One species of _Drosophila_ in particular, _D. melanogaster_, has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The terms "fruit fly" and "_Drosophila_" are often used synonymously with _D. melanogaster_ in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species[1] and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.
