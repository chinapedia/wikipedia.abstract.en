DISTILLERY FOOTBALL CLUB was an Irish association football club originally based on Distillery Road in Drumcondra, Dublin. [1] The club was active during the 1930s and 1940s, fielding teams in both the Leinster Senior League [2] and the Athletic Union League.[3] They also competed in the FAI Cup, the FAI Intermediate Cup, the FAI Junior Cup and the Leinster Senior Cup, winning the three latter trophies. [4][5][6][7] Despite their successes at intermediate and junior level, unlike their contemporaries Sligo Rovers and St Patrick's Athletic, Distillery never joined the League of Ireland.
