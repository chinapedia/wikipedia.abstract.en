The CHURCH OF THE CARPENTER was a mission of the Episcopal Church associated with the Society of Christian Socialists in Boston. Its congregation was known as the BROTHERHOOD OF THE CARPENTER. Founded in 1890 by the Reverend William Dwight Porter Bliss, the church sought to promote the cause of economic justice and influenced many of its members to take an active interest in the labor movement. Notable members included educator and activist Vida Dutton Scudder, sculptor Anne Whitney, novelist William Dean Howells, poet Robert Treat Paine, Jr., city planner Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, and photographer Francis Watts Lee.
