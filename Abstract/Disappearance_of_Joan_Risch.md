Late on the afternoon of October 24, 1961, police went to a house in Lincoln, Massachusetts, after a neighbor reported seeing blood leading from the house to the driveway. She had made the discovery after a young girl living in the house had returned from a playdate to find her mother, JOAN RISCH (born Joan Carolyn Bard; May 12, 1930)[1] absent. Several unconfirmed sightings of an apparently disoriented Risch walking on nearby roads later that day were reported.[2]
