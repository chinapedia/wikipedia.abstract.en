The INTERCOLLEGIATE CHINESE FOR SOCIAL ACTION (ICSA) was a student organization formed in 1967 at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). The group organized various community-oriented events and service projects, particularly in the Chinatown community in San Francisco.[1] In 1968, the ICSA joined the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), a coalition of different student groups advocating for campus reform at SFSU.[2] The ICSA also actively protested traditional Chinese leadership, in particular the Six Companies in San Francisco.[3]
