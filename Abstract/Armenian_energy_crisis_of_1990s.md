The ENERGY CRISIS IN ARMENIA, popularly known as the DARK AND COLD YEARS (), refers to the energy crisis in Armenia during the 1990s, when the newly-independent Armenia's population lived in shortage of energy and basic consumer goods. Although it only lasted 3-4 years, it left a deep impact and impression.[1] Local people have dubbed the years from 1992 to 1995 in different ways, such as "hungry", "cold", and "bad", but the most common title used is "the dark."
