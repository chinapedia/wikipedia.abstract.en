_THE BIG SPELL_ is a British game show which aired in January and February 2017 on Sky 1. The program is an adaptation of the Australian program _The Great Australian Spelling Bee_. It features 20 children aged between 9 and 13 competing in a series of spelling-related challenges, and delves into both the spellings and the meanings of various words. The show is hosted by Sue Perkins and Joe Lycett, with newsreader Moira Stuart the pronouncer.[1] The show was cancelled after one series.[2]
