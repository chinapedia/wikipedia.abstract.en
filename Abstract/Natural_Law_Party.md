The NATURAL LAW PARTY (NLP) is a transnational party founded in 1992 on "the principles of Transcendental Meditation",[1] the laws of nature, and their application to all levels of government.[2] At its peak, it was active in up to 74 countries; it continues in India and some parts of the United States. The party defines "natural law" as the organizing intelligence which governs the natural universe.[3] The Natural Law Party advocates using the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program as tools to enliven natural law and reduce or eliminate problems in society.[4]
