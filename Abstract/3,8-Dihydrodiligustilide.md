3,8-DIHYDRODILIGUSTILIDE is a nonsteroidal phytoprogestogen that is found in _Ligusticum chuanxiong_.[1][2] It is a potent agonist of the progesterone receptor (EC₅₀ = 90 nM).[3] Another compound in the plant, riligustilide, is also a phytoprogestogen, but is almost 1,000-fold less potent and is very weak in comparison (EC₅₀ ≈ 81 μM).[4]
