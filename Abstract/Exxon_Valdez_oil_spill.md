The _EXXON VALDEZ_ OIL SPILL occurred in Prince William Sound, Alaska, March 24, 1989, when _Exxon Valdez_, an oil tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company, bound for Long Beach, California, struck Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef, west of Tatitlek, Alaska, at 12:04Â a.m.[1][2] local time and spilled (or 37,000 metric tonnes)[3] of crude oil over the next few days.[4] It is considered to be one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters.[5] The _Valdez_ spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 _Deepwater Horizon_ oil spill, in terms of volume released.[6] Prince William Sound's remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing response plans. The region is a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds. The oil, originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, eventually affected of coastline, of which were heavily or moderately oiled.[7][8][9]
