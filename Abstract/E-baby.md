_E-BABY_ is a two-hander play written by Jane Cafarella that was premiered at Chapel Off Chapel in Melbourne in 2015. It is set over a 16-month period in 2015â€“16 and deals with two women going through gestational surrogacy, the genetic mother of the embryo created by _in vitro_ fertilisation, and the woman carrying the child. It has been described by Patricia Tobin as a "quietly feminist play that asserts a heartfelt approach towards matters of infertility, adoption and motherhood".[1]
