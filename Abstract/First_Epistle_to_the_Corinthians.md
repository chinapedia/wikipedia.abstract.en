The FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS (), usually referred to as FIRST CORINTHIANS or 1 CORINTHIANS is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle and a co-author named Sosthenes, and is addressed to the Christian church in Corinth. Scholars believe that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction.[1] Called "a masterpiece of pastoral theology",[2] it addresses various issues that had arisen in the Christian community at Corinth.
