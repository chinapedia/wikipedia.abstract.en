A MATHEMATICAL MODEL is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed MATHEMATICAL MODELING. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science).
