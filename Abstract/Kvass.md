KVASS (see List of names below) is a traditional fermented Slavic beverage commonly made from rye bread,[1] which is known in many Central and Eastern European and Asian[2][3] countries as "black bread". The colour of the bread used contributes to the colour of the resulting drink. Kvass is classified as a "non-alcoholic" drink by Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian standards, as the alcohol content from fermentation is typically low (0.5–1.0% or 1–2 proof).[4][5] It may be flavoured with fruits such as strawberries or raisins, or with herbs such as mint.[6]
