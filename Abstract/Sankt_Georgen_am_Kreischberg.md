SANKT GEORGEN AM KREISCHBERG is since 2015 a municipality in Murau District in Styria, Austria. It was created as part of the Styria municipal structural reform,[1] out of the former independent towns Sankt Georgen ob Murau und Sankt Ruprecht-Falkendorf. The town church after the changes, which began in November 2013, had continued the name "Sankt Georgen ob Murau", which was corrected through an amendment in April 2014.[2]
