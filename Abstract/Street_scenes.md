The STREET SCENES are a work of art by the artists Ernst Ludwig Kirchner made between 1913 and 1915. They are dubbed to be one of the most important works of German expressionism. It consists of eleven paintings, 32 pages from sketchbooks, 15 ink brush drawings, 17 pastel and chalk drawings, 14 woodcuts, 14 etchings and 8 lithographies. The work deals with the Berlin of the early 20th century and how it is developing into a metropolis. A lot of "Koketten" (prostitutes) are depicted as a metaphor for the hectic pace and sensuality of the growing city. There are also a lot of references to be found in the cycle.
