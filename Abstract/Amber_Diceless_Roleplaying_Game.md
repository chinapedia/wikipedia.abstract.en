The _AMBER DICELESS ROLEPLAYING GAME_ is a role-playing game created and written by Erick Wujcik, set in the fictional universe created by author Roger Zelazny for his _Chronicles of Amber_. The game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple diceless system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster, is used to determine how situations are resolved.[1][2]
