In the formal languages of computer science and linguistics, the CHOMSKY HIERARCHY (occasionally referred to as the CHOMSKY-SCHÜTZENBERGER HIERARCHY[1]) is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars. This hierarchy of grammars was described by Noam Chomsky in 1956.[2] It is also named after Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of formal languages.
