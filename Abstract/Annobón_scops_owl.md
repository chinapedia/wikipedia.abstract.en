The ANNOBÓN SCOPS OWL (_Otus feae_) is an owl endemic to the Equatorial Guinea island of Annobón. The current population is estimated to be around 50-249 individuals, with the population declining due to habitat alteration and destruction.[1] When describing the species in 1903, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the birds were abundant in wooded areas at altitudes of 400–500 metres on the island.[2] Few sightings of the bird have been reported since then.[3]
