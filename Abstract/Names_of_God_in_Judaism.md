The name of God most often used in the Hebrew Bible is the Tetragrammaton (YHWH ). It is frequently anglicized as Jehovah and Yahweh and written in most English editions of the Bible as "the " owing to the Jewish tradition increasingly viewing the divine name as too sacred to be uttered. It was thus replaced vocally in the synagogue ritual by the Hebrew word _Adonai_ (“My Lords”), which was translated as _Kyrios_ (“Lord”) in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures.[1]
