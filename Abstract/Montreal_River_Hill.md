MONTREAL RIVER HILL is a hill in Unorganized North Algoma District, Ontario, Canada, located north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario near the Montreal River.[1] Traversed by Ontario Highway 17,[2] the hill is simultaneously considered one of the best parts of the Trans-Canada Highway to drive in good weather due to its scenic vistas,[3] and one of the worst parts of the Trans-Canada Highway to drive in poor weather due to its long, steep grade.[4]
