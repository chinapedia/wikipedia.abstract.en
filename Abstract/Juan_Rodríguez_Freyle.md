JUAN RODRÍGUEZ FREYLE (also written as JUAN RODRÍGUEZ FREILE), (Bogotá, New Kingdom of Granada, 25 April 1566 - Bogotá, 1642) was an early writer in the New Kingdom of Granada, the Spanish colonial territory of what today is Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela. The son of a soldier in the army of Pedro de Ursúa, Rodríguez Freyle knew the _cacique_ of Guatavita and the founder of Bogotá: Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. His major work _El Carnero_ is a collection of stories, anecdotes and rumours about the early days of colonial Colombia and the demise of the Muisca Confederation. It is one of the most important sources for the sixteenth century colonial period of present-day Colombia.
