The ALNÖ COMPLEX or ALNÖ ALKALINE COMPLEX is a group of carbonatite and alkaline igneous rocks in Alnö in the eastern coast of central Sweden that intruded the basement in Late Ediacaran times.[1][2][3] The Alnö Complex is made up by a series of concentric dykes within a radius of 25 km of a main "central complex" of intrusions.[4] In addition the Alnö Complex proper is surrounded by a 500 to 600 m broad zone of metasomatic rock that was formed by metasomatic alteration of the existing Precambrian migmatite gneiss basement.[5][6] The specific type of metasomatic rock is referred by some authors as "fenite".[7][8] The dykes of the complex consist of carbonatite and alkaline rocks such melilite and sövite.[9]
