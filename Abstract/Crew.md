STS-112_crew.jpg.]] A CREW is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization. A location in which a crew works is called a CREWYARD or a WORKYARD[1]. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title _Crewman_.
