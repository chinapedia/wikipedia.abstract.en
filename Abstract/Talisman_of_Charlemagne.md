Talisman_de_Charlemagne_Tau.jpg Talisman_de_Charlemagne_6032.JPG The TALISMAN OF CHARLEMAGNE is a 9th-century Carolingian reliquary encolpion that may once have belonged to Charlemagne and is purported to contain a fragment of the True Cross. It is the only surviving piece of goldwork which can be connected with Charlemagne himself with some degree of probability, but the connection has been seriously questioned.[1] The talisman is now kept in Rheims in the Palace of Tau (inv.no. G 7).
