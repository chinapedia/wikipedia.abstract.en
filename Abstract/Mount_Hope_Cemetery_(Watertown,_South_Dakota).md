MOUNT HOPE CEMETERY is a municipal cemetery located at 11th Street East and 14th Avenue North, Watertown, South Dakota. Influenced by the 19th century rural cemetery movement, the 40-acres of land that would become the cemetery was purchased by the city from the Winona and St. Peter Railroad for $120. The earliest recorded burial was in 1881.[1] As of April 2017, there have been about 12,300 interments at Mount Hope.
