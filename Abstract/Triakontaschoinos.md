The TRIAKONTASCHOINOS (, "Land of the Thirty "_Schoinoi_"), Latinized as TRIACONTASCHOENUS, was a geographical and administrative term used in the Greco-Roman world for the part of Lower Nubia between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile. In the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, all or the northern part of this area, stretching from the First Cataract south to Maharraqa and known as the DODEKASCHOINOS (Δωδεκάσχοινος, "Land of the Twelve _Schoinoi_"), latinized as DODECASCHOENUS, was often annexed to Egypt or controlled from it. The terms TRIAKONTASCHOINOS and DODEKASCHOINOS were first found in the Ptolemaic period and denominate buffer zones between Egypt and later Rome on the one hand and Meroe on the other hand.
