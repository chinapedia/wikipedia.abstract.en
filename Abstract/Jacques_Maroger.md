JACQUES MAROGER (; 1884â€“1962) was a painter and the technical director of the Louvre Museum's laboratory in Paris. He devoted his life to understanding the oil-based media of the Old Masters. He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and became an influential teacher. His book, _The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters_, has been criticized by some modern writers on painting who say that the painting medium Maroger promoted is unsound.
