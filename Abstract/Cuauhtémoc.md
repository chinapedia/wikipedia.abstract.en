CUAUHTÉMOC (, also known as CUAUHTEMOTZÍN, GUATIMOZÍN or GUATÉMOC; c. 1495) was the Aztec ruler (_tlatoani_) of Tenochtitlan from 1520 to 1521, making him the last Aztec Emperor. The name Cuauhtemōc means "one who has descended like an eagle", and is commonly rendered in English as "Descending Eagle", as in the moment when an eagle folds its wings and plummets down to strike its prey. This is a name that implies aggressiveness and determination.
