The COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE PILL (COCP), often referred to as the BIRTH CONTROL PILL or colloquially as "THE PILL", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. It includes a combination of an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) and a progestogen (specifically a progestin). When taken correctly, it alters the menstrual cycle to eliminate ovulation and prevent pregnancy.
