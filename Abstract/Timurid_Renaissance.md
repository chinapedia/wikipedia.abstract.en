Timurid Renaissance reached its peak in the 15th century after the end of period of Mongol invasions and conquests. One of the symbols of the Timurid Renaissance is the rebuilding of the Samarkand by Timur. Samarkand, important Islamic center for scholarly study, was destroyed by Genghis Khan during the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia. Timur reign experienced revived interest in the classical Persian art. Large-scale building projects have been undertaken (mausoleums, madrasas, and kitabhane-medieval Islamic book workshops), mathematics and astronomy got more attention, and at the beginning of the 16th century mastering firearms was achieved. Major commissions from the Timur's lifetime were the Timur's Summer Palace in Shahrisabz, Bibi-Khanym Mosque, as well as reconstruction of the city of Samarkand itself.[4] The city of Herat became important center of intellectual and artistic life in the Islamic world during this time.[5] The fact that Samarkand and Herat were able to become the centers of Timurid Renaissance and Persian culture at that time in general is due to the destruction of Persian cities by previous wars.[6] Timurid Renaissance differed from the previous cultural and artistic developments during the Buyid dynasty in fact that it was not direct revival of classical models but it rather broaden the cultural appeal by including more colloquial style in Persian language as well as by including more widespread Turkic language as a literary and the official language.[7]
