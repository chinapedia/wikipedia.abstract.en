KINLICHEE, also known historically as KIN LI CHEE, KIN-LI-CHEE, or KIN-LI-CHEE, is a populated place situated in Apache County, Arizona, 6 miles north-northeast of Ganado.[1] The current name was officially recognized as a result of a decision by the Board on Geographic Names in 1983. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2] The name is derived from the Navajo _kin dah lichi'i_, which means "red house up at an elevation".[3]
