IN-GAME PHOTOGRAPHY (also known as SCREENSHOT ART, SCREENSHOT PHOTOGRAPHY and PROFESSIONAL GAMING PHOTOGRAPHY) is a form of new media art, which consists of photographing video game worlds. Screenshot photography has been featured in physical art galleries around the world. The validity and legality of this art form is sometimes questioned because in-game photographers are taking photos of artwork created by the game's designers and artists.[1] However, for the most part in-game photographers share the same motivations as "real life" photographers, including a desire to capture visually interesting images, preserve memories, and demonstrating technical expertise.[2]
