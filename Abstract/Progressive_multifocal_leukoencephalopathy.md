PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML) is a rare and often fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage (_-pathy_) or inflammation of the white matter (_leuko-_) of the brain (_-encephalo-_) at multiple locations (_multifocal_). It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system. The JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems. In general, PML has a mortality rate of 30â€“50% in the first few months, and those who survive can be left with varying degrees of neurological disabilities.
