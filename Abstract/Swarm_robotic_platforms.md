SWARM ROBOTIC PLATFORMS apply swarm robotics[1] in multi-robot collaboration.[2] They take inspiration from nature (e.g. collective problem solving mechanisms seen in nature such as honey bee aggregation[3][4]). The main goal is to control a large number of robots (with limited sensing/processing ability) to accomplish a common task/problem. Hardware limitation and cost of robot platforms limit current research in swarm robotics to mostly performed by simulation software (e.g. Stage,[5] ARGoS[6]). On the other hand, simulation of swarm scenarios that needs large numbers of agents is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to poor modelling of external conditions and limitation of computation.
