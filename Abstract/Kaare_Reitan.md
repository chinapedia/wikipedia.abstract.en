KAARE REITAN (8 August 1903 â€“ 8 October 2000) was a Norwegian Orthodontist who was instrumental in introducing through his histological research experiments the responses of tissues to orthodontic tooth movement. His experiments set a foundation for future research on the effects on surrounding tissues of teeth by the mechanical forces of orthodontics. He was a recipient of Albert H. Ketcham Award.[1]
