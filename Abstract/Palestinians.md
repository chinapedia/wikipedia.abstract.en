The PALESTINIAN PEOPLE (, _ash-sha‘b al-Filasṭīnī_), also referred to as PALESTINIANS (, _al-Filasṭīniyyūn_, ) or PALESTINIAN ARABS (, _ạl-flsṭynyyn ạl-ʿrb_), are an ethnonational group[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] comprising the modern descendants of the peoples who have lived in Palestine over the centuries, including Jews and Samaritans, and who today are largely culturally and linguistically Arab.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] Despite various wars and exoduses (such as that in 1948), roughly one half of the world's Palestinian population continues to reside in historic Palestine, the area encompassing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel.[16] In this combined area, , Palestinians constituted 49% of all inhabitants,[17] encompassing the entire population of the Gaza Strip (1.865 million),[18] the majority of the population of the West Bank (approximately 2,785,000 versus about 600,000 Jewish Israeli citizens, which includes about 200,000 in East Jerusalem) and 20.95% of the population of Israel proper as Arab citizens of Israel.[19][20] Many are Palestinian refugees or internally displaced Palestinians, including more than a million in the Gaza Strip,[21] about 750,000 in the West Bank[22] and about 250,000 in Israel proper. Of the Palestinian population who live abroad, known as the Palestinian diaspora, more than half are stateless, lacking citizenship in any country.[23] Between 2.1 and 3.24 million of the diaspora population live in neighboring Jordan,[24][25] over 1 million live between Syria and Lebanon and about 750,000 live in Saudi Arabia, with Chile's half a million representing the largest concentration outside the Middle East.
