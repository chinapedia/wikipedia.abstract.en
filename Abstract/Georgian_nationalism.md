Flag_of_Georgia.svg ]] The beginning of GEORGIAN NATIONALISM can be traced to the middle of the 19th century, when Georgia was part of the Russian Empire. From being more culture-focused in the Imperial Russian and Soviet periods, it went through several phases, evolving into radical ethnocentric in the late 1980s and early in the post-Soviet independence years, and to a more inclusive and civic-oriented form in the mid-1990s. However, vestiges of ethnic nationalism remain among many Georgians.[1]
