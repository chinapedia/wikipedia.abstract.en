The UNITED STATES NATIONAL KABADDI TEAM first competed at the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup in Ahmedabad, India. The squad was hastily formed just prior to the tournament, and consisted primarily of Florida A&M University graduates who were experienced in other sports, but were unfamiliar with the sport of kabaddi.[1][2] Although the team lost all five of its group stage matches, the team was acknowledged by the media for their enthusiasm over the sport and their participation.[3][4]
