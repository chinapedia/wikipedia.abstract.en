The 20th season of _Arthur_ began broadcast on PBS in the United States on October 10, 2016, and finished on June 1, 2017. In this season, Oasis Animation took over animation from 9 Story Media Group, and reduced the number of episodes to 7 instead of the usual 10. This is the shortest season of the series, lacking the usual number of 10 episodes that has been the number of episodes in every season since season 4.
