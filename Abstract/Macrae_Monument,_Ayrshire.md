James Macrae (1677–1746) was most likely born in the parish of Ochiltree[1] and escaped great poverty to become a sea captain and later an administrator who served as the Governor of Fort St George and in 1725 Governor of the Madras Presidency, modern day Chennai.[2] He encountered the pirate Edward England and was noted for reforming the administration of Madras Presidency on behalf of the British East India Company. James returned from India with a fortune conservatively estimated at £100,000. He died unmarried at Monkton House that he had purchased circa 1739[3] and renamed 'Orangefield' and was buried in 1748 at Monkton Churchyard in, for reasons that are not entirely clear, an unmarked grave.[4]
