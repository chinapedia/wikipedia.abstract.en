BI.png Золотий_трикутник_партнерства.png PROZORRO (Ukrainian: Прозоро – transparent, clear) is a public e-procurement system and a symbol of dramatic reform of government procurement in Ukraine. ProZorro is a result of collaboration between Ukrainian government, business sector, and civil society. This system was developed by reputable international anti-corruption organization Transparency International Ukraine with a help of volunteers, NGOs, business community and state bodies of Ukraine, the WNISEF fund, the EBRD, and other partners. During pilot stage of the project Transparency International Ukraine was administering the development of the system: ProZorro central database and a number of additional modules. Innovative technologies help to ensure the system’s transparency and monitoring: currently there are the analytics modules Qlik, public (bi.prozorro.org) and professional (bipro.prozorro.org). In December 2015 all ownership and relevant intellectual property rights for ProZorro system have been transferred to the state enterprise designated by Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine.[1]
