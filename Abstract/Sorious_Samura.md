SORIOUS SAMURA (born 27 October 1963) is a Sierra Leonean journalist. He is best known for two CNN documentary films: _Cry Freetown_ (2000) and _Exodus from Africa_ (2001). The self-funded _Cry Freetown_ depicts the most brutal period of the civil war in Sierra Leone with RUF rebels capturing the capital city (January 1999).[1] The film won, among other awards, an Emmy Award and a Peabody. _Exodus from Africa_ shows the harrowing effort by the best of young African male blood to break through to Europe via death- and danger-ridden paths from Sierra Leone and Nigeria, via Mali, the Sahara desert, Algeria, and Morocco through the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain.
