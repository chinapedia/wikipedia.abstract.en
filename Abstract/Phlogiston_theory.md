Jjbecher.jpg proposed the phlogiston theory]] The PHLOGISTON THEORY is a superseded scientific theory that postulated that a fire-like element called PHLOGISTON ()[1] is contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. The name comes from the Ancient Greek φλογιστόν _phlogistón_ (_burning up_), from φλόξ _phlóx_ (_flame_). It was first stated in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher and then put together more formally by Georg Ernst Stahl. The theory attempted to explain processes such as combustion and rusting, which are now collectively known as oxidation.
