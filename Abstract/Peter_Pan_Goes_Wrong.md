_PETER PAN GOES WRONG_ is a play by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer, and Henry Shields of the Mischief Theatre Company (creators of _The Play That Goes Wrong_). The premise, as in _The Play That Goes Wrong_, is that the actors and crews are members of the fictitious Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society presenting their production of the J.M. Barrie classic _Peter Pan_, and ruin it through amateurism and personal rivalries.
