NAIRI SEDRAKYAN (born 1961 in Ninotsminda, USSR) is an Armenian mathematician involved in national and international Olympiads of mathematics, having been the president of the Armenian Mathematics Olympiads, the Leader of Armenian IMO Team,[1] a jury member and problem selection committee member of the International Mathematical Olympiad,[2] a jury member and problem selection committee member of the Zhautykov International Mathematical Olympiad (IZhO),[3] a jury member and problem selection committee member of the International Olympiad of Metropolises,[4] the president of the International Mathematical Olympiad Tournament of the Towns. He has also authored a large number of problems proposed in these Olympiads. Nairi Sedrakyan is the author of one of the hardest problems ever proposed in the history of the International Mathematical Olympiad, the 5th problem of the 37th International Mathematical Olympiad.[5][6] This problem is considered to be one of the hardest problems ever because none of the members of the strongest teams, i.e. the National Olympic Teams of the USA, Russia or China succeeded to solve it correctly.[7][8][9] Moreover, the National Olympic Team of People's Republic of China obtained a cumulative result equal to 0 points and was ranked 6th in the final ranking of the countries instead of the usual 1st or 2nd place.[10] The British 2014 film X+Y, released in the USA as A Brilliant Young Mind (inspired by Beautiful Young Minds) focuses on an English mathematical genius chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the IMO. In the film this problem is stated to be the hardest problem ever proposed in the history of International Mathematical Olympiad (minutes 9:40-10:30).[11] Other outstanding results of the author include having 4 problems in the shortlist of the 27 problems selected worldwide of the 40th IMO in Romania, and having 5 students win medals in the 41st IMO in South Korea (2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals).[12] Moreover, only 1 point was missing for Sevak Mkrtchyan to obtain a Gold Medal (later on he became a Professor of mathematics in the USA, having received his PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkley).[13] Nevertheless, Arthur Barkhoudarian, one of Nairi Sedrakyan's first students received a Gold Medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad and later on, he received his PhD in mathematics from Charles University in Prague.[14] As all winning students were from the same school, where Nairi Sedrakyan was teaching mathematics, the government of the Republic of Armenia awarded the author the title of the best teacher of the Republic of Armenia and he received a special gift from the Prime Minister.[15] In particular, one of the medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad was received by Nairi Sedrakyan's son Hayk Sedrakyan (later on he became a Professor of mathematics in Paris and a professional Math Olympiad Coach in the greater Boston area, Massachusetts, USA, having received his PhD in mathematics from the Pierre and Marie Curie University (Sorbonne University) in Paris, France).[16] [17] [18]
