Calendar_(part_of_a_set)_MET_DP-13486-011.jpg, height: 20.3 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City)]] A CALENDAR is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.
