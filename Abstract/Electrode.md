Arc_welding_electrodes_and_electrode_holder.triddle.jpg]] An ELECTRODE is an electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e.g. a semiconductor, an electrolyte, a vacuum or air). The word was coined by William Whewell at the request of the scientist Michael Faraday from two Greek words: _elektron_, meaning amber (from which the word electricity is derived), and _hodos_, a way.[1][2]
