In molecular biology, RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM (RFLP) is a technique that exploits variations in homologous DNA sequences, known as polymorphisms, in order to distinguish individuals, populations, or species or to pinpoint the locations of genes within a sequence. The term may refer to a polymorphism itself, as detected through the differing locations of restriction enzyme sites, or to a related laboratory technique by which such differences can be illustrated. In RFLP ANALYSIS, a DNA sample is digested into fragments by one or more restriction enzymes, and the resulting _restriction fragments_ are then separated by gel electrophoresis according to their size.
