Chain contour length for this polymer is ~204 nm; thickness is ~0.4 nm.[1]]] A POLYMER (;[2][3] Greek _poly-_, "many" + _-mer_, "part") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits.[4] Due to their broad range of properties,[5] both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life.[6] Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. The terms polymer and resin are often synonymous with plastic.
