Worms_Magnuskirche1.JPG The MAGNUSKIRCHE is a small church in Worms, Germany, to the south of Worms Cathedral. It is the city's smallest church. Archaeological evidence and its dedication (probably identifiable with Magnus of FÃ¼ssen, a Carolingian saint) suggest it originated in the 8th century - part of that building survives in the nave's north wall.
