Onde_electromagnetique.svg sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, propagating in the direction +Z through a homogeneous, isotropic, dissipationless medium, such as vacuum. The electric field (blue arrows) oscillates in the ±X-direction, and the orthogonal magnetic field (red arrows) oscillates in phase with the electric field, but in the ±Y-direction.]]
