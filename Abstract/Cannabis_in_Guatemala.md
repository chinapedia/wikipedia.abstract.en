CANNABIS IN GUATEMALA, as of 2016, is illegal. Otto PÃ©rez, when he was president of the country, tried to lead a legalization drive, and some congressmen tried to pass a law for legalization, but those efforts failed. A poll conducted in 2012 said that 41% of Guatemalans might support decriminalization.
