The SHELDON BORIGHT HOUSE, also known as the GREY GABLES, is a historic house at 122 River Street in Richford, Vermont. Built in 1890 for a prominent local businessman, it is a fine example of a pattern-book design by Palliser, Palliser & Company, and may be the only instance of a house found on the cover of one of that company's pattern books. Now a bed and breakfast inn, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.[1]
