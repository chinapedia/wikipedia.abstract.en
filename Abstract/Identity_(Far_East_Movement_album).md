_IDENTITY_ is the fifth studio album primarily written and conducted by American hip hop music group Far East Movement. It was released on October 21, 2016 through Spinnin' Records and Transparent Agency. The album features artists from diverse backgrounds, especially those from Korea and America, as a nod to Far East Movement's Koreatown origins.[1] The band itself describes the album as "a Far East Movement, in a sense, bridging artists from the east with artists from the west while fusing different genres we love."
