MARIE-ROSE LÉODILLE DELAUNAY (1827-1906) was a Haitian educator. She founded the _l'Institution Mont-Carmel_ in 1850 and was its manager until 1903. This was the first secular secondary educational school for girls in Haiti. She founded her school only two years after education of girls had been formally included in the government policy at all, and it was a pioneer institution: since the 1810s, there had been some private basic education schools for girls, but it was not until the 1850s that secondary education schools for girls were founded in Haiti.
