JOE JOHNSON was[1] an American gay cartoonist, whose MISS THING and BIG DICK were among the first ongoing gay comics characters, appearing in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[2] The characters were featured in single-panel humor cartoons originally published in _The Advocate_. MissThing.jpg Miss Thing is an unflappable, stereotypically effeminate, gay "queen";[3] the name was a popular expression in gay male subculture for such a person. He has a willowy physique and a pompadour hairstyle, and wears floral prints, bell-bottoms, and flamboyant blouses.[4] Big Dick is an outgoing, stereotypically macho gay man. He has a highly muscular physique, and wears tight jeans which emphasize his large penis, a baseball cap, and a leather jacket and boots, in the mold of a Tom of Finland character.[5][6] Both characters are sexually adventurous, and the cartoons are blatantly sexual with frequent nudity, but not sexually explicit.[7] The characters usually appear separately in cartoons under their respective names, but sometimes meet.
