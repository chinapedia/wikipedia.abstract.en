The LATIN BISHOPRIC OF SALONA was a Roman Catholic diocese centred on Amfissa (medieval Salona), in Central Greece, during the period of Frankish rule there after the Fourth Crusade. The see was suppressed with the conquest of the region by the Ottoman Turks in 1410, but is retained by the Catholic Church as a titular see. It has been vacant since 1964.
