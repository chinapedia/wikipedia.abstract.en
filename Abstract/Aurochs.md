The AUROCHS ( or ; pl. AUROCHS, or rarely AUROCHSEN, AUROCHSES), also known as URUS or URE (_Bos primigenius_), is an extinct species of large wild cattle that inhabited Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is the ancestor of domestic cattle; it has also been suggested as an ancestor genetically to the modern European bison, which have been crossbred with steppe bison.[1] The species survived in Europe until 1627, when the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktor√≥w Forest, Poland.
