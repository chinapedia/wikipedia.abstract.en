JAPANESE EXONYMS are the names of places in the Japanese language that differ from the name given in the dominant language of the aforementioned region. While Japanese names of places that are not derived from the Chinese language generally tend to represent the endonym or the English exonym as phonetically accurate as possible, the Japanese terms for some place names are obscured, either because the name was borrowed from another language or because of some other obscure etymology, such as referring to England (more specifically the United Kingdom) as イギリス (_Igirisu_), which is based on the Portuguese term for "English", _Inglês_.[1] While there is a term for England that is more phonetically accurate to the endonym, イングランド (_Ingurando_), the term only applies to the Country of England as opposed to the United Kingdom as a whole.
