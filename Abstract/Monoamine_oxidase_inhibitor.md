MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIS) are a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of one or both monoamine oxidase enzymes: monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). They are best known as powerful anti-depressants, as well as effective therapeutic agents for panic disorder and social phobia. They are particularly effective in treatment-resistant depression and atypical depression.[1] They are also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and several other disorders.
