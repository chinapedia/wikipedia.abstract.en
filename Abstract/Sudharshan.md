_SUDHARSHAN_ is a 1951 Indian Tamil film directed by A. S. A. Sami and Sundar Rao Nadkarni. The film features P. U. Chinnappa and P. Kannamba in the lead roles. The story is based on a popular folk myth about a Panduranga devotee Gora who was a potter by trade. The same story was filmed simultaneously by Gemini Studios. The Gemini version Chakradhari was released early and due to unknown reason _Sudharshan_ was delayed.[1]
