"SINNERS IN THE HANDS OF AN ANGRY GOD" is a sermon written by British Colonial Christian theologian Jonathan Edwards, preached to his own congregation in Northampton, Massachusetts, to unknown effect,[1] and again on July 8, 1741 in Enfield, Connecticut.[2] Like Edwards' other works, it combines vivid imagery of Hell with observations of the world and citations of the scripture. It is Edwards' most famous written work, is a fitting representation of his preaching style,[3] and is widely studied by Christians and historians, providing a glimpse into the theology of the First Great Awakening of c. 1730â€“1755.
