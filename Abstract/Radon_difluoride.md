RADON DIFLUORIDE () is a compound of radon, a noble gas. Radon reacts readily with fluorine to form a solid compound, but this decomposes on attempted vaporization and its exact composition is uncertain.[1][2] Calculations suggest that it may be ionic,[3] unlike all other known binary noble gas compounds. The usefulness of radon compounds is limited because of the radioactivity of radon. The longest-lived isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.82 days, which decays by Î±-emission to yield polonium-218.[4]
