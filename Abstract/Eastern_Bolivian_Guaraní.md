The EASTERN BOLIVIAN GUARANÍ, or AVA GUARANÍ, are an Indigenous people formerly known as CHIRIGUANOS or Chiriguano Indians. Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos retained their lands in the Andes foothills of southeastern Bolivia from the 16th to the 19th centuries by fending off, first, the Inca Empire, later, the Spanish Empire, and, still later, independent Bolivia. The Chiriguanos were finally subjugated in 1892.
