HARRY LILLIS "BING" CROSBY JR. (; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977)[1][2] was an American singer and actor.[3] The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1931 to 1954.[4] His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin. _Yank_ magazine said that he was "the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen" during World War II.[5] In 1948, American polls declared him the "most admired man alive", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII.[6][7] Also in 1948, _Music Digest_ estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.[8]
