In mathematics, a FRACTAL is a subset of a Euclidean space for which the Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension. Fractals tend to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the Mandelbrot set;[1][2][3][4] Because of this, fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales called SELF SIMILARITY,[5] also known as EXPANDING SYMMETRY or UNFOLDING SYMMETRY; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge,[6] it is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of topology.
