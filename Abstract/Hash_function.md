Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg A HASH FUNCTION is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called HASH VALUES, HASH CODES, DIGESTS, or simply HASHES. Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file. One such application is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences. They are also useful in cryptography. A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify whether some input data map onto a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or any equivalent alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This is used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.
