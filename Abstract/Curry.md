CURRY (plural CURRIES) is a variety of dishes originating in the Indian subcontinent that use a complex combination of spices or herbs, usually including ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies. Curry is generally prepared in a sauce.[1] Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India, where the word also originated, may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree.[2]
