The GWANGJU STUDENTS MOVEMENT () is a movement that was started to fight against Japanese Imperialism. This began to take place starting on November 3, 1929. However, this wasn't the only movement of the time. There was a second movement which was led by a great amount of Gwangju Middle School students in May 20, 1943. The reason why these movements had originally sparked was because of a small incident where a Korean girl was being harassed at Naju (나주) Station on October 30 of that same year as the first movement. These movements were important because it gained Korea their freedom from the Japanese and thus receiving the independence that they fought for although there were many casualties and upsets.
