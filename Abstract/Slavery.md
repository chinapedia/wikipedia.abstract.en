SLAVERY is any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a _de jure_ form of property.[1] A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, _de jure_ slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is _de facto_ forced to work against their own will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour to refer to such situations.[2] However, and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word, slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs.
