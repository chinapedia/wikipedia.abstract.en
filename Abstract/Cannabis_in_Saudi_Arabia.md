The use and possession of cannabis is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Use and possession for personal use of any kind of recreational drugs is often punishable by imprisonment if caught. For Saudi citizens, there would generally be more leniency. Imprisonment for personal use of cannabis could go up to 1 to 6 months in prison with or without whippings for first time offenders. Imprisonment for drug dealing can range between 2 to 10 years in prison with whippings. Repeated dealing and or smuggling of high amounts of drugs usually result in harsher time in prison or even the death penalty, although recent executions are rare. Foreigners who use cannabis might be deported.[1]
