SULTAN MOHAMMED ALI AL-KITBI (1970, United Arab Emiratesâ€”14 December 2015, Taiz, Yemen) was a colonel of the United Arab Emirates Army who became one of the most senior officers killed during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war. He was also the highest ranking UAE officer to have been killed.[1] In his legacy, the standard issue of the UAE armed forces rifle, the CAR 816, is named Caracal Sultan and bears an engraving honoring him.[2]
