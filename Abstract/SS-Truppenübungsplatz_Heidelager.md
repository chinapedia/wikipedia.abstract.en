_SS-TRUPPENÜBUNGSPLATZ HEIDELAGER_ was a World War II SS military complex and Nazi concentration camp in Pustków and Pustków Osiedle, Poland.[1][2] The Nazi facility was built to train collaborationist military units, including the Ukrainian 14th Waffen SS Division "Galician",[3] and units from Estonia.[4] This training included killing operations inside the concentration camps – most notably at the nearby Pustków and Szebnie camps – and Jewish ghettos in the vicinity of the 'Heidelager'.[5][6] The military area was situated in the triangle of the Wisła and San rivers, dominated by large forest areas. The centre of the Heidelager was at Blizna, the location of the secret Nazi V-2 missile launch site, which was built and staffed by prisoners from the concentration camp at Pustków.
