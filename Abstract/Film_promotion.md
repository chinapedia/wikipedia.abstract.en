FILM PROMOTION is the practice of promotion specifically in the film industry, and usually occurs in coordination with the process of film distribution. Sometimes called the PRESS JUNKET or FILM JUNKET, film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media and interviews with the key people involved with the making of the film, like actors and directors.[1] As with all business, it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle. Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. Publicity is generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors.
