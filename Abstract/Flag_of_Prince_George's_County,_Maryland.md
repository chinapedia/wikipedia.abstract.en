The current FLAG OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND, was adopted in 1963, replacing one that had been in use since 1696.[1] It is a 3 parts tall by 5 parts wide white field with a red St. George's cross atop it, with the seal of Prince George's County in the canton.[2] Though official regulation states that the flag use the former county seal that was used from 1958 to 1971,[3] in practice most flags that are manufactured and used by the county government itself use the current county seal, which was introduced in 1971.[4]
