CARNIVAL IN BELIZE is the celebration of Carnival with a "fusion of street theatre, music, costume and dance."[1] More broadly, Carnival is a "collective expression of the perceptions, meanings, aspirations, and struggles engendered by the material conditions of social life and informed by the cultural traditions of the group."[2] These perspectives are a challenge to classic definitions which identify carnival origins in Europe as 'pagan' practices. However, pre-Lenten carnival practices in Belize are of mixed ‘origins’ involving various aspects of Maya, African, and European influences.
