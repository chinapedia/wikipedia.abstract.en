In molecular biology the SMALL PATHOGENICITY ISLAND RNA X (alias RsaOR) gene is a bacterial non-coding RNA. It was discovered in a large-scale analysis of _Staphylococcus aureus_.[1] SprX was shown to influence antibiotic resistance of the bacteria to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin glycopeptides, which are used to treat MRSA infections.[2] In this study the authors identified a SprX target, stage V sporulation protein G (Spo VG). By reducing Spo VG expression levels, SprX affects _S. aureus_ resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotics. Further work demonstrated its involvement in the regulation of pathogenicity factors.[3]
