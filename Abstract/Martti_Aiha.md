MARTTI AIHA (born 1952) is a sculptor from Finland. He was born in Pudasj√§rvi and works in Fiskars.[1] He has made abstracted sculptured wall reliefs and free-standing sculptures. His reliefs made of transparent acrylic sheet give an impression of immateriality, incorporeality and weightlessness. The ornamental, flame-like living shapes have become his trademark.[2] In addition of acrylic and plywood, he works with metal, wood or plastic.[3]
