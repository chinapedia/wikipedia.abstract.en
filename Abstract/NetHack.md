_NETHACK_ is a single-player roguelike video game originally released in 1987 with ASCII graphics. It is a descendant of an earlier game called _Hack_ (1982), which is a clone of _Rogue_ (1980).[1] Comparing it with _Rogue_, _Engadget_{{'}}s Justin Olivetti wrote that it took its exploration aspect and "made it far richer with an encyclopedia of objects, a larger vocabulary, a wealth of pop culture mentions, and a puzzler's attitude."[2] In 2000, _Salon_ described it as "one of the finest gaming experiences the computing world has to offer".[3]
