KarteKrummhoern800nChr.png The BAY OF SIELMÖNKEN or BIGHT OF SIELMÖNKEN ( or _Sielmönker Bucht_) is a former bay on the territory of the present day municipality of Krummhörn in the west of East Frisia in Germany. The bight reached its greatest extent during the Carolingian transgression of 800 to 950 A. D.[1] After that it silted up heavily and was completely enclosed by dykes between 1,000 A. D. and the 13th century.
