A MOSQUE (; from , ; literally "place of ritual prostration") is a place of worship for Muslims.[1][2] Any act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque, whether or not it takes place in a special building.[3] Informal and open-air places of worship are called _musalla_, while mosques used for communal prayer on Fridays are known as _jāmiʿ_.[4] Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche (_mihrab_) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca (_qiblah_),[5] ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued.[6][7] The pulpit (_minbar_), from which the Friday sermon (_khutba_) is delivered, was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques.[8][9] Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women.[10] This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depending on the region, period and denomination.[11]
