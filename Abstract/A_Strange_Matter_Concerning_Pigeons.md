"A STRANGE MATTER CONCERNING PIGEONS" (), also translated variously as "A STRANGE TALE OF PIGEONS" or "A STRANGENESS OF PIGEONS", is a short story by Pu Songling first published in _Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio_ (1740). It revolves around Zhang Youliang, an avid pigeon-keeper who befriends a fellow collector and is entrusted to care for a few of his pigeons. The story has been translated into both English and French, and adapted into an art installation.
