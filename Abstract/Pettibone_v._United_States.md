_PETTIBONE V. UNITED STATES_, 148 U.S. 197 (1893), is a United States Supreme Court criminal case involving the knowledge requirement in an obstruction of justice case.[1][2] It was the first Supreme Court case involving interpretation of obstruction of justice statutes (currently United States Code Section 1503).[3] Chief Justice Fuller wrote, "a person is not sufficiently charged with obstructing or impeding the due administration of justice in a court unless it appears that he knew of had notice that justice was being administered in such court".[4]
