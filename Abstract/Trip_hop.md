TRIP HOP (sometimes used synonymously with "downtempo")[1] is a musical genre that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol.[2] It has been described as "a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognizable",[3] and may incorporate a variety of styles, including funk, dub, soul, psychedelia, R&B, and house, as well as other forms of electronic music.[4] Trip hop can be highly experimental.[5]
