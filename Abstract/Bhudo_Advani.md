BHUDO ADVANI (17 August 1905 â€“ 25 July 1985)[1] was an Indian cinema character-actor and comedian. He started his acting career in theatre with the notion of spreading awareness on social issues. He came to Bombay on the advice of an Ajanta Cinetone representative and was offered a role in the film _Afzal_, also called _Hoor-E-Haram_ in 1933, directed by Mohan Bhavnani.[2] He later joined Sagar Movietone, becoming an important fixture in most films produced by them. He turned from character roles to comedy performing in _Dr. Madhurika_ (1935), directed by Sarvottam Badami, _Deccan Queen_ (1936) and _Do Diwaane_ (1936), by C. Luhar.
