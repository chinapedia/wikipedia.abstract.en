Building_of_the_European_Parliament_in_Brussels.jpg "European_Parliament"_on_official_languages_of_the_European_Union.jpg The EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (EP) is the legislative branch of the European Union and one of its seven institutions. Together with the European Commission and the Council of the European Union ('the Council', which should not be confused with the European Council and the non-EU Council of Europe organisation) it exercises the tripartite legislative function of the European Union. The Parliament is composed of 751 members (MEPs), intended to become 705 starting from the 2019–2024 legislature because of specific provisions adopted about Brexit, who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).[1][2][3]
