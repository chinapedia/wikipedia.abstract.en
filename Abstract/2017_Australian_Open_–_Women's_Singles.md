Serena Williams grabbed her 7th Australian title overall and first Australian Open where she did not lose a set during the tournament, defeating her sister Venus Williams in the final, 6–4, 6–4 to win the Women's Singles tennis title at the 2017 Australian Open. This marks the first time the Williams sisters met in a Grand Slam final since the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the first time they met in the Australian Open final since 2003. With Serena's win, she also regained the WTA singles No. 1 ranking from Kerber.[1] Serena was roughly 8-weeks pregnant with her first daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., at the end of this tournament.[2]
