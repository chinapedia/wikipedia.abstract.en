STAT (stylized STAT, sometimes also called STAT NEWS)[1] is a health-oriented news website launched on November 4, 2015 by John W. Henry, the owner of _The Boston Globe_. It is produced by Boston Globe Media and is headquartered in the _Globe_{{'}}s own building in Boston.[2][3] Its executive editor is Rick Berke, who formerly worked at both _The New York Times_ and _Politico_.[4] According to Kelsey Sutton of _Politico_, the website is Henry's "biggest and most ambitious standalone site yet".[5] The site's name comes from the term "stat," short for _statim_, or "immediately"â€”a term that has long been used in medical contexts.
