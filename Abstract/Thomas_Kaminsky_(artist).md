THOMAS KAMINSKY (born 1945) is a German artist, painter and printmaker living and working in Cologne and Vienna.[1][2] Born in Dresden, in 1964 he escaped to West Berlin and soon after became a student of the Informel painter and graphic artist Hann Trier (1915–99) at Berlin University's Fine Art Academy. In 1977 he was among the first to receive the Schmidt-Rottluff award.[3] This was followed in 1981–82 by a Villa Massimo Rome fellowship, one of the most important distinctions for a young German artist.[4] In 1998 there were retrospectives of his woodcuts in Kassel, Wuppertal[5] and 'Between Concrete and Utopia' at Kunstmuseum Villa Zanders in Bergisch Gladbach.[6] Kaminsky was subsequently commissioned to make artworks for the residence of the German ambassador in Beijing.
