The OSTWALD PROCESS is a chemical process for making nitric acid (HNO₃). Wilhelm Ostwald developed the process, and he patented it in 1902.[1][2] The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry, and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production. Historically and practically, the Ostwald process is closely associated with the Haber process, which provides the requisite raw material, ammonia (NH₃).
