JOHN JAMES AUDUBON (born JEAN RABIN; April 26, 1785 – January 27, 1851) was an American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter. He was notable for his extensive studies documenting all types of American birds and for his detailed illustrations that depicted the birds in their natural habitats. His major work, a color-plate book entitled _The Birds of America_ (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Audubon identified 25 new species.
