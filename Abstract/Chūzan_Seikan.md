or _Mirror of Chūzan_, compiled in 1650 by Shō Shōken, is the first official history of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. In six scrolls, the main text occupies five and an accompanying summary the sixth. Unlike later official histories such as _Chūzan Seifu_ and _Kyūyō_, which were written in kanbun, _Chūzan Seikan_ is largely written in Japanese, other than for the summary and a number of quotes in Chinese.[1][2]
