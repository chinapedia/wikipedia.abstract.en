_THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS_ is an American comic strip created by Rudolph Dirks in 1897 and later drawn by Harold Knerr for 35 years (1914 to 1949).[1] It debuted December 12, 1897, in the _American Humorist_, the Sunday supplement of William Randolph Hearst's _New York Journal_. Dirks was the first cartoonist to regularly express comic characters' dialogue using speech balloons.[2] The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.
