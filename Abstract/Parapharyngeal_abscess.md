A PARAPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS is a deep neck space abscess of the parapharyngeal space (or pharyngomaxillary space), which is lateral to the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and medial to the masseter muscle. [1] This space is divided by the styloid process into anterior and posterior compartments. The posterior compartment contains the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and many nerves.[2]
