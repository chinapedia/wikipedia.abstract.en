Schroedingers_cat_film.svg" theorem according to the many-worlds interpretation. In this interpretation, every event is a branch point; the cat is both alive and dead, even before the box is opened, but the "alive" and "dead" cats are in different branches of the universe, both of which are equally real, but which do not interact with each other.[1]]] The MANY-WORLDS INTERPRETATION is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. The existence of the other worlds makes it possible to remove randomness and action at a distance from quantum theory and thus from all physics. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe"). In layman's terms, the hypothesis states there is a very large—perhaps infinite[2]—number of universes, and everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. The theory is also referred to as MWI, the RELATIVE STATE FORMULATION, the EVERETT INTERPRETATION, the THEORY OF THE UNIVERSAL WAVEFUNCTION, MANY-UNIVERSES INTERPRETATION, MULTIVERSE THEORY or just MANY-WORLDS.
