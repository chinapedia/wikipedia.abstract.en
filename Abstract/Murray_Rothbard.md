MURRAY NEWTON ROTHBARD (; March 2, 1926 – January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School,[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] historian,[9][10] and a political theorist[11] whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism.[12] Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism and a central figure in the 20th-century American libertarian movement. He wrote over twenty books on political theory, revisionist history, economics and other subjects.[13] Rothbard asserted that all services provided by the "monopoly system of the corporate state" could be provided more efficiently by the private sector and wrote that the state is "the organization of robbery systematized and writ large".[14][15][16][17][18][19] He called fractional-reserve banking a form of fraud and opposed central banking.[20] He categorically opposed all military, political and economic interventionism in the affairs of other nations.[21][22] According to his protégé Hans-Hermann Hoppe, "[t]here would be no anarcho-capitalist movement to speak of without Rothbard".[23]
