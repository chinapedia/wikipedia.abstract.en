DYLAN MARLAIS THOMAS (27 October 1914 – 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems "Do not go gentle into that good night" and "And death shall have no dominion"; the 'play for voices' _Under Milk Wood_; and stories and radio broadcasts such as _A Child's Christmas in Wales_ and _Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog_. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a "roistering, drunken and doomed poet".[1]
