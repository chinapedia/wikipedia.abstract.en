A DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM (DCS) is a computer application that facilitates the process of data collection, allowing specific, structured information to be gathered in a systematic fashion, subsequently enabling data analysis to be performed on the information.[1][2][3] Typically a DCS displays a form that accepts data input from a user and then validates that input prior to committing the data to persistent storage such as a database.
