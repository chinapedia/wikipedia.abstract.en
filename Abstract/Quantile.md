Iqr_with_quantile.png, with quartiles shown. The area below the red curve is the same in the intervals (−∞,_Q_₁), (_Q_₁,_Q_₂), (_Q_₂,_Q_₃), and (_Q_₃,+∞).]] In statistics and probability QUANTILES are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. There is one fewer quantile than the number of groups created. Thus quartiles are the three cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal-sized groups. Common quantiles have special names: for instance quartile, decile (creating 10 groups: see below for more). The groups created are termed halves, thirds, quarters, etc., though sometimes the terms for the quantile are used for the groups created, rather than for the cut points.
