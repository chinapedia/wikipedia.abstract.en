"ONE TONY LOCKETT" is a song recorded by Australian musician James Freud as a tribute to St Kilda and Sydney AFL player Tony Lockett, who booted his record-breaking 1300th goal shortly before the release of the track. The song utilises the music of the popular traditional Cuban song "Guantanamera". Released in 1999 with the backing of the Seven Network,[1] the song charted in the Top 40 during the month of June, reaching a peak of #38.[2]
