A TIER LIST is a list of anything that can be ranked. It originated from playable characters or other elements of a video game, subjectively ranked by their respective viability in high-level competitive settings. Characters listed high on a tier list of a specific game are considered to be powerful characters compared to lower-scoring characters, and are therefore more likely to be used during tournaments. Tier lists are popular in fighting games such as the _Street Fighter_ and _Super Smash Bros._ series, and MOBA titles such as _League of Legends_ and _Dota 2_, in addition to hero shooter titles such as _Overwatch_ and _Paladins_.
