The INDONESIAN JUDGES ASSOCIATION, known locally as _Ikatan Hakim Indonesia_ or IKAHI is an association of judicial officials in Indonesia. IKAHI's members include first-level trial judges and senior justices, as opposed to the Indonesian Judges' Forum (FDHI) which includes appeals court judges.[1] IKAHI executive Suhadi has described the association's focus as protection of judges from threats and harassment, though judicial transparency activists have disputed this.[2]
