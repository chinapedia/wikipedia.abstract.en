TRERHYNGYLL is a small village in the Vale of Glamorgan, about north of Cowbridge and south of Ystradowen, near Maendy, off the A4222 road.[1] Trerhyngyll and Maendy Halt railway station operated here from 1905 to 1951, though the line was closed to passengers as early as 1930 between Cowbridge and Aberthaw.[2] In 1986 it was described as a "typical vale village with between 50-60 houses, most of which are 10-50 years old though 8 are over 200 years old." Trerhyngyll typically houses commuters who work in Cowbridge or Cardiff.[3]
