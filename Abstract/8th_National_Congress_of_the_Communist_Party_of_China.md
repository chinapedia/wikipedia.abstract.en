The 8TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA was held in two sessions, the first 15–27 September 1956 and the second 5–23 May 1958 in Beijing. It was the first Congress of the Communist Party of China since the start of it taking full control of mainland China in 1949 and establishing the People's Republic of China. It was preceded by the relatively early 7th National Congress. It was formally succeeded by the 9th National Congress. The Great Hall of the People was not yet constructed, so it was held in the National Political Consultative Conference Hall.
