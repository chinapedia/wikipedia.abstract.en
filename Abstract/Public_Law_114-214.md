PUBLIC LAW 114-216 is the federal law of the United States that regulates GMO food labeling. It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when President Obama signed then Senate Bill 764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed _A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes_, it evolved over time into "the legislative vehicle for a measure concerning bioengineered food disclosure".[1] The bill was crafted by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI).[2] The "GMO labeling bill"[3] was introduced by its sponsor, Sen. Roger F. Wicker (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and passed Senate and House in June 2016. The law overturned relevant state laws such as Vermont's GMO labeling law that had called for strict and transparent GMO food labeling in Vermont after July 1, 2016.[4]
