NSIR4 (NITROGEN STRESS-INDUCED RNA 4), former name SYR12, is a cyanobacterial non-coding RNA which plays role in the regulation of Glutamine synthetase (GS), a key enzyme in biological nitrogen assimilation. NsiR4 interacts with the 5'UTR of the mRNA of the GS inactivating factor IF7 (_gifA_ mRNA) and reduces its expression. NsiR4 expression is under positive control of the nitrogen control transcription factor (NtcA). NsR4 is a first example of an sRNA controlling the assimilation of a micronutrient.[1]
