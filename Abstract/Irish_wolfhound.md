The IRISH WOLFHOUND is a historic sighthound dog breed from Ireland that has by its presence and substantial size inspired literature, poetry and mythology.[1][2][3]1 Like all sighthounds, it was used to pursue game by speed, it was also famed as a guardian dog, specializing in protection against and for the hunting of wolves. The original dog-type was presumed extinct by most knowledgeable authors but recreated specifically for the canine fancy mainly by Captain George A. Graham in the late 19th century[4][5] The modern breed, classified by recent genetic research into the _Sighthound United Kingdom Rural Clade_,[6] has been used by coursing hunters who have prized it for its ability to dispatch game caught by swifter sighthounds.[7][8]
