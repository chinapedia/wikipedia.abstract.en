The _LIBER PONTIFICALIS_ (Latin for 'pontifical book' or _Book of the Popes_) is a book of biographies of popes from Saint Peter until the 15th century. The original publication of the _Liber Pontificalis_ stopped with Pope Adrian II (867–872) or Pope Stephen V (885–891),[1] but it was later supplemented in a different style until Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447) and then Pope Pius II (1458–1464).[2] Although quoted virtually uncritically from the 8th to 18th centuries,[3] the _Liber Pontificalis_ has undergone intense modern scholarly scrutiny. The work of the French priest Louis Duchesne (who compiled the major scholarly edition), and of others has highlighted some of the underlying redactional motivations of different sections, though such interests are so disparate and varied as to render improbable one popularizer's claim that it is an "unofficial instrument of pontifical propaganda."[4]
