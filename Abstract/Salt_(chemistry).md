Potassium-dichromate-sample.jpg has the bright orange color characteristic of the dichromate anion.]] In chemistry, a SALT is a chemical compound consisting of an assembly of cations and anions.[1] Salts are composed of related numbers of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negative ions) so that the product is electrically neutral (without a net charge). These component ions can be inorganic, such as chloride (Cl^(−)), or organic, such as acetate (); and can be monatomic, such as fluoride (F^(−)), or polyatomic, such as sulfate ().
