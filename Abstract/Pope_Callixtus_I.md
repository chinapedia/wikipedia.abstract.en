POPE CALLIXTUS I (died 222), also called CALLISTUS I, (Kaliktus), was the Bishop of Rome (according to Sextus Julius Africanus) from c. 218 to his death c. 222 or 223.[1] He lived during the reigns of the Roman Emperors Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. Eusebius and the Liberian catalogue gave him five years of episcopate (217â€“222). He was martyred for his Christian faith and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church.
