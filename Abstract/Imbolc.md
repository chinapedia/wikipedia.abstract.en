IMBOLC or IMBOLG ( ), also called (SAINT) BRIGID'S DAY (, , ), is a Gaelic traditional festival marking the beginning of spring. It is held on 1 February, or about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox.[1][2] Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals—along with Beltane, Lughnasadh and Samhain[3]—and corresponds to the Welsh __. For Christians, especially in Ireland, it is the feast day of Saint Brigid.
