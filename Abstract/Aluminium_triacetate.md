ALUMINIUM TRIACETATE, formally named ALUMINIUM ACETATE,[1] is a chemical compound with composition . Under standard conditions it appears as a white, water-soluble solid[2] that decomposes on heating at around 200 °C.[3] The triacetate hydrolyses to a mixture of basic hydroxide / acetate salts,[4] and multiple species co-exist in chemical equilibrium, particularly in aqueous solutions of the acetate ion; the name aluminium acetate is commonly used for this mixed system.
