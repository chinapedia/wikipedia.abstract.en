The SNORREBROENS PAKHUS, located at Overgaden Neden Vandet 45–47, is a former warehouse overlooking Christianshavn Canal in the Christianshavn neighbourhood of Copenhagen, Denmark. It consists of what was originally two individual but almost identical warehouses from circa 1800 which were merged into one building in the 1860s and has now been converted into apartments. The name, which is of modern ofigins, refers to Snorrebroen, the bridge that carries nearby Sankt Annæ Gade across the canal.
