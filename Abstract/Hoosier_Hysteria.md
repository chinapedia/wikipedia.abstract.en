HOOSIER HYSTERIA is the state of excitement surrounding basketball in Indiana, or more specifically the Indiana high school basketball tournament.[1] In part, the excitement stemmed from the inclusion of all tournament entrants into the same tournament, where a small town's David might knock off a large city's Goliath. The most famous example occurred in 1954, when Milan (enrollment 161) defeated Muncie Central (enrollment over 1,600) to win the State title. The plot of the now famous movie, _Hoosiers_, was based on the story of the 1954 Milan team and seems to typify the hysteria related to basketball in the state of Indiana.
