_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _UNGUICULATA_ is one of seven sections in the subgenus _Chrysoma_. It includes three species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are rigid shrubs with a single main stem and are less than tall. They have yellow flowers arranged in corymb-like groups and the flowers turn red as they age. They have sepals with fringed lobes, petals which have lobes arranged like the fingers of a hand and anthers which have an appendage which looks like a pair of claws.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he described the section and gave it the name _Unguiculata_.[2][3] The name _Unguiculata_ is the diminutive form of the Latin word _unguis_ meaning "little claw" or "little talon"[4] referring to the anther appendage in these species.
