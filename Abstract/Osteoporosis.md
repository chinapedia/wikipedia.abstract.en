OSTEOPOROSIS is a disease in which bone weakening increases the risk of a broken bone.[1] It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly.[2] Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip.[3] Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms.[4] Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously.[5] Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.[6]
