COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) is a psycho-social intervention[1][2] that aims to improve mental health.[3] CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving emotional regulation,[4][5] and the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.[6][7] CBT is often used as an umbrella term referring to a number of cognitive and/or behaviour psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.[8][9][10]
