Laser theory of Fabry-Perot (FP) semiconductor lasers proves to be nonlinear, since the gain,[1][2] the refractive index[3] and the loss coefficient[4] are the functions of energy flux. The nonlinear theory[5] made it possible to explain a number of experiments some of which could not even be explained (for example, natural linewidth), much less modeled, on the basis of other theoretical models; this suggests that the nonlinear theory developed is a new paradigm of the laser theory.
