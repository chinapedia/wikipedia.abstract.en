A QUANGO or QUANGO (less often QUANGO or QANGO) is a QUASI-AUTONOMOUS NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION. It is typically an organisation to which a government has devolved power, but which is still partly controlled and/or financed by government bodies. As its name suggests, a quango is a hybrid form of organization, with elements of both non-government organizations (NGOs) and public sector bodies. The concept is most often applied in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and other English-speaking countries.
