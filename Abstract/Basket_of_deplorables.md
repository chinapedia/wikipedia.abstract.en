"BASKET OF DEPLORABLES" is a phrase from a 2016 presidential election campaign speech delivered by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on September 9, 2016, at a campaign fundraising event, which she used to describe half of the supporters of her opponent, Republican nominee Donald J. Trump. The next day she expressed regret for "saying half", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified "hateful views and voices".
