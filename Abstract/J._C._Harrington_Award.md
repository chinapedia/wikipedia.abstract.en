The J. C. HARRINGTON AWARD was established in 1981 by the Society for Historical Archaeology and is named in honor of J. C. Harrington (1901-1998), a pioneer founder of historical archaeology in North America. The award is presented for a "life-time of contributions to the discipline centered on scholarship". The award is an inscribed medal. No more than one Harrington Award is presented each year.[1]
