MAX HORKHEIMER (; ; February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include _Eclipse of Reason_ (1947), _Between Philosophy and Social Science_ (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, _Dialectic of Enlightenment_ (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.[1]
