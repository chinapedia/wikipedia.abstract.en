Crank is a condition in which a ship heels abnormally, and recovers slowly under the action of the wind. If a ship makes long, slow rolls and takes time resuming a vertical position, it is referred to as crank, cranky, crank-sided, tender, or tender-sided. If the ship snaps back to its vertical position when heeled, it is called ʻstiff.ʼ Stiffness refers to a ship's power to stand up to her canvas, and will offer great resistance to inclination from the upright, when under sail.[1] Although stiff is considered good in the case of many ships, there are extreme cases in which the vessel will be too stiff and resist the tendency to heel under wind pressure, which may cause damage to masts, rigging, and structure. According to Arthur Nelson, “most new Tudor ships were affected slightly on completion, one way or the other." [2]
