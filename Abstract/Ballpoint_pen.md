A BALLPOINT PEN, also known as a BIRO[1] or BALL PEN, is a pen that dispenses ink (usually in paste form) over a metal ball at its point, i.e. over a "ball point". The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.[2] The design was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument;[3] millions are manufactured and sold daily.[4] As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.
