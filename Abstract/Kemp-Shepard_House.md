The KEMP-SHEPARD HOUSE is a historic house on Highbridge Road (Vermont Route 104A) in Georgia, Vermont. The main block of the brick house, built about 1830, is an important early work of a regional master builder, and it is attached to an older wood-frame ell. It was built on land that was among the first to be settled in the eastern part of the town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1]
