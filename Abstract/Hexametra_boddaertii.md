_HEXAMETRA BODDAERTII_ is a parasitic roundworm belonging to the family Ascarididae. _H. boddaertii_ was originally described from a single specimen of Mastigodryas boddaerti, a South American colubrine snake.[1] Other neotropical colubrids identified as hosts to _H. boddaertii_ include Oxyrhopus trigeminus, Philodryas patagoniensis, Spilotes pullatus, Trimorphodon biscutatus, Philodryas baroni, and Oxyrhopus guibei.[2] It is thought that _Hexametra_ may be the causative agent of ocular disease, diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis, (DSUN), in Brazil.[3]
