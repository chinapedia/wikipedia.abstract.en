The estate was purchased in about 1877 by Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke (1828–1897), senior partner of Barings Bank, who rebuilt the mansion house known as MEMBLAND HALL. He suffered financial troubles and in 1899 the estate and Hall were sold to a property developer.[1] A year later Membland was sold to ship builder William Cresswell Gray.[2][3] The house became derelict after World War I and was demolished in 1927.[4] Several of the estate's service buildings survive, including the _Bull and Bear_ gatekeeper's lodge, stables, gasworks, forge and laundry. On the site of the house a smaller dwelling was built between 1966-8.[5]
