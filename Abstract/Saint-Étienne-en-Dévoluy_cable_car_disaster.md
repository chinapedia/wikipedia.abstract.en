The SAINT-ÉTIENNE-EN-DÉVOLUY CABLE CAR DISASTER occurred on 1 July 1999 in Saint-Étienne-en-Dévoluy, France, when a gondola which was being operated on a privately owned aerial tramway detached from the cable it was traveling on, and fell into the valley below. The accident killed all twenty people on board. The death toll was equal to that of another cable car accident in Italy which occurred one year previously. The disaster remains the deadliest cable car accident in France, and one of the deadliest such incidents anywhere in the world.[1]
