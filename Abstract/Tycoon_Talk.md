_TYCOON TALK_ is a business celebrity talk show broadcast on Hong Kong's TVB Pearl by film producer / host Sean Lee-Davies, who directed and hosted two series of eight episodes featuring Hong Kong's most recognised billionaires, business leaders and entrepreneurs. In those two series, Lee-Davies gained access to not only their work environment but also their private lives. He challenged American businessman James E. Thompson to a push-up challenge; played pool with Bruce Rockowitz, co-founder of Pure; and challenged the CEO of Mission Hills golf Dr. Ken Chu to a round. He accompanied Tai Sang Bank Director Philip Ma on a helicopter ride around Hong Kong island; and went for a drive with tycoon Sir Gordon Wu in a Nissan Leaf car.
