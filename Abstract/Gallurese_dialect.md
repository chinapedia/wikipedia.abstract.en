GALLURESE (_gadduresu_) is a Romance lect from the Italo-Dalmatian family spoken in the region of Gallura, northeastern Sardinia. It is often considered a dialect of southern Corsican or a transitional language between Corsican and Sardinian. Nowadays, the last definition seems to have prevailed and not even in Corsica is it considered anymore to be a Corsican dialect, but rather a separate language, despite the Corsican influence. The "Gallurese International Day" (_Ciurrata Internaziunali di la Linga Gadduresa_) takes place each year in Palau (Sardinia) with the participation of orators from other areas, including Corsica.[1][2][3]
