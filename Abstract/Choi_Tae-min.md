CHOI TAE-MIN (5 May 1912 â€“ 1 May 1994) was the leader of a South Korean cult combining elements of Buddhism, Christianity, and traditional Korean Shamanism[1]. Choi, originally a Buddhist monk, then a convert to Roman Catholicism, was married six times. He was the mentor of the impeached South Korean president, Park Geun-hye (the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee), until his death in 1994. He allegedly used his relationship with Park to solicit bribes from government officials and businessmen.[2][3] In late 2016, a scandal involving his daughter, Choi Soon-sil, broke out, with allegations that she too has exerted undue influence over President Park.[4][5]
