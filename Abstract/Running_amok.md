RUNNING AMOK, sometimes referred to as simply AMOK or GONE AMOK,[1] also spelled AMUK, from the Southeast Asian Austronesian languages (especially Malaysian[2] and Indonesian[3]), is "an episode of sudden mass assault against people or objects usually by a single individual following a period of brooding that has traditionally been regarded as occurring especially in Malay culture but is now increasingly viewed as psychopathological behavior".[4] The syndrome of "Amok" is found in the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-IV TR).[5] The phrase is often used in a less serious manner when describing something that is wildly out of control or causing a frenzy (e.g., a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be termed as "running amok").
