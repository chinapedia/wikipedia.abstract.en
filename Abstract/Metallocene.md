Metallocene_structure.PNG of a METALLOCENE compound, where M is a metal cation]] A METALLOCENE is a compound typically consisting of two cyclopentadienyl anions (, abbreviated Cp) bound to a metal center (M) in the oxidation state II, with the resulting general formula (C₅H₅)₂M. Closely related to the metallocenes are the metallocene derivatives, e.g. titanocene dichloride, vanadocene dichloride. Certain metallocenes and their derivatives exhibit catalytic properties, although metallocenes are rarely used industrially. Cationic group 4 metallocene derivatives related to [Cp₂ZrCH₃]⁺ catalyze olefin polymerization.
