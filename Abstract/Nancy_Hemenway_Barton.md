NANCY HEMENWAY WHITTEN BARTON (June 19, 1920 – February 23, 2008) was an American artist who specialized in tapestries created from a wide range of fabrics. She created an art form she called "bayetage"—a combination of flower-dyed wool, bayeta, and collage. Hemenway had one-woman exhibitions at more than 20 museums around the world, including the Farnsworth Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago,[1]and the Edinburgh City Art Centre, Scotland. A retrospective exhibition, "Ahead of Her Time" was held[2] at the University of New England Gallery in Portland, Maine in the fall of 2017.[3]
