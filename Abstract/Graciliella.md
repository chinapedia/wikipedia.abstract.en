_GRACILIELLA_ is a genus of cave beetle in the family Leiodidae.[1] It was previously included in the genus _Anthroherpon_ but DNA evidence showed that it is actually a more distantly related group of species. The paper in which _Graciliella_ was published gained some media attention, with several stories picking up on the spider-like appearance of these beetles.[2] _Graciliella_ currently consists of six species, including the newly discovered _Graciliella kosovaci_ and _Graciliella ozimeci_ All species occur in subterranean habitats of the Dinaric Mountains, from Crvanj mountain (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the north, to Trnovo (Montenegro) in the south, and from Å½aba mountain (Croatia) in the west to Prokletije mountain (Montenegro) in the east.[3]
