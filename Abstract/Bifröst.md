stands before the rainbow bridge while blowing a horn (1905) by Emil Doepler.]] In Norse mythology, BIFRÖST ([1] or sometimes BILRÖST or BIVROST) is a burning rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods. The bridge is attested as _Bilröst_ in the _Poetic Edda_; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and as _Bifröst_ in the _Prose Edda_; written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds. Both the _Poetic Edda_ and the _Prose Edda_ alternately refer to the bridge as ÁSBRÚ (Old Norse "Æsir's bridge").[2]
