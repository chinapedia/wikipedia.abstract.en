Salida-de-chilenos-de-Iquique.png published on 15 June 1879 an image (of April 1879) of Chileans waiting at the port of Iquique for ships to return home.]] The EXPULSION OF CHILEANS FROM BOLIVIA AND PERU IN 1879 was ordered by of the governments of Bolivia (on 1 March 1879) and Peru (on 15 April 1879). The expulsion took place at the beginning of the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) between Chile and an alliance between Peru and Bolivia. Chilean citizens (about 30,000[1] to 40,000 in number) in both nations were ordered to leave within eight days or face internment and confiscation of their property. They were expunged on poorly-built rafts and pontoons at Peruvian ports, or forced to wander through the desert to reach the northernmost positions occupied by the Chilean Army in Antofagasta. The edict of expulsion was widely popular in Peru[2] and met with little resistance, allowing the expulsion to occur quickly.
