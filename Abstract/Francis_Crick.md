FRANCIS HARRY COMPTON CRICK [1][2] (8 June 1916 â€“ 28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist. In 1953, he co-authored with James Watson the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material".[3][4] The results were based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin, Raymond Gosling and Wilkins.
