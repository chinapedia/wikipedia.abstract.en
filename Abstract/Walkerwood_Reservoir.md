Walkerwood_Reservoir_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1399979.jpg Walkerwood_Reservoir_-_panoramio.jpg WALKERWOOD RESERVOIR is the lowest reservoir of a series of four in the Brushes valley above Stalybridge in Greater Manchester,[1] built in the 19th century to provide a supply of safe drinking water. It is owned and operated by United Utilities. The reservoir dam consists of a clay core within an earth embankment. The embankment was originally protected from erosion with stone pitching. At a later stage these were overlain with in-situ concrete slabs, which in turn have deteriorated over the years. [2]
