IL SANTO is an Italian novel written by Antonio Fogazzaro and published by Baldini & Castoldi in 1905 in Milan. The novel is the third and last of a trilogy in which _Piccolo Mondo Antico_ is the first and _Piccolo Mondo Moderno_ is the second.[1] Despite the fact that Fogazzaro was a devout and loyal Catholic, _Il Santo_ was listed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.[2] The Vatican's prohibition of this novel helped Fogazzaro achieve a worldwide reputation.[3]
