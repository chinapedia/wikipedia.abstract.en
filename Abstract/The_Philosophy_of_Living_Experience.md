_THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIVING EXPERIENCE_ is a book by Alexander Bogdanov, which he wrote in 1911 and published in 1913.[1] [2] Further editions were published in 1920 and 1923 without revision.[3] However the 1923 addition contains an appendix "From Religious to Scientific Monism" delivered at the Institute of Scientific Philosophy in February 1923.[4] This is the book in which Bogdanov most extensively discusses the relationship of his thought to both Karl Marx and Ernst Mach.[5] The book was probably based on a course he developed firstly at the Capri Party School (1909) and subsequently at the Bologna Party School (1911).[6] Indeed Bogdanov cites the unpublished work of Nikifor Vilonov, a worker-philosopher who attended the Capri school.[7] An English translation was published in 2015.[8]
