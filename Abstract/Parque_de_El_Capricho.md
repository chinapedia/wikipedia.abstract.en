The PARQUE DE EL CAPRICHO is a park in Madrid. The name _capricho_ means "folly" in Spanish. It was created by Mar√≠a Josefa Pimentel, Duchess of Osuna (1752-1834) on her estate at Alameda de Osuna, which was then outside the city of Madrid. It is landscaped in eighteenth-century style with formal and naturalistic features. It is recognised as one of the most beautiful parks in the city.[1]
