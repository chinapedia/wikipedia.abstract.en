Syria has a turbulent economic history. In 1963, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party came to power, and instituted socialist policies of nationalization and land reform.[1] In 1970, General Hafiz al-Assad took power. The restrictions on private enterprise were relaxed, but a substantial part of the economy was still under government control. By the 1980s, Syria found itself politically and economically isolated, and in the midst of a deep economic crisis.[2] Real per capita GDP fell 22 percent between 1982 and 1989.[3] In 1990, the Assad government instituted a series of economic reforms, although the economy remained highly regulated.[4] The Syrian economy experienced strong growth throughout the 1990s, and into the 2000s.[5] Syria's per capita GDP was 4,058 US dollars in 2010.[6] There is no authoritative GDP data available after 2012, due to Syria's civil war.[7]
