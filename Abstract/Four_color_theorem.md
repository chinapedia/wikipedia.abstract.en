Four_Colour_Map_Example.svgMap_of_United_States_vivid_colors_shown.png In mathematics, the FOUR COLOR THEOREM, or the FOUR COLOR MAP THEOREM, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a _map_, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. _Adjacent_ means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a corner where three or more regions meet.[1] It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Initially, this proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand. Since then the proof has gained wide acceptance, although some doubters remain.
