ST ALBANS () is a city in Hertfordshire,[1] England, and the major urban area in the City and District of St Albans. It lies east of Hemel Hempstead and west of Hatfield, about north-northwest of central London, southwest of Welwyn Garden City and south-southeast of Luton. St Albans was the first major town on the old Roman road of Watling Street for travellers heading north, and it became the Roman city of Verulamium. It is a historic market town and is now a dormitory town within the London commuter belt and the Greater London Built-up Area.
