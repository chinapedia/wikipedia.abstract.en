ST. JOHN'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH was founded in 1804 by James Kilbourne, the same Episcopal deacon who founded the city in which the church resides, Worthington, Ohio, and for whom a nearby high school (Worthington Kilbourne High School) and middle school (Kilbourne Middle School) are named. It was the first Episcopal church built west of the Allegheny Mountains, built between 1827-1831, with Kilbourne Hall (the parish house) constructed in 1927 and the church's Early Education Center in 1962.
