The MACKINAC BRIDGE ( ) is a suspension bridge spanning the Straits of Mackinac to connect the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of the U.S. state of Michigan. Opened in 1957, the [1] bridge (familiarly known as "BIG MAC" and "MIGHTY MAC")[2] is the world's 22nd-longest main span and the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere.[3] The Mackinac Bridge is part of Interstate 75 and the Lakes Michigan and Huron components of the Great Lakes Circle Tour across the straits; it is also a segment of the U.S. North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge connects the city of St. Ignace on the north end with the village of Mackinaw City on the south.
