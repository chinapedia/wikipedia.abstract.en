PIPERIDINE is an organic compound with the molecular formula (CH₂)₅NH. This heterocyclic amine consists of a six-membered ring containing five methylene bridges (–CH₂–) and one amine bridge (–NH–). It is a colorless liquid with an odor described as objectionable, and typical of amines.[1] The name comes from the genus name _Piper_, which is the Latin word for pepper.[2] Although piperidine is a common organic compound, it is best known as a representative structure element within many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids, such as natural-ocurring solenopsins[3].
