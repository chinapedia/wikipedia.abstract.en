_THE STATE OF THE WORLD'S ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE_ is a major report on the breeds of farm livestock in the world. It was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2007. It covers mammalian and avian domestic livestock breeds, but does not include fish or honey bees and other invertebrates. It is based on information submitted to the FAO, in the form of reports of participating countries, thematic studies prepared by experts and data on individual breeds submitted to DAD-IS. An annex to the report, the _List of breeds documented in the Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources_, gives an estimate of conservation status for all breeds for which sufficient data had been received. The report has been translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Indonesian, Russian and Spanish.
