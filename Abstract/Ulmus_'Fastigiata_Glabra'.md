The ELM cultivar _ULMUS_ 'FASTIGIATA GLABRA' was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s as _U. montana fastigiata glabra_. Späth used _U. montana_ both for wych elm and for _U._ × _hollandica_ hybrids like 'Dampieri',[1] so the name does not necessarily imply a wych elm cultivar. A specimen in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh was determined by Melville in 1958 as a hybrid of the _U._ × _hollandica_ group (he called it _U. glabra_ × _U. carpinifolia_ [:_U. minor_ ] × _U. plotii_ [:_U. minor_ 'Plotii' ]).[2] The cultivar did not appear in Späth's 1903 catalogue.
