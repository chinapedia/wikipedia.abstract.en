CHRISTIANA WILLES (1786â€“1873), also known by her married name CHRISTIANA HODGES, was an early nineteenth century cricketer and the sister of John Willes. She has sometimes been attributed as the founder of roundarm bowling but it is known that the style was originated by Tom Walker. Many cricket sources name her as CHRISTINA rather than Christiana, but John Major and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography are adamant that Christiana was the correct spelling of her name.[1][2]
