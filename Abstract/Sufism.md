SUFISM, or _TAṢAWWUF_[1](), variously defined as "Islamic mysticism",[2] "the inward dimension of Islam"[3][4] or "the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam",[5][6] is mysticism in Islam, "characterized ... [by particular] values, ritual practices, doctrines and institutions"[7] which began very early in Islamic history[8] and represents "the main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization of" mystical practice in Islam.[9][10] Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as "Sufis" (from _ṣūfiyy_ / _ṣūfī_).[11]
