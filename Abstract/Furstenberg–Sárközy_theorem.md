The FURSTENBERG–SÁRKÖZY THEOREM is a result in additive number theory on square-difference-free sets, named after Hillel Furstenberg and András Sárközy. It states that, if S is a set of natural numbers with the property that no two numbers in S differ by a square number, then the natural density of S is zero. That is, for every ε > 0, and for all sufficiently large n, the fraction of the numbers up to n that are in S is less than ε. Equivalently, every set of natural numbers with positive upper density contains two numbers whose difference is a square.[1]
