The KANDAHAR BILINGUAL ROCK INSCRIPTION, (also KANDAHAR EDICT OF ASHOKA, sometimes "CHEHEL ZINA EDICT"), is a famous bilingual edict in Greek and Aramaic, proclaimed and carved in stone by the Indian Maurya Empire ruler Ashoka (r.269-233 BCE) around 260Â BCE. It is the very first known inscription of Ashoka, written in year 10 of his reign (260 BCE), preceding all other inscriptions, including his early Minor Rock Edicts, his Barabar caves inscriptions or his Major Rock Edicts.[1] This first inscription was written in Classical Greek and Aramaic exclusively. It was discovered in 1958.[2]
