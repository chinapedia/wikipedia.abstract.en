The DRAVIDIAN LANGUAGES are a language family spoken mainly in Southern India and parts of Central and Eastern India, as well as in Sri Lanka, with small pockets in Southern Afghanistan, Southwestern Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, the Laccadives and the Maldives.[1] There are small but significant immigrant communities outside of South Asia, in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Mauritius and the Philippines since the colonial era. The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are (in descending order of number of speakers): Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes, who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas, such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India.[2] The Dravidian languages are spoken by more than 215 million people in India, Pakistan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.[3]
