LEFT-WING POLITICS supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy.[1][2][3][4] It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished.[5] The term left-wing can also refer to "the radical, reforming, or socialist section of a political party or system".[6]
