FCA POLAND SA (until April 1, 2015 FIAT AUTO POLAND SA) is an automobile factory belonging to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles formed on May 28, 1992 after Fiat acquired Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych (FSM) in Bielsko-Biała and Tychy. At that time, Fiat Auto took over 90% of the company's shares. Until today, the takeover of FSM by Fiat is considered hostile and controversial.[1][2][3]
