The POLITICS OF COLOMBIA take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Colombia is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is carried out by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives of Colombia. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Colombia as "flawed democracy" in 2016.[1]
