The ECONOMY OF ISRAEL is advanced by global standards.[1][2] Israel ranks within the top 20 nations in the world on the latest report of the UN's Human Development Index, which places it in the category of "Very Highly Developed", allowing the country to enjoy a higher standard of living than many other Western countries. The prosperity of Israel's advanced economy allows the country to have a sophisticated welfare state, a modern infrastructure, and a high-technology sector competitively on par with Silicon Valley.[3] Israel has the second-largest number of startup companies in the world after the United States,[4] and the third-largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies after the U.S. and China.[5] Intel[6], Microsoft[7], and Apple[8][9] built their first overseas research and development facilities in Israel, and other high-tech multi-national corporations, such as IBM, Google, HP, Cisco Systems, Facebook and Motorola have opened R&D centres in the country.[10]
