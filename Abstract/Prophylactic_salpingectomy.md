Uterus_and_nearby_organs.jpg PROPHYLACTIC SALPINGECTOMY is a preventative surgical technique performed on patients who are at higher risk of having ovarian cancer, such as individuals who may have pathogenic variants of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.[1] Originally salpingectomy was used in cases of ectopic pregnancies.[2] As a preventative surgery however, it involves the removal of the fallopian tubes. By not removing the ovaries this procedure is advantageous to individuals who are still of child bearing age. It also reduces risks such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis which are associated with removal of the ovaries.[3]
