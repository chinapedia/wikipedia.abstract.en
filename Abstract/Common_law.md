COMMON LAW is the body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Common law looks to precedential decisions of relevant courts, synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts and, if a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as _stare decisis_). If the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases, and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue.[7] The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,[8][9] stands in contrast to statute law, created through the legislative process.[10]
