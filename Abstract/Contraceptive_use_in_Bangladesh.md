Contraceptive use is important to slow population growth as well as a reduction in neonatal mortality, maternal mortality and adverse perinatal outcomes. A National Institute of Population Research and Training study conducted in 2014 found a contraceptive prevalence rate of 62.4%.[1] A recent study, however, found contraceptive prevalence rate 81.27%. It was found that contraceptive use was affected by contextual factors along with individual and fertility related factors. Visits by a family planning worker (FPW) within the previous six months had the biggest impact on contraceptive use. Education level (adjusted) and number of children who are alive were also positively associated with contraceptive use. Contraceptive use was lower among Muslims, desire for a son, living in rural area and Sylhet Division.[2]
