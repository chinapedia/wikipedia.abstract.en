The MUSICIANS CLUB OF NEW YORK is a musicians' club based in New York City. It was founded in 1911 with the intent of providing a social platform for musicians in and around New York, but its mission later expanded to support and promote young musicians through prizes and scholarships, as well as provide recognition for contemporary composers. From 1979 it administered the Koussevitzky International Recording Award (KIRA), and since 1956 has presented the Young Artist Awards, now known as the Serge and Olga Koussevitzky Young Artist Awards.
