The STENO MEDAL, created in 1969, is awarded by the Geological Society of Denmark to honor a prominent geologist.[1][2] It was named after the Dane Niels Steensen (also known as Nicolaus Steno), who is recognized internationally for his effort in the field of geological science. Steno (1638-1686) made groundbreaking contributions to crystallography as well as stratigraphy, which are fundamental disciplines in geology.
