Saint Paulinus}} PAULINUS OF NOLA (; ; , ; also Anglicized as PAULINE OF NOLA;[1]  – June 22,  431), born PONTIUS MEROPIUS ANICIUS PAULINUS,[2] was a Roman poet, writer, and senator who attained the ranks of suffect consul () and governor of Campania (–1) but—following the assassination of the emperor Gratian and under the influence of his Spanish wife Therasia—abandoned his career, was baptized as a Christian, and probably after Therasia's death became bishop of Nola in Campania. While there, he wrote poems in honor of his predecessor St Felix and corresponded with other Christian leaders throughout the empire. He is traditionally credited with the introduction of bells to Christian worship and helped resolve the disputed election of Pope Boniface I.
