Odin_hrafnar.jpg's shoulders in an illustration from an 18th-century Icelandic manuscript]] In Norse mythology, HUGINN (from Old Norse "thought"[1]) and MUNINN (Old Norse "memory"[2] or "mind"[3]) are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin. Huginn and Muninn are attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the _Prose Edda_ and _Heimskringla_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in the _Third Grammatical Treatise_, compiled in the 13th century by Óláfr Þórðarson; and in the poetry of skalds. The names of the ravens are sometimes modernly anglicized as HUGIN and MUNIN.
