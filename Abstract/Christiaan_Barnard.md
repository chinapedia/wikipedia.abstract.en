CHRISTIAAN NEETHLING BARNARD (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first highly publicized heart transplant and the first one in which the patient regained consciousness.[1][2] On 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of accident-victim Denise Darvall into the chest of 54-year-old Louis Washkansky, with Washkansky regaining full consciousness and being able to easily talk with his wife, before dying 18 days later of pneumonia. The anti-rejection drugs that suppressed his immune system were a major contributing factor.[3][4][5][6] Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[7][8][9] Barnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, whose operation was performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for a year and a half and was able to go home from the hospital.[10][11]
