Atchison-bingham.jpg]] Atchison-statue.jpg Courthouse, Plattsburg, Missouri]] DAVID RICE ATCHISON (August 11, 1807January 26, 1886) was a mid-19th century Democratic[1] United States Senator from Missouri.[2] He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate for six years.[3] Atchison served as a major general in the Missouri State Militia in 1838 during Missouri's Mormon War and as a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War under Major General Sterling Price in the Missouri Home Guard. He is best known for the claim that for 24 hours--Sunday, March 4, 1849 through noon on Monday--he may have been Acting President of the United States. This belief, however, is dismissed by nearly all historians, scholars, and biographers.[4][5]
