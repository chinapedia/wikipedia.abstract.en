KANGOL is an English clothing company famous for its headwear. The name Kangol reflects the original production where the K was for knitting,[1] the ANG was for angora, and the OL was for wool. Although no Kangol hat has ever actually been manufactured in Australia, the Kangaroo logo was adopted by Kangol in 1983 because Americans commonly asked where they could get "the Kangaroo hat." [2]
