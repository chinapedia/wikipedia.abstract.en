The_Paston_Treasure.jpg _THE PASTON TREASURE_ is an historically rare record of a _cabinet of treasures_ in British collecting. Commissioned by either Sir Robert Paston or his father Sir William Paston in the early 1670s,[1] the oil painting depicts a small fraction of the Paston family's collected treasures. It was executed by an unknown Dutch artist who resided at the Paston family residence at Oxnead Hall near Aylsham in Norfolk for approximately 3 months, in order to complete the commission.
