Pataliputra_Palace_capital_by_L_A_Waddell_1895.jpg, a Hellenistic anta capital found in the Mauryan Empire palace of Pataliputra, India, dated to the 3rd century BCE.]] HELLENISTIC INFLUENCE ON INDIAN ART reflects the artistic influence of the Greeks on Indian art following the conquests of Alexander the Great, from the end of the 4th century BCE to the first centuries of our era. The Greeks in effect maintained a political presence at the doorstep, and sometimes within India, down to the 1st century CE with the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdoms, with many noticeable influences on the arts of the Maurya Empire (c.321â€“185 BCE) especially.[1] Hellenistic influence on Indian art was also felt for several more centuries during the period of Greco-Buddhist art.[2][3]
