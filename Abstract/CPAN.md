The_logo_of_CPAN.png The COMPREHENSIVE PERL ARCHIVE NETWORK (CPAN) is a repository of over 250,000 software modules and accompanying documentation for 39,000 distributions, written in the Perl programming language by over 12,000 contributors.[1] _CPAN_ can denote either the archive network or the Perl program that acts as an interface to the network and as an automated software installer (somewhat like a package manager). Most software on CPAN is free and open source software.[2] CPAN was conceived in 1993[3] and has been active online since October 1995. It is based on the CTAN model and began as a place to unify the structure of scattered Perl archives.[4]
