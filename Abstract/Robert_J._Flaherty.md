ROBERT JOSEPH FLAHERTY, (;[1] February 16, 1884 â€“ July 23, 1951) was an American filmmaker who directed and produced the first commercially successful feature-length documentary film, _Nanook of the North_ (1922). The film made his reputation and nothing in his later life fully equaled its success, although he continued the development of this new genre of narrative documentary with _Moana_ (1926), set in the South Seas, and _Man of Aran_ (1934), filmed in Ireland's Aran Islands. Flaherty is considered the "father" of both the documentary and the ethnographic film.
