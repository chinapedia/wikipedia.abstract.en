The HALFWAY TRAM STOP is a tram stop situated at the midpoint of the Great Orme Tramway on the slopes of the Great Orme in Llandudno, Wales. The Great Orme Tramway operates as a two-section funicular, and passengers must change at Halfway between the lower section (to and from the Victoria stop) and the upper section (to and from the Summit stop). The stop is also convenient for the nearby Bronze Age Copper Mines.[1][2]
