The HALL EFFECT is the production of a voltage difference (the HALL VOLTAGE) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and to an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.[1] For clarity, the original effect is sometimes called the ORDINARY HALL EFFECT to distinguish it from other "Hall effects" which have different physical mechanisms.
