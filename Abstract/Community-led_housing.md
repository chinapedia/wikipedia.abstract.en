Image_of_Community-led_housing_project_Saffron_Acres_in_Leicester_UK.jpg COMMUNITY-LED HOUSING is where people and communities play a leading role in addressing their own housing needs. The route taken depends on things like the nature of the demand, available resources, location and type of activity. Approaches encompass new build, regeneration and the use of existing buildings. Community-led housing groups may form on the basis of a geographical connection or something else they have in common (e.g. older people, LGBT groups etc.). There is no definitive definition of the term, yet there have been attempts to provide clarity by identifying key principles which underpin all community-led housing activity.[1]
