_ROMOLO ED ERSILIA_ is an opera in three acts composed by Johann Adolph Hasse to an Italian-language libretto by Pietro Metastasio. The opera was commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa to celebrate the marriage of her son Leopold to Maria Luisa of Spain. The opera was first performed on 6 August 1765, the day after their wedding, in the court theatre of the Imperial Palace in Innsbruck.[1][2] The opera received its first performance in modern times in 2011 during the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music.[3]
