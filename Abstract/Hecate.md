HECATE or HEKATE (; , _Hekátē_) is a goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches or a key[1] and in later periods depicted in triple form. She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, light, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery.[2][3] She appears in the _Homeric Hymn_ to Demeter and in Hesiod's _Theogony_, where she is promoted strongly as a great goddess. The place of origin of her following is uncertain, but it is thought that she had popular followings in Thrace.[4]
