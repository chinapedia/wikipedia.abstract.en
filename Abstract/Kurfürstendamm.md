Berlin_-_Kürfurstendamm_Gehsteig.jpg Kurfürstendamm_2003.JPG The KURFÜRSTENDAMM (; colloquially _KU'DAMM_, ) is one of the most famous avenues in Berlin. The street takes its name from the former _Kurfürsten_ (prince-electors) of Brandenburg. This very broad, long boulevard can be considered the Champs-Élysées of Berlin—lined with shops, houses, hotels and restaurants. In particular, many fashion designers have their shops there, as well as several car manufacturers' show rooms.
