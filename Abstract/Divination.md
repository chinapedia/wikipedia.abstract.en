Divinization|Divination (disambiguation)}} DIVINATION (from Latin _divinare_ "to foresee, to foretell, to predict, to prophesy ",[1] related to _divinus_, divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual.[2] Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.[3] Divination_display_at_the_Pitt_Rivers_Museum.jpg in Oxford, England.]] Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.
