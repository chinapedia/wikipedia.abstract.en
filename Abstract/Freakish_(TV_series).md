_FREAKISH_ is an American horror web television series that premiered on October 10, 2016 on Hulu. The series features several high-profile social-media stars and celebrities—including Liza Koshy, Hayes Grier, Meghan Rienks, Leo Howard, and Aislinn Paul—and focuses on a group of high-school students who are trapped inside their school when a nearby chemical plant explodes, resulting in residents and other infected students turning into mutated freaks.
