ENGLEWOOD is a former railroad station at Depot Square in Englewood, New Jersey. Once served by the Erie Railroad's Northern Branch, the building is located in the city's town center along the ROW now used as a branch line by CSX Transportation.[1] The station at Depot Plaza (as it was originally known) was one of the original stations upon opening of the Northern Railroad of New Jersey, which included two others in the town, Van Brunts (later Nordhoff) and Highwood. The building has undergone various incarnations as restaurants, a recording studio, and a performing arts school.[2] The proposed Northern Branch Corridor Project extension the Hudsonâ€“Bergen Light Rail would pass the station along the line.
