A POWER LAW is a mathematical relationship between two quantities in which one is directly proportional to some power of the other. The POWER LAW FOR CACHE MISSES was first established by C. K. Chow in his 1974 paper,[1] supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by Richard Mattson in 1971.[2] The power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges, given a tolerable miss rate, as one of the early steps while designing the cache hierarchy for a uniprocessor system.[3]
