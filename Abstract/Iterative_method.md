In computational mathematics, an ITERATIVE METHOD is a mathematical procedure that uses an initial guess to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions for a class of problems, in which the _n_-th approximation is derived from the previous ones. A specific implementation of an iterative method, including the termination criteria, is an algorithm of the iterative method. An iterative method is called CONVERGENT if the corresponding sequence converges for given initial approximations. A mathematically rigorous convergence analysis of an iterative method is usually performed; however, heuristic-based iterative methods are also common.
