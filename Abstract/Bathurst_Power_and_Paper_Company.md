Established in 1914, the BATHURST POWER AND PAPER COMPANY was a combined logging, lumber mill and wood-pulp paper company that supplied its own electric power from Nepisiguit Grand Falls. Its operations were centred at Bathurst, New Brunswick. After changing hands several times over the course of a century, Smurfit-Stone closed the mill in 2006, and sold the site to a redevelopment firm. The redeveloper, which was already defunct by January 2016, was fined $150,000 in July 2016 under the New Brunswick Clean Environment Act.
