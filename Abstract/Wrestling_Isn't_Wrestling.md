_WRESTLING ISN'T WRESTLING_ is a 2015 short film written and directed by Max Landis. Released for free on YouTube, the film retells the story of WWE professional wrestler Triple H. Like Landis's 2012 short _The Death and Return of Superman_, it consists of an unscripted monologue by Landis on the subject matter, accompanied by sequences with actors performing the parts in the story.
