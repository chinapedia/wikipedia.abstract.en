NIM is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (i.e., nimming) objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap/pile. The goal of the game is to avoid taking the last object.
