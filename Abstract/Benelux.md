The BENELUX UNION (;[1] ;[2] ),[3] also known as simply BENELUX, is a politico-economic union and formal international intergovernmental cooperation (http://www.benelux.int) of three neighboring states in western Europe: Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg.[4] The name _Benelux_ is a portmanteau formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country's name – BElgium, NEtherlands, LUXembourg – and was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944).[5] It is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic and cultural grouping of the three countries.
