CLARENCE DENTON "C. D." TUSKA (August 15, 1896 â€“ June 30, 1985) was an early radio experimenter and amateur operator, who also became one of the first radio receiver manufacturers. He is best known as the co-founder, along with Hiram Percy Maxim, of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). He was also the original editor and owner of the amateur radio publication _QST_, which he subsequently sold to the ARRL in 1919, as part of his reorientation toward professional activities within the radio industry.
