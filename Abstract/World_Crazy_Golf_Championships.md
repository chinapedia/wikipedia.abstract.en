The WORLD CRAZY GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS (WCGC) have been held every year since 2003 at the Adventure Golf Complex on Crazy Golf Course on the seafront of Hastings, East Sussex.[1] Individuals compete for the prestigious trophy with players from all over the world [2] including England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Finland, Germany, Czech Republic, Portugal and the United States.[3][4] However, during its 16-year history (to 2018) only six different players have managed to lift the coveted trophy.
