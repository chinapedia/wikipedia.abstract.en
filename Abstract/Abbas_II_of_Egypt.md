ABBAS II HELMY BEY (also known as _‘Abbās Ḥilmī Pasha_, ) (14 July 1874 – 19 December 1944) was the last Khedive (Ottoman viceroy) of Egypt and Sudan, ruling from 8 January 1892 to 19 December 1914.[1] In 1914, after the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in World War I, the nationalist Khedive was removed by the British, then ruling Egypt, in favor of his more pro-British uncle, Hussein Kamel, marking the _de jure_ end of Egypt's four-century era as a province of the Ottoman Empire, which had begun in 1517.
