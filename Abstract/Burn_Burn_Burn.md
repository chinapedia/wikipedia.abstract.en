_BURN BURN BURN_ is a 2015 British black comedy film, the directorial debut of Chanya Button.[1] The film is a coming-of-age tale, written by Charlie Covell and inspired by the Jack Kerouac novel _On the Road_ published in 1957. The fictional plot follows the story of two girls, Seph (Laura Carmichael) and Alex (Chloe Pirrie), taking a road trip to follow the instructions of their close friend Dan, who has died and given them instructions where to scatter his ashes. The ashes (stored in tupperware in the glove compartment) keep diminishing in quantity as the trip progresses. The film had its World premiere at the BFI London Film Festival 2015.[2][3]
