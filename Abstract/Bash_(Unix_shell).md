BASH is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.[1][2] First released in 1989,[3] it has been used widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS Mojave and earlier versions. A version is also available for Windows 10.[4] It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11. [5]
