MEDITATION is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Scholars have found meditation difficult to define, as practices vary both between traditions and within them.
