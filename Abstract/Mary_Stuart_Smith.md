MARY STUART HARRISON SMITH (1834â€“1917) was an American author, translator, and women's advocate. Her _Virginia Cookery Book_ (1885) is one of the country's early modern cookbooks. In addition to other original works, she published over fifty translated compositions, primarily from the German to English. In 1893 Smith, a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia, attended and spoke on behalf of Virginia women at the Chicago World's Congress, which was designed to highlight women's rights. In 1895 she was among other women invited by the Virginia governor to represent the Commonwealth's female workers at the Board of Women's convention at the International Exposition in Atlanta.
