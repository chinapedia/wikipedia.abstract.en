The artist may have chosen an archaic form for this depiction of baptism by St. Peter.]] BAPTISM (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα _baptisma_; see below) is a Christian rite of admission and adoption,[1] almost invariably with the use of water, into Christianity.[2][3] The synoptic gospels recount that John the Baptist baptised Jesus.[4][5][6][7] Baptism is considered a sacrament in most churches, and as an ordinance in others. Baptism is also called CHRISTENING,[8][9] although some reserve the word "christening" for the baptism of infants.[10] It has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.
