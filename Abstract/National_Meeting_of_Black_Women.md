The first NATIONAL MEETING OF BLACK WOMEN (, I ENMN) took place between 2 and 4 December 1988, in Valen√ßa, Rio de Janeiro, with the participation of 450 women from 17 Brazilian states.[1] The Encontro Nacional resulted from a great impulse to organize among black women, mainly the fluminenses, who already prepared the I Encontro Estadual de Mulheres Negras of Rio de Janeiro, in 1987.
