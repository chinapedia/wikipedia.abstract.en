At least two and possibly three vessels have borne the name _PHILIP DUNDAS_ (or _Phillip Dundas_), named for Philip Dundas (c.1763â€“1807), a Scottish British East India Company naval officer, president of the East India Marine Board, and superintendent of Bombay. He returned to Britain and became a Member of Parliament before returning to the Far East to become governor of Prince of Wales Island.
