In 2016, _Allure_ magazine fashion director Rachael Wang wrote, "Going braless is as old as feminism but it seems to be bubbling to the surface more recently as a direct response to Third Wave moments like #freethenipple hashtag campaign, increased trans-visibility like Caitlyn Jenner's ''Vanity Fair ''cover ... and Lena Dunhamâ€™s show _Girls_ (which features young girls often without bras)."[2] Going braless, which for many years was considered a political statement, has in recent years become fashionable.[3]
