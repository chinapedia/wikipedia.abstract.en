The ORGANIZATION OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN SUPREME AUDIT INSTITUTIONS (OLACEFS) is an international, autonomous, independent, apolitical and permanent organization.[1] Its origins can be traced back to the First Congress of Latin American Supreme Audit Institutions - CLADEFS - held in 1963 in Caracas, Venezuela, in response to the need for a forum for exchanging ideas and experiences relating to government control, and for promoting cooperation and development between supreme audit institutions. At the Congress it was recommended that a Latin American Institute of Fiscal Control be created to carry out specialized research and serve as a center for information, education, coordination and mutual assistance between audit institutions.
