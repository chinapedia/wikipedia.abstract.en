CHOLERA is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_.[1][2] Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.[3] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days.[4] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[5] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[6] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[7] Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish.[8] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[9]
