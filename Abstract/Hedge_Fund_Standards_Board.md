The STANDARDS BOARD FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS (SBAI), formerly known as the HEDGE FUND STANDARDS BOARD, is an international standard-setting body for the alternative investment industry and sets the voluntary standard of best practices and practices endorsed by its members. Its primary role is to be the custodian of the Alternative Investment Standards (formerly known as "the Standards"), which are designed to create a "framework of transparency, integrity and good governance" in the way the hedge fund industry operates.[1][2]
