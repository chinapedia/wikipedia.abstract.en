Studies that are _IN VIVO_ (Latin for "within the living"; often not italicized in English[1][2][3]) are those in which the effects of various biological entities are tested on whole, living organisms or cells, usually animals, including humans, and plants, as opposed to a tissue extract or dead organism. This is not to be confused with experiments done _in vitro_ ("within the glass"), i.e., in a laboratory environment using test tubes, Petri dishes, etc. Examples of investigations _in vivo_ include: the pathogenesis of disease by comparing the effects of bacterial infection with the effects of purified bacterial toxins; the development of non-antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and new drugs generally; and new surgical procedures. Consequently, animal testing and clinical trials are major elements of _in vivo_ research. _In vivo_ testing is often employed over _in vitro_ because it is better suited for observing the overall effects of an experiment on a living subject. In drug discovery, for example, verification of efficacy _in vivo_ is crucial, because _in vitro_ assays can sometimes yield misleading results with drug candidate molecules that are irrelevant _in vivo_ (e.g., because such molecules cannot reach their site of _in vivo_ action, for example as a result of rapid catabolism in the liver).[4]
