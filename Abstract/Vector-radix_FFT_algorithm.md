The VECTOR-RADIX FFT ALGORITHM, is a multidimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm that divides the transform dimensions by arbitrary radices. It breaks a multidimensional (MD) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) down into successively smaller MD DFTs until, ultimately, only trivial MD DFTs need to be evaluated.[1]
