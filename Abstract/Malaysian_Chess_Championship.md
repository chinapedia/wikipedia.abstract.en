The MALAYSIAN CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP is organized by the Malaysian Chess Federation (MCF; ). Known as the NATIONAL CLOSED CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP prior to 2016, the first edition was held in 1974. A separate MALAYSIAN WOMEN'S CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP has also been held annually since 1990. FIDE Master Christi Hon has won the national title a record five times, while Woman International Master Siti Zulaikha Foudzi has won the women's title a record eight times. Curiously, it has occurred twice that a pair of siblings has won the national and the women's titles in the same year: Kamal Ariffin Wahiddudin and Nurul Huda Wahiduddin in 1991, and Zarul Shazwan Zullkafli and Nur Shazwani Zullkafli in 2007.[1]
