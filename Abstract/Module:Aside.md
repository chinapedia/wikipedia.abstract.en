-- This module is an experiment in an altered discussion dynamic for Wikipedia forums. -- It presents a brief digest of the referenced discussion on a user's talk subpage. -- The full conversation remains available via V-D-E buttons (V = view the talk subpage, -- D = file a comment to the user's MAIN talk page like if there's something you want him to 'admin' or to request an invite as applicable -- E = edit the talk subpage -- The digest should present usernames and the first words of each comment, for the past N comments -- One intention is to allow off-topic conversations to be less obtrusive on the parent thread. -- Another is that, potentially, some of these may be invite-only conversations in some forum where that is deemed appropriate. -- Discussions of this type might be indexed in multiple specialized forums. -- Part of the experiment is that if users feel *invited* to a discussion, it gives editors a chance to express mutual esteem, -- as a counterbalance against the usual where they only really talk personally when in conflict. Not sure this will really happen...
