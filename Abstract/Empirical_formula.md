In chemistry, the EMPIRICAL FORMULA of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound.[1] A simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sulphur monoxide, or SO, would simply be SO, as is the empirical formula of disulphur dioxide, S₂O₂. This means that sulphur monoxide and disulphur dioxide, both compounds of sulphur and oxygen, will have the same empirical formula. However, their molecular formulas, which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound, may not be the same.
