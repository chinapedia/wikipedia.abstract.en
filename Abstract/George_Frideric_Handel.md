GEORGE FRIDERIC (or FREDERICK) HANDEL (; born ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] â€“ 14 April 1759) was a German, later British, Baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle-upon-Saale and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727.[1] He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.
