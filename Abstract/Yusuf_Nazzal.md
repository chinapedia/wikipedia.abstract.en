YUSUF NAZZAL (1937 – 6 September 1972) alias 'TONY', was the second in command of eight Palestinian terrorists that invaded 31 Connollystraße in the Munich Olympic Village on 5 September 1972. Nine members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage after two members, weightlifter Yossef Romano and wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg, were killed in the initial takeover. Television images broadcast to the billions of people watching around the world show Nazzal frequently throughout the crisis, seemingly always smoking, wearing sunglasses, open neck red shirt and a cowboy hat, which led him to be identified as the 'Cowboy'.[1] According to author Serge Groussard, Nazzal "liked to be called Guevara".[2]
