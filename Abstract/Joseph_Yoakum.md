JOSEPH ELMER YOAKUM (February 22, ca. 1890 â€“ December 25, 1972) was a self-taught landscape artist of African-American and possible Native American descent,[1] who drew landscapes in a highly individual style. He was 76 when he started to record his memories in the form of imaginary landscapes, and he produced over 2,000 drawings during the last decade of his life. His work is an example of Outsider Art.
