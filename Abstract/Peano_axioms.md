In mathematical logic, the PEANO AXIOMS, also known as the DEDEKINDâ€“PEANO AXIOMS or the PEANO POSTULATES, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.
