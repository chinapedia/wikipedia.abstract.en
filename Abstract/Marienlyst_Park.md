MARIENLYST PARK (Danish: Marienlystparken) is a public park in Hasle in the Aarhus V district, north-west Aarhus, Denmark.[1] The park is situated west of the _Herredsvang_ neighborhood along the street _Fjældevænget Busvej_ to the south and Brendstrup Forest to the west. Marienlyst Park is one of the largest parks in Aarhus and features both landscaped lawns and artificial forested hills. Facilities include an amphitheatre, soccer fields, playgrounds and a 6-hole golf course.[2] Marienlyst Park was established in connection with the development of western Hasle in the 1970s and today forms part of a green corridor extending from Vestereng to Brabrand Lake. The park is owned by Aarhus Municipality and is managed by the municipal department _Natur og Miljø_ (Nature and Environment). Marienlyst Park can be rented for public events.[3][4]
