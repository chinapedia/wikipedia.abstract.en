561 ZÜM QUEEN WEST is a rapid transit route in Brampton, Ontario that was introduced on September 6, 2016 as part of Züm phase 2. It runs from Mount Pleasant GO Station where it connects with 505 Züm Bovaird and continues west along Bovaird Drive, south along Mississauga Road, and east along Queen Street to Downtown Brampton Terminal. The route currently operates only on weekdays during rush hours and midday. This is mainly due because of the widening project along Queen Street from Chinguacousy Road to Mississauga Road is still ongoing or lower ridership that as it is on 501 Züm Queen. The Brampton Transit 1 Queen shares the entire length with this route and operates 30 minutes or better all day, every day.
