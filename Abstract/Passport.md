Passports-assorted.jpg A PASSPORT is a travel document, usually issued by a country's government, that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder primarily for the purpose of international travel.[1] Standard passports may contain information such as the holder's name, place and date of birth, photograph, signature, and other relevant identifying information. All countries' governments have either begun issuing or plan to issue biometric information in a microchip embedded in the passport, making them machine-readable and difficult to counterfeit.[2] , there are over 150 jurisdictions issuing these e-passports.[3] Previously issued non-biometric machine-readable passports usually remain valid until their respective expiration dates.
