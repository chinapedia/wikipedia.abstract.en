CZESŁAW RATKA (born 1952) is a Polish engineer and translator.[1] He graduated at Politechnika Śląska (Silesian University of Technology) in Gliwice.[2] He specialised in electronics.[3] He was especially concerned with hygrometry. He has been interested in Spanish language and literature for forty years. He is famous for translating two parts[4] of _La Araucana_ (_The Araucaniad_) by the 16th-century Spanish poet Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga (1533-1594). For this translation he was awarded with the Cervantes Institute Award.[5][6][7] In his translation Czesław Ratka retained the ottava rima of the original. His version of the poem is regarded as excellent by critics and other translators, for example by Wojciech Charchalis[8] and Florian Śmieja.[9] Czesław Ratka's work was compared to Piotr Kochanowski's translation of _Jerusalem Delivered_ by Torquato Tasso (1618).[10]
