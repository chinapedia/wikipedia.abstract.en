_LA CONVERSIONE E MORTE DI SAN GUGLIELMO_ (_The Conversion and Death of Saint William_) is a sacred musical drama (_dramma sacro_) in three parts by the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The libretto, by Ignazio Mancini, is based on the life of Saint William of Aquitaine as recounted by Laurentius Surius.[1] It was Pergolesi's first operatic work, possibly written as a study exercise for his conservatory. The work was premiered at the Monastery of Sant'Agnello Maggiore, Naples in the summer of 1731.[2]
