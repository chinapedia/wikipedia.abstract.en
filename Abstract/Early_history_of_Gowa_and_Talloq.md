The Makassar kingdom of Gowa emerged around 1300 as one of many agrarian chiefdoms in the Indonesian peninsula of South Sulawesi. From the sixteenth century onward, Gowa and its coastal ally Talloq became the first power to dominate most of the peninsula,[1] enabled by wide-ranging administrative and military reforms, including the creation of the first bureaucracy in South Sulawesi. Sixteenth-century Gowa has been characterized as an empire[2] and the early history of the kingdom has been analyzed as an example of state formation.
