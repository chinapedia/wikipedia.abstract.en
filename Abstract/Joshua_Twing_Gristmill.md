The JOSHUA TWING GRISTMILL is a historic industrial facility at 450 North Main Street in the city of Barre, Vermont. Built in 1844, it is a remarkably high-style example of Greek Revival architecture for an essentially utilitarian industrial structure. Joshua Twing, its builder, was engaged for many years in a variety of industrial pursuits, primarily considered with engineering improvements in water wheels and turbines. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[1]
