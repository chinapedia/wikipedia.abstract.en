RUDOLF JOSEPH LORENZ STEINER (27 (or 25) February 1861[1] â€“ 30 March 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect, economist[2] and esotericist.[3][4] Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published philosophical works including _The Philosophy of Freedom_. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy; other influences include Goethean science and Rosicrucianism.[5]
