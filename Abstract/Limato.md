LIMATO (foaled 8 February 2012) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. He is a sprinter who has produced his best performances over six and seven furlongs on good or firm ground. He was one of the best British juveniles of 2014 when he was undefeated in four races including the Rose Bowl Stakes and the Two-Year-Old Trophy, although, as a gelding he was ineligible to run in many of the most important races. In the following year he won the Pavilion Stakes and the Park Stakes as well as finishing second in the Commonwealth Cup and the Prix de la Foret. As a four-year-old he recorded his first Group One success in the July Cup before finishing second in the Nunthorpe Stakes and then winning the Prix de la Foret. At five Limato was placed twice in Group One races and returned to winning form when taking the Challenge Stakes in October. In 2018 he struggled for form early in the year but went on to win the Hopeful Stakes, Garrowby Stakes and a second Challenge Stakes.
