_POPE MFG. CO. V. GORMULLY_, 144 U.S. 224 (1892),[1] was an early United States Supreme Court decision refusing, on public policy grounds, to enforce an agreement not to contest patent validity. The Supreme Court later relied on _Pope_ in _Lear, Inc. v. Adkins_[2] as authority in support of overruling the doctrine of licensee estoppel. That doctrine had prohibited patent licensees from challenging the validity of patents under which they had been licensed.
