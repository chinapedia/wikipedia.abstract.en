_LOAD_ is the sixth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on June 4, 1996 by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally. The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band's typical thrash metal style, which alienated much of the band's fanbase.[1][2][3] It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock[4] and alternative rock.[5] Drummer Lars Ulrich said about _Load_{{'s}} more exploratory nature, "This album and what we're doing with it â€“ that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die".[6] At 79 minutes, it is Metallica's longest studio album.
