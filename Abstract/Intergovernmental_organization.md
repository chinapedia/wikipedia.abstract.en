An INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION or INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION (IGO) is an organization composed primarily of sovereign states (referred to as _member states_), or of other intergovernmental organizations. Intergovernmental organizations are called international organizations, although that term may also include international non-governmental organization such as international nonprofit organizations or multinational corporations.
