_LE MOUVEMENT GÉOGRAPHIQUE_ was a geographical magazine published in Brussels from 1884 to 1922. It was initially edited by Alphonse-Jules Wauters, and primarily promoted and documented Belgian colonisation of Congo. From 1890, it was owned by the Compagnies du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie.[1] Another periodical edited by Wauters, _Le Congo illustré_, was folded into the _Mouvement Géographique_ in 1896.[2]
