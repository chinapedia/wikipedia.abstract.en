The ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS were four laws passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.[1][2] They made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen (Naturalization Act), allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens who were deemed dangerous (Alien Friends Act of 1798)[3] or who were from a hostile nation (Alien Enemy Act of 1798),[4] and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government (Sedition Act of 1798).[5]
