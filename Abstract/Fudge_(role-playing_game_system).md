_FUDGE_ is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games.[1] The name "_FUDGE_" was once an acronym for _Freeform Universal Donated_ (later, _Do-it-yourself_) _Gaming Engine_[2] and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game's design goals. _Fudge_ has been nominated for an Origins Award for _Best Role-Playing Game System_ for the _Deryni Role-Playing Game_.[3][4]
