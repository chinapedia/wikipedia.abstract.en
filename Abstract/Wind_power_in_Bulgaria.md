At the end of 2015 the wind power in Bulgaria had production capacity of 691MW .[1] That capacity generated 1,436 GWh for 2015 which represented 3.23% of the whole power generated in the country for that period. The capacity factor for wind power in Bulgaria in 2015 was about 23.7%. We can get to this number knowing that at the end of 2015 the wind power capacity was 0.6912GW and during 2015 there was no new wind capacity installed. For 8766 hours in one year that capacity could generate 0.6912GW * 8766 = 6059.0592GWh power, but it generated only 1436GWh power which is (1436/ 6059) *100 = 23.7%
