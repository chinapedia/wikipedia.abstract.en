MOLYBDENUM is a chemical element with the symbol MO and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin _molybdaenum_, from Ancient Greek __, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.[1] Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.[2]
