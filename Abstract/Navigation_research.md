Whereas originally the term Navigation applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination, NAVIGATION RESEARCH deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general. It can be defined as "The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location" (Franz, Mallot, 2000). It concerns basically all moving agents, biological or artificial, autonomous or remote-controlled.
