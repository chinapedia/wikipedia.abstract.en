BACKGAMMON is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in Mesopotamia.[1][2][3][4] It is a two player game where each player has fifteen pieces (_checkers_) which move between twenty-four triangles (_points_) according to the roll of two dice. The objective of the game is to be first to _bear off_, i.e. move all fifteen checkers off the board. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games.
