_CARDIOCEPHALOIDES LONGICOLLIS_ is a species of flukes. The life cycle of _C. LONGICOLLIS_ is asexual as well as complex. Its asexual stage resides in the body of whelks where it replicates many times, and eventually its eggs are dispersed in the water through feces. _C.longicollis_ begin their early life as free swimming miracidia larvae in the water. They go on to infect snails (intermediate host), and a variety of fishes, usually second intermediate host, in the form of a cercariae. While _C.longicollis_ has previously been recorded in 19 fish species, researchers have found 12 other species which are viable hosts for _C.longicollis_ making for a grand total of 31 aquatic species. The final host for this parasite are the gulls that eat the infected fish in which the parasite has formed cysts in.
