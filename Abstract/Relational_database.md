A RELATIONAL DATABASE is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.[1] A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS). Virtually all relational database systems use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.[2]
