FORT FREDENSBORG is situated along the Gulf of Guinea, in the Greater Accra Region in Old Ningo and was built in 1734.[1] The Danish fort was once used as a slave trading station. However, with the abolition of the slave trade, it soon decayed such that by 1835 only one man was stationed in the fort ‘to maintain the flag’.
