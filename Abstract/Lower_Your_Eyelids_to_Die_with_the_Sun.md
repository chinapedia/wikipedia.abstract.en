"LOWER YOUR EYELIDS TO DIE WITH THE SUN" is a song by French electronic music artist M83, which serves as the final track of the band's third album, _Before the Dawn Heals Us_ (2005). It is a 10-minute ambient post-rock instrumental characterized by monolithic arrangements of choral singers and spacious drums. The song has been used in several films and trailers due to its dramatic nature, and has also received critical acclaim, with _Slant Magazine_ even ranking it the best song M83 has released, stating that "it would be missing the point of M83 entirely to crown 'Lower Your Eyelids to Die with the Sun' as their greatest song for any other reason than [that] it remains the first instance where the band achieved something truly mythical."[1] A previously unreleased music video was shared by frontman Anthony Gonzalez in anticipation of Mute Records re-releasing M83's first three studio albums.[2]
