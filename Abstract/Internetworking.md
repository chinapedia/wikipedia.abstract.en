INTERNETWORKING is "the concept of interconnecting different types of networks to build a large, global network"[1] such that any pair of connected hosts can exchange packets. To build an internetwork, the following are needed:[2] A standardized scheme to address packets to any host on any participating network; a standardized protocol defining format and handling of transmitted packets; components interconnecting the participating networks by routing packets to their destinations based on standardized addresses.
