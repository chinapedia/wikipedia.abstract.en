OKĀSA (ဩကာသ, also AWGATHA and COMMON BUDDHIST PRAYER) is a formulaic Burmese Buddhist prayer that is recited to initiate acts of Buddhist devotion, including obeisance to the Buddha and Buddhist monks.[1] The term _okāsa_ literally means "permission" in Pali,[2] and is used to request permission to pay homage, seek forgiveness of any intentional and unintentional offenses, and precedes the undertaking of the Five Precepts.[3][4] Minor variations of this Burmese language prayer exist from one Buddhist monastery to another.
