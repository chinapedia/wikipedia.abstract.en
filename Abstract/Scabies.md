SCABIES, also known as the SEVEN-YEAR ITCH, is a contagious skin infestation by the mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_.[1][2] The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash.[3] Occasionally, tiny burrows may be seen in the skin.[4] In a first-ever infection a person will usually develop symptoms in between two and six weeks.[5] During a second infection symptoms may begin in as little as 24 hours.[6] These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline.[7] The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children.[8] The itch is often worse at night.[9] Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin.[10]
