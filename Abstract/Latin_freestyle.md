LATIN FREESTYLE (local terms include MIAMI FREESTYLE[1]) or simply FREESTYLE MUSIC[2] is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the New York metropolitan area in the 1980s.[3] It experienced its greatest popularity from the late 1980s until the early 1990s. It continues to be produced today and enjoys some degree of popularity, especially in urban settings. A common theme of freestyle lyricism is heartbreak in the city.[4] The first freestyle hit is largely attributed to "Let the Music Play" by Shannon.
