LS IV-14 116 is a hot subdwarf located approximately 2,000 light years away on the border between the constellations Capricornus and Aquarius. It has a surface temperature of approximately 34,000 Â± 500 kelvins.[1] Along with stars HE 2359-2844 and HE 1256-2738, LS IV-14 116 forms a new group of star called heavy metal subdwarfs. These are thought to be stars contracting to the extended horizontal branch after a helium flash and ejection of their atmospheres at the tip of the red giant branch.[2]
