JANSJE GRETHA (JANS) SCHUIRINGA (Balmahuizen, July 9, 1887 - Utrecht, August 1, 1975), also known as MISS SCHUIRINGA, was one of the first people in the Netherlands who held the title of dentist.[1] The work that Schuiringa carried out between 1920 and 1957 as a professor of prosthetic dentistry at the Institute of Dentistry in Utrecht,[2] was of major significance for the development of the discipline of maxillofacial dental surgery.[3] Maxillofacial dental surgery, which operates on the jaw and the face, involves making prosthetics for the face and teeth.
