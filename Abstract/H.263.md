H.263 is a video compression standard originally designed as a low-bit-rate compressed format for videoconferencing. It was standardised by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) in a project ending in 1995/1996, and developed with a number of companies, primarily Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and Panasonic. It is a member of the H.26x family of video coding standards in the domain of the ITU-T.
