Two human polls and a committee's selections comprised the 2017 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) football rankings, in addition to various publications' preseason polls. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseasonâ€”the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. One additional poll, the College Football Playoff (CFP) ranking, is released midway through the season after the ninth week.
