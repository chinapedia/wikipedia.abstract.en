CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJI RAJE AIRPORT is proposed to serve the city of Pune, India. The greenfield airport will be located near the villages of Ambodi, Sonori, Kumbharvalan, Ekhatpur-Munjawadi, Khanwadi, Pargaon Memane, Rajewadi, Aamble, Tekwadi, Vanpuri, Udachiwadi, Singapur near Saswad and Jejuri in Purandar taluka of Pune District in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The CIDCO will hold 51 per cent stake in the SPV, while MADC's stake will be around 19 per cent. The remaining 30 per cent will be divided between the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).[1] The Government of Maharashtra has declared that the first flight from this airport is expected to take off by 2019 and the airport will be named after Maratha King Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj who was born at Purandhar fort.[2] The Airports Authority of India conducted surveys on various areas near Pune for a new airport for the city. Initially a site near Chakan was fixed for the airport. But due to opposition from local farmers and the mountainous terrain, the government decided to set the new airport in Purandar taluka as it was a flatter region compared to Chakan. The proposed airport in Purandar will be spread over 2,400 hectares.[3][4] This airport will also boost trade from Pune and neighbouring districts as it will have its own dedicated cargo terminal.[5]
