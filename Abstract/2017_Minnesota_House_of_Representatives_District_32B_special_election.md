A SPECIAL ELECTION was held in the U.S. state of Minnesota on February 14, 2017, to elect a new representative for District 32B in the Minnesota House of Representatives, caused by a ruling by the Minnesota Supreme Court that incumbent Bob Barrett was ineligible to be a candidate in the general election on November 8, 2016. Anne Neu, the Republican nominee, won the special election.
