The GREAT VOWEL SHIFT was a series of changes in the pronunciation of the English language that took place primarily between 1350 and the 1600s and 1700s, beginning in southern England and today having influenced effectively all dialects of English. Through this vowel shift, all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation. Some consonant sounds changed as well, particularly those that became silent; the term _Great Vowel Shift_ is sometimes used to include these consonant changes.[1][2]
