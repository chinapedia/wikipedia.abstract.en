CHLOROMETHYLANDROSTENEDIOL (CMA), also known as 4-CHLORO-17Α-METHYL-ANDROST-4-ENE-3Β,17Β-DIOL, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 4-androstenediol that was never marketed.[1] It was first encountered in 2005 when it was introduced as a "dietary supplement" and putative prohormone under the name PROMAGNON by an online vendor called Peak Performance Laboratories.[2] CMA was voluntarily discontinued by Gaspari Nutrition in late 2006, likely fearing government sanctions if it continued to sell the product.[3]
