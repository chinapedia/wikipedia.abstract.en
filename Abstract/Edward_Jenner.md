EDWARD JENNER, FRS FRCPE[1] (17 May 1749 â€“ 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine.[2][3] The terms _vaccine_ and _vaccination_ are derived from _Variolae vaccinae_ (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1796 in the long title of his _Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox_, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.[4]
