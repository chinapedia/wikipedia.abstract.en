Talis02.png comes from the _Black Pullet_ grimoire.]] A GRIMOIRE ( ) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities and demons.[1] In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the Bible) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all _books on magic_ could be thought of as grimoires, not all _magical books_ should be thought of as grimoires.[2]
