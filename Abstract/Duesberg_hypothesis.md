The DUESBERG HYPOTHESIS is the claim, associated with University of California, Berkeley professor Peter Duesberg, that various noninfectious factors such as but not limited to, recreational and pharmaceutical drug use are the cause of AIDS, and that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is merely a harmless passenger virus.[1] The scientific consensus is that the Duesberg hypothesis is incorrect and that HIV is the cause of AIDS.[2][3] The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, biochemist vitamin proponent David Rasnick, and journalist Celia Farber. The scientific community contends that Duesberg's arguments are the result of cherry-picking predominantly outdated scientific data[4] and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIV's role in AIDS.[5]
