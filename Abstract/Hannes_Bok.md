Science_fiction_quarterly_1942sum.jpg''. _Starstone World_ has never been published in book form; it is believed that magazine text was cut for publication, and Bok's full-length manuscript has been lost.]] HANNES BOK, pseudonym for WAYNE FRANCIS WOODARD (July 2, 1914 â€“ April 11, 1964), was an American artist and illustrator, as well as an amateur astrologer and writer of fantasy fiction and poetry. He painted nearly 150 covers for various science fiction, fantasy, and detective fiction magazines, as well as contributing hundreds of black and white interior illustrations. Bok's work graced the pages of calendars and early fanzines, as well as dust jackets from specialty book publishers like Arkham House, Llewellyn, Shasta Publishers, and Fantasy Press. His paintings achieved a luminous quality through the use of an arduous glazing process, which was learned from his mentor, Maxfield Parrish. Bok shared one of the inaugural 1953 Hugo Awards for science fiction achievement (best Cover Artist).[1]
