XXVI_Forum_Ekonomiczne_w_Krynicy_–_Stary_Dom_Zdrojowy.jpg KRYNICA ECONOMIC FORUM - an annual international meeting of economic and political elites held in the first half of September^([1]) at the ski and spa resort of Krynica-Zdrój in southern Poland. The Forum was founded by Zygmunt Berdychowski[1] in 1992 and it is organised by the Foundation Institute for Eastern Studies in Warsaw. Within 25 years of its history the Krynica Economic Forum has evolved from a small conference, with about 100 participants, to one of the biggest and most recognisable meetings of the political and business leaders of Central and Eastern Europe[2], and is therefore sometimes referred to as the "Eastern Davos".[3]
