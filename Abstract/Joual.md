_JOUAL_ () is an accepted name for the linguistic features of basilectal Quebec French that are associated with the French-speaking working class in Montreal which has become a symbol of national identity for some. _Joual_ is stigmatized by some and celebrated by others. While _joual_ is often considered a sociolect of the Québécois working class, many feel that perception is outdated.
