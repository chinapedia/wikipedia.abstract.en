US_Army_Excellence_in_Armor_Coin.png EXCELLENCE IN ARMOR (EIA) is a program of the United States Army that awards outstanding Armor and Cavalry Soldiers whose performance is routinely above the standard and demonstrate superior leadership potential. The EIA was initially proposed in May 1984 and implemented in October 1987. The program rewards outstanding armor and cavalry Soldiers with a Certificate of Achievement, a challenge coin from the U.S. Army's Chief of Armor, awarding of the personnel development skill identifier (PDSI) “E4J,” and will set the Soldier apart from their peers during promotion boards.[1][2][3]
