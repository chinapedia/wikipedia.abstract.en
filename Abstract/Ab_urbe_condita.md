of Pacatianus, usurper of Roman emperor Philip in 248. It reads _ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO_, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]] _AB URBE CONDITA_ (), or _ANNO URBIS CONDITÆ_ (), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by classical historians to refer to a given year in Ancient Rome. _Ab urbe condita_ literally means "from the founding of the City", while _anno urbis conditæ_ means "in the year since the City's founding". Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, 753 BC, would be written AUC 1, while AD 1 would be AUC 754. The foundation of the Empire in 27 BC would be AUC 727.
