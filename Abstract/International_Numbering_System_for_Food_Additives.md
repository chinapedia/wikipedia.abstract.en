The INTERNATIONAL NUMBERING SYSTEM FOR FOOD ADDITIVES (INS) is a European-based naming system for food additives, aimed at providing a short designation of what may be a lengthy actual name.[1] It is defined by Codex Alimentarius, the international food standards organisation of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). The information is published in the document _Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives_, first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011. The INS is an open list, "subject to the inclusion of additional additives or removal of existing ones on an ongoing basis".[2]
