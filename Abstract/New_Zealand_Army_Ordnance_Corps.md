THE NEW ZEALAND ARMY ORDNANCE CORPS (NZAOC) was a Corps whose function was to provide, receive, store, repair, maintain, and issue: ordnance stores, vehicles, ammunition, foodstuffs, and ammunition. Ordnance Organisations had previously existed in the Royal New Zealand Artillery[1] and the New Zealand Defence Stores Department, who for the Territorial Army established a temporary Ordnance Deport organisation and trained staff in Ordnance functions for the 1913 and 1914 Annual camps,[2][3][4][5][6] so that on the eve of the great war a cadre existed within the Territorial Army to establish an Ordnance Corps to support the NZEF.
