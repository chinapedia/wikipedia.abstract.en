The _ENCHIRIDION_ or _HANDBOOK OF EPICTETUS_ (, _Enkheirídion Epiktḗtou_) is a short manual of Stoic ethical advice compiled by Arrian, a 2nd-century disciple of the Greek philosopher Epictetus. Although the content is mostly derived from the _Discourses of Epictetus_, it is not a summary of the _Discourses_ but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. The book is thus a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.
