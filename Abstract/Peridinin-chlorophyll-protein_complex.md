The PERIDININ-CHLOROPHYLL-PROTEIN COMPLEX (PCP or PERCP) is a soluble molecular complex consisting of the PERIDININ-CHLOROPHYLL A-PROTEIN bound to peridinin, chlorophyll, and lipids. The peridinin molecules absorb light in the blue-green wavelengths (470 to 550Â nm) and transfer energy to the chlorophyll molecules with extremely high efficiency.[1] PCP complexes are found in many photosynthetic dinoflagellates, in which they may be the primary light-harvesting complexes.[2]
