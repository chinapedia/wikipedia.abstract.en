ALBERT CLINTON CONNER (September 5, 1848 - April 13, 1929) was an American Impressionist painter who was an integral part of the Richmond Group of painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After moving to California, Conner helped found The Painters' Club of Los Angeles in 1906, which lay the groundwork for the creation of the California Art Club three years later in 1909.
