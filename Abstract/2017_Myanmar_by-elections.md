The 2017 MYANMAR BY-ELECTIONS were held on 1 April 2017. The elections were held to fill 19 vacant parliamentary seats: nine in the Pyithu Hluttaw, three in the Amyotha Hluttaw, and seven in regional parliaments of Kayah State Hluttaw and Shan State Hluttaw.[1] The seats were left by those who became government leaders or officials after the 2015 general election, or unable to be held due to instability at that time.[2][3]
