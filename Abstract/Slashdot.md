_SLASHDOT_ (sometimes abbreviated as _/._) is a social news website that originally billed itself as "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters". It features news stories on science, technology, and politics that are submitted and evaluated by site users and editors. Each story has a comments section attached to it where users can add online comments. The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda, also known as "CmdrTaco", and classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos". In 2012, they sold it to[1] DHI Group, Inc. (i.e., Dice Holdings International, which created the Dice.com website for tech job seekers[2][3]). In January 2016, BizX acquired Slashdot Media, including both SLASHDOT.ORG and SourceForge.[4][5][6]
