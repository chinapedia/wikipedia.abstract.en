AFRICAN SONG (19 March 1977 â€“ after 1993) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was inexpensively bought as a yearling and had a brief racing career which comprised only five races in a four-month period in the spring and summer of 1980. After finishing third on his debut he won a minor race at Sandown before finishing third in the Duke of York Stakes. At Royal Ascot in June he recorded an emphatic victory in the Group One King's Stand Stakes but his career was then interrupted by injury and he finished last in his only subsequent race. He made little impact as a breeding stallion.
