The 2017 BOSTON RED SOX SEASON was the 117th season in the team's history, and their 106th season at Fenway Park. They finished with a 93â€“69 record, the same as their previous season, two games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. It was also the team's first season in 15 years without David Ortiz, due to his retirement. The Red Sox won their second straight American League East championship, the first time the team has won the division (which was established in 1969) in consecutive years; it was their ninth division title overall. In the postseason, they lost in four games in the American League Division Series to the eventual 2017 World Series champions, the Houston Astros.
