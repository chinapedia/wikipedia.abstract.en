CHAGAS DISEASE, also known as AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protist _Trypanosoma cruzi_.[1] It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae, or "kissing bugs".[2] The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.[3] After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms.[4][5] The other 30–40% of people develop further symptoms 10–30 years after the initial infection,[6] including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20–30%, leading to heart failure.[7] An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.[8]
