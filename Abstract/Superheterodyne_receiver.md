Toshiba_Vacuum_tube_Radio.jpg Superheterod_radio.JPG circuit from around 1975]] A SUPERHETERODYNE RECEIVER, often shortened to SUPERHET, is a type of radio receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I.[1] Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle.
