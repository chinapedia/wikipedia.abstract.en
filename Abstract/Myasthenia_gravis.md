MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.[1] The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing.[2] It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking.[3] Onset can be sudden.[4] Those affected often have a large thymus or develop a thymoma.[5]
