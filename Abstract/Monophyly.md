Clade-grade_II.png: both blue and red groups are _monophyletic_. The green group is _paraphyletic_ because it is missing a monophyletic group (the blue group) that shares a common ancestorâ€”the lowest green vertical stem.]] Monophyly,_paraphyly,_polyphyly.pngs, showing a _monophyletic_ taxon: _the simians_ (in yellow); a _paraphyletic_ taxon: _the prosimians_ (in cyan, including the red patch); and a _polyphyletic_ group: _the night-active primates, i.e., the lorises and the tarsiers_ (in red)]] Phylogenetic-Groups.svg (in yellow): _the group of "reptiles and birds"_, contains its most recent common ancestor and all descendants of that ancestor. + A _paraphyletic_ taxon (in cyan): _the group of reptiles_, contains its most recent common ancestor, but does not contain all the descendants (namely Aves) of that ancestor. + A _polyphyletic_ "group" (in red): _the group of all warm-blooded animals_ (Aves and Mammalia), does not contain the most recent common ancestor of all its members; this group is not seen as a taxonomic unit and is not considered a taxon by modern systematists.]]
