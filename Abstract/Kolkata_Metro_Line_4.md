The LINE 4 or Noapara - Barasat Line of the Kolkata Metro is an 16.876Â km[1] long metro route from Noapara to Barasat in North 24 Parganas, which is under construction. It is being built by RVNL. It is a fully elevated corridor. It will have an interchange station at the Dum Dum Airport with line 6 of the Kolkata metro. The future of the project beyond Airport is still in darkness due to land problem. After Dum Dum Airport, the metro route will pass through a land owned by a private company. When the project was sanctioned, then railway minister Mamata Banerjee vested this land for metro project but the company moved to High court against it making the future of the project beyond airport in darkness. Till now no solution came. The construction company L&T was given the tender for construction but due to no hope of getting rid of land problem beyond airport, they walked out from the construction. In Barasat, heavy traffic jam is a burning problem for the citizens. Metro project would have given them a breath. But still now no hope arose to the citizens. However, the future of the alignment beyond Dum Dum Airport is still uncertain.
