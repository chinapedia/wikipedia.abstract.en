St_Matthew,_Dyson_Road,_London_E15_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1742809.jpg ST MATTHEW'S CHURCH is a Church of England church on Dyson Road in West Ham, east London.[1] It originated in 1891 as a mission of All Saints Church, West Ham, designed to serve the area between West Ham Park and Romford Road. A permanent building was put up in 1896 and a separate parish formed the following year. It opened a mission of its own around 1900 in Vicarage Lane, which was destroyed by the London Blitz.[2]
