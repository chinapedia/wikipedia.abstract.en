STOP BULLYING: SPEAK UP is a campaign of Cartoon Network to raise awareness of bullying issues and promote positive relationships. Cartoon Networkâ€™s special programming on bullying issues during the month of October coincides with National Bullying Prevention Month. The campaign directs witnesses and victims of bullying to "speak up" and enlist the help of a teacher or other responsible adult. The campaign features documentaries, public service ads, and use of existing programs to carry the anti-bullying message on the network, and directs children, parents and educators to other resources about bullying issues, including an anti-bullying pledge.
