meteor shower.]] AMATEUR ASTRONOMY is a hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science, such as by monitoring variable stars,[1] double stars[2] sunspots,[3] or occultations of stars by the Moon[4] or asteroids,[5] or by discovering transient astronomical events, such as comets,[6] galactic novae[7] or supernovae in other galaxies.[8]
