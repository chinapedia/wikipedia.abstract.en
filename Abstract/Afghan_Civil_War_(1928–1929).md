The AFGHAN CIVIL WAR was fought from 14 November 1928 to 13 October 1929. Rebelling, and subsequently governing Saqqawist forces under Habibull훮h Kalak훮ni fought against various opposing tribes and rival monarchs in the Kingdom of Afghanistan, among whom Mohammed N훮dir Kh훮n eventually achieved a preponderant role. Despite early successes, such as the capture of Kabul and defeat of Amanullah Khan on 17 January 1929 or the capture of Kandahar on 3 June, the Saqqawists were eventually deposed by anti-Saqqawist forces led by Nadir on 13 October 1929, leading to Nadir's ascension as King of Afghanistan, who ruled until his assasination on 3 November 1933.
