ASIAN AMERICAN ACTIVISM refers broadly to political movements and activities that Asian Americans have participated in. Asian immigrants to America had always been dissatisfied with the level of discrimination they received. For example, Asian Americans lamented the harsh regulation and discrimination opposed upon them with the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882 – 1943) and the Angel Island Immigration Station (1910 – 1940). Detainees in Angel Island turned to silent protests by writing poetry, often bitter and angry in nature, on the walls.[1] However, mass organizing did not fully begin until the 1960s.
