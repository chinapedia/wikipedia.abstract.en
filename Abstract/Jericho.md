JERICHO (; __ ; __) is a Palestinian city in the West Bank. It is located in the Jordan Valley, near Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west. It is the administrative seat of the Jericho Governorate, and is governed by the Palestinian National Authority.[1] In 2007, it had a population of 18,346.[2] The city was occupied by Jordan from 1949 to 1967, and has been held under Israeli occupation since 1967; administrative control was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.[3][4] It is believed to be one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world[5][6][7] and the city with the oldest known protective wall in the world.[8] It was thought to have the oldest stone tower in the world as well, but excavations at Tell Qaramel in Syria have discovered stone towers that are even older.[9][10]
