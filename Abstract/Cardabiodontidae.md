CARDABIODONTIDAE is an extinct family of lamniform sharks. Confirmed members of this family include _Cardabiodon_ and _Dwardius_, both which are genera which existed in Australia, North America, and Europe during the Late Cretaceous period.[1][2] It has been suggested that _Parotodus_ could also belong to this family, but the authors that originally made this proposal expressed a weakening of rationale for it.[3]
