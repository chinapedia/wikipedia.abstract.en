MORPHINE is a pain medication of the opiate family which is found naturally in a number of plants and animals.[1][2] It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain.[3] It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain.[4] It is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labor.[5] It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injection under the skin, intravenously, injection into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.[6] Maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when given intravenously and after 60 minutes when given by mouth, while duration of effect is 3–7 hours.[7][8] Long-acting formulations also exist.[9]
