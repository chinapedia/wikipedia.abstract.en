In linguistic typology, SUBJECT–VERB–OBJECT (SVO) is a sentence structure where the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third. Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). The label is often used for ergative languages that do not have subjects, but have an AGENT–VERB–OBJECT (AVO) order.
