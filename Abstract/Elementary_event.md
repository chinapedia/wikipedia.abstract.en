In probability theory, an ELEMENTARY EVENT (also called an ATOMIC EVENT or SAMPLE POINT) is an event which contains only a single outcome in the sample space.[1] Using set theory terminology, an elementary event is a singleton. Elementary events and their corresponding outcomes are often written interchangeably for simplicity, as such an event corresponds to precisely one outcome.
