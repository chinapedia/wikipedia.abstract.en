WILLIAM "WILLY" MURPHY[1] (1936â€“1976) was an American underground cartoonist and editor. Murphy's humor focused on hippies and the counterculture. His signature character was Arnold Peck the Human Wreck, "a mid-30s beanpole with wry observations about his own life and the community around him."[2] Murphy's solo title was called _Flamed-Out Funnies_; in addition, he contributed to such seminal underground anthologies as _Arcade_, _Bijou Funnies_, and _San Francisco Comic Book_, as well as the _National Lampoon_.
