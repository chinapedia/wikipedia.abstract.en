CRESPI Automotive (1962 - 1977) of Buenos Aires[1] was an Argentinian auto manufacturer, founded by Tulio Crespi,[2] a former racing driver. Crespi was the first "modern" Argentinian sports car manufacturer. Their most famous model, the Tulieta GT,[3] came into production in 1977. It was lightweight and unique, but not very fast. The engine was a 1397cc or 85 cubic inch engine made by Renault, and was known for being unreliable as well. It was the same engine used in the 1976 R5 Alpine/Gordini, which produced 93 horsepower. The C6J Turbo engine was also used in a small number of the GTs. Later in 1977 Crespi ended production of the Tulieta GT, and only a few survive today.[4][5][6][7]
