DIMETHYLTRIENOLONE (developmental code name RU-2420) is a synthetic, orally active, and extremely potent anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and 17α-alkylated 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) derivative which was never marketed for medical use.[1] It has among the highest known affinity of any AAS for the androgen (and progesterone) receptors,[2][3] and has been said to be perhaps the most potent AAS to have ever been developed.[4]
