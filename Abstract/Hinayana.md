"HĪNAYĀNA" () is a Sanskrit term literally meaning the "small/deficient vehicle".[1][2] Classical Chinese and Tibetan teachers translate it as "smaller vehicle".[3] The term was applied to the _Śrāvakayāna_, the Buddhist path followed by a śrāvaka who wished to become an arhat. This term appeared around the first or second century. Hīnayāna was often contrasted with _Mahāyāna_, which means the "great vehicle".
