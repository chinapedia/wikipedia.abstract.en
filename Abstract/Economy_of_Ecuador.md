The ECONOMY OF ECUADOR is the eighth largest in Latin America and the 69th largest in the world by total GDP.[1] Ecuador’s economy is based on the export of oil, bananas, shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money transfers from Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad.[2] In 2017, remittances constituted 2.7% of country's GDP.[3] The total trade amounted to 42% of the Ecuador’s GDP in 2017.[4] The country is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources. In 2017, oil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 32% of export earnings.[5][6] Ecuador is one of OPEC's smallest members[7] and produced about 531,300 barrels per day of petroleum in 2017.[8][9] It is the world's largest exporter of bananas ($3.38 billion in 2017) and a major exporter of shrimp ($3.06 billion in 2017).[10] Exports of non-traditional products such as cut flowers ($846 million in 2017) and canned fish ($1.18 billion in 2017) have grown in recent years.[11] In the past, Ecuador’s economy depended largely on primary industries like agriculture, petroleum, and aquaculture. As a result of shifts in global market trends and development of technology have led to the economic development of other sectors like textile, processed food, metallurgy and the service sectors.[12] Between 2006 and 2014, GDP growth averaged 4.3%, driven by high oil prices and external financing.[13] From 2015 until 2018 GDP growth averaged just 0.6%.[14] Ecuador's president, Lenín Moreno, has launched a radical transformation of Ecuador’s economy since taking office in May 2017. The aim is to increase the private sector’s weight, in particular the oil industry.[15][16] The International Monetary Fund approved an agreement with Ecuador in March 2019.[17] This arrangement would provide support ($10 billion) for the Ecuadorian government’s economic policies over three years (2018-2021 Prosperity Plan).[18][19]
