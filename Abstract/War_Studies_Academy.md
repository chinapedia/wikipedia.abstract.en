The WAR STUDIES UNIVERSITY (; _ASzWoj_[1]) is the highest military academic institution in Poland. It was formed by Ministry of National Defence in 2016 in place of the former National Defence University Academy (Akademia Obrony Narodowej, AON) established in 1990. Minister of National Defence Wojciech Fa≈Çkowski explained that the reorganization of the academy was inspired by the need to improve the proportion of military students in the university's overall profile.[2]
