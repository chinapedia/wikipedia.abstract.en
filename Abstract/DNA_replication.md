Nucleotides (bases) are matched to synthesize the new partner strands into two new double helices.]] In molecular biology, DNA REPLICATION is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule. DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the basis for biological inheritance. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential.
