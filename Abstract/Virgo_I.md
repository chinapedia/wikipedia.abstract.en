VIRGO I is an extremely faint satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.[1] It was discovered in the Subaru Strategic Survey. Virgo I has an absolute visual magnitude of -0.8 making it the least luminous galaxy confirmed thus far. The galaxy has a radius of 124 light years, (half light radius 38Â pc) meaning that it is too big to be a globular cluster.[2] Cetus II is dimmer, but too small to be classed as a galaxy.[3] Virgo I is dimmer than Segue I, the previous dimmest known. The distance to Virgo I is .[4]
