VENUS OVER MANHATTAN was founded in 2012 by Adam Lindemann. The gallery is now known as VENUS, with spaces operating in both Manhattan and Los Angeles. The New York space is dedicated to curated exhibitions both historic and contemporary, which cast a unique and often iconoclastic view on the work of established artists or artists whose works have been somewhat overlooked. Past exhibitions have included those of Alexander Calder,[1][2] Jack Goldstein,[3] William Copley,[4] Raymond Pettibon,[5][6] Walter Dahn,[7] Peter Saul,[8] and H.C. Westermann.[9] In New York, VENUS has collaborated with artist foundations, estates, and galleries including The Calder Foundation, White Columns, Spr√ºth Magers, David Zwirner, the estate of William Copley and the estate of Allan Frumkin.
