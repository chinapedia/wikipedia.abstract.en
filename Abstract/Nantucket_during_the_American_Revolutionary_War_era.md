The_town_of_Sherburne_in_the_island_of_Nantucket_(NYPL_b12610613-422499).jpg The citizens of NANTUCKET DURING THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR ERA relied on whaling, industries that supported whaling, and the trade in oil that resulted from that industry. Because most of this trade was with England, the leading citizens of Nantucket chose to be neutral during the American Revolutionary War, siding neither with those who supported revolution nor with the British Crown, in order to maintain the viability of the island's economy. The Quaker culture of pacifism was a secondary cause of the island's non-participation in revolutionary activities.
