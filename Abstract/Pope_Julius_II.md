POPE JULIUS II (; ) (5 December 1443 â€“ 21 February 1513), born GIULIANO DELLA ROVERE, was head of the Roman Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1503 to 1513. Nicknamed the _Warrior Pope_ or the _Fearsome Pope_, he chose his papal name not in honor of Pope Julius I but in emulation of Julius Caesar.[1] One of the most powerful and influential popes, Julius II was the central figure of the High Renaissance and left a significant mark in world history.[2]
