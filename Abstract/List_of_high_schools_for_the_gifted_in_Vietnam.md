In Vietnamese secondary education, HIGH SCHOOLS FOR THE GIFTED or SPECIALIZED HIGH SCHOOLS (_Trường Trung Học Phổ Thông Chuyên_ / _Trường THPT Chuyên_) are designated public schools for secondary students to express gifted potentials in natural sciences, social sciences, and/or foreign languages. Schools for the gifted fall into two categories: provincial schools and university-affiliated schools. The first high schools for the gifted were initiated in 1966, and since then each province of Vietnam now has at least one high school for the gifted. Entrance to a high school for the gifted are based on test results and is extremely competitive.
