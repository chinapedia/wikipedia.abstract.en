EDWARD BURDEN (_c_.1540-1588)[1] was a sixteenth century recusant priest. Born in County Durham, he was a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.[2] He studied at Duoay College [3] and was ordained a priest in Rheims[4] in 1584.[5] He is probably best known for being one of the Eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales, for, arriving in England in 1586, he was captured two years later and executed by hanging, drawing and quartering[6] in York on 29 November 1588,[7]
