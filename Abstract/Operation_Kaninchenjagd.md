_Operation Kaninchenjagd_ ("Operation rabbit hunting") is one of two titles of an anonymous paper[1] that became public in September 2016 and led to accusations against the German politician and incumbent general secretary of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), Peter Tauber. It is alleged that Mr. Tauber – who was at that time member of the CDU and the (regional) chairman of the Young Union in Hesse – was involved in (attempted) bullying of another member and employee of the CDU.
