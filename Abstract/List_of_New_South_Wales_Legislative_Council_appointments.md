This is a list of APPOINTMENTS TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, caused by the resignation or death of an incumbent member. A departure creates a casual vacancy which is filled by a candidate of the same affiliation in a joint sitting of the Parliament of New South Wales. The Constitution of New South Wales states that if the previous sitting Legislative Council member was at the time of his/her election the representative of a particular political party, the nominated candidate for the vacancy must be a member of that same party.[1][2]
