CENSORSHIP IN BOLIVIA can be traced back through years of conflict between Bolivia’s indigenous population and the wealthier population of European descent.[1] Until Bolivia democratized in 1982, the media was strictly controlled.[2] Since Evo Morales was elected, censorship has increased throughout the years, being qualified as partially free by the freedom house, with a 53/100 score on freedom of press (0 the most free and 100 the least free). Evo Morales' government has since tried to control the media and regulate it in his favour. "In February 2016, voters rejected a referendum that would have permitted Morales to run for a fourth term. The vote was widely viewed as a rebuke to the president, who responded to it with an attempt to crack down on online media, which he appeared to blame for the referendum’s defeat. Soon after the vote, the government created the General Directorate of Social Networks, a body within the Ministry of Communications tasked with coordinating the government’s interactions with online communities. This mission involves efforts to disseminate government-friendly messages online and to engage with government critics on social media, often aggressively. Authorities also proposed a pair of measures that would have imposed greater regulation on online outlets, but they were never implemented. Additionally, in June, Bolivia joined 16 other countries including Venezuela and Cuba in rejecting a UN Human Rights Commission resolution affirming the right to a free, uncensored internet".[3]
