A PALINDROME is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as _madam_ or _racecar_ or the number _10801._ Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".
