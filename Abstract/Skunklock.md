The SKUNKLOCK is a brand of bicycle lock for securing a bicycle to a pole or other fixture, similar to a standard U-lock. Its cylindrical body contains a noxious chemical inside that is released if the body is cut. The chemical compound is meant as a deterrent to someone attempting to cut the lock and steal the bicycle. The lock is being funded through crowdfunding, with an announced shipping date of June 2017.[1]
