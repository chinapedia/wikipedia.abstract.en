The KANEM–BORNU EMPIRE existed in areas which are now part of Chad and Nigeria. It was known to the Arabian geographers as the KANEM EMPIRE from the 8th century AD onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of BORNU (the BORNU EMPIRE) until 1900. The Kanem Empire (c. 700–1380) was located in the present countries of Chad, Nigeria and Libya.[1] At its height it encompassed an area covering not only most of Chad, but also parts of southern Libya (Fezzan) and eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. The Bornu Empire (1380s–1893) was a state in what is now northeastern Nigeria, in time becoming even larger than Kanem, incorporating areas that are today parts of Chad, Niger, Sudan, and Cameroon. It existed from 1380s to 1893. The early history of the Empire is mainly known from the Royal Chronicle or _Girgam_ discovered in 1851 by the German traveller Heinrich Barth.
