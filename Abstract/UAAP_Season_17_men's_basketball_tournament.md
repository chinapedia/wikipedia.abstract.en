The 1954 UAAP MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT was the 17th year of the men's tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s basketball championship. Hosted by University of Santo Tomas, the NU Bulldogs defeated the FEU Tamaraws in a single game finals taking their first UAAP men's basketball championship since the league's inception in 1938. This was the only title of NU until they won their second crown 60 years later in 2014.
