The 2016 QUEENSLAND HANDBALL LEAGUE is a Brisbane based championship for Handball. It is a home and away structure conducted in April to July 2016, with the winning team qualifying for the National Club Championship. The competition was not held due to a combined Queensland team called the Brisbane Wolves competing in the 2016 Australian Handball Club Championship, 2016 Oceania Handball Champions Cup and the 2016 Australian Handball League.
