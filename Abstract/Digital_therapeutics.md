DIGITAL THERAPEUTICS, a subset of digital health, are evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease.[1][2][3][4][5] Digital therapeutic companies should publish trial results inclusive of clinically-meaningful outcomes in peer-reviewed journals.[6]The treatment relies on behavioral and lifestyle changes usually spurred by a collection of digital impetuses.[7][8] Because of the digital nature of the methodology, data can be collected and analyzed as both a progress report and a preventative measure.[9][10][11][12][13][14] Treatments are being developed for the prevention and management of a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including type II diabetes, congestive heart failure, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, asthma, substance abuse, ADHD, hypertension, anxiety, depression, and several others.[15][16][17][18][19] Digital therapeutics often employ strategies rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy.[20][21][22]
