In economics, specifically general equilibrium theory, a PERFECT MARKET is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called PERFECT COMPETITION. In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold, it has been theoretically demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service, including labor, equals the quantity demanded at the current price. This equilibrium would be a Pareto optimum.[1]
