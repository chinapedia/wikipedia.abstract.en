The expression ‘’IRISH OF NANTES’’ denotes a community formed in the 17th century and of great importance in the 18th century. It was originally composed of Jacobite political refugees fleeing the violence of Britain’s revolutions, particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This community eventually extended to the ports of Bordeaux and La Rochelle as well as to the colony of Saint-Domingue.
