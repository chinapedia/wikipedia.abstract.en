THE PAINTERSâ€™ CLUB OF LOS ANGELES was a short-lived arts organization that existed from 1906-1909, and allowed only men as members. When the group disbanded a number of artists who had been members reorganized themselves as the California Art Club, including Charles Percy Austin (1883-1948), Franz Bischoff (1864-1929), Carl Oscar Borg (1879-1947), Benjamin Brown (1865-1942), Hanson Puthuff (1875-1972), Jack Wilkinson Smith (1873-1949), and William Wendt (1845-1946). Beginning with its founding in December 1909, the new California Art Club widened its membership guidelines to include female painters and sculptors of any gender.
