The HUNGARIAN NATIONAL FRONT (; MNA) was a far-right Hungarist and neo-Nazi paramilitary movement, founded in 1989 by István Győrkös as HUNGARIAN NATIONAL SOCIALIST ACTION GROUP (; also abbreviated MNA). The organization adopted its current name on 29 November 1992, after a court ruled to ban National Socialist name and symbols.[1]
