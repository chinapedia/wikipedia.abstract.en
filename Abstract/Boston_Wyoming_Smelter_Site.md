The BOSTON WYOMING SMELTER SITE was the site of a copper smelter that processed ores from the nearby GRAND ENCAMPMENT MINING DISTRICT in Carbon County, Wyoming in the early 20th century. The site includes the former town of Rudefeha and is near Encampment, Wyoming. The smelter was constructed in 1902 by Grand Encampment promoter Willis George Emerson, connected to the main Ferris-Haggerty Mine location by a aerial tram over the Continental Divide. The smelter initially produced matte, an intermediate product in copper refining. In 1903 it was upgraded to produce blister copper. Power for the blowers needed for the blister refining process came from a water turbine at the end of a diameter wood-stave pipe from the South Fork of the Encampment River, away. The smelter could process 300 to 400 tons of ore a day.[1]
