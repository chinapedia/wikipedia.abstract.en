Qapf_diagram_plutonic_05.svg of the QAPF diagram]] QUARTZOLITE or SILEXITE is an intrusive igneous rock, in which the mineral quartz is more than 90% of the rock's felsic mineral content, with feldspar at up to 10%.[1][2] Typically, quartz forms more than 60% of the rock,[3] the rest being mostly feldspar although minor amounts of mica or amphibole may also be present.[4] Quartzolite occurs as dykes, sills, veins, bosses and segregation masses;[5][6] it is also found in association with greisen and pegmatite.[7][8][9] Quartzolite is an extremely rare type of rock.[10] No extrusive rock equivalent of quartzolite is known.[11]
