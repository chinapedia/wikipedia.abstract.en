CLAUDIUS PTOLEMY (; , _Klaúdios Ptolemaîos_ ; ; )[1] was a mathematician, astronomer, geographer and astrologer. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, under the rule of the Roman Empire,[2] had a Latin name, which several historians have taken to imply he was also a Roman citizen,[3] cited Greek philosophers, and used Babylonian observations and Babylonian lunar theory. The 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou () in the Thebaid (). This attestation is quite late, however, and there is no other evidence to confirm or contradict it.[4] He died in Alexandria around AD 168.[5]
