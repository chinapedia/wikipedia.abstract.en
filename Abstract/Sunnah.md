Sunna}} _SUNNAH_ (, , plural ), also _SUNNA_ or _SUNNAT_, is the body of literature which discusses and prescribes the traditional customs and practices of the Islamic community, both social and legal,[1] often but not necessarily based on the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions.[2][3] The Quran (the holy book of Islam) and the _sunnah_ make up the two primary sources of Islamic theology and law.[4][5] The _sunnah_ is also defined as "a path, a way, a manner of life"; "all the traditions and practices" of the Islamic prophet that "have become models to be followed" by Muslims.[6][7]
