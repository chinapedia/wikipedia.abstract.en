The economy of Cambodia at present follows an open market system (market economy) and has seen rapid economic progress in the last decade.[1] Cambodia had a GDP of $18.05 billion in 2015.[2] Per capita income, although rapidly increasing, is low compared with most neighboring countries. Cambodia's two largest industries are textiles and tourism, while agricultural activities remain the main source of income for many Cambodians living in rural areas.[3] The service sector is heavily concentrated on trading activities and catering-related services. Recently, Cambodia has reported that oil and natural gas reserves have been found off-shore.[4]
