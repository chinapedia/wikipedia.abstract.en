In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-COMPLETE or AI-HARD, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems, assuming intelligence is computational, is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problemâ€”making computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI.[1] To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.
