YOTCHIANGRAI (also called PHRAYA YOT CHIANG RA and YOT MUEANG) was the thirteenth monarch of the Mangrai Dynasty that ruled Lan Na in what is now northern Thailand. He was a son of _Thao_ (Prince) Bunrueang, the only son of King Tilokaraj who had been executed by his grandfather on suspicion of disloyalty. He ruled from the death of his grandfather until he abdicated in favour of his son in 1495.[1]
