The STRIPED ANOLE (_ANOLIS LINEATUS_) is a species of lizard in the family Dactyloidae. It is native to Curaçao and Aruba of the Netherlands Antilles, but has also been introduced to Klein Curaçao.[1] It is generally common (at least on Curaçao),[2] and is particularly common in densely vegetated gardens in the capital Willemstad.[3] It is found in dry tropical shrubland at all elevations in its range,[4] but is uncommon in habitats without larger trees.[5] It can often be seen on rocks, the walls of buildings or tree trunks; at various heights but often relatively close to the ground.[6] It is a member of the _A. chrysolepis_ species group.[7]
