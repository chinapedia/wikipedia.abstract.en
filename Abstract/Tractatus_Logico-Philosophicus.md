The _TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS_ (widely abbreviated and cited as TLP) (Latin for _Logical Philosophical Treatise_ or _Treatise on Logic and Philosophy_) is the only book-length philosophical work by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that was published during his lifetime. The project had a broad goal: to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science.[1] It is recognized by philosophers as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. G. E. Moore originally suggested the work's Latin title as homage to the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ by Baruch Spinoza.[2]
