The WALDENECKSEE or PETERSEE is a quarry lake on the western edge of the Northern Black Forest. It lies in an exclave of the municipality of Sinzheim, surrounded by Baden-Baden, between Iberg and Fremersberg on the western side of the hill of Waldeneck. Around 1900 a quarry was established here that was worked until 1968. After that a lake formed on the floor of the quarry, about 200 metres long and 35â€“75 metres wide.[1] One of its common names, the Petersee, is derived from the name of the former quarry owners, the Peter Porphyry Gravel Works (_Porphyr-Schotterwerk Peter_).[2] Today it is leased as an angling lake[3] and bathing is forbidden.[4]
