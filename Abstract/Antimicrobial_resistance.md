ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE (AMR or AR) is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication that once could successfully treat the microbe.[1][2][3] The term ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE (AR or ABR) is a subset of AMR, as it applies only to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.[4] Resistant microbes are more difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses of antimicrobials. These approaches may be more expensive, more toxic or both. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant (MDR). Those considered extensively drug resistant (XDR) or totally drug-resistant (TDR) are sometimes called "superbugs".[5]
