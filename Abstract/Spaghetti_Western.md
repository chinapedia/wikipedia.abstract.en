SPAGHETTI WESTERN, also known as ITALIAN WESTERN or MACARONI WESTERN (primarily in Japan),[1] is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success.[2] The term was used by American critics and those in other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.[3]
