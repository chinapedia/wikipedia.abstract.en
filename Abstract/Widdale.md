WIDDALE is a small side dale on the south side of Wensleydale in North Yorkshire, England. The dale lies to the east of Great Knoutberry Hill (also known as Widdale Fell) and is bounded on the west by Dentdale, south by Sleddale and north by Mossdale. It is drained by Widdale & Snaizeholme Becks which feed the waters north into the River Ure at Appersett.[1] The name Widdale means 'The Wooded Valley' in Old Norse.[2]
