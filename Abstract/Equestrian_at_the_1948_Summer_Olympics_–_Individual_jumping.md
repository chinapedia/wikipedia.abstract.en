The individual jumping in equestrian at the 1948 Olympic Games in London was held at the Empire Stadium on 14 August.[1] The competition consisted of a single round of jumping. In the case of a tie in points, a jump-off was arranged. The jump-off had no time limit, however, the time taken to complete the jump-off was used as a tie-breaker.[2] The points from the individual competition were also used in the team competition.
