BHILLAMA V (r. c. 1175-1191 CE) was the first sovereign ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Deccan region in India. A grandson of the Yadava king Mullagi, he carved out a principality in present-day Maharashtra by capturing forts in and around the Konkan region. Around 1175 CE, he grabbed the Yadava throne, supplanting the descendants of his uncle and an usurper. Over the next decade, he ruled as a nominal vassal of the Chalukyas of Kalyani, raiding the Gujarat Chaulukya and Paramara territories. After the fall of the Chalukya power, he declared sovereignty around 1187 CE, and fought with the Hoysala king Ballala II for control of the former Chalukya territory in present-day Karnataka. Around 1189 CE, he defeated Ballala in a battle at Soratur, but two years later, Ballala defeated him decisively.
