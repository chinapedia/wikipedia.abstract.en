ASTRONOMICAL NUTATION is a phenomenon which causes the orientation of the axis of rotation of a spinning astronomical object to vary over time. It is caused by the gravitational forces of other nearby bodies acting upon the spinning object. Although they are caused by the same effect operating over different timescales, astronomers usually make a distinction between _precession_, which is a steady long-term change in the axis of rotation, and _nutation_, which is the combined effect of similar shorter-term variations.[1]
