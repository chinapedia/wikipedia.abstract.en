The LONG BEACH ADMIRALS were a professional American football team based in Long Beach, California. They were a member of the Continental Football League to begin the 1967 season and were part of the league's expansion to the west coast.[1] Notably, the Admirals played just one regular season game, a 37â€“13 loss to the Seattle Rangers before 950 fans, before applying for an immediate transfer to Portland, Oregon.[2] The league denied the request and revoked the Admirals franchise, opting instead to field six teams in the Pacific Division.[3]
