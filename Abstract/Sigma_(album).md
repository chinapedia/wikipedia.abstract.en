_SIGMA_ (stylized with the Greek symbol _Σ_) is the debut studio album by Japanese musical unit REOL. It was released on October 19, 2016 by Toy's Factory in two physical editions—a standard CD, and a CD and DVD bundle—and for digital consumption. Prior to their formation, each member—Reol, Giga and Okiku—worked with each other on numerous musical projects until finalizing a record contract with Toy's Factory in early 2016. The material on the album were written, sung and co-composed by Reol, whilst production was handled by all three artists and arranged by Giga.
