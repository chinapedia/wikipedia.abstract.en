PHILIP HENRY GOSSE FRS (; 6 April 1810 â€“ 23 August 1888), known to his friends as Henry, was an English naturalist and popularizer of natural science, virtually the inventor of the seawater aquarium, and a painstaking innovator in the study of marine biology. Gosse created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and coined the term "aquarium" when he published the first manual, _The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea_, in 1854. His work was the catalyst for an aquarium craze in early Victorian England. [1]
