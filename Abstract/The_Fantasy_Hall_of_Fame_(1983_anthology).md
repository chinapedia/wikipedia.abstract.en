_THE FANTASY HALL OF FAME_ is an anthology of fantasy short works edited by Robert Silverberg and Martin H. Greenberg. It was first published in hardcover by Arbor House in October 1983. The first British edition was issued by Robinson in trade paperback in June 1988 under the alternate title _THE MAMMOTH BOOK OF FANTASY ALL-TIME GREATS_, under which title it was reprinted by the same publisher in July 1990. A second British edition was issued by W. H. Smith in trade paperback under the alternate title _GREAT FANTASY_ in 2004. This work should not be confused with the later anthology of the same title with different content (only four stories are common to the two books) edited by Silverberg alone for HarperPrism in March 1998.[1]
