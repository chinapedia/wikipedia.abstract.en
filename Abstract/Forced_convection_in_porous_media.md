Forced convection is type of heat transport in which fluid motion is generated by an external source like a (pump, fan, suction device, etc.). Heat transfer through porus media is very effective and efficiently. Porous medium is defined as a material volume consisting of solid matrix with an interconnected void. Flow in porous media have revealed the Darcy law< which relates linearly the flow velocity to the pressure gradient across the porous medium. Forced convection heat transfer in a confined porous medium has been a subject of intensive studies during the last decades because of its wide applications, including: Chemical, Environmental, Mechanical, Geological and Petroleum.
