RUCYL (Rucyl Frison, born Rucyl Mills) is a new media and sound artist, singer, musician, and producer. Her interests involve experimentation and process as performance,[1] time-based analog effects systems, and using sound to represent concepts that are non-tactile (time, natural forces, emotion, identity, and physics). Her earlier experimental works incorporated vocal improvisation and computer generated algorithmic music in tandem with generated visual projections,[2] using Max MSP and VJ software. Rucyl improvises during her live performances[3] using MIDI controllers, loopers, diy software and hardware, and effects processors.
