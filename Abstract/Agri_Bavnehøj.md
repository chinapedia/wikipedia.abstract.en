AGRI BAVNEHØJ (or AGRI BAVNEHOEJ) is a Danish hill and vista point with a bronze age burial mound, located 137 meters above sea level. It is close to the village of Agri, in Mols Bjerge National Park on the southern part of the Djursland peninsula, northeast of Denmark’s second largest city, Aarhus. The mound was built 1800 – 1000 years BC.[1] Agri Bavnehøj is the least known of four vista points and burial mounds on southern Djursland, despite being the highest (by a few meters). The others are Stabelhøje, Trehøje and Ellemandsbjerg.
