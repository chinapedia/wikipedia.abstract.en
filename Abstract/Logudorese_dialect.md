LOGUDORESE SARDINIAN[1] (, ) is one of the two written standards of Sardinian, often considered the most conservative of all Romance languages. The orthography is based on the spoken dialects of central northern Sardinia, identified by certain attributes which are not found, or found to a lesser degree, among the Sardinian dialects centered on the other written form, Campidanese. Its ISO 639-3 code is _src_. Italian-speakers do not understand Logudorese, like any other dialect of the Sardinian language:[2] Sardinian is an autonomous linguistic group rather than a dialect of Italian[3] as it is often noted because of its morphological, synctatic, and lexical differences from Italian.
