To combat the illicit synthetic cannabinoid industry many jurisdictions have created a system to control these cannabinoids through their general (or Markush) structure as opposed to their specific identity (or "street name"). In this way new analogs are already controlled before they are even created.[1][2] A large number of cannabinoids have been grouped into classes based on similarities in their chemical structure, and these classes have been widely adopted across a variety of jurisdictions.[3][4][5][6][7][8]
