MURMUR (also called BREATHY VOICE, WHISPERY VOICE, SOUGHING and SUSURRATION) is a phonation in which the vocal folds vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are adjusted to let more air escape[1] which produces a sighing-like sound. A simple murmured phonation, (not actually a fricative consonant, as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest), can sometimes be heard as an allophone of English between vowels, such as in the word _behind_, for some speakers.
