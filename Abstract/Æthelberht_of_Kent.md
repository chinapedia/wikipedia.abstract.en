ÆTHELBERHT (; also ÆTHELBERT, AETHELBERHT, AETHELBERT or ETHELBERT; ; 550 – 24 February 616) was King of Kent from about 589 until his death. The eighth-century monk Bede, in his _Ecclesiastical History of the English People_, lists him as the third king to hold _imperium_ over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the late ninth century _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, he is referred to as a bretwalda, or "Britain-ruler". He was the first English king to convert to Christianity.
