A RHYME is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, exactly the same sound) in the final stressed syllables and any following syllables of two or more words. Most often, this kind of "perfect" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of lines of poems and songs.[1] More broadly, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word _rhyme_ has come to be sometimes used as a shorthand term for any brief poem, such as a rhyming couplet or nursery rhyme.
