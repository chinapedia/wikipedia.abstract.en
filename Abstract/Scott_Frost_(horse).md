SCOTT FROST (1952-1983) was a United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame Standardbred trotter trained and driven by future Hall of Fame inductee Joe O'Brien. His performances on the racetrack in 1954 saw him voted United States Two-Year-Old Trotter of the Year and in 1955 he became the first winner of the U.S. Trotting Triple Crown series and was voted U.S. Harness Horse of the Year. Racing at age four in 1956, Scott Frost became the first horse to twice win Harness Horse of the Year honors.[1]
