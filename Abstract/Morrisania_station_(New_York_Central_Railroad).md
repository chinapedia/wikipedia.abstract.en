The MORRISANIA STATION was a station on the New York Central Railroad's Harlem Line, serving the community of Morrisania in the Bronx, New York City. The station was built in 1858, but after declining ridership, which paralleled the decline of this section of the Bronx, the station was closed in 1972 along with some other stations in the Bronx as well as all stations between Dover Plains and Chatham. The station had two side platforms, and was a local station on the four-track Harlem Line.[1] The station was located at 168th Street and Park Avenue.[2][3]
