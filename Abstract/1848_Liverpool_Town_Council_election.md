Elections to Liverpool Town Council were held on Wednesday 1 November 1848, with the exception of Castle Street and Scotland wards where the elections were held on 2 November because the Aldermen for these wards were not able to act as returning officers. One third of the council seats were up for election, the term of office of each councillor being three years.
