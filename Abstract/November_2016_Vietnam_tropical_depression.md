The NOVEMBER 2016 VIETNAM TROPICAL DEPRESSION caused heavy flooding throughout central and southern Vietnam. Forming out from a low-pressure system on November 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring it as a tropical depression. With favorable conditions aloft and an increase of organization, the JMA predicted that it had a chance of becoming a tropical storm while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) in the same time issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on November 4. Due to its proximity to land and a circulation displaced from the deep convection, both the JMA and the JTWC canceled their warnings as it made landfall over in Southern Vietnam. The system continued moving westward over land and the JMA stopped tracking on the system on November 6.
