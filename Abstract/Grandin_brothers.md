The GRANDIN BROTHERS; JOHN LIVINGSTON GRANDIN (December 20, 1836 – September 10, 1912), WILLIAM JAMES GRANDIN (August 16, 1838 – December 7, 1904) and ELIJAH BISHOP GRANDIN (December 20, 1840 – December 3, 1917) were a sibling trio of American entrepreneurs who were among the first to begin business ventures in commercial oil prospecting in the United States, and who later became involved in banking and Bonanza wheat farming. They eventually became titans of the wheat industry, operating the largest corporate wheat farm in the Dakota Territory (in Grandin, North Dakota) in the late 19th century –which was possibly the largest such farm in the United States at the time.
