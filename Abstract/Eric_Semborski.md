ERIC SEMBORSKI (born June 1, 1993) is an American ice hockey player who served as an emergency goaltender for the Chicago Blackhawks and Philadelphia Flyers during the 2016â€“17 NHL season. He was substituted onto the ice, but the move was disallowed by the referee due to the primary goalie not being injured.[1] Semborski also served as an emergency backup goalie for the Blackhawks on December 3, 2016 when Corey Crawford needed an emergency appendectomy.[2] Semborski dressed for the game and sat on the Blackhawks' bench but did not make an actual appearance in the game itself. The Blackhawks later thanked Semborski by gifting him a custom goalie mask, personalized Topps trading card, and a brief video tribute at the United Center.[3]
