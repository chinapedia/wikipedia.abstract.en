The _OBERKOMMANDO DES HEERES_ (OKH) was the High Command () of the German Army during the Era of Nazi Germany. It was founded in 1935 as a part of Adolf Hitler's re-militarisation of Germany. From 1938 OKH was, together with OKL (_Oberkommando der Luftwaffe_, High Command of the Air Force) and OKM (_Oberkommando der Marine_, High Command of the Navy), formally subordinated to the OKW (_Oberkommando der Wehrmacht_, High Command of the Armed Forces), with the exception of the Waffen-SS. During the war, OKH had the responsibility of strategic planning of Armies and Army Groups, while the General Staff of the OKH managed operational matters. Each German Army also had an _Armeeoberkommando_, Army Command, or AOK. Until the German defeat at Moscow in December 1941, OKH and its staff was _de facto_ the most important unit within the German war planning. OKW then took over this function for theatres other than the German-Soviet front. OKH commander held the title _Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres_ (Supreme Commander of the Army). Following the Battle of Moscow, after OKH commander Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was excused, Hitler appointed himself as Commander-in-Chief of the Army.
