CORSICAN (_corsu_ or _lingua corsa_ ) is a Romance language from the Italo-Dalmatian family that is spoken predominantly on the Mediterranean island of Corsica (France). Corsican is closely related to Tuscan and therefore to the Florentine-based Italian. Some languages, which originated from Corsican but are also heavily influenced by Sardinian and are nowadays considered to be languages on their own, are also spoken, and to some extent written, on the island of Sardinia (Italy).[1]
