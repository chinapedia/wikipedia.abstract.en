The STERADIAN (symbol: SR) or SQUARE RADIAN[1][2] is the SI unit of solid angle. It is used in three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, which quantifies planar angles. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, gives a _length_ on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an _area_ on the surface. The name is derived from the Greek στερεός _stereos_ 'solid' + radian.
