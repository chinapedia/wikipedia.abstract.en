Oolong_tea_leaf.jpg OOLONG (; ) is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (_Camellia sinensis)_ produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting.[1] Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation, which varies according to the chosen duration of time before firing, can range from 8â€“85%,[2] depending on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asia,[3] as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony.
