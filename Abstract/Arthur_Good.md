ARTHUR GOOD (16[1] or 26[2] August 1853 â€“ 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,[3] science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name TOM TIT. He wrote a series of weekly articles, _La Science Amusante_, or _Amusing Science_, that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages. The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as surrealist collages, and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as Max Ernst and Joseph Cornell.
