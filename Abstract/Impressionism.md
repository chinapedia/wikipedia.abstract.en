Claude_Monet,_Impression,_soleil_levant.jpg, _Impression, soleil levant_ (_Impression, Sunrise_), 1872, oil on canvas, Mus√©e Marmottan Monet, Paris. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after Louis Leroy's article _The Exhibition of the Impressionists_ satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]] IMPRESSIONISM is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of _movement_ as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.
