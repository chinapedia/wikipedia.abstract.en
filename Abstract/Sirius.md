SIRIUS (, designated Α CANIS MAJORIS (Latinized to ALPHA CANIS MAJORIS, abbreviated ALPHA CMA, Α CMA)), is the brightest star in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Greek word _Seirios_ "glowing" or "scorching." With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years.[1]
