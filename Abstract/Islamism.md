ISLAMISM is a concept whose meaning has been debated in both public and academic contexts.[1] The term can refer to diverse forms of social and political activism advocating that public and political life should be guided by Islamic principles[2][3] or more specifically to movements which call for full implementation of _sharia_. It is commonly used interchangeably with the terms political Islam or Islamic fundamentalism.[4] In academic usage, the term _Islamism_ does not specify what vision of "Islamic order" or sharia are being advocated, or how their advocates intend to bring them about.[5] In Western mass media it tends to refer to groups whose aim is to establish a sharia-based Islamic state, often with implication of violent tactics and human rights violations, and has acquired connotations of political extremism. In the Muslim world, the term has positive connotations among its proponents.[6]
