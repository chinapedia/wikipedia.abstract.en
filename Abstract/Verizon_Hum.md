HUM is a vehicle diagnostic and tracking system from Verizon Communications. The system is composed of two devices: a diagnostics reader which connects to a vehicle's OBDII and a speaker with Bluetooth connectivity that can be clipped to the visor.[1] A monthly subscription is required, but also includes a mobile application for reviewing collected data and receiving alerts as well as roadside assistance.[2] The Hum was first revealed in January 2015[3] under the name Verizon Vehicle,[4] but was rebranded before its release in August of that year.[5]
