RED ROCK #007 (1976 â€“ June 8, 1994) was a ProRodeo Hall of Fame bucking bull who competed in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). Bull riders attempted to ride Red Rock 309 times and not one was able to stay on him until the eight-second whistle required for a scored ride. He was also chosen as the PRCA 1987 Bucking Bull of the Year. However, Red Rock is most famous for his association with bull riding icon Lane Frost and their famous matchup called the Challenge of the Champions. In 1994 Hollywood made a bull riding feature film called _8 Seconds_ based on Lane Frost's life, which includes his duel with Red Rock. He was the first livestock inducted into the St. Paul Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2017.
