BEACHCOMBER is a _nom de plume_ that has been used by several journalists writing a long-running humorous column on the _Daily Express_. It was originated in 1919 by Major John Bernard Arbuthnot MVO as his signature on the column, titled ‘By the Way’. The name Beachcomber was then passed to D. B. Wyndham Lewis and, in turn, to J. B. Morton, who wrote the column till 1975. It was later revived by William Hartston, current author of the column.
