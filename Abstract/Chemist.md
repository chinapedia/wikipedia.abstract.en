_The Apothecary_ or _The Chemist_ by Gabriël Metsu (c. 1651–67). A CHEMIST (from Greek chēm (ía) alchemy; replacing chemist from Medieval Latin alchimista[1]) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.
