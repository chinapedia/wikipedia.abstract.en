CRYOIMMUNOTHERAPY, also referred to as CRYOIMMUNOLOGY, is an oncological treatment for various cancers that combines cryoablation of tumor with immunotherapy treatment.[1] In-vivo cryoablation of a tumor, alone, can induce an immunostimulatory, systemic anti-tumor response, resulting in a cancer vaccineâ€”the abscopal effect.[2] Thus, cryoablation of tumors is a way of achieving autologous, in-vivo tumor lysate vaccine and treat metastatic disease.[3][4] However, cryoablation alone may produce an insufficient immune response, depending on various factors, such as high freeze rate.[5] Combining cryotherapy with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for cancer treatment.[6]
