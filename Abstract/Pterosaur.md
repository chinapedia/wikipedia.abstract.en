PTEROSAURS (;[1][2] from the Greek , __, meaning "winged lizard") were flying reptiles of the extinct clade or order PTEROSAURIA. They existed during most of the Mesozoic: from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 to 66 million years ago[3]). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.[4]
