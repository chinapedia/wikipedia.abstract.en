Streitwiesen_1990.jpg A _JUGENDBURG_, sometimes referred to in English as a YOUTH CASTLE, is a mediaeval castle in German-speaking countries that was converted during the 20th century into a public community centre or educational facility for young people. The sponsors of the original youth castles came mainly from the _Wandervogel_ and _Pfadfinder_ movement, or were at least linked to the youth movement.
