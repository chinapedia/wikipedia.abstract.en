ELIZABETH FREMANTLE (born 1962) is an English novelist, whose published works include _Queens Gambit,_ _The Girl in the Glass Tower_ (2016) and _Queen's Gambit_ (2013). As EC Fremantle she has published the critically acclaimed thriller _The Poison Bed (2018)._ Elizabeth's novels focus on themes of women and power and are linked by her interest in exploring the invisibility of early modern women's lives. She was described by The Bookseller in 2013 as ‘a major new voice in historical fiction,’ and People Magazine called her ‘a brilliant new player in the court of royal fiction.’ Fremantle is the 5x great-granddaughter of diarist Elizabeth Wynne Fremantle and Thomas Fremantle (Royal Navy officer), the latter of whom was a close associate of Horatio Nelson.
