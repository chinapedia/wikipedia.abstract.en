LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS were held in Angola on 23 August 2017,[1] although voting was delayed until 26 August at 15 polling stations due to bad weather on election day.[2] The top candidate of the winning party automatically becomes President after the election in accordance with the new 2010 Constitution. The ruling party MPLA headed by João Lourenço was widely expected to win. Preliminary results show that MPLA has won with a clear margin.[3] The final results were released on 6 September 2017.[4]
