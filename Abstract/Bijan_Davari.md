}} BIJAN DAVARI is an Iranian-American engineer. He is an IBM Fellow and Vice President at IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center, Yorktown Hts, NY. His pioneering work in miniaturization of semiconductor devices changed the world of computing.[1] His research led to the first generation of voltage-scaled deep-submicron CMOS with sufficient performance to totally replace bipolar technology in IBM mainframes and enable new high-performance UNIX servers. He is credited with leading IBM into the use of copper and silicon on insulator before its rivals.[2] He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineers[3] and is known for his seminal contributions to the field of CMOS technology. He is an IEEE Fellow, recipient of the J J Ebers Award in 2005[4] and IEEE Andrew S. Grove Award in 2010.[5] At the present time, he leads the Next Generation Systems Area of research.
