In computing, OBJECT CODE or OBJECT MODULE is the product of a compiler.[1] In a general sense object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language,[2] usually a machine code language (i.e., binary) or an intermediate language such as register transfer language (RTL). The term indicates that the code is the goal or result of the compiling process, with some early sources referring to source code as a "subject program."
