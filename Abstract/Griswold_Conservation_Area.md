GRISWOLD CONSERVATION AREA is a 43-acre (0.17 km²) park located 0.5 miles northwest of Blue Mound, Illinois. The land preserve, which is operated by the Macon County Conservation District, centers on hiking and picknicking for users in the farming area southwest of Decatur. It is based on a land parcel donated to the county in 1973 by local benefactor and landowner Harry E. Griswold, and the conservation area is named in his honor.[1]
