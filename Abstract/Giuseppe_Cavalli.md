GIUSEPPE CAVALLI (29 November 1904 – 25 October 1961) was an Italian photographer, little known outside his native country.[1] His work had a "simple, quiet aesthetic"[2] and he was "best known for his ‘high-key’ style, characterised by the use of bright, even lighting to minimise shadow."[3] Cavalli was a joint founder of the photography group La Bussola (The Compass) in 1947, and on his own formed the photography group Misa in 1953.
