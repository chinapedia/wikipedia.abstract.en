ABU SAYYAF (; ; __, ASG; ),[1] unofficially known as the ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT â€“ PHILIPPINES PROVINCE, is a Jihadist militant and pirate group that follows the Wahhabi doctrine of Sunni Islam. It is based in and around Jolo and Basilan islands in the southwestern part of the Philippines, where for more than four decades, Moro groups have been engaged in an insurgency seeking to make the province independent. The group is considered violent [2] and was responsible for the Philippines' worst terrorist attack, the bombing of Superferry 14 in 2004, which killed 116 people.[3] The name of the group is derived from the Arabic _abu_ () ("father of"), and _sayyaf_ () ("swordsmith").[4] As of 2012, the group was estimated to have between 200 and 400 members,[5] down from 1,250 in 2000.[6] They use mostly improvised explosive devices, mortars and automatic rifles.
