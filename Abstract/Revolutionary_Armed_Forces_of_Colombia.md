The REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA—PEOPLE'S ARMY (, FARC–EP and FARC) was a guerrilla movement[1] involved in the continuing Colombian armed conflict from 1964 to 2017. It was known to employ a variety of military tactics[2] in addition to more unconventional methods, including terrorism.[3][4][5][6] The FARC–EP was formed during the Cold War period as a Marxist–Leninist peasant force promoting a political line of agrarianism and anti-imperialism.
