In metric geometry, ASYMPTOTIC DIMENSION of a metric space is a large-scale analog of Lebesgue covering dimension. The notion of asymptotic dimension was introduced my Mikhail Gromov in his 1993 monograph _Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups_[1] in the context of geometric group theory, as a quasi-isometry invariant of finitely generated groups. As shown by Guoliang Yu, finitely generated groups of finite homotopy type with finite asymptotic dimension satisfy the Novikov conjecture.[2] Asymptotic dimension has important applications in geometric analysis and index theory.
