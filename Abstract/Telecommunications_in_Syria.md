The Syrian Ministry of Communications retains governmental authority over the internet in Syria.[1] Prior to the Syrian civil war, TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN SYRIA were slowly moving towards liberalization, with a number of licenses awarded and services launched in the Internet service provision market. The initiative reflected the government's change in attitude towards liberalization, following its promise to the European Union to liberalize markets by 2010. All other forms of fixed-line communications are provided by the state owned operator, Syrian Telecom (STE).[2]
