_Weierstrass_elliptic_function_P.png.]] ABEL ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS are holomorphic functions of one complex variable and with two periods. They were first established by Niels Henrik Abel and are a generalization of trigonometric functions. Since they are based on elliptic integrals, they were the first examples of elliptic functions. Similar functions were shortly thereafter defined by Carl Gustav Jacobi. In spite of the Abel functions having several theoretical advantages, the Jacobi elliptic functions have become the standard. This can have to do with the fact that Abel died only two years after he presented them while Jacobi could continue with his exploration of them throughout his lifetime. Both the elliptic functions of Abel and of Jacobi can be derived from a more general formulation which was later given by Karl Weierstrass based on their double periodicity.
