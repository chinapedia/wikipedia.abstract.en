Emigrants_Leave_Ireland_by_Henry_Doyle_1868.jpg in Ireland]] A DIASPORA (/daɪˈæspərə/)[1] is a scattered population whose origin lies in a separate geographic locale.[2][3] In particular, diaspora has come to refer to involuntary mass dispersions of a population from its indigenous territories, most notably the expulsion of Jews from the Land of Israel (known as the Jewish diaspora) and the fleeing of Greeks after the fall of Constantinople. Other examples are the African transatlantic slave trade, the Palestinian diaspora, the southern Chinese or Indians during the coolie trade, the Irish during and after the Irish Famine, the Romani from India, the Italian diaspora, the exile and deportation of Circassians, and the emigration of Anglo-Saxon warriors and their families after the Norman Conquest of England.[4]
