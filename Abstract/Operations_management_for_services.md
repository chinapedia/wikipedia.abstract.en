OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT FOR SERVICES has the functional responsibility for producing the services of an organization and providing them directly to its customers.[1] It specifically deals with decisions required by operations managers for simultaneous production and consumption of an intangible product. These decisions concern the process, people, information and the system that produces and delivers the service. It differs from operations management in general, since the processes of service organizations differ from those of manufacturing organizations.[2]
