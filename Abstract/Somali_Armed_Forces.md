The SOMALI ARMED FORCES are the military forces of Somalia, officially known as the _Federal Republic of Somalia_.[1] Headed by the President as Commander in Chief, they are constitutionally mandated to ensure the nation's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.[2] Before the Somali civil war broke out, Somalia had the largest and strongest army in the African continent until the collapse of the central government during 1991.
