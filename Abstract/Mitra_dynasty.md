The MITRA DYNASTY refers to a group of local rulers whose name incorporated the suffix "-mitra" and who are thought to have ruled the area of Mathura from around 150 BCE to 50 BCE.[1][2] They are not known to have been satraps nor kings, and their coins only bear they name without any title, therefore they are sometimes simply called "the Mitra rulers of Mathura". Alternatively, they have been dated from 100 BCE to 20 BCE.[3] The Mitra dynasty was replaced by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps from around 60 BCE.
