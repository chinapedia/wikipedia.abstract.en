The SINHALESE (Sinhala: සිංහල ජාතිය _Sinhala Jathiya_, also known as _Hela_) are an Indo-Aryan-speaking ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka.[1] They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million.[2][3] The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion. The Sinhalese people speak Sinhala, an Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists,[4] although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of Christianity. The Sinhalese are mostly found in North Central, Central, South, and West Sri Lanka. According to the 5th century epic poem Mahavamsa, and the Dipavamsa, a 3rd–5th century treatise written in Pali by Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese are a mixture of Hela people (Namely Yaksha (Rakshasa) and Naga tribes) the original inhabitants of the island and [5][6]settlers who came to the island in 543 BCE from Sinhapura, in India, led by Prince Vijaya.[7]
