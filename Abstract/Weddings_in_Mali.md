Malian_wedding_celebration_.jpg WEDDINGS IN MALI involve various important customs and celebrations spread out through a number of days. Usually, the groom and the bride do not personally know the attendees that come to the wedding festivity, because Malian families tend to be very big due to polygamy. Therefore, most of the time it is very hard for one to know every member of his or her extended family. Thus weddings are a perfect occasion for all the extended family members of the couple to come for the big day. Wedding ceremonies in Bamako are a time when the community comes together to support the bride and groom's family. During this time food is given, and family from the village come to say goodbye to the bride-to-be and celebrate with the family.
