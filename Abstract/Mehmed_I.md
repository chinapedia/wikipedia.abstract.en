Mehmet_I_honoraries_miniature.jpg.]] MEHMED I (1379 – 26 May 1421), also known as MEHMED ÇELEBI (, "the noble-born") or KIRIŞÇI (from Greek _Kyritzes_, "lord's son"), was the Ottoman Sultan from 1413 to 1421. The fourth son of Sultan Bayezid I and Devlet Hatun, he fought with his brothers over control of the Ottoman realm in the Ottoman Interregnum (1402–1413). Starting from the province of Rûm he managed to bring first Anatolia and then the European territories (Rumelia) under his control, reuniting the Ottoman state by 1413, and ruling it until his death in 1421.
