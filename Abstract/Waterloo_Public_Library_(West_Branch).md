The WATERLOO PUBLIC LIBRARY (WEST BRANCH) is a historic building located in Waterloo, Iowa, United States. The public library was established there in 1896.[1] It operated out of two rented rooms, one on the east side of the Cedar River and other on the west side. The Carnegie Foundation agreed to grant the community $21,000 to build this building and a similar amount for the east side branch on April 11, 1902.[2] Waterloo architect J.G. Ralston designed both buildings in the Neoclassical style. They were both dedicated on February 23, 1906. The single-story brick structure has a projecting entrance pavilion capped with a triangular pediment that is supported by Ionic columns. Also noteworthy are the corner piers that feature bands of brick squares set into the stone.[3] In 1977 voters in Waterloo approved a $3,650,000 bond referendum to renovate the city's 1938 post office and federal building to house the library.[4] The post office vacated the building in 1979 when it relocated. The old library building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[5] It now houses law offices.
