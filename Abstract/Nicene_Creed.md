Nicaea_icon.jpg depicting the Emperor Constantine, accompanied by the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325), holding the Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]] The NICENE CREED (Greek: or, , Latin: ) is a statement of belief widely used in Christian liturgy. It is called _Nicene_ because it was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea (present day İznik, Turkey) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325.[1] In 381, it was amended at the First Council of Constantinople, and the amended form is referred to as the Nicene or the NICENO-CONSTANTINOPOLITAN CREED.
