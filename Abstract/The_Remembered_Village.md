_THE REMEMBERED VILLAGE_ is a 1978 ethnological work by M. N. Srinivas. The book is about the villager who lives in the small village, named as Rampura in the state of Karnataka, then called Mysore. It is notable for the absence of fieldnotes as a base for the work, which is considered standard in ethnography following the standards set by Bronislaw Malinowski in _Argonauts of the Western Pacific_ as they were lost due to arson,[1] and elicited fierce debate in the anthropological community due to its unorthodox origin, among other factors.[2][3][4] The book is noted for its concern on the aesthetic, flowing prose and the significant role of the ethnographer himself,[5] a marked departure from earlier works such as Evans-Pritchard's studies on the Nuer, which is written with a more objective voice.
