SAAB AB (originally SVENSKA AEROPLAN AB, later SAAB and SAAB GROUP; ) is a Swedish aerospace and defence company, founded in 1937. From 1947 to 1990 it was the parent company of automobile manufacturer Saab Automobile. Between 1968 and 1995 the company was in a merger with commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania-Vabis, known as Saab-Scania. The two were de-merged in 1995 by the new owners, Investor AB. Despite the demerger, both Saab and Scania share the right to use the griffin logo,[1] which originates from the coat of arms of the Swedish region of Scania.[2]
