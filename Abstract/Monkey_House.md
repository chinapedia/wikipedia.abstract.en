MONKEY HOUSE is the name of a musical group founded by Don Breithaupt, a Canadian-born pianist, singer/songwriter, composer, arranger, producer and author. The group got its name from a 1970 book by Kurt Vonnegut.[1] The band formed in 1992, which Breithaupt said started as the songs he had written seemed too jazzy or different for other bands to cover.[2] A number of guest artists have contributed songs and have performed on their most recent two albums, including Drew Zingg, Elliott Randall, Michael Leonhart, and Jay Graydon. Breithaupt has revealed that Steely Dan is one of his biggest influences.[3] The band makes melodic pop with a sophisticated, jazzy twist,[4] with some horn arrangements. The latest release sports a five-piece horn section.
