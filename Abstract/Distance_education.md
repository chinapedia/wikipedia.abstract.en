DISTANCE EDUCATION or LONG-DISTANCE LEARNING is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a school.[1][2] Traditionally, this usually involved CORRESPONDENCE COURSES wherein the student corresponded with the school via post. Today it involves ONLINE EDUCATION. Courses that are conducted (51 percent or more)[3] are either hybrid,[4] blended[5] or 100% distance learning. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), offering large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies, are recent developments in distance education.[6] A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, online learning, virtual classroom etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education.
