The SUBJECTIVE STANDARD and OBJECTIVE STANDARD are legal standards for knowledge or beliefs of a defendant in a criminal law case.[1][2][3] An objective standard of reasonableness requires the finder of fact to view the circumstances from the standpoint of a hypothetical reasonable person, absent the unique particular physical and psychological characteristics of the defendant. A subjective standard of reasonableness asks whether the circumstances would produce an honest and reasonable belief in a person having the particular mental and physical characteristics of the defendant, such as their personal knowledge and personal history, when the same circumstances might not produce the same in a general reasonable person.[4]
