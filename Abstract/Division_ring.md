In abstract algebra, a DIVISION RING, also called a SKEW FIELD, is a ring in which division is possible. Specifically, it is a nonzero ring[1] in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, i.e., an element with Stated differently, a ring is a division ring if and only if the group of units equals the set of all nonzero elements. A division ring is a type of noncommutative ring under the looser definition where _noncommutative ring_ refers to rings which are not _necessarily_ commutative.
