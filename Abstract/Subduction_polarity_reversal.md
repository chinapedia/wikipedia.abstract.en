Subduction_polarity_reversal.svg SUBDUCTION POLARITY REVERSAL is a geologic process in which two converging plates switch roles: The over-lying plate becomes the down-going plate, and vice versa. There are two basic units which make up a subduction zone. This consists of an overriding plate and the subduction plate.[1] Two plates move towards each other due to tectonic forces.[2] The overriding plate will be on the top of the subducting plate.[3] This type of tectonic interaction is found at many plate boundaries.[4]
