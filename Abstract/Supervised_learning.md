SUPERVISED LEARNING is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from __ consisting of a set of _training examples_.[2] In supervised learning, each example is a _pair_ consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the _supervisory signal_). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).
