THE FISH is a 1918 poem by the American poet Marianne Moore. The poem was published in the August 1918 issue of _The Egoist_. Moore's biographer, Linda Leavell, has described "The Fish" as "...one of Moore's best-loved and most mystifying poems" and that it is "Admired for its imagery and technical proficiency".[1] The poem was later included in Moore's 1921 collection _Observations_, where it appeared alongside "Reinforcements". The placing of the two poems in the book has been interpreted by critic John Slatin as a commentary by Moore on World War I, due to her brother's service as a chaplain in the United States Navy.
