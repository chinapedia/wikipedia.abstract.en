Whales_Bubble_Net_Feeding-edit1.jpg|alt=Photo of several whales each with only its head visible above the surface]] BUBBLE-NET FEEDING is a unique and complex feeding behavior engaged in by humpback whales (_Megaptera novaeangliae_)[1] and Bryde's whales. It is one of the few surface feeding behaviors that humpback whales are known to engage in.[2] This type of feeding is often done in groups.[3] The group size can range from a minimum of two or three whales participating and up to sixty at one time.[4] Whales can also perform a similar method of surface feeding called lunge feeding but this is done solo.[5]
