The JANGID are a jƒÅti (sub-caste) of Vishwakarma in the Indian subcontinent, particularly Rajasthan, India. Historically known for carpentry, especially woodcarving and furniture making. Following Sanskritisation, they were associated with the Brahmin varna. Today, the Jangid are usually known for painting[1][2][3] and decorative works such as making seats or chariots for religious figurines.[4]
