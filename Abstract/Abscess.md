An ABSCESS is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body.[1] Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling.[2] The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed.[3] The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling.[4] Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles, with carbuncles being larger.[5]
