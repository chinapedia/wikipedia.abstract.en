SYPHILIS is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium _Treponema pallidum_ subspecies _pallidum_.[1] The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary).[2] The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration usually between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter) though there may be multiple sores.[3] In secondary syphilis, a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.[4] There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina.[5] In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms.[6] In tertiary syphilis, there are gummas (soft, non-cancerous growths), neurological problems, or heart symptoms.[7] Syphilis has been known as "the great imitator" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.[8][9]
