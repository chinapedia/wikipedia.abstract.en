Blessed MELCHOR CHYLIŃSKI (8 January 1694 - 2 December 1741) - in religious RAFAŁ - was a Polish Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor Conventual.[1] He first served as a soldier but decided to instead become a priest and so entered the Franciscans and made his profession prior to ordination. He also became known for his simplistic preaching and for his generous outreach to the poor through the distribution of clothing and food.[2]
