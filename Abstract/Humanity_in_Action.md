HUMANITY IN ACTION is an international nonprofit organization that educates and connects young people who seek to become leaders on issues related to human and minority rights. The organization, founded in 1997, maintains offices in seven countries: the United States, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its flagship program, the Humanity in Action Fellowship, places more than 100 college students and recent graduates into intensive educational fellowship programs in one of five European cities each year. In 2015, Humanity in Action began a partnership with The National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta to start a sixth fellowship program, named after Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis.
