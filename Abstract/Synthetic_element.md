Periodic_table,_good_SVG.svg A SYNTHETIC ELEMENT is one of twenty-four chemical elements that do not occur naturally on Earth:[1] they have been created by human manipulation of fundamental particles in a nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, or detonation of an atomic bomb; and thus are called "synthetic", "artificial", or "man-made".[2] The synthetic elements are those with atomic numbers 95â€“118:[3] the twenty-four were created between 1944 and 2010. The mechanism for the creation of a synthetic element is to force additional protons onto the nucleus of an element with an atomic number lower than ninety-five. All synthetic elements are unstable, but they decay at at a widely varying rate: their half-lives range from 15.6 million years to a few hundred microseconds.
