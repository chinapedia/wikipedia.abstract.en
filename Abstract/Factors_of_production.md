In economics, FACTORS OF PRODUCTION, RESOURCES, or INPUTS are what is used in the production process to produce outputâ€”that is, finished goods and services. The utilized amounts of the various inputs determine the quantity of output according to the relationship called the production function. There are three _basic_ resources or factors of production: land, labor, and capital. The factors are also frequently labeled "producer goods or services" to distinguish them from the goods or services purchased by consumers, which are frequently labeled "consumer goods".
