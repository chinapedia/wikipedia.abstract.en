BRONA CROFT, later known as LILY FRANKENSTEIN, is a character on Showtime's _Penny Dreadful_. Created by writer John Logan and portrayed by Billie Piper, Brona begins the series as an Irish immigrant living in London. An original take on the Bride of Frankenstein story, Piper's character and acting have been acclaimed by critics, calling her "alternately elegant, bewitching, coarse, and frightening."[1]
