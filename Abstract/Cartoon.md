He holds the hat from Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" and balances a fishbowl on his left index finger.]] A CARTOON is a type of illustration, possibly animated, typically in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a _cartoonist_,[1] and in the second sense they are usually called an _animator_.
