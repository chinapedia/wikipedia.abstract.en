_CALADENIA CAESAREA_ SUBSP. _CAESAREA_, commonly known as the MUSTARD SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and up to three mustard-coloured flowers with red stripes. It was originally described as a subspecies of _Caladenia filamentosa_ but the rich colour of its flowers and prominent labellum separate it from that species.
