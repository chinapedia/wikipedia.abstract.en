BENJAMIN KENT (1708â€“1788) was an American minister and later the Massachusetts Attorney General before the American Revolution and acting Attorney General during much of Robert Treat Paine's tenure (1777-1785).[1] Prior to the American Revolution, Kent was the lawyer who took on most of the cases of slaves suing their masters for personal illegal enslavement,[2] which contributed to the demise of slavery in Massachusetts. He has been called an "ardent patriot"[3] and was a member of the North End Caucus and prominent member of the Sons of Liberty, which formed to protest the passage of the Stamp Act of 1765.[4] The efforts of the Sons of Liberty created the foundation for the Boston Tea Party. Kent called for independence early in the American Revolution.
