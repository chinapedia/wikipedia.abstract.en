The _ODYSSEY_ (;[1] _Od√Ωsseia_, in Classical Attic) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the _Iliad_, the other Homeric epic. The _Odyssey_ is fundamental to the modern Western canon; it is the second-oldest extant work of Western literature, while the _Iliad_ is the oldest. Scholars believe the _Odyssey_ was composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.[2]
