The NGAGYUR NYINGMA NUNNERY INSTITUTE () was founded by Penor Rinpoche in 1995. Buddhist nuns there study a nine-year course on sutra and tantra along with poetry, grammar, composition and so on, a syllabus virtually identical to that of Ngagyur Nyingma Institute. In 2002, the institute began sending teachers to teach in other nunneries including to India, Bhutan, and Nepal.[1][2]
