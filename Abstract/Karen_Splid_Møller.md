KAREN SPLID MØLLER (1800–1880) was a Norwegian cookbook writer who is remembered for the handwritten cookbook which she began to compile in 1819, making it one of the oldest sources of Norwegian recipes. It consists mainly of recipes for desserts, cakes and pastries but also includes details for a number of fine hot dishes. As the book was compiled at Moldegård, the house where she lived in Molde in the northernmost part of Western Norway, it is known as _kokebok fra Moldegård_ or the Moldegård Cookbook.[1][2]
