Tissot_The_Creation.jpg[1]]] A CREATION MYTH (or COSMOGONIC MYTH) is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it.[2][3][4] While in popular usage the term _myth_ often refers to false or fanciful stories, members of cultures often ascribe varying degrees of truth to their creation myths.[5][6] In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths, metaphorically, symbolically and sometimes in a historical or literal sense.[7][8] They are commonly, although not always, considered cosmogonical mythsâ€”that is, they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness._See:_
