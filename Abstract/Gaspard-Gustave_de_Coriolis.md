GASPARD-GUSTAVE DE CORIOLIS (; 21 May 1792 – 19 September 1843) was a French mathematician, mechanical engineer and scientist. He is best known for his work on the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference, leading to the Coriolis effect. He was the first to apply the term _travail_ (translated as "work") for the transfer of energy by a force acting through a distance.[1]
