REAL ESTATE TECHNOLOGY is a broad term that encompasses the application of information technology and platform economics to real estate markets[1][2]. Because some goals of real estate technology include reducing paperwork or making transactions quicker and more efficient, it is often thought of as overlapping with financial technology. Contemporary digital real estate technologies could therefore include property management using digital dashboards, smart home technology, research and analytics, listing services/tech-enabled brokerages, mobile applications, residential and commercial lending, 3D-modeling for online portals, automation[3], crowdfunding real estate projects, shared spaces management[4], as well as organizing, analyzing, and extracting key data from lengthy rental documents.[5]
