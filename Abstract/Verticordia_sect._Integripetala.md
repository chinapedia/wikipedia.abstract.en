_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _INTEGRIPETALA_ is one of six sections in the subgenus _Eperephes_. It includes five species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are mostly small, bushy shrubs with needle-like leaves and dark red to pink or creamy-white flowers with their petals having smooth edges. Most species are confined to the wheatbelt.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he described the section and gave it the name _Integripetala_.[2][3] The name _Integripetala_ is from the Latin words _integer_ meaning "whole", "entire" or "sound"[4] and _petalum_ meaning "petal"[5] referring smooth or entire edges of the petals in these species.[6]
