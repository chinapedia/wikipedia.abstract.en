AFFIRMING THE CONSEQUENT, sometimes called CONVERSE ERROR, FALLACY OF THE CONVERSE, or CONFUSION OF NECESSITY AND SUFFICIENCY, is a formal fallacy of taking a true conditional statement (e.g., "If the lamp were broken, then the room would be dark,") and invalidly inferring its converse ("The room is dark, so the lamp is broken,") even though the converse may not be true. This arises when a consequent ("the room would be dark") has one or more _other_ antecedents (for example, "the lamp is not plugged in" or "the lamp is in working order, but is switched off").
