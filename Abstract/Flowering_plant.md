The FLOWERING PLANTS, also known as ANGIOSPERMS, ANGIOSPERMAE[1][2] or MAGNOLIOPHYTA, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species.[3] Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. However, they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, _angiosperm_ means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant. The term comes from the Greek words _angeion_ ("case" or "casing") and sperma ("seed").
