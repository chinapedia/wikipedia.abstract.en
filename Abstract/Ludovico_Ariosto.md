LUDOVICO ARIOSTO (, also ,[1][2][3][4] ; 8 September 1474 â€“ 6 July 1533) was an Italian poet. He is best known as the author of the romance epic _Orlando Furioso_ (1516). The poem, a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's _Orlando Innamorato_, describes the adventures of Charlemagne, Orlando, and the Franks as they battle against the Saracens with diversions into many sideplots. Ariosto composed the poem in the ottava rima rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work.
