In mathematics, a COUNTABLE SET is a set with the same cardinality (number of elements) as some subset of the set of natural numbers. A countable set is either a finite set or a COUNTABLY INFINITE set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.
