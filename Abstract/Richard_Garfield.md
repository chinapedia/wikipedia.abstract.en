RICHARD CHANNING GARFIELD (born June 26, 1963) is an American mathematician, inventor, and game designer. Garfield created _Magic: The Gathering_, which is considered to be the first modern collectible card game (CCG). _Magic_ debuted in 1993 and its success spawned many imitations.[1] Garfield oversaw the successful growth of _Magic_ and followed it with other game designs.[2] Included in these are _Netrunner_, _BattleTech(CCG)_, _Vampire: The Eternal Struggle_, _Star Wars Trading Card Game_, _The Great Dalmuti_, _Artifact_, and the board game _RoboRally_. He also created a variation of the card game Hearts called Complex Hearts.[3] Garfield first became passionate about games when he played the roleplaying game _Dungeons & Dragons_,[4] so he designed _Magic_ decks to be customizable like roleplaying characters.[5] Garfield and _Magic_ are both in the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.[6]
