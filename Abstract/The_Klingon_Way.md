_THE KLINGON WAY: A WARRIOR'S GUIDE_ (Klingon: _TLHINGAN TIGH: SUVWI' DEVMEH PAQ_) is a 1996 book by the linguist Marc Okrand that was published by Pocket Books. _The Klingon Way_ is a collection of proverbs and sayings in the constructed language of Klingon, ascribed to the Klingon race and Klingon culture in the fictional _Star Trek_ universe. Okrand first began constructing the Klingon language in the 1980s when he was hired to produce Klingon dialogue for _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_, going on to publish _The Klingon Dictionary_. _The Klingon Way_ expanded the Klingon lexicon, and was followed by _Klingon for the Galactic Traveler_.
