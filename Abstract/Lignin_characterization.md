The term "LIGNIN CHARACTERIZATION" (or "LIGNIN ANALYSIS") refers to a group of activities within lignin research aiming at describing the characteristics of a lignin by determination of its most important properties.[1] Most often, this term is used to describe the characterization of technical lignins by means of chemical or thermo-chemical analysis. Technical lignins are lignins isolated from various biomasses during various kinds of technical processes such as wood pulping. The most common technical lignins include lignosulphonates (isolated from sulfite pulping), kraft lignins (isolated from kraft pulping black liquor), organosolv lignins (isolated from organosolv pulping), soda lignins (isolated from soda pulping) and lignin residue after enzymatic treatment of biomass.
