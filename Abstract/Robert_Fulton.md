ROBERT FULTON (November 14, 1765 â€“ February 25, 1815) was an American engineer and inventor who is widely credited with developing a commercially successful steamboat; the first was called _The North River Steamboat_ (later _Clermont_). In 1807 that steamboat traveled on the Hudson River with passengers, from New York City to Albany and back again, a round trip of 300 miles, in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traffic and trade on major American rivers.
