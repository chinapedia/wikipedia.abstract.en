PALM CREEK VIRUS (PCV) is an insect virus belonging to the genus _Flavivirus_, of the family _Flaviviridae_. It was discovered in 2013 from the mosquito _Coquillettidia xanthogaster_. The female mosquitoes were originally collected in 2010 from Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, Alyangula, Groote Eylandt, Jabiru and the McArthur River Mine, and had since been preserved. The discovery was made by biologists at the University of Queensland.[1] The virus is named after Palm Creek, near Darwin, from where it was originally isolated.[2]
