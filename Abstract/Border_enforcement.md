BORDER ENFORCEMENT is a type of immigration enforcement whereby a country enforces its immigration laws by trying to prevent people from crossing its border or borders illegally. There are multiple methods a country can use to do this, including patrolling its border and building walls along part or all of it.[1] The term is most commonly used in regards to the efforts by the United States government to prevent people from migrating illegally to the U.S. by crossing the Mexico-United States border. Since 2002, the number of United States Border Patrol agents has more than doubled, to a total of 20,273 (as of September 2016), and federal spending on the Patrol has increased from $1.4 to $3.8 billion over the same time.[2] In addition to the Patrol, agencies responsible for border enforcement in the U.S. include Immigration and Customs Enforcement.[3]
