TEDX CONFERENCES are independently organized events licensed by the organization in charge of the TED conferences. TEDx conferences agree to follow certain principles set out by the main organization.[1] TEDx events are non-profit, but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.[2] Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a Creative Commons license.[3] In 2011, TED began a program called "TEDx in a Box" that allows people in developing countries to hold TEDx events. TEDx also expanded to include TEDxYouth events, TEDx corporate events and TEDxWomen, among other events. As of January 2014, TEDx talk library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries[4][5] In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.[6][7] TEDx presentations also include live performances, which are catalogued in the TEDx Music Project.[8] According to TEDxSanta Cruz, "as of 2015, over 1,500 [TEDx events] have been scheduled all over the world".[9]
