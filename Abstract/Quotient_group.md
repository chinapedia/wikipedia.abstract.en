A QUOTIENT GROUP or FACTOR GROUP is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves some of the group structure (the rest of the structure is "factored" out). For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo _n_ can be obtained from the group of integers under addition by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of _n_ and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory.
