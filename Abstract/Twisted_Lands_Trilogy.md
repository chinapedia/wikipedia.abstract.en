The TWISTED LANDS TRILOGY is a Psychological/Supernatural, horror-mystery-thriller hidden-object video game series, created by Alawar, a Russian-based video game developer, publisher and distributor company.It is perhaps one of the most recognized, if not popular PC games created by Alawar. The first game in the series, Twisted Lands: Shadow Town, which released on October 21, 2010. The sequel, Twisted Lands 2, also known as Twisted Lands: Insomniac, was released in 2012. A third game, Twisted Lands: Origins, was released at the end of that very same year, however, received negative reviews and criticism for its very pale and much brighter atmosphere, that unlike the two other games didn't have. Some people have found the game rather appreciative and not all reviews have been negative. The third entry (possibly the last in the series as nothing has been heard about a fourth game happening), is more of a spin-off title than a regular sequel, and the plot is very different from the two others, having nothing at all to do with the first games in the trilogy.
