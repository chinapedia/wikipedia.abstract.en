HINDI (Devanagari: हिन्दी, IAST: _Hindī_), or MODERN STANDARD HINDI (Devanagari: मानक हिन्दी, IAST: _Mānak Hindī_) is a standardised and Sanskritised register[1] of the Hindustani language. Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, is one of the official languages of India, along with the English language.[2] It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[3] However, it is not the national language of India because no language was given such a status in the Indian constitution.[4][5]
