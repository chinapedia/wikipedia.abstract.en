MEMsfounding.jpg in 1986 first introducing the term "microelectromechanical systems"]] MEMS_Microcantilever_in_Resonance.png]] MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (MEMS, also written as MICRO-ELECTRO-MECHANICAL, MICROELECTROMECHANICAL or MICROELECTRONIC AND MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS and the related MICROMECHATRONICS and MICROSYSTEMS) is the technology of microscopic devices, particularly those with moving parts. It merges at the nano-scale into nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and nanotechnology. MEMS are also referred to as micromachines in Japan, or _micro systems technology_ (_MST_) in Europe.
