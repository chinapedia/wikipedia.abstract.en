In logic and mathematics PROOF BY CONTRADICTION is a form of proof that establishes the truth or validity of a proposition by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction. Proof by contradiction is also known as INDIRECT PROOF, PROOF BY ASSUMING THE OPPOSITE, and _REDUCTIO AD IMPOSSIBILE_. It is a particular kind of the more general form of argument known as _reductio ad absurdum_.[1][2]
