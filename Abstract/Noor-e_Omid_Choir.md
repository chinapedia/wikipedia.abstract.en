NOOR-E OMID CHOIR is an amateur SATB choir and the first choir of the kind in Afghanistan.[1] It was founded in 2015 by a 22-year-old Afghan musician, Omid Noori, who has been the conductor of the choir since then. He also happens to be the first operatic singer in Afghanistan.[2] Noor-e Omid is the first polyphonic choir in the history of Afghanistan music; all the former ensembles were singing in unison known as “chorus”, which indicates the structure of such choirs in native language.[3]
