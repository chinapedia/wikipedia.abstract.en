_CHILDREN OF DUNE_ is a 1976 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the third in his _Dune_ series of six novels. Initially selling over 75,000 copies, it became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field.[1] The novel was critically well-received for its gripping plot, action, and atmosphere,[2] and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1977.[3] It was originally serialized in _Analog Science Fiction and Fact_ in 1976, and was the last _Dune_ novel to be serialized before book publication. The novels _Dune Messiah_ and _Children of Dune_ were published in one volume by the Science Fiction Book Club in 2002 and the two were adapted into a well-received television miniseries entitled _Frank Herbert's Children of Dune_ by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003.
