GEORGE BERNARD SHAW (26 July 1856 –  2 November 1950), known at his insistence simply as BERNARD SHAW, was an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as _Man and Superman_ (1902), _Pygmalion_ (1912)'' and Saint Joan'' (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
