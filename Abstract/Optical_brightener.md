OPTICAL BRIGHTENERS, OPTICAL BRIGHTENING AGENTS (OBAS), FLUORESCENT BRIGHTENING AGENTS (FBAS), or FLUORESCENT WHITENING AGENTS (FWAS), are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm) by fluorescence. Fluorescent emission is a short-lived period of light emission by a fluorophore, unlike phosphorescence, which is long-lived. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a "whitening" effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore.[1] LaundrydetergentGlow.jpg
