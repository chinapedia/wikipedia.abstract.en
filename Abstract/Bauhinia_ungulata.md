_BAUHINIA UNGULATA_ is a shrub species (up to 7 m height) in the tropical Americas, from Mexico to Paraguay. It is commonly found throughout the Brazilian open savannas of Cerrado and Pantanal. Its nocturnal flowers are pollinated by phyllostomid bats, mainly the small Glossophaginae _Glossophaga soricina_ and _Anoura caudifer_ and the Phyllostominae _Phyllostomus discolor_, which visit the flowers singly or in pairs [1]
