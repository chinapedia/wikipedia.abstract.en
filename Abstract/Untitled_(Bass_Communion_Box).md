UNTITLED (or BOX SET) is a box set compilation of songs released by British musician, songwriter, and producer Steven Wilson under the pseudonym Bass Communion. It contains many rarities from the last 15 years of Steven's ambient and drone work, especially from vinyl-only editions of Bass Communion albums. It also features the previously unreleased track "Temporal", recorded in 2012 as a homage to composer Harrison Birtwistle and his 1971 composition "Chronometer" â€“ both pieces are created entirely from the sounds of clocks and other timekeeping devices.
