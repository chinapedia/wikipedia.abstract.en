Most languages of Europe belong to the '''Indo-European language family. Out of a total population of 744 million (as of 2018), some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language; within Indo-European, the three largest phyla are ROMANCE, GERMANIC and SLAVIC with more than 200 million speakers each, between them accounting for close to 90% of Europeans. Smaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include Hellenic (Greek, c. 10 million), Baltic (c. 7 million), Albanian (c. 5 million), Indo-Aryan (Romani, c. 1.5 million) and Celtic (including Welsh, c. 1 million).
