BEECHCRAFT is a brand of Textron Aviation[1] since 2014. Originally, it was a brand of BEECH AIRCRAFT CORPORATION, an American manufacturer of general aviation, commercial, and military aircraft, ranging from light single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports, business jets, and military trainers.[2][3] Beech later became a division of Raytheon and later Hawker Beechcraft before a bankruptcy sale turned its assets over to Textron (parent company of Beech's cross-town Wichita rival, Cessna Aircraft Company).[4][5][6]
