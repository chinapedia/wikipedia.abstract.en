In the United States, a FORM 1099-OID is a tax form intended to be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service by the holder of debt instruments (such as bonds, notes, or certificates) which were discounted at purchase to report the taxable difference between the instruments' actual value and the discounted purchase price.[1][2] Like other 1099 forms, it is normally filled out by a payer of income (such as an employer) and sent both to tax authorities and the recipient of the income.
