The EINSTEIN–PODOLSKY–ROSEN PARADOX (EPR PARADOX) is a thought experiment proposed by physicists Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) that they interpreted as indicating that the explanation of physical reality provided by Quantum Mechanics was incomplete.[1] In a 1935 paper titled _Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?_, they attempted to mathematically show that the wave function does not contain complete information about physical reality, and hence the Copenhagen interpretation is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
