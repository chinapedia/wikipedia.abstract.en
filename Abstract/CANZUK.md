CANZUK is an acronym for the theoretical political and economic union of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as part of an international body similar in scope to the former European Economic Community.[1] This includes increased trade, foreign policy co-operation, military co-operation, and mobility of citizens between the four states.[2] The idea is supported by various organisations and think tanks, such as CANZUK International, the Adam Smith Institute and politicians from the four countries.
