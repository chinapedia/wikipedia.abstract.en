_FEDERATED AMALGAMATED GOVERNMENT RAILWAY & TRAMWAY SERVICE ASSOCIATION V NSW RAIL TRAFFIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION_, known as the _RAILWAY SERVANTS CASE_,[1] is an early High Court of Australia case that held that employees of State railways could not be part of an interstate industrial dispute under the conciliation and arbitration power,[2] applying the doctrine of "implied inter-governmental immunities". The doctrine was emphatically rejected by the High Court in the 1920 _Engineers' Case_,[3] and in 1930 the High Court upheld the validity of an award binding on state railway authorities.[4]
