THE GREEN PARTY - AN COMHAONTAS GLAS (, literally "Green Alliance") is a green[1] political party that operates in Ireland—both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was founded as the ECOLOGY PARTY OF IRELAND in 1981 by Dublin teacher Christopher Fettes. The party became the GREEN ALLIANCE in 1983 and adopted its current English name in 1987 while the Irish name was kept unchanged. Its leader is Eamon Ryan, its deputy leader is Catherine Martin and its chairman is Roderic O'Gorman. Green Party candidates have been elected to most levels of representation: local (in the Republic), Dáil Éireann, Northern Ireland Assembly and European Parliament.
