STRATIFIED SLOPE DEPOSITS or _GRÈZES LITÉES_ (original French name) are accumulations of debris that are traditionally associated with periglaciation but that can also form in other settings.[1][2] The deposits have a weak sorting and a coarse bedding. Stratified slope deposits are usually found at the lower slopes of valleys where thicknesses vary but may exceed 10 meters. Periglacial stratified slope deposits are thought to be the result of rock fragmented by frost being accumulated downslope.[3]
