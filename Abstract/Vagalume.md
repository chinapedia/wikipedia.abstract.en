VAGALUME is a music portal from Brazil. Created in 2002 by the couple Ana Let√≠cia Torres and Daniel Lafraia, they used the PHP language with MySQL database to initially create a small base of lyrics of songs. Gradually, users sent lyrics and included information from artists of all musical genres (more than 1,000 new lyrics are sent daily). Over time, other content was added, for example autographs, biographies and discography. The stylized logo was created by remembering the insect firefly. The portal is one of the most accessed throughout Brazil and Portugal.[1][2]
