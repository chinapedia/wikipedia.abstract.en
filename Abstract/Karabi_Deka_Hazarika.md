KARABI DEKA HAZARIKA () (born on 1 January 1953) is an Indian writer. She was born in the small coal mining township of Borjan in the Indian state of Nagaland. Her father, Minakanta Hazarika, was a doctor who spent most of his life serving the poor in the Naga hills. A great Assamese literary author, Atul Chandra Hazarika was her maternal uncle who later became Karabi's chief source of literary inspiration. Born amidst the green hills, lush forests and rivers instilled an early love and awe for nature in her that is echoed in her literary works in later years, especially her poems.
