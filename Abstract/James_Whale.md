JAMES WHALE (22 July 1889 – 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theater director and actor. He is best remembered for several horror films: _Frankenstein_ (1931), _The Old Dark House_ (1932), _The Invisible Man_ (1933) and _Bride of Frankenstein_ (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical _Show Boat_. He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, and many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.
