LINCOS (an abbreviation of the Latin phrase _lingua cosmica_) is a constructed language first described in 1960 by Dr. Hans Freudenthal in his book _Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse, Part 1_. It is a language designed to be understandable by any possible intelligent extraterrestrial life form, for use in interstellar radio transmissions. Freudenthal considered that such a language should be easily understood by beings not acquainted with any Earthling syntax or language. Lincos was designed to be capable of encapsulating "the whole bulk of our knowledge."
