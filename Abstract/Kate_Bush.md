CATHERINE BUSH (born 30 July 1958) is an English singer-songwriter and record producer. Bush came to notice in 1978 when, aged 19, she topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single "Wuthering Heights", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song.[1] She has since released 25 UK Top 40 singles, including the top-10 hits "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", "Babooshka", "Running Up That Hill", "Don't Give Up" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and "King of the Mountain". She has released ten studio albums, all of which reached the UK Top 10, including the UK number-one albums _Never for Ever_ (1980), _Hounds of Love_ (1985), and the compilation _The Whole Story_ (1986). She is the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.[2]
