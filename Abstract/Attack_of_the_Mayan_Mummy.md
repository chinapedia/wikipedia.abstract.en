_ATTACK OF THE MAYAN MUMMY_ is the Americanized, English-dubbed version of a 1957[1][2] Mexican horror film called _La Momia Azteca_, aka _La Momia_. It was made by Jerry Warren, who removed a huge portion of the original Mexican film, replacing it with newly filmed footage featuring American actors.[3][4] This solved the problem of redubbing the original Spanish dialogue into English.[5] Warren released his film in 1963.[6][7][8][9] He later re-released the film in 1965 on a double bill with his _Creature of the Walking Dead_.[10]
