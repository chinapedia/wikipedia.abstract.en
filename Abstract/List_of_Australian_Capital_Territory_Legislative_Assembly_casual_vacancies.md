This is a list of CASUAL VACANCIES IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, caused by the resignation or death of an incumbent member. A departure creates a casual vacancy which is filled by a countback of the votes for the departing member at the previous election. Prior to the introduction of the Hare-Clark electoral system in 1995, casual vacancies were instead filled by appointment by the party of the departing member.[1]
