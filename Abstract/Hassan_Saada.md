HASSAN SAADA (born 2 January 1994) is a Moroccan boxer. He was initially scheduled to compete in the men's light heavyweight competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics, but Saada was ejected from the competition after being arrested for sexual assault the day before the opening ceremony.[1][2] Saada was arrested and jailed during the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape were made against him by two Brazilian women who worked in the Olympic Village in Barra da Tijuca as waitresses, one day before he was due to fight at the Olympic Games.[3] Saada was stripped of his Olympic competitor status, and could face 6-10 years in prison if convicted.[4]
