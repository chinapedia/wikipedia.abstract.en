New Zealand (__) is an island country located in the south-western Pacific Ocean, near the centre of the water hemisphere. It consists of a large number of islands, estimated around 600, mainly remnants of a larger land mass now beneath the sea. The two main islands by size are the North Island (or _Te Ika-a-Māui_) and the South Island (or _Te Waipounamu_), separated by the Cook Strait; the third-largest is Stewart Island (or _Rakiura_), located off the tip of the South Island across Foveaux Strait. The three largest islands stretch across latitudes 34° to 47° south.[1]
