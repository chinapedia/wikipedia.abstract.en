VALE DO RIBEIRA is a region in the south of the state of São Paulo and the northeast of the state of Paraná, Brazil. It contains a large part of the Ribeira de Iguape River valley, from which it takes its name, as well as the coastal Iguape-Cananéia-Paranaguá estuary lagoon complex. The region is environmentally rich, with large areas of well-preserved Atlantic Forest, but economically poor.
