COPRINI is a tribe of scarab beetles, in the dung beetle subfamily (Scarabaeinae). Scholtz et al.[1] describe them as tunnellers that are shiny black, of moderate to large size (9–30 mm long) and with a strongly convex shape. They also, however state that the grouping based on these characteristics has little phylogenetic validity, and the placement of several genera in this and related tribes is likely to change.[2]
