7Α-HYDROXYDEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE (7Α-HYDROXY-DHEA; 7Α-OH-DHEA), also known as 3Β,7Α-DIHYDROXYANDROST-4-ENE-17-ONE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring steroid and a major metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that is formed by CYP7B1 (steroid 7α-hydroxylase) in tissues such as the prostate gland and by CYP3A4 in the liver.[1][2] The major metabolic pathway of DHEA outside the liver is via 7-hydroxylation into 7α-OH-DHEA and 7β-OH-DHEA.[3] 7α-OH-DHEA has weak estrogenic activity, selectively activating the estrogen receptor ERβ.[4] In addition, 7α-OH-DHEA may be responsible for the known antiglucocorticoid effects of DHEA.[5][6]
