MUHI-UD-DIN MUHAMMAD[1] (3 November 16183 March 1707),[2] commonly known by the sobriquet AURANGZEB (Persian: "Ornament of the Throne")[3] or by his regnal title ALAMGIR (Persian: "Conqueror of the World"),[4] was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over nearly the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years.[5][6][7] Widely considered to be the last effective Mughal emperor,[8] Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and is regarded as one of the few rulers who have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout South Asia.[9][10]
