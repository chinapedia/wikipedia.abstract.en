LOUISE MARTINE LAURETTE CONRING (1824â€“1891) was a Danish superintendent, hospital inspector, deaconess and nurse. Charged by Princess Louise to investigate the Deaconess Institutes in Germany, Sweden and France with a view to creating one in Denmark, Conring was the first Danish woman to be trained in nursing, ultimately heading the Deaconess Institute in Copenhagen from 1863.[1][2]
