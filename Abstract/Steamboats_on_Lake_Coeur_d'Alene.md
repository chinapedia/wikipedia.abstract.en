STEAM NAVIGATION ON LAKE COEUR D'ALENE lasted from the 1880s to the 1930s. More steamboats operated on Lake Coeur dâ€™Alene than on any other lake west of the Great Lakes.[1] The high point of steam navigation was probably from 1908 to 1913. After that railroads, and increasingly automobile and truck traffic on newly built highways supplanted steam navigation, although some vessels continued to be operated unit the mid-1930s.
