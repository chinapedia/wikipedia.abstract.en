_THE OLD ENGLISH BOETHIUS_ is an Old English translation/adaptation of the sixth-century _Consolation of Philosophy_ by Boethius, dating from between c. 880 and 950. Boethius's work is prosimetrical, alternating between prose and verse, and one of the two surviving manuscripts of the Old English translation renders the poems as Old English alliterative verse: these verse translations are known as the _METRES OF BOETHIUS_.
