The GAME.COM is a fifth-generation handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in August 1997.[1][2] A smaller version, the GAME.COM POCKET PRO, was released in mid-1999. The first version of the Game.com can be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem for Internet connectivity,[3] hence its name referencing the top level domain .com.[4] It was the first video game console to include a touchscreen and the first handheld console to include Internet connectivity. The Game.com sold less than 300,000 units and was discontinued in 2000 because of poor sales.
