The ALEVI ZAZA or ZAZA ALEVIS is the community of ZAZAS adhering to Alevism, the other group of Zazas adhering to Sunni Islam (the Sunni Zaza), roughly divided by half. The Zazas are sometimes regarded a sub-group of Kurds;[1] the Zaza language is part of the Western Iranian languages, though it is not mutually intelligible with the Kurdish language. There is a history of antagonism between the two Zaza religious groups, taken advantage of by the Turkish government. The Alevi Zaza are concentrated in the region of Dersim. There are also Kurmanj-speaking (Kurds) and Turkish-speaking Alevis in Eastern Turkey. The term "Kurdish Alevis" is used to include both Kurmanj-speakers and Zaza-speakers. The community is generally supportive of the Turkish state.
