OXAMATE is a salt of oxamic acid.[1] Oxamate has a molecular formula of C₂H₂NO₃^(−) an isosteric form of pyruvate. Oxamate is a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Oxamate is a possible pyruvate analog that has the ability to halt lactate production by inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase, effectively stopping the conversation process of pyruvate to lactate.[2]
