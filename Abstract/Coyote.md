The COYOTE (from Nahuatl _coy≈çtl_ ), PRAIRIE WOLF or BRUSH WOLF, _Canis latrans_, is a canine native to North America. It is smaller than its close relative, the gray wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia, though it is larger and more predatory, and is sometimes called the AMERICAN JACKAL by zoologists.
