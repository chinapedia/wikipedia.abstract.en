JOSIAH VAVASSEUR (26 November 1834 â€“ 13 November 1908) was an English industrialist who founded Vavasseur and Co. (also known as London Ordnance Works). In 1883 the company merged with W.G. Armstrong and Company, and Vavasseur became a director of the firm. Late in life he adopted Cecil Fisher, only son of admiral John Fisher, and the Fisher family inherited his fortune, including Kilverstone Hall.
