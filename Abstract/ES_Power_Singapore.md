ES POWER[1][2][3] is an electricity retailing service started by Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte. Ltd.[4] in 2016. Environmental Solutions claims that ES Power is the first electricity service in Singapore to offer complete carbon offset to its customer. Carbon offsets are given through carbon credits which, in turn, are used to invest in non-renewable energy related projects around the globe, especially in developing countries. ES Power presently operates in Singapore and its customer base is exclusively in Singapore.
