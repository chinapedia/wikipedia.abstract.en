BA√çA DE TARRAFAL or TARRAFAL BAY is a bay of the Atlantic Ocean on the northwest coast of the island of Santiago in Cape Verde. The town of Tarrafal lies at its southeastern shore, and 643 m high Monte Graciosa rises from its northern shore.[1] Most of its coast is rocky, but there is a stretch of beach near the city. The headland Ponta Preta marks the northwestern limit of the bay; there is a lighthouse (Farol da Ponta Preta) on it. Farol_Ponta_Preta.jpg
