The ECONOMY OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC is a developed export-oriented social market economy based in services, manufacturing, and innovation, that maintains a high-income welfare state and the European social model.[1] The Czech Republic participates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union, and is therefore a part of the economy of the European Union, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna, instead of the euro. It is a member of the OECD. The Czech Republic ranks 15th in inequality-adjusted human development and 14th in World Bank Human Capital Index ahead of countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom or France. It was described by _The Guardian_ as "one of Europeâ€™s most flourishing economies".[2]
