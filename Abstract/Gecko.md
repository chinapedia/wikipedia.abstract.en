GECKOS are lizards belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, found in warm climates throughout the world. They range from 1.6 to 60Â cm (0.64 to 24 inches). Most geckos cannot blink, but they often lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist. They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light.
