The AMERICAN FIBER HELMET (also known as the AMERICAN PITH HELMET, SAFARI HELMET, TROPICAL HELMET, SUN HELMET, ELEPHANT HELMET, or the PRESSED FIBER HELMET) is a type of sun helmet made of pressed fiber material that has been used as part of the military uniform by various parts of the United States Armed Forces, from 1934 to present.[1][2][3][4] As of 2017, the helmet continues to be worn by US military rifle range cadres, as an icon for marksmanship excellence.[5][6][7][8] The helmet is technically not a pith helmet, insofar as it is not constructed from pith material.[9] However, in the more generic sense of design style, this type of sun helmet is modeled similarly to one and thus often referred to in common use as a pith helmet.[10] Additionally, the helmet is not a combat helmet, insofar as it was not originally designed to protect the head during combat. However, the helmet was nonetheless assigned, at various times in the 1930s and 1940s, as combat gear for use in active theaters.[11]
