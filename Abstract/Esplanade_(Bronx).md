ESPLANADE, also known as ESPLANADE AVENUE, is a street with a series of green traffic medians in the Morris Park and Pelham Gardens neighborhoods of the Bronx in New York City. The street was constructed in 1912 atop a covered trench of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway that was cut through a hill. Atop the hill, Esplanade intersects with Pelham Parkway, a road with its own series of green traffic medians designated as parkland.
