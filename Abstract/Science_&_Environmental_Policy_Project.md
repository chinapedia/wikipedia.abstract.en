THE SCIENCE & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PROJECT (SEPP) is an advocacy group financed by private contributions based in Arlington, Virginia in the United States.[1] It was founded in 1990 by atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer.[2] SEPP disputes the prevailing scientific views of climate change and ozone depletion. SEPP also questioned the science used to establish the dangers of secondhand smoke, arguing the risks are overstated.[3]
