POLLADA[1] is a traditional FOOD FROM PERU, and makes up one of the most well-known plates in Peruvian cuisine. It is a special food because it is prepared in exchange of receiving a profit to help a particular need. For example, raising funds for a disease, financial support for some activity, or simply raising money for profit.
