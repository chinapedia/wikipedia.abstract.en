According to various texts within the Hebrew Bible, it also contained Aaron's rod and a pot of manna.[3] Hebrews 9:4 describes: "The ark of the covenant [was] covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tablets of the covenant."[4]
