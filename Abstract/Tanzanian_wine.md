TANZANIAN WINE industry does not have much international recognition, however, it is the second largest producer of wine in Sub-Saharan Africa after South Africa.[1] Compared to the rest of the world, the history of wine in Tanzania is very recent and dates back to just a few years before independence. Tanzania only has one major grape growing region and it is centered around the capital city Dodoma. The most common grape varietals in the region are Chenin Blanc, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and a local variety named for a Dodoma sub-region, Makutupora. Initially wine production and grape growing was limited to missionaries, however, in 1969 the government entered the market with the formation of the Dodoma Wine company.
