In the common law of torts, _RES IPSA LOQUITUR_ (Latin for "the thing speaks for itself") is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. Although modern formulations differ by jurisdiction, common law originally stated that the accident must satisfy the necessary elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, causation, and injury. In _res ipsa loquitur_, the elements of duty of care, breach, and causation are inferred from an injury that does not ordinarily occur without negligence.
