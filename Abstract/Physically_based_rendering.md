Physically_Based_Rendering_Sample_2.png texture rendered close-up using physically based rendering principles. Microsurface abrasions cover the material, giving it a rough, realistic look even though the material is a metal. Specular highlights are high and realistically modeled at the appropriate edge of the thread using a normal map.]] Physically_Based_Rendering_Sample_1.png rendered using PBR. Even though this is a rough, opaque surface, more than just diffuse light is reflected from the brighter side of the material, creating small highlights, because "everything is shiny" in the physically-based rendering model of the real world. Tessellation is used to generate an object mesh from a heightmap and normal map, creating greater detail.]]
