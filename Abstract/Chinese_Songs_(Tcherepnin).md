_CHINESE SONGS_, Op. 95, is a 1962 song collection composed in America by Alexander Tcherepnin, who had performed in North China during the 1930s.[1] The collection of six songs (op.95 1962) was dedicated to the Chinese baritone Yi-Kwei Sze. Sze recorded the songs, together with two other Chinese songs from Op. 71 (1945), accompanied by pianist Brooks Smith in 1965 (Iramac LP 6517), which won the Netherlands Edison Award in 1966. Tcherepnin had also made English translations of the Chinese texts, and the six songs were also performed in English by Korean soprano Christina Cha in English in 1965.[2]
