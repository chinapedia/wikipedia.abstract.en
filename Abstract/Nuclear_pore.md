A NUCLEAR PORE is a part of a large complex of proteins, known as a NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX that spans the nuclear envelope, which is the double membrane surrounding the eukaryotic cell nucleus. There are approximately 1,000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the nuclear envelope of a vertebrate cell, but it varies depending on cell type and the stage in the life cycle.[1] The human nuclear pore complex (hNPC) is a 110 MDa structure. The proteins that make up the nuclear pore complex are known as nucleoporins; each NPC contains at least 456 individual protein molecules and is composed of 34 distinct nucleoporin proteins.[2]About half of the nucleoporins typically contain solenoid protein domains—either an alpha solenoid or a beta-propeller fold, or in some cases both as separate structural domains. The other half show structural characteristics typical of "natively unfolded" or intrinsically disordered proteins, i.e. they are highly flexible proteins that lack ordered tertiary structure.[3] These disordered proteins are the _FG_ nucleoporins, so called because their amino-acid sequence contains many phenylalanine—glycine repeats.[4]
