Blessed JAKOB GRIESINGER (c. 1407 - 11 October 1491) was a German Roman Catholic professed religious from the Order of Preachers and a former soldier.[1] Griesinger served in the Italian province of Campania as a soldier to the duke and later became disillusioned with such a life before turning to a sudden call to the religious life to which he dedicated the remainder of his life to.[2]
