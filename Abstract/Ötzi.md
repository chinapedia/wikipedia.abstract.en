ÖTZI (), also called THE ICEMAN, the SIMILAUN MAN (), the MAN FROM HAUSLABJOCH, the TYROLEAN ICEMAN, and the HAUSLABJOCH MUMMY, is the well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE.[1] The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps, hence the nickname "Ötzi", near Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy.[2] He is Europe's oldest known natural human mummy, and has offered an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) Europeans. His body and belongings are displayed in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy.
