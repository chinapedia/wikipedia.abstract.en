Smuggling is a common trope or theme in literature and can be found in a wide range of works – from the 18th century novels of Charlotte Turner Smith to Prosper Mérimée's 19th century novella, _Carmen_ (the inspiration for numerous films as well as Bizet's opera, _Carmen_)[1] to the James Bond novel (and later film) _Diamonds are Forever_.
