Crannog_-_geograph.org.uk_-_35551.jpg, on Loch Tay, Scotland]] A CRANNOG[1][2][3] (; ; ) is typically a partially or entirely artificial island, usually built in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Unlike the prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps that were built on the shores and were inundated only later on, crannogs were built in the water, thus forming artificial islands.
