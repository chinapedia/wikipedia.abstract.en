Between 1977 and 2006, the BRISTOL-MEYERS SQUIBB Foundation presented annual AWARDs of US$50,000 to scientists for distinguished achievements in fields such as cancer, infectious disease, neuroscience, nutrition, and cardiovascular disease.[1] The recipients of these awards were selected by pre-eminent members of each field and past award recipients. Bristol-Myers Squibb had no role in determining the recipients of the awards.[2]
