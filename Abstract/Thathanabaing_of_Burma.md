The THATHANABAING OF BURMA (, also spelt THATHANAPAING) served as the head of the Buddhist Sangha (order of monks) in pre-colonial Burma, until the position was abolished in 1938 by the British authorities in colonial Burma. The Thathanapaing was responsible for managing the monastic hierarchy and education at monasteries. The Thathanabaing resided in a royal monastery near the kingdom's capital.[1] However, appointees were usually commoners born in the villages, with no blood relationship with the royal house.[2] Their appointments were made on the basis of their mastery of Buddhist knowledge and literature.[3]
