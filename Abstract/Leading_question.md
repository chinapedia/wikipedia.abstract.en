In common law systems that rely on testimony by witnesses, a LEADING QUESTION or SUGGESTIVE INTERROGATION[1] is a question that suggests the particular answer or contains the information the examiner is looking to have confirmed. Their use is restricted in eliciting testimony in court, to reduce the ability of the examiner to direct or influence the evidence presented. Depending on the circumstances, leading questions can be objectionable or proper.
