In signal processing, the MULTIDIMENSIONAL EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION (MULTIDIMENSIONAL EMD) is the extension of the 1-D EMD algorithm into multiple-dimensional signal. The Hilbert–Huang empirical mode decomposition (EMD) process decomposes a signal into intrinsic mode functions combined with the Hilbert spectral analysis known as Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT). The multidimensional EMD extends the 1-D EMD algorithm into multiple-dimensional signals. This decomposition can be applied to image processing, audio signal processing and various other multidimensional signals.
