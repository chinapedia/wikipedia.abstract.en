WARREN is the traditional name for the largest settlement in the civil parish of Gawsworth in Cheshire, England. It is situated just to the north west of Gawsworth church and hall, and approximately south of the market town of Macclesfield.[1] Nowadays the name is seldom used, the inhabitants usually saying that they live in Gawsworth.
