ARISTOPHANES (;[1] , ; c. 446 â€“ c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion (),[2] was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These provide the most valuable examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy and are used to define it, along with fragments from dozens of lost plays by Aristophanes and his contemporaries.[3]
