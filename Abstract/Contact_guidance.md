CONTACT GUIDANCE refers to a phenomenon for which the orientation of cells and stress fibers is influenced by geometrical patterns such as nano/microgrooves on substrates, or collagen fibers in gels and soft tissues.[1][2][3] This phenomenon was discovered in 1912,[4] and the terminology was introduced in 1945,[5] but it is with the development of tissue engineering that researchers drew increasing attention on this topic, seeing the potential of contact guidance in influencing the morphology and organization of cells. Nevertheless, the biological processes underlying contact guidance are still unclear.
