_SMOOTH JAZZ CAFE_ is the seventh solo studio album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in October 2014 by Cleopatra Records/Purple Pyramid. The album was recorded at Tarquin's mobile Jungle Room Studios in the New York Catskill Mountains at a 200 year old Farmhouse. Additional recording was done in the quaint town of New Paltz (village), New York. Tarquin reached out to some old guitar friends to guest with him on the album, Chuck Loeb on _Zoot Suit_, Hal Lindes on _The Big Sleep_ & _Birdbrain_, and Denny Jiosa on _Hipster_ & _Chrome Dome_. The entire album was engineered, produced and performed by Tarquin. Most of the album is new material with exception of 4 songs, _Peg, Swift Kick, Yorkville and Spanish Harlem._
