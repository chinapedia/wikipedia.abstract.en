SQL ( _S-Q-L_,[1] "sequel"; STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)[2][3][4][5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM. First, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify _how_ to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
