XIAO HAN (蕭翰) (d. 949), probably né SHULÜ HAN (述律翰), also named DILIE (敵烈), courtesy name HANZHEN (寒真), was a general of the Khitan Liao dynasty. After a brief Liao conquest of central China after Liao's second emperor Emperor Taizong destroyed Later Jin, Xiao was left in control of Later Jin's former capital Daliang, but was unable to hold it. He later plotted against Emperor Taizong's nephew and successor Emperor Shizong and was executed.
