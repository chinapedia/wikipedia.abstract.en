China did not become involved with the World Bank group until 1980. Since its entry into the World Bank, China has made significant contributions to the World Bank while also borrowing from the bank to finance various projects within its territory. As a rising major power, China struggles to obtain appropriate voting power within the World Bank. Because of this, China and other BRICs nations formed its own development bank called the New Development Bank in 2014.[1]
