RABBI SHLOMO WAHRMAN (_Hebrew_: הרב שלמה הלוי וואהרמאן) was the Rosh HaYeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County and one of the leading Torah Scholars of his time, held in high esteem by the Torah World. As an eyewitness to Kristallnacht and a Torah luminary with an all encompassing knowledge of the breadth and depth of Torah scholarship, he made a tremendous impression on the hundreds of students whom he taught over his thirty years as a Rebbe and Rosh Yeshiva at HANC. He authored thirteen books and hundreds of articles on matters related to Jewish law, Talmudic analysis, and Jewish history.
