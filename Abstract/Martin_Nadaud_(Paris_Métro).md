Metro_de_Paris_-_Ligne_3_-_Gambetta_02.jpg MARTIN NADAUD is a merged station, one of Paris m√©tro's ghost stations. This station was absorbed into Gambetta following line reorganisation in 1969.[1] During the 1960s, it became evident that Porte de Bagnolet was inadequately served by public transport, although there is strong demand. It was therefore decided to extend the line 3 towards Bagnolet from the Place Gambetta. Because the flow of travelers to Porte de Bagnolet was expected to be much more important than towards the Porte des Lilas, the development of a fork was rejected. The terminus of Porte des Lilas gave way in favor of that of Bagnolet, with creation of a shuttle from Gambetta - to Porte des Lilas, which comprises the line 3a.
