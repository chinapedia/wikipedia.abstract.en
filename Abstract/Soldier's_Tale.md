SOLDIER'S TALE (foaled 28 March 2001) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was a talented but injury-prone sprinter who raced only eight times before he retired at the age of six. Unraced as a two-year-old he won one minor race from two starts in early 2004 before being off the course for over a year. As a four-year-old in 2005 he won his first two races including the Chipchase Stakes before finishing fourth in the July Cup. He missed the whole of the 2006 season before returning as a six-year-old in 2007. He finished third in the Duke of York Stakes and the John of Gaunt Stakes before recording his biggest victory on his final appearance when he defeated a top-class international field to win the Golden Jubilee Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Australia.
