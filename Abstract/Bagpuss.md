_BAGPUSS_ is a British children's television series, made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate through their company Smallfilms. The series of 13 episodes was first broadcast from 12 February 1974[1] to 7 May 1974. The title character was "a saggy, old cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams".[2] Although only 13 episodes were made, it remains fondly remembered,[3] and was frequently repeated in the UK for 13 years.[4] In 1999 _Bagpuss_ topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme.
