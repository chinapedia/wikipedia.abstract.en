POLITICS OF MOZAMBIQUE takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Mozambique is head of state and head of government of a multi-party system.[1][2][3] Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Mozambique as "hybrid regime" in 2016.[4]
