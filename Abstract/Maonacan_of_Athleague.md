Saint MAONACAN, otherwise MANCHAN (, , fl. A.D. 500) OF ATHLEAGUE (, "the stony-ford of St. Manchan" or "ford of flagstones", ), was an early Irish Christian saint. He founded a church in Athleague, in county Roscommon. Saint Manchan's feast day is celebrated on February 18 (February 7 in the Old Calendar), by Roman Catholics, and Anglicans. The life of Manchan of Athleague is obscured because many persons named Manchan are to be found among the monastically-inclined medieval Irish Christians.
