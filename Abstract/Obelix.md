OBELIX (; ) (also known as Elie Sfeir) is a cartoon character and protagonist in the French comic book series Asterix. He works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman, and is Asterix's best friend. Obelix is noted for his fatness, the menhirs he carries around on his back and his superhuman strength. He fell into a cauldron of the Gauls' magic potion when he was a baby, causing him to be the only Gaul in Asterix's village who is in a permanent state of superhuman strength. Because of this already enormous strength, Obelix is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again, a ban he regards as being tremendously unfair. Other characteristics are his simplemindedness, his love and care for his dog Dogmatix, his anger when someone refers to him as being _"fat"_, his enthusiasm for hunting and eating wild boars, and beating up Romans. His catchphrase is: _"Ils sont fous ces romains"_, which translates into "These Romans are crazy!", although he considers nearly every other nationality to be just as strange.
