The SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The Scientific Revolution took place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment. While its dates are debated, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's _De revolutionibus orbium coelestium_ (_On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_) is often cited as marking the beginning of the Scientific Revolution.
