In Nigeria, the freedom of expression is protected by section 39 (1) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria constitution.[1] Despite of this constitutional protection, the Nigerian media was controlled by the government throughout its history and even to this day. Furthermore, there was a brief moment from 1979 to 1983 when the government of the Second Nigerian Republic handed over the task of censorship to the military. NIGERIAN CENSORS typically target certain kinds of idea, such as ethnic discussion, political opposition, and morality incorrectness.
