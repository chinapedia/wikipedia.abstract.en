CAROL THOMAS (n√©e MCCUNE; born 5 June 1955) is an English former footballer and was the second captain of England, taking over from Sheila Parker in 1976. She is the most successful captain of the England women's national team in terms of tournament successes and recognised as one the genuine but unsung pioneers of the modern women's game.[1][2][3] Thomas became captain at the age of 21 and held that position until her retirement with a then record 56 caps in 1985. She remained the longest, continuous serving captain for a period of 26 years before being overtaken by Faye White in 2011.
