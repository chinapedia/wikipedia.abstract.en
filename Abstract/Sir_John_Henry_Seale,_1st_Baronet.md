SealeArms.png SIR JOHN HENRY SEALE, 1ST BARONET (1780â€“1844) of Mount Boone in the parish of Townstal near Dartmouth in Devon, was a Whig Member of Parliament for Dartmouth in 1838.[1] He was created a baronet on 31 July 1838.[2] He owned substantial lands in Devon, mainly at Townstal and Mount Boone. Together with the Earl of Morley of Saltram House near Plymouth, he built several bridges in Dartmouth, most notably the Dart crossing.[3] His influence over the pocket borough of Dartmouth ceased after the 1832 Reform Act and subsequently he was in competition for that parliamentary seat with Arthur Howe Holdsworth.
