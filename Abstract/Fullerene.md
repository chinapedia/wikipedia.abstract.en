C60a.png C20_Fullerene.png Carbon_nanotube_zigzag_povray_cropped.PNG C60-Fulleren-kristallin.JPG A FULLERENE is an allotrope of carbon whose molecule consists of carbon atoms connected by single and double bonds so as to form a closed or partially closed mesh, with fused rings of five to seven atoms. The molecule may be a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, or many other shapes and sizes. Graphene (isolated atomic layers of graphite), which is a flat mesh of regular hexagonal rings, can be seen as an extreme member of the family.
