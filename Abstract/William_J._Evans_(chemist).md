WILLIAM J. EVANS is a distinguished chemistry professor at the University of California Irvine who specialises in the fields of inorganic and organometallic chemistry. He was born in Wisconsin where he also completed his undergraduate studies. He received his Bachelorâ€™s degree in 1969 after focusing on research into pentaboranes. After the completion of his undergraduate studies he attended The University of California, Los Angeles where he obtained his PhD in 1973 for his research into metallocarboranes.[1] He then spent some time at Cornell University where he completed his postdoctoral research in transition metal phosphite complexes. In 1975, Evans arrived at the University of Chicago where he decided to begin research into actinides and lanthanides1. He moved to the University of California, Irvine in 1983 where he has remained ever since1.Evans has won many accolades which include the ACS Award in Inorganic Chemistry in 2005 and the prestigious Tolman award in 2014 for his research in the field of coordination chemistry of the late elements. [2] Evans has a particular interest in meeting the global energy demand. His research focuses on the role that actinides and lanthanides can play in these processes3. Evans and his research group believe that the unique properties displayed by these rare metals, could help to solve global problems through potential new catalysis and improved processes.[3] Tris(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl).png
