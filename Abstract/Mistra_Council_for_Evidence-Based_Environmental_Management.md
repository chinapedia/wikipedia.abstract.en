THE MISTRA COUNCIL FOR EVIDENCE-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (MISTRA EVIEM) is an independent council that conducts systematic reviews and maps on various environmental issues to improve the basis for decisions in Swedish environmental policy. By synthesising and analysing all available evidence on a certain topic, Mistra EviEM is contributing to environmental management placed on a scientific foundation. In Sweden, systematic reviews of this kind have previously been conducted primarily in the medicine and health care sector, for instance by the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU).
