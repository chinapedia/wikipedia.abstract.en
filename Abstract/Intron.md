An INTRON is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product.[1][2] The word _intron_ is derived from the term _intragenic region_, i.e. a region inside a gene.[3] The term _intron_ refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.[4] Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons. Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses, and can be located in a wide range of genes, including those that generate proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). When proteins are generated from intron-containing genes, RNA splicing takes place as part of the RNA processing pathway that follows transcription and precedes translation.
