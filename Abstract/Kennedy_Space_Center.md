The JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER (KSC, originally known as the NASA LAUNCH OPERATIONS CENTER) is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers. Since December 1968, the KSC has been NASA's primary launch center of human spaceflight. Launch operations for the Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC.[1] Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and even own facilities on each other's property.
