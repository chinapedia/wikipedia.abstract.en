DAVID PAUL CRONENBERG (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian filmmaker, writer, and actor. He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infection, technology, and the intertwining of the psychological with the physical. In the first third of his career, he explored these themes mostly through horror and science fiction films such as _Scanners_ (1981) and _Videodrome_ (1983), although his work has since expanded beyond these genres.
