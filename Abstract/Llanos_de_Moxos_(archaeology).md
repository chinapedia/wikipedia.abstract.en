The LLANOS DE MOXOS (Moxos Plains), also known as the LLANOS DE MOJOS and the BENI SAVANNA, have extensive remains of pre-Columbian agricultural societies scattered over most of Beni Department, Bolivia. The remains testify to a well-organized and numerous indigenous people. This contradicts the traditional view of archaeologists, notably Betty Meggers, that the Amazon River Basin was not environmentally able to sustain a large population and that its indigenous inhabitants were hunter-gatherer bands or slash-and-burn farmers. In the 1960s, petroleum company geologists and geographer William Denevan were among the first to publicize the existence of extensive man-made earthworks in the Amazon, especially in the Llanos de Moxos. Llanos_de_moxos1.png Many types of earthworks have been documented in the Llanos, including monumental mounds, raised fields for agriculture, natural and man-made forest islands, canals and causeways, ring ditches, and fish weirs. There is no evidence that the inhabitants were politically united in pre-Columbian times, but rather they seem to have been organized into a large number of small, independent polities speaking a variety of different, unrelated languages.
