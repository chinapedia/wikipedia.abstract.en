Entry_for_827_in_the_Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle,_which_lists_the_eight_bretwaldas.gif _BRETWALDA_ (also _BRYTENWALDA_ and _BRETENANWEALDA_, sometimes capitalised) is an Old English word. The first record comes from the late 9th-century _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_. It is given to some of the rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention. The term _bretwalda_ also appears in a 10th-century charter of Ã†thelstan. The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either 'wide-ruler' or 'Britain-ruler'.
