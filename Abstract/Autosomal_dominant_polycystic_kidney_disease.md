AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (ADPKD) is the most prevalent, potentially lethal, monogenic human disorder.[1] It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained to a large extent by its genetic heterogeneity and modifier genes.[2] It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases â€” a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias.[3][4][5] Over 50% of patients with ADPKD eventually develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation.[6][7] ADPKD is estimated to affect at least one in every 1000 individuals worldwide, making this disease the most common inherited kidney disorder with a diagnosed prevalence of 1:2000 and incidence of 1:3000-1:8000 in a global scale.[8][9][10][11][12]
