_FIQH_ (;[1] ) is Islamic jurisprudence.[2] _Fiqh_ is often described as the human understanding of the _sharia,_[3] that is human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the Quran and the _Sunnah_ (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and His companions). Fiqh expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (_ijtihad_) of the Quran and _Sunnah_ by Islamic jurists (_ulama_)[4] and is implemented by the rulings (_fatwa_) of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas _sharia_ is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, _fiqh_ is considered fallible and changeable. _Fiqh_ deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam as well as political system. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (_madh'hab_) of _fiqh_ within Sunni practice, plus two (or three) within Shi'a practice. A person trained in _fiqh_ is known as a _faqÄ«h_ (plural _fuqaha_).[5]
