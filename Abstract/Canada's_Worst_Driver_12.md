_CANADA'S WORST DRIVER 12_ was the twelfth season of the Canadian reality TV show _Canada's Worst Driver,_ which aired on the Discovery Channel. As with previous years, eight people, nominated by their family or friends, enter the Driver Rehabilitation Centre to improve their driving skills. The focus of this season was on the Dangers of Speeding. This year, the Driver Rehabilitation Centre is located at the Dunnville Airport in Dunnville, Ontario for the seventh straight season. The initial drive started in Niagara Falls, Ontario and the final road test occurred in Hamilton, Ontario. This season notably featured reckless and texting while driving contestant KRYSTAL MCCANN, who not only drove in a way that was rude, inconsiderate, selfish and unacceptable,[1] but also became the first-ever _Canada's Worst Driver_ "winner" to _not_ receive the trophy due to her refusal to learn.[2] Reactions towards Krystal's behaviour on the show was overwhelmingly negative, due to her overall equally negative appearance, especially her rudeness noted towards host Andrew Younghusband.[3] In an interview, Krystal explained that she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after the show, which explained her volatile attitude.[4]
