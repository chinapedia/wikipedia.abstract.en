In computing, COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE (CGI) offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically. Such programs are known as _CGI scripts_ or simply as _CGIs_. The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server. In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.[1]
