Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as CAVALRYMAN, HORSEMAN, DRAGOON, or TROOPER. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants. Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.
