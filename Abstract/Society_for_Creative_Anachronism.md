ChivalryTournament.JPG participants]] The SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM (SCA) is an international living history group with the aim of studying and recreating mainly Medieval European cultures and their histories before the 17th century. A quip often used within the SCA describes it as a group devoted to the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been",[1] choosing to "selectively recreate the culture, choosing elements of the culture that interest and attract us".[2] Founded in 1966, the non-profit educational corporation has over 30,000 paid members [3] with about 60,000 total participants in the society (including members and non-member participants).[4]
