Two trains collided on the main line in Semnan Province between Semnan and Damghan, Iran, on 25 November 2016, resulting in 49 deaths and 103 injuries.[1] There were reported difficulties with the rescue operation due to the incident's remote location 4Â km from the nearest station, Haft-Khan,[2] and because only one helicopter could reach the scene immediately to join the rescue operation.[3] It was the deadliest rail disaster in Iran since the Nishapur train disaster in 2004.
