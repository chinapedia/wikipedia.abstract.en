MANCHAN , (), was an early Christian saint credited with founding many early Christian churches in Ireland. His life is obscured because many people named Manchan are found among the monastically-inclined Medieval Irish Christians, and the name is a diminutive of , . Manchan probably died of famine during volcanic winters caused by the extreme weather events of 535â€“536, which preceded the 6th century _Justinian plague of Mohill_. The Shrine of Manchan is a remarkable and unique example of Irish Urnes style art, adapted to Ringerike style, skillful in design and execution. Saint Manchan's feast day is celebrated 14 February by Roman Catholics, and Anglicans.
