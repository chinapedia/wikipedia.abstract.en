The 2017 ZAGREB LOCAL ELECTIONS were held on 21 May and 4 June 2017 for the Mayor of Zagreb and members of the Zagreb Assembly. Milan Bandić, the 52nd and incumbent mayor since 2005 (previously also the 50th mayor from 2000–2002), ran for a sixth 4-year term. As no candidate won an absolute majority of the vote in the first round, a second round of elections took place on 4 June 2017 between the two highest-placed candidates in terms of popular vote: incumbent mayor Milan Bandić of the Bandić Milan 365 - Labour and Solidarity Party and former Minister of Construction Anka Mrak Taritaš of the Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats. In the run-off Bandić won re-election as mayor, taking 51.8% of the votes against 46% for Mrak Taritaš (with 2.1% of the votes being blank or invalid). Turnout for the election was 47.7% in the first round and 41.2% in the second round.
