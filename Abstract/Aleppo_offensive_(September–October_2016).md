The ALEPPO OFFENSIVE OF SEPTEMBERâ€“OCTOBER 2016 was the military operation launched in Aleppo in late September 2016 by the Syrian Army and its allies aiming to capture all of the remaining rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo. Rebel forces controlling East Aleppo at that time were primarily fighters of Fatah Halab[1][2] (which includes FSA units),[3] although a significant number of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham fighters were also present.[4]
