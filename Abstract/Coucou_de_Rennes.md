Coq_coucou_de_Rennes-2.jpg COUCOU DE RENNES is a French breed of chicken. The chicken was a historic Breton breed which had nearly disappeared by the late twentieth century.[1] However, starting in 1988 with a rebreeding effort by the Ecomuseum of Rennes, the breed has since recovered.[2] There is an association of Coucou de Rennes chicken producers that has breeding regulations. These state that the minimum age of slaughter must not be before 130 days for the fowl, 180 days for the hens and roosters, and 200 days for the capons.[3]
