The Icelandic family model can be compared to that of the Anglo-Saxon model in regards to its benefits and the Scandinavian model in regards services. Iceland was seen as a lagging country compared to other European countries in terms of family policy. Family policy in Iceland had been long ignored by its policy makers. Not until 1994 when the United Nations celebrated the Year of Family. After the recognition of the importance of family by the United Nations, Iceland's parliament sought to establish a resolution to the concept of family policy that was gaining greater political attention in Iceland.
