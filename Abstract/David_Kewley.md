DAVID "_DAWSEY_" KEWLEY (1850 â€“ 25 March 1904) was a Manx boatman, member of the Douglas Rocket Brigade and volunteer in the Lifeboat Service, renowned for his involvement in the saving of lives at sea. The actual number of people saved from drowning by _Dawsey_ differ. Some contemporary reports list that he saved as many as 38 lives,[1] others 25,[2] but it is generally recognised that he was directly involved in saving the lives of at least 23 people, and as a member of the Douglas Lifeboat Crew assisted in the saving of many more. He was a recipient of numerous awards from the Royal Humane Society for his life-saving exploits.[3][4][5] Although a man of dauntless courage, he would never speak about his feats and disliked hearing other people talk about them.[6]
