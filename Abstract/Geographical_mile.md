The GEOGRAPHICAL MILE is a unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc along the Earth's equator. For the 1924 International Spheroid this equalled 1855.4 metres.[1] _The American Practical Navigator_ 2017 defines the geographical mile as .[2] Greater precision depends more on choice of ellipsoid than on more careful measurement: the length of the equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is which makes the geographical mile 1855.3248 m,[3] while the _IERS Conventions (2010)_ takes the equator to be making the geographical mile 1855.3250Â m,[4] 1.2 millimetres longer. In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles.
