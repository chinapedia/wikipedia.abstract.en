HOTEL DER NEDERLANDEN (also HOTEL DHARMA NIRMALA during its last 10 years) was a historic hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. Hotel der Nederlanden was one of the three grand hotels in Batavia during the last period of the colonial rule, the other being Hotel des Indes and the Grand Hotel Java. The hotel had operated for more than a century, after which it was demolished in 1969 and was replaced with the Bina Graha presidential office.
