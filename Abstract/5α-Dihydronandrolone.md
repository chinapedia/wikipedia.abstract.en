5Α-DIHYDRONANDROLONE (also known as 5Α-DHN, DIHYDRONANDROLONE, DHN, 5Α-DIHYDRO-19-NORTESTOSTERONE, or 5Α-ESTRAN-17Β-OL-3-ONE) is a naturally occurring anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 5α-reduced derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).[1] It is a major metabolite of nandrolone and is formed from it by the actions of the enzyme 5α-reductase analogously to the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from testosterone.[2][3]
