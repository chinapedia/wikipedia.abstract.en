The 2016–17 LIGA DE FÚTBOL PROFESIONAL BOLIVIANO SEASON was the 40th season of Bolivia's top-flight football league and the last season under the LFPB name. This season comprised three tournaments (_Apertura 2016_, _Apertura 2017_ and _Clausura 2017_) after an agreement was reached between LFPB and ANF (Second Division) to change the calendar to a single calendar year following the reforms implemented for the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana by CONMEBOL ahead of the 2017 season.
