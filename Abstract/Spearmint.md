SPEARMINT, also known as GARDEN MINT, COMMON MINT, LAMB MINT and MACKEREL MINT,[1][2] is a species of mint, _MENTHA SPICATA_, native to Europe and southern temperate Asia, extending from Ireland in the west to southern China in the east. It is naturalized in many other temperate parts of the world, including northern and southern Africa, North America and South America.[3][4] It is used as a flavoring in food and herbal teas. The aromatic oil, called oil of spearmint, is also used as a flavoring and sometimes as a scent.
