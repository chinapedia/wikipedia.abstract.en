LOP NUR WILD CAMEL NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE () protects one of the three remaining habitats of the Wild Bactrian camel, a critically endangered species.[1] The reserve stretches around the north, east, and south of Lop Nur, a dry lake in a desert known as the "Sea of Death", and one of the most arid regions in the world. The reserve was established in 1986 by Xinjiang Province, and has been modified over the years. The reserve is under pressure from new roads in the area, development of mining interests, and illegal hunting.[2][3]
