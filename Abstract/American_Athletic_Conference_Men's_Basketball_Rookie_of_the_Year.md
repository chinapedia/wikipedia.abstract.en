The AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR is a basketball award given to the American Athletic Conference's one or more best men's basketball players in their first year of competitive play. The conference formed in 2013â€“14 after many schools departed from the original Big East Conference to form their own conference. Austin Nichols of Memphis was the first-ever winner.[1] This award is voted for by the coaches and can only be awarded once to any player.
