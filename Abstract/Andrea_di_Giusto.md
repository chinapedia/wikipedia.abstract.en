Andrea_di_giusto,_polittico_con_madonna_e_santi,_1455,_01.JPG ANDREA DI GIUSTO (c. 1400- 2 September 1450, Florence), rarely also known as ANDREA MANZINI or ANDREA DI GIUSTO MANZINI was a Florentine painter of the late Gothic to early Renaissance style in Florence and its surrounding countryside. Andrea was heavily influenced by masters Lorenzo Monaco, Bicci di Lorenzo, Masaccio, and Fra Angelico, and tended to mix and match the motifs and techniques of these artists in his own work.[1] Andrea was an eclectic painter and is considered a minor master of Florentine early Renaissance art. Andrea trained under Bicci di Lorenzo as a G_arzone_. He painted his most significant works, three altarpieces, in the Florentine contado, or countryside; these altarpieces were created for Santâ€™Andrea a Ripalta in Figline, Santa Margarita in Cortona, and the Badia degli Olivetani di San Bartolomeo alle Sacce near Prato. Aside from his major altarpieces, Andrea painted several Frescoes over the course of his career. He, along with other minor masters, are also known to have provided several different types of art, including triptychs and frescoes, for Romanesque pievi, or rural churches with baptistries. Moreover, he was well known for several types of smaller craft objects, such as small tabernacles. He is said to have worked between 1420 and 1424 under Bicci di Lorenzo on paintings for Santa Maria Nuova. He is said to have worked with Masaccio in painting the _Life of San Giuliano_ for the Polyptych of Pisa, including the painting of the _Madonna and Child_, in 1426. He also appears to have collaborated in 1445 with Paolo Uccello in the Capella dell'Assunta in the Prato Cathedral.[2] In 1428, he is listed as a member of the _Arte dei Medici e Speziali_ guild in Florence as "Andrea di Giusto di Giovanni Bugli".[3] His son, Giusto d'Andrea, was also a painter and worked with Neri di Bicci and Benozzo Gozzoli. Andrea died in Florence in 1450.[4]
