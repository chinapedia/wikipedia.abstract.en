Countries_by_GDP_(Nominal)_in_2014.svg'', 2014[1]]] _'Gross domestic product (GDP_') is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period, often annually.[2][3] GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations.[4]
