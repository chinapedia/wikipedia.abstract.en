The 1923 TOLEDO ROCKETS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Toledo University (renamed the University of Toledo in 1967) during the 1923 college football season. In their third season under head coach James Dwyer, the team compiled a 6â€“4 record, the first winning season in program history, won the Northwest Ohio League championship, and shut out its opponents in all six victories.[1] The team's 87 points against Findlay established the program's single game scoring record and remains the second highest point total in program history.[2] Gib Stick's 30 point tally in the Findlay game also remains tied for the second highest single game scoring total in program history.[3]
