_NEPENTHES NEBULARUM_ is a tropical pitcher plant native to southeastern Mindanao in the Philippines.[1] The species was described by Geoff Mansell, owner of Exotica Plants. It has so far been recorded with certainty from only two mountains, where it grows in submontane mossy forest at an altitude of up to 1800 m above sea level. It has been found in close proximity to _N. copelandii_, _N. truncata_, and a taxon matching the description of _N. cornuta_.[2]
