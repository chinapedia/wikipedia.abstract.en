The AZKARRA is the first vehicle produced by Canadian company Atelier Girfalco Limit√©e. It is a three-wheel all-electric sports vehicle accommodating two passengers side by side. Production was initially set to begin in 2017 with first deliveries scheduled for the Spring of 2017, but the team has decided to take a step back and insure that the vehicle is ready before launching production.
