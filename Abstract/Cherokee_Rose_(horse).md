CHEROKEE ROSE (1 March 1991 â€“ ca. 2012) was an Irish-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed promise as a two-year-old in 1993 when she won one of her three races and finished a very close second in the Group Three Prix du Calvados. She failed to win in an interrupted three-year-old season. She emerged as a top class performer in 1995 when she won the Prix du Palais-Royal, Prix de la Porte Maillot, Prix Maurice de Gheest and the Haydock Sprint Cup. After her retirement from racing she has considerable success as a dam of winners.
