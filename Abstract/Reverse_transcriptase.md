A REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed _reverse transcription_. Reverse transcriptases are used by retroviruses to replicate their genomes, by retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes, and by some non-retroviruses such as the hepatitis B virus, a member of the _Hepadnaviridae_, which are dsDNA-RT viruses.
