_POKEY THE PENGUIN_ is an online comic strip created in 1998. It chronicles the adventures of a penguin named Pokey and a large cast of other characters. _Pokey_ comics are drawn crudely and minimalistically, and they consist largely of a string of non-sequiturs and absurd journeys, with a token effort towards more traditional plots and continuity (such as the conflict with the Italians over arctic-circle candy) that tend to be established through oblique references to off-screen characters and non-events. Today, new comic strips appear sporadically, although formerly the site was updated daily.[1]
