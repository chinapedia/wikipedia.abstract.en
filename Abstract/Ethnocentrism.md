ETHNOCENTRISM is the act of judging another culture based on preconceptions that are found in the values and standards of one's own culture â€“ especially regarding language, behavior, customs, and religion.[1][2] These aspects or categories are distinctions that define each ethnicity's unique cultural identity.[3]
