REYKJAVÍK ( ;[1] ) is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxaflói bay. Its latitude is 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state (Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, is slightly further north at 64°10', but Greenland is a constituent country, not an independent state). With a population of around 128,793 (and 228,231 in the Capital Region),[2][3] it is the center of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity, and is a popular tourist destination.
