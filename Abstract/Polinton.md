POLINTONS (also called MAVERICKS) are large DNA transposons which contain genes with homology to viral proteins and which are often found in eukaryotic genomes. They were first discovered in the mid-2000s and are the largest and most complex known DNA transposons. Polintons encode up to 10 individual proteins and derive their name from two key proteins, a DNA POLymerase and a retroviral-like INTegrase.[1][2][3][4][5]
