JALĀL AD-DĪN MUHAMMAD RŪMĪ (), also known as JALĀL AD-DĪN MUHAMMAD BALKHĪ (), MEVLÂNÂ/MAWLĀNĀ (, "our master"), MEVLEVÎ/MAWLAWĪ (, "my master"), and more popularly simply as RUMI (30 September 1207 – 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century Persian[1][2][3] poet, jurist, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic originally from Greater Khorasan.[4][5] Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims, and the Muslims of South Asia have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries.[6] His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats. Rumi has been described as the "most popular poet"[7] and the "best selling poet" in the United States.[8][9]
