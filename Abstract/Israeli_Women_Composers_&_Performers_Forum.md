The ISRAELI WOMEN COMPOSERS & PERFORMERS FORUM is a non-profit organization, founded to establish, base and promote women composers in the Israeli music scene, and to bring their music to a wide recognition. The foundation was established in 2000 by the composer Hagar Kadima as the Israeli Women Composers Forum. In 2014 the Forum has also expanded to include women performers, thus getting its current name. In the same year, the Forum has become a musical organization uniting composers and performers and is assisted by the Felicja Blumenthal Music Center, Tel Aviv.
