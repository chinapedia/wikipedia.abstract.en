WARRATYI is the site of a prehistoric rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Located around north of Adelaide and about inland, it has been identified as the oldest known site of human habitation in inland Australia.[1] Newspapers reported that this rock shelter was discovered by chance in 2011 by a local resident who stumbled upon it while looking for somewhere to go to the toilet. Researchers found thousands of artefacts and bone fragments, which enabled them to date the shelter's occupation to a number of periods between 49,000 and 10,000 years ago. The finds include the earliest evidence in Australia of the development of bone and stone-axe technology, the use of ochre, and interaction with megafauna such as _Diprotodon_.
