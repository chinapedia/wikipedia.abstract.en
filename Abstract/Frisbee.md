Frisbee_090719.jpg registered trademark "Frisbee"]] A FRISBEE (pronounced , origin of the term dates to 1957, also called a FLYING DISC or simply a DISC) is a gliding toy or sporting item that is generally plastic and roughly in diameter with a pronounced lip. It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in flying disc games. The shape of the disc is an airfoil in cross-section which allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air. Spinning it imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic force, allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance.
