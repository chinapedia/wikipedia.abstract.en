The _CURSUS HONORUM_ (Latin: lit. "course of honor", or more colloquially "ladder of offices") was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in both the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. It was designed for men of senatorial rank. The _cursus honorum_ comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts. Each office had a minimum age for election, and Lex Villia Annalis made those requirements formal. There were minimum intervals between holding successive offices and laws forbade repeating an office.[1]
