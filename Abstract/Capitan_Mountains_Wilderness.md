CAPITAN MOUNTAINS WILDERNESS is a Wilderness area located within the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico. The area was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System on December 19, 1980 by Public Law 96-550. Located in the Capitan Mountains, this area is recognized as the birthplace of Smokey Bear.[1] There are a number of trails through the wilderness, but access to trailheads is difficult as most are only reachable by four-wheel-drive roads.[2]
