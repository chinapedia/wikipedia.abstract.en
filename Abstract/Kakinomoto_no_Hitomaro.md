Sanjūrokkasen-gaku_-_1_-_Kanō_Tan’yū_-_Hitomaru.jpg: _Hito-maru_ (人丸) , 1648]] KAKINOMOTO NO HITOMARO (柿本 人麻呂 or 柿本 人麿; – ) was a Japanese _waka_ poet and aristocrat of the late Asuka period. He was the most prominent of the poets included in the _Man'yōshū_, the oldest _waka_ anthology, but apart from what can be gleaned from hints in the _Man'yōshū_, the details of his life are largely uncertain. He was born to the Kakinomoto clan, based in Yamato Province, probably in the 650s, and likely died in Iwami Province around 709.
