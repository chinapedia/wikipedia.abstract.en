Chile_relief_map_1974.png with major roads and rail lines depicted.]] TRANSPORT IN CHILE is mostly by road. The south of the country is not connected to central Chile by road, except through Argentina, and water transport also plays a part there. The railways were historically important in Chile, but now play a relatively small part in the country's transport system. Because of the country's geography and long distances between major cities, aviation is also important.
