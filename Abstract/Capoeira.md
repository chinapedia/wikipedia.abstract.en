CAPOEIRA () is an Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance,[1][2][3] acrobatics,[4] and music.[5][6] It was developed by enslaved Africans in Brazil[7] at the beginning of the 16th century.[8] It is known for its acrobatic and complex maneuvers, often involving hands on the ground and inverted kicks. Emphasizes flowing movements rather than fixed stances, the _ginga_, a rocking step, is usually the focal point of the technique. The most widely accepted origin of the word _capoeira_ comes from the Tupi words _ka'a_ ("forest") _pa≈©_ ("round"),[9] referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior where fugitive slaves would hide. A practitioner of the art is called a CAPOEIRISTA ().[10][11]
