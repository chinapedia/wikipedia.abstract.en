Since August 2016, some American athletes have protested against police brutality and racism[1][2][3][4][5] by kneeling during the U.S. national anthem.[6] Since 2017, many players also began protesting against President Donald Trump's[7] criticisms of those involved in the protest as well as against Trump's policies since taking office.[8] Some observers have described the protests as politically motivated or patriotic, while others have criticized the attention to social issues during sporting events, and others have called the protests unpatriotic or disrespectful.[9][10]
