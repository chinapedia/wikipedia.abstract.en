TRIESTE SCIENCE+FICTION FESTIVAL was founded in 2000 under the name of SCIENCE PLUS FICTION by the Research and Experimentation Centre La Cappella Underground with the ambitious purpose of re-launching the _Festival Internazionale del film di fantascienza_ (International Science Fiction Film Festival), which had been held in the northern Italian city of Trieste in the years 1963â€“1982.
