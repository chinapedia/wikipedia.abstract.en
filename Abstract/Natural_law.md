Carlo_Crivelli_007.jpg, a Catholic philosopher of the Middle Ages, revived and developed the concept of natural law from ancient Greek philosophy]] NATURAL LAW (, _lex naturalis_) is a philosophy asserting that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature, endowed by nature—traditionally by God or a transcendent source—and that these can be understood universally through human reason. As determined by nature, the LAW OF NATURE is implied to be objective and universal;[1] it exists independently of human understanding, and of the positive law of a given state, political order, legislature or society at large.
