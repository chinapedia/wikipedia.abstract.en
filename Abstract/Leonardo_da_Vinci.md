LEONARDO DI SER PIERO DA VINCI (14/15 April 14522 May 1519),[1] more commonly LEONARDO DA VINCI ( ),[2] was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been called the father of ichnology,[3] and he is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. The _Mona Lisa_ is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made.[4] _The Last Supper_ is the most reproduced religious painting of all time[5] and his _Vitruvian Man_ drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well.[6] Perhaps 15 of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works—together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting—compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of Leonardo's contemporary Michelangelo.[7]
