HOWARD ROBARD HUGHES JR. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, engineer,[1] film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. He first became prominent as a film producer, and then as an influential figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from a near-fatal plane crash and increasing deafness.
