It is intended to be a premier observatory of the 2020s, combining the largest mirror yet on a near-infrared space telescope with a suite of technologically advanced instruments from around the world.[1] JWST is expected to cost at least 8.8 billion dollars, including design, construction, and five years of operations (does not include extended mission funding) or International contributions.[2][3] Its likely peak year for funding was probably 2014, when the project used more than US$650 million.[4]
