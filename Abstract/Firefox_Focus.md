FIREFOX FOCUS is a free and open-source privacy-focused browser from Mozilla, available for Android[1][2] and iOS smartphones and tablets.[3][4] Firefox Focus was initially a tracker-blocking application for mobile iOS devices, released in December 2015.[5] It was developed into a minimalistic web browser shortly afterwards.[6] However, it can still work solely as a tracking-blocker in the background of the Safari browser on Apple devices.
