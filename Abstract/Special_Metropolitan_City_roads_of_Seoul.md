There are some SPECIAL METROPOLITAN CITY ROADS IN SEOUL (). Basically in South Korea, urban municipalities maintain and designate highway routes. In Seoul, some of these routes are designated as motorways not allowed to walk. The numbering system of Seoul is complicated than the others: official number and guide number. Basically, official numbering system is used in the legal system only, while guide numbering system is used not only for the signage system, but also widely in public.
