ARCADIAN HEIGHTS (14 April 1988 â€“ after 2011) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse who recorded his biggest win in the 1994 Ascot Gold Cup. He was unraced as a two-year-old but developed into a useful stayer as a three-year-old when he won the Chester Stakes, finished second in the March Stakes and ran prominently for a long way in the St Leger. In 1992 he failed to win but ran well to take second place in the Ormonde Stakes, Henry II Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup. His prospects however became compromised by his difficult and aggressive temperament as he attempted to attack other horses during his races. An attempt to curb his behaviour by fitting him with a muzzle was only partially successful and he was gelded before the end of the year.
