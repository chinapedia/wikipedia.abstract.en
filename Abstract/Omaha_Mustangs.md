The OMAHA MUSTANGS were a professional American football team based in Omaha, Nebraska. They began as an independent, semi-pro team in the early 1960s before joining the Professional Football League of America, a newly formed league based on remnants of the United Football League, in 1965.[1] The Mustangs won the PFLA championship in their second season by defeating the Des Moines Warriors in a playoff game in front of 4,530 spectators.[2] Omaha moved to the Continental Football League for the 1968 season and finished 7-5 in the Central Division.
