Лабораторія_мікроклонального_розмноження_рослин.jpg _IN VITRO_ (meaning: _in the glass_) studies are performed with microorganisms, cells, or biological molecules outside their normal biological context. Colloquially called "test-tube experiments", these studies in biology and its subdisciplines are traditionally done in labware such as test tubes, flasks, Petri dishes, and microtiter plates. Studies conducted using components of an organism that have been isolated from their usual biological surroundings permit a more detailed or more convenient analysis than can be done with whole organisms; however, results obtained from _in vitro_ experiments may not fully or accurately predict the effects on a whole organism. In contrast to _in vitro_ experiments, _in vivo_ studies are those conducted in living organisms, including humans, and whole plants.
