SEAN EVANS (born April 26, 1986) is an American webshow producer, interviewer, and host. He is the host of the YouTube series _Hot Ones_, in which he interviews celebrities while they eat progressively spicier chicken wings. Born in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Evans found fame on the internet not only for his proficiency in celebrity interviews, but also for eating incredibly spicy food like the Carolina Reaper pepper, which holds the title for hottest pepper by Guinness World Records. He cites eating spicy food as a child for building up his tolerance.[1][2] Before working as an interviewer Evans was a copywriter for the Chicago tourism board.[3]
