Josephus_Antiquitates_Iudaice.jpg'']] The extant manuscripts of the writings of the first-century Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus include references to Jesus and the origins of Christianity. Josephus' _Antiquities of the Jews_, written around 93–94 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus Christ in Books 18 and 20 and a reference to John the Baptist in Book 18. Scholarly opinion varies on the partial authenticity of the reference in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the _Antiquities_, a passage that states that Jesus the Messiah was a wise teacher who was crucified by Pilate, usually called the _Testimonium Flavianum_.
