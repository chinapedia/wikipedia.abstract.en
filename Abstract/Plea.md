In legal terms, a PLEA is simply an answer to a claim made by someone in a criminal case under common law using the adversarial system. Colloquially, a plea has come to mean the assertion by a defendant at arraignment, or otherwise in response to a criminal charge, whether that person pleaded guilty, not guilty, no contest, (in the United States) _Alford plea_ or (in the United Kingdom) no case to answer.
