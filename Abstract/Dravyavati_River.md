DRAVYAVATI RIVER, also known as Amanishah nullah,[1] originates in Jaisalya village, on the western slope of Amber hills (part of the Aravalli Range). It flows through the Jaipur city, north to south over a length of 47.5 km, collecting storm and waste water from Naharika Nallah and Ambabari, the Ganda Nallah (draining ancient and new parts of Jaipur), and finally joins the Dhund river.[2] Most of the Jaipur city's population stays within the 10 km periphery of Dravyavati river.
