_ANTROPHYOPSIS_ is a genus of vittarioid ferns, a member of subfamily Vittarioideae and family Pteridaceae. Like other vittarioids, ferns in the genus are epiphytes with simple, straplike leaves. They are native to tropical Africa and islands of the Indian Ocean. The presence of a midrib in their leaves, the shape of their spores, and the shape of cells at the tip of their paraphyses (minute hairs on the spore-bearing structures) help to distinguish members of the genus from other vittarioids. The group was raised to the level of genus in 2016.
