The Bangladesh cricket team toured South Africa in September and October 2017 to play two Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.[1] It was Bangladesh's first tour of South Africa in nine years.[2] Ahead of the series, Faf du Plessis was appointed captain of South Africa's ODI side, replacing AB de Villiers, therefore captaining South Africa in all three formats.[3][4] However, du Plessis suffered an injury during the third ODI ruling him out of the T20I series, with JP Duminy replacing him as captain.[5]
