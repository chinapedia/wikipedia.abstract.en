Wiki-analsex.png ANAL SEX or ANAL INTERCOURSE is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure.[1][2][3] Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging.[4][5] Although _anal sex_ most commonly means penileanal penetration,[6][7][8] sources sometimes use _anal intercourse_ to exclusively denote penileanal penetration, and _anal sex_ to denote any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.[9][10]
