_SKELETOCUTIS ALUTACEA_ is a species of poroid fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It was described as new to science in 1946 by American mycologist Josiah Lincoln Lowe as _Poria alutacea_.[1] Jean Keller transferred it to the genus _Skeletocutis_ in 1979.[2] It is found in the United States and Canada, in Europe, and New Zealand, where it causes a white rot in various woody substrates.[3]
