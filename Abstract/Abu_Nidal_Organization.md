The ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) is the most common name for the Palestinian nationalist militant group FATAH â€“ THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (_Fatah al-Majles al-Thawry_). The ANO is named after its founder Abu Nidal. It was created by a split from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO in 1974. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States,[1] the United Kingdom,[2] Japan,[3] Israel and the European Union.[4] The ANO was secular and anti-Western, but was not particularly associated with a broad ideology like leftism or Marxism.[5][6]
