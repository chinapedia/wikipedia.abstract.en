HECTOR HUGH MUNRO (18 December 1870 – 14 November 1916), better known by the pen name SAKI, and also frequently as H. H. MUNRO, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture. He is considered a master of the short story, and often compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker. Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, he himself influenced A. A. Milne, Noël Coward and P. G. Wodehouse.[1]
