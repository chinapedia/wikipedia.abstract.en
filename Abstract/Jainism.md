JAINISM (),[1] traditionally known as _JAIN DHARMA_ is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called "Jains", a word derived from the Sanskrit word _jina_ (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths by destroying the karma through an ethical and spiritual life.[2] Jainism is a transtheistic religion,[3] and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as _tirthankaras_, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, as Matsya the twenty-third being Parshvanatha in 900 BCE, and twenty-fourth being the Mahāvīra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal _dharma_ with the _tirthankaras_ guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology.
