SIGISMUND (variants: Sigmund, Siegmund) is a German proper name, meaning "protection through victory", from Old High German _sigu_ "victory" + _munt_ "hand, protection". Tacitus Latinises it _Segimundus_. There appears to be an older form of the High German word "Sieg" (victory): _sigis_, obviously Gothic and an inferred Germanic form, and there is a younger form: _sigi_, which is Old Saxon or Old High German _sigu_ (both from about 9th century). A 5th century Prince of Burgundy was known both as _Sigismund_ and _Sigimund_ (see Ernst Förstemann, _Altdeutsche Personennamen_, 1906; Henning Kaufmann, _Altdeutsche Personennamen_, Ergänzungsband,1968). Its Hungarian equivalent is ZSIGMOND.
