ALBERTA PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY NO. 34, also known as HIGHWAY 34, was a highway in northwest Alberta, Canada, that existed in various configurations from the mid-1930s to the late 1990s. It was originally established in the 1930s as a east–west alternative highway to Highway 2 (then Highway 1) from north of Grande Prairie to Triangle, west of High Prairie, through the southern Peace Country via Valleyview.[1] After a number of realignments affecting the east segment of the highway in the late 1950s through mid-1960s[2][3][4] and a shortening in the early 1990s due to highway renumbering,[5][6] Highway 34 spent its final years as a highway between Highway 2 north of Grande Prairie to Valleyview before being renumbered as Highway 43 on March 1, 1998.[7][8]
