PAUL BUNYAN is a giant lumberjack in American folklore.[1][2] His exploits revolve around the tall tales of his superhuman labors,[3][4] and he is customarily accompanied by BABE THE BLUE OX. The character originated in the oral tradition of North American loggers,[5][6][7][8] and was later popularized by freelance writer William B. Laughead (1882â€“1958) in a 1916 promotional pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company.[9] He has been the subject of various literary compositions, musical pieces, commercial works, and theatrical productions.[10] His likeness is displayed in several oversized statues across North America.[11][12]
