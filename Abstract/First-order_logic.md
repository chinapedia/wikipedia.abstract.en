FIRST-ORDER LOGIC—also known as PREDICATE LOGIC and FIRST-ORDER PREDICATE CALCULUS—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as _Socrates is a man_ one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man" and _there exists_ is a quantifier while _x_ is a variable.[1] This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations;[2] in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.
