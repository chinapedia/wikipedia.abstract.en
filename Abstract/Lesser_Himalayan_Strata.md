One of the major depositional strata in the Himalaya is the LESSER HIMALAYAN STRATA from the Paleozoic to Mesozoic eras. It had a quite different marine succession during the Paleozoic, as most parts of it are sparsely fossiliferous or even devoid of any well-defined fossils. Moreover, it consists of many varied lithofacies, making correlation work more difficult. This article describes the major formations of the _Paleozoic â€“ Mesozoic Lesser Himalayan Strata_, including the _Tal Formation_, _Gondwana Strata_, _Singtali Formation_ and _Subathu Formation_.
