_JULNAR_ was a 900-ton, 210-ft long river paddle steamer built in 1908 by E. Rennie and Co. of Greenwich, London, for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. At the time she was the fastest vessel on the river. The ship, modified and renamed HMS _JULNAR_, was sunk in 1916 while attempting to steam upriver past Ottoman guns to re-supply British forces under siege in Kut-al-Amara during the Mesopotamian Campaign.[1]
