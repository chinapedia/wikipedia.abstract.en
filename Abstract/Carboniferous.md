The CARBONIFEROUS ( )[1] is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name _Carboniferous_ means "coal-bearing" and derives from the Latin words _carbō_ ("coal") and _ferō_ ("I bear, I carry"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822.
