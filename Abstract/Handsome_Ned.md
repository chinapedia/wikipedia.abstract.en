HANDSOME NED was the stage name of ROBIN DAVID MASYK (June 4, 1957 - January 10, 1987), a Canadian country singer and songwriter.[1] Although he only released a small number of singles and was never widely known outside of Toronto during his lifetime,[2] he has been credited as the catalyst for an early-1980s country music and roots rock revival in Toronto[3] which paved the way for acts such as Blue Rodeo, Prairie Oyster, Skydiggers and Cowboy Junkies to break through to greater fame,[4] and as one of the key figures in the transformation of the city's Queen Street West district into a cultural hotspot.[5]
