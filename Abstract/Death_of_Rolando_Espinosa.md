ROLANDO ESPINOSA, then mayor of Albuera, Leyte, died on November 5, 2016, at the Baybay City Provincial Jail. He was detained at the jail due to his arrest for illegal drug possession in October 2016.[1] According to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), the notorious suspects of the murder, Espinosa was killed during a shootout that he initiated when the CIDG came to the jail to serve him a search warrant.[2] Espinosa's death occurred amid allegations that he was involved in the drug trade by President Rodrigo Duterte,[3] who initiated the Philippine Drug War intending to kill criminals using or distributing drugs. The Commission on Human Rights and Karapatan have held Duterte accountable for Espinosa's death, with Senate condemning the death as an instance of extrajudicial killing.[4]
