The ACCELERATED GRAPHICS PORT (AGP) was designed as a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a video card to a computer system, primarily to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. It was originally designed as a successor to PCI-type connections for video cards. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express (PCIe); by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available,[1] with GPU manufacturers and add-in board partners eventually dropping support for the interface in favour of PCI Express.
