MERITOCRACY (_merit_, from Latin _mereō_, and _-cracy_, from Ancient Greek κράτος __ 'strength, power') is a political system in which economic goods and/or political power are vested in individual people on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as heredity or wealth.[1] Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was coined in 1958 by the sociologist Michael Dunlop Young in his satirical essay _The Rise of the Meritocracy_.[2]
