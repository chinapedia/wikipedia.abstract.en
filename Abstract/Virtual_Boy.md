The VIRTUAL BOY is a 32-bit table-top video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in 1995 it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic "3D" graphics. The player uses the console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, releasing only 22 games for the system.
