ALLAN LAKE LANDING is a unpopulated place situated in Coconino County, Arizona.[1] It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2] The area was used as a turnaround for a logging railroad in the past which removed many of the trees to the east of Lake Mary Road. The unusual shape of the lake is due to a habitat improvement project by the Arizona Game and Fish Department in 1986. The project ultimately failed and restoration efforts are currently underway to improve the site.
