The CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF BURUNDI () is the supreme authority on Burundi's constitutional law. The Constitutional Court deals with the interpretation of the Constitution of 2005 and is considered the country's second highest court. In conjunction with the Burundian Supreme Court (_Cour SuprÃªme_), the Constitutional Court can sit _en banc_ as a High Court of Justice (_Haute Cour de Justice_) with special prerogatives, such as the power to try an incumbent president.[1]
