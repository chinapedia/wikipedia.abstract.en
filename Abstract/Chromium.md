CHROMIUM is a chemical element with the symbol CR and atomic number 24. It is the first element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle transition metal.[1] Chromium is also the main additive in stainless steel, to which it adds anti-corrosive properties. Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum, with almost 90% of infrared light being reflected.[2] The name of the element is derived from the Greek word χρῶμα, _chrōma_, meaning color,[3] because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.
