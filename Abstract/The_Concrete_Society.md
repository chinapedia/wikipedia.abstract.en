The_Concrete_Society_logo.jpg THE CONCRETE SOCIETY is a UK based non-profit company that was founded in 1966 in response to the increasing need for a single organisation embracing all those interested in concrete.[1] On its formal inauguration, on 13 October 1966, the Society took over the work of the four organisations (the Reinforced Concrete Association, the Prestressed Concrete Development Group, the Pavings Development Group and the Formwork Development Group), by then in the process of dissolution, in order both to carry on their work and to extend it to cover the entire field of concrete technology and use.[2]
