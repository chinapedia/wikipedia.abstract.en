1SULAMAN is a mixed development project comprising condominium, water theme park, recreational landscape park and serviced suites. The project is developed by Sagajuta Sabah Sdn Bhd, and predicted to be completed in 2015.[1] However, due to several issues, the building remained unfinished until 2016, leading to the developer being sued by property lots buyers as well as from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.[2] On 24 November 2016, the project was officially declared abandoned by the Ministry of Local Government.[3]
