"THE TUMOR" is a short story by John Grisham, telling about the focused ultrasound process through the case of a fictional character named Paul. This story was not released through Grisham's usual publisher, but instead was published for a free eBook on the website of the Focused Ultrasound Foundation,[1] on whose board Grisham serves.[2] Grisham's purpose in writing this short story was to increase awareness about the promising new medical therapy.[3] The use of focused ultrasound is not yet approved for use on brain tumors, but _The Tumor_ takes place in a time when the therapy is in regular use. Unlike most short stories, the story is as much informational as narrative, and includes medical illustrations and brain scan images.[4] The book's cover includes the subtitle _A Non-Legal Thriller_. On Grisham's website, in a letter introducing _The Tumor_, Grisham states "It's the most important book I've ever written."[5]
