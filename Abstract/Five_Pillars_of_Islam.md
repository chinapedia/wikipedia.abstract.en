The FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM (__ ; also __ "pillars of the religion") are some basic acts in Islam, considered mandatory by believers and are the foundation of Muslim life. They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel.[1][2][3][4] The Sunni and Shia agree on the essential details for the performance and practice of these acts,[5][6][7] but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They make up Muslim life, prayer, concern for the needy, self-purification, and the pilgrimage,[8][9] if one is able.[10]
