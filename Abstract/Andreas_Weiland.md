ANDREAS WEILAND (born October 14, 1944[1]) is a bilingual poet.[2] He writes in English, but also in German.[3] His poetry has repeatedly caused positive echos by fellow poets. JÃ¼rgen Theobaldy was the first poet and editor who published him.[4] Nicolas Born called him "a born lyrical poet".[5] Erich Fried considered his poems important.[6] Many well-known and not so well-known artists and a few filmmakers (thus Jean Marie-Straub[7] Dore O., and Werner Nekes[8]) also cared for his poetry. Weiland is also an art and film critic.[9]
