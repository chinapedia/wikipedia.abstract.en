The BATTLE OF ACRE (also known as the FOURTH BATTLE OF ACRE) occurred on 3 November 1840. Mehmet Ali had refused the conditions the Quadrilateral Alliance sought to impose. On the 3 November Acre was shelled by a combined British and Ottoman fleet under Admiral Sir Robert Stopford. The town was largely destroyed, the Egyptians withdrew and came to terms.[1]
