LITTLE NEMO is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, _Dream of the Rarebit Fiend_, before receiving his own spin-off series, _Little Nemo in Slumberland_.[1] The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.
