The Officers Row Historic District representatives the industrial function of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Shore Facility. Built between 1896 and 1913, the buildings were built to provide adequate housing for the officers responsible for shipyard and industrial area. Officers' Quarters A, B, C, D and E were designed by the Seattle architectural firm of Chamberlin and Siebrand in 1896. This established the dominant architectural style in the shipyard. They form a line along the bluff overlooking the yard. As new quarters were needed, they were added into the line. The initial development was between 1910 and 1913.
