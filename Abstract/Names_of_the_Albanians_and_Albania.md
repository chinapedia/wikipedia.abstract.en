The ALBANIANS () and their country ALBANIA (_Shqipëria_) have been identified by many ethnonyms. The native endonym is Shqiptar. The name "Albanians" (Byzantine Greek: _Albanoi/Arbanitai/Albanites_; Latin: _Albanenses/Arbanenses_) was used in medieval Greek and Latin documents that gradually entered European languages from which other similar derivative names emerged.[1] Linguists believe that the _alb_ part in the root word originates from an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, meaning "hill, mountain", also present in _Alps_.[2] Through the root word _alban_ and its rhotacized equivalents _arban_, _albar_, and _arbar_, the term in Albanian became rendered as _Arbëreshë_ () for the people and _Arbëria_ () for the country.[3][4]
