METHANDRIOL DIPROPIONATE (MADP), also known as METHYLANDROSTENEDIOL DIPROPIONATE and sold under the brand names ARBOLIC, DURABOLIC, OR-BOLIC, PROBOLIK, and PROTABOLIN among others, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 5-androstenediol.[1][2] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C3,17β dipropionate ester of methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol) – and acts as a prodrug of methandriol in the body.[3][4] Methandriol dipropionate is administered by intramuscular injection and, relative to methandriol, has an extended duration via this route of several days due to a depot effect afforded by its ester.[5] It was marketed in the United States,[6] but is no longer available in this country.[7]
