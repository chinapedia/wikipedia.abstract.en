Fashion in Nigeria has always been diverse, reflecting its many ethnic groups, religions, and cultures. Recently, the Nigerian fashion industry has developed more participants, exposure, structure, presence, earnings, and training. Many now work in the industry as clothing designers, fashion models, clothing stylists, fashion photographers, makeup artists, hair stylists, cosmetologists, and fashion journalists. Magazines devoted to FASHION IN NIGERIA are now common. Nigeria's New Fashion Week has grown in attendance, with long streets dedicated to fashion retailers in the major cities of Nigeria.[1]
