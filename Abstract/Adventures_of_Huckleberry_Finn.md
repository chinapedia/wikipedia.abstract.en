_ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN_ (or, in more recent editions, _THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN_) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (_Tom Sawyer Abroad_ and _Tom Sawyer, Detective_) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_.
