OSWALD ARNOLD GOTTFRIED SPENGLER (; 29 May 1880 â€“ 8 May 1936) was a German historian and philosopher of history whose interests included mathematics, science, and art. He is best known for his book _The Decline of the West_ (_Der Untergang des Abendlandes_), published in 1918 and 1922, covering all of world history. Spengler's model of history postulates that any culture is a superorganism with a limited and predictable lifespan.
