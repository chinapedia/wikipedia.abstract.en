DARCY/D'ARCY (or variant forms DARCI or DARCEY), lit. "_From Arcy (Yvelines)_", "_From the Fortress_", or "_Dark(-haired) One_", is a surname from the Norman barony of d'Arcy, in what was once the Duchy of Normandy (a "French Viking" duchy/dukedom under the French King), but is now Northern-Western France. Becoming very popular in the English language after the Norman conquest of England, while more popular as a surname, it does have some popularity as a given name. Derived given names include girls names like "Darcene".
