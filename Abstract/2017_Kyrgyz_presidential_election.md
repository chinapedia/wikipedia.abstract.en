PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS were held in Kyrgyzstan on 15 October 2017.[1] Incumbent President Almazbek Atambayev was not allowed to run again because the constitution sets a single six-year term for the head of state.[2] Eleven candidates registered for the race, and from this field Sooronbay Jeenbekov of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan won more than 50% of the vote, avoiding a runoff.[3] Following certification of the results on 30 October,[4] Jeenbekov was inaugurated as President of Kyrgyzstan on 24 November.[5] Some described the vote as Central Asiaâ€™s first competitive Presidential election.[6]
