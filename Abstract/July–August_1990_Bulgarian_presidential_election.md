The second election for president of the Republic of Bulgaria was conducted by the 7th Grand National Assembly following the resignation of Petar Mladenov (July 20, 1990). It is held on the same procedural rules as the first choice as not yet adopted a new Constitution. A vote was held in six rounds since none of the candidates managed to get a majority of 2/3 of the total number of MPs (400).
