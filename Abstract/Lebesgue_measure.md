In measure theory, the LEBESGUE MEASURE, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of _n_-dimensional Euclidean space. For _n_ = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called _N_-DIMENSIONAL VOLUME, _N_-VOLUME, or simply VOLUME.[1] It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called LEBESGUE-MEASURABLE; the measure of the Lebesgue-measurable set _A_ is here denoted by _Î»_(_A_).
