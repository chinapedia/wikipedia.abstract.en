The "OPPOSITIONAL GAZE", first coined by feminist, scholar and social activist bell hooks in her 1992 essay collection Black Looks: Race and Representation[1], is a type of looking relation that involves the political rebellion and resistance against the repression of a black person's right to look. As hooks states, white slave-owners would punish their slaves regularly simply for looking at them.[2] Hooks' essay is a work of feminist film theory that criticizes both the male gaze through Michel Foucault's 'relations of power'[3] and the prevalence of white feminism in feminist film theory.
