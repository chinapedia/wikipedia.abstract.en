A poker player is DRAWING if they have a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable. The hand itself is called a DRAW or DRAWING HAND. For example, in seven-card stud, if four of a player's first five cards are all spades, but the hand is otherwise weak, they are _drawing to_ a flush. In contrast, a made hand already has value and does not necessarily need to draw to win. A made starting hand with no help can lose to an inferior starting hand with a favorable draw. If an opponent has a made hand that will beat the player's draw, then the player is _drawing dead_; even if they make their desired hand, they will lose. Not only draws benefit from additional cards; many made hands can be improved by catching an out â€” and may have to in order to win.
