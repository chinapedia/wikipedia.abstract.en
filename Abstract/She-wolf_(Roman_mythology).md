La_lupa_con_Romolo_e_Remo_di_Domenico_Parodi_e_Francesco_Biggi_(detail).png'', sculpture by Francesco Biggi and Domenico Parodi in the Palazzo Rosso of Genoa, Italy]] Roma,_repubblica,_moneta_di_p._satrienus,_77_ac..JPG In the Roman foundation myth, it was a SHE-WOLF that nursed and sheltered the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned in the wild by order of King Amulius of Alba Longa. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.[1]
