NEW LATIN (also called NEO-LATIN[1] or MODERN LATIN)[2] was a revival in the use of Latin in original, scholarly, and scientific works between 1375 and 1900. Modern scholarly and technical nomenclature, such as in zoological and botanical taxonomy and international scientific vocabulary, draws extensively from New Latin vocabulary. In such use, New Latin is subject to new word formation. As a language for full expression in prose or poetry, however, it is often distinguished from its successor, Contemporary Latin.
