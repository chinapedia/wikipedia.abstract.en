The MĔNĒ (also MINA, Aramaic) ()[1] is an ancient Mesopotamian unit of weight for gold or silver and one of the earliest written words for money. The mĕnē, like the shekel, was also a unit of currency. In ancient Greece, it originally equalled 70 drachmae and later was increased to 100 drachmae.[2] The Greek word _mna_ was borrowed from Semitic; compare Hebrew _māneh_, Aramaic _mĕnē_, Syriac _manyā_, Ugaritic _mn_, and Akkadian _manū_. However, before it was used as currency, a mene was a unit of measurement, equal to 567 grams. One mĕnē of gold would be worth $23,000 USD and one mĕnē of silver would be worth $300 USD at today's metal prices.
