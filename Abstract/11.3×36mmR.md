The 11.3×36MMR (commonly referred to as "11mm Montenegrin") is a rimmed carbine and revolver cartridge developed by Austria-Hungary. Though originally designed for the Früwirth repeating carbine, it was also used with the Gasser M1870 revolver. The caliber was widespread throughout the Balkans due to the Montenegrin Pattern Revolvers.
