DANIEL DEFOE (; c. 1660 â€“ 24 April 1731),[1] born DANIEL FOE, was an English trader, writer, journalist, pamphleteer and spy. He is most famous for his novel _Robinson Crusoe_, which is second only to the Bible in its number of translations.[2] He has been seen as one of the earliest proponents of the English novel, and helped to popularise the form in Britain with others such as Aphra Behn and Samuel Richardson.[3] Defoe wrote many political tracts and often was in trouble with the authorities, including a spell in prison. Intellectuals and political leaders paid attention to his fresh ideas and sometimes consulted with him.
