RHYMING SLANG is a form of slang word construction in the English language. It is especially prevalent in the UK, Ireland and Australia. It started in the early 19th century in the East End of London; hence its alternative name, COCKNEY RHYMING SLANG.[1] In the United States, especially the criminal underworld of the West Coast between 1880 and 1920, rhyming slang has sometimes been known as AUSTRALIAN SLANG.[2][3][4][5]
