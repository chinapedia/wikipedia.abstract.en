SKIPTON BROUGHTON CARRIAGE SIDINGS are located in Skipton, North Yorkshire, England, on the Airedale Line just west Skipton station. The name derives form its proximity to the A6069 Broughton Road that runs parallel to the railway line heading towards Gargrave in Skipton.[1] The sidings are located on the opposite side of the railway to where the former Skipton Engine shed was located. This facility closed in 1967.[2]
