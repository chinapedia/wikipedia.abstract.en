The TAMARIND RESTAURANT is an Indian restaurant in Mayfair, London, opened in 1995. It won a Michelin star in 2001, the first Indian restaurant to do so.[1][2] The Tatler describes it as beautiful, "sophisticated, lively and oddly romantic", and as suitable for clinching a business deal as a grand Sunday lunch or a lover's "light supper".[3] The Michelin Guide calls the cuisine "appealing northern Indian food" and "of great finesse".[4] Jonathan Gold, in the _Los Angeles Times_, wrote that he had been impressed by its "frank attempt to produce Indian food with the sheen and polish of white-tablecloth European cuisine", though he chiefly recalled "the wine list, the flowers, and the cost."[5]
