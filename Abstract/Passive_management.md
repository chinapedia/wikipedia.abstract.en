PASSIVE MANAGEMENT (also called PASSIVE INVESTING) is an investing strategy that tracks a market-weighted index or portfolio.[1][2] The most popular method is to mimic the performance of an externally specified index by buying an index fund. By tracking an index, an investment portfolio typically gets good diversification, low turnover (good for keeping down internal transaction costs), and low management fees. With low fees, an investor in such a fund would have higher returns than a similar fund with similar investments but higher management fees and/or turnover/transaction costs.[3]
