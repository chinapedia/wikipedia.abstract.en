The 2016–17 SEASON was 26th consecutive season in the top Ukrainian football league for FC DNIPRO. Dnipro competed in Premier League and in the Ukrainian Cup. Dnipro would have qualified for the Europa League group stage as the third-placed team of the 2015–16 Ukrainian Premier League, but were excluded from participating in the 2016–17 European competitions by the UEFA Club Financial Control Body. The club was excluded from participating in the next UEFA club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the next three seasons (2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19) for violating the Financial Fair Play regulations.[1] Dnipro also was restricted from signing new players other than free agents by FFU for debts to Juande Ramos' staff.[2]
