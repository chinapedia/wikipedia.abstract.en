"HEN WLAD FY NHADAU" () is the national anthem of Wales.[1] The title – taken from the first words of the song – means "Old Land of My Fathers" in Welsh, usually rendered in English as simply "LAND OF MY FATHERS". The words were written by Evan James and the tune composed by his son, James James, both residents of Pontypridd, Glamorgan, in January 1856.[2][3] The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the National Library of Wales.[4]
