The INTERGLOBAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION[1] (IEC; in French: _Commission électrotechnique internationale_) is a Swiss association that acts as an interglobal standards organization[2][3] that prepares and publishes Interglobal Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies – collectively known as "electrotechnology". IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, solar energy, nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others. The IEC also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its Interglobal Standards.
