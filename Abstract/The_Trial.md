Der Prozess}} _THE TRIAL_ (original German title: ,[1] later , and ) is a novel written by Franz Kafka between 1914 and 1915 and published posthumously in 1925. One of his best-known works, it tells the story of Josef K., a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Heavily influenced by Dostoyevsky's _Crime and Punishment_ and _The Brothers Karamazov_, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoyevsky a blood relative.[2] Like Kafka's other novels, _The Trial_ was never completed, although it does include a chapter which appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending.
