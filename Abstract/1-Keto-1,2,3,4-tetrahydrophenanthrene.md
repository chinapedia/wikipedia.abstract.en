1-KETO-1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDROPHENANTHRENE (THP-1), or 1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDROPHENANTHREN-1-ONE, is a synthetic steroid-like compound which was reported to be the first synthetic estrogen, or the first synthetic compound identified with estrogenic activity.[1][2] It was first synthesized in 1933 by Cook et al. and was tested due to its similarity to the presumed chemical structure of estrone.[3][4] Upon reassessment many decades later, the compound was found to bind only weakly to the estrogen receptors, and, unexpectedly, did not actually have functional activity as an estrogen or antiestrogen _in vitro_ or _in vivo_.[5] It did, however, show some androgenic and antiandrogenic activity _in vitro_.[6]
