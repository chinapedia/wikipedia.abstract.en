ALFRED EDWARD HOUSMAN (; 26 March 1859 â€“ 30 April 1936), usually known as A. E. HOUSMAN, was an English classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems _A Shropshire Lad_. Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside.[1] Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the First World War. Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself.
