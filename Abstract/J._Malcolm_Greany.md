Greany_Attu_Woman.jpg JOHN MALCOLN GREANY (April 23, 1915 â€“ July 27, 1999) was an American nature photographer. Born Philadelphia, Greany grew up in Detroit. In 1936 he went to Juneau, Alaska, joining Alaska explorer and promoter Bernard R. Hubbard on an expedition along the Taku River. Greany settled in Juneau in 1938 following his marriage to his wife Irene. During World War II he worked for the U.S. Army as a photographer. His photographs of the inhabitants of Attu Island in 1941 represent the last and virtually the only documentation of life on the island, since the inhabitants of Attu were deported when it was occupied by Japanese forces, and they never returned.[1][2]
