FORD MADOX BROWN (16 April 1821 – 6 October 1893) was a French-born British painter of moral and historical subjects, notable for his distinctively graphic and often Hogarthian version of the Pre-Raphaelite style. Arguably, his most notable painting was _Work_ (1852–1865). Brown spent the latter years of his life painting the twelve works known as _The Manchester Murals_, depicting Mancunian history, for Manchester Town Hall.
