A Turkish military intervention in Syria started on 24 August 2016, code-named by Turkey as _Operation Euphrates Shield,_ an ongoing cross-border operation by the Turkish military and allied groups in the Syrian Civil War. Operations were ongoing in the region between the Euphrates river to the east and the rebel-held area around Azaz to the west. The Turkish military and Turkey-backed Syrian rebel groups, some of which use the Free Syrian Army (FSA) label, have been fighting against forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as well as against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) since 24 August 2016. A new phase of the Turkish intervention started in January 2018, in the Afrin region of Syria, code-named by Turkey as Operation Olive Branch (Turkish: Zeytin Dalı Harekâtı). It's an offensive against the Kurdish Democratic Union Party in Syria (PYD), its armed wing People's Protection Units (YPG),[33] and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
