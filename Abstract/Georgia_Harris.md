GEORGIA HARRIS (July 29, 1905 - January 30, 1997) was known for preserving traditional forms of Catawba pottery. A member of the Catawba Tribe in South Carolina, Harris was the recipient of the National Heritage Fellowship for her work. Although ranging centuries, the earliest records of the Catawba pottery tradition that have been obtained date back to 1702.[1] It was this rich history that Harris was responsible for preserving, including during a time period that ranged from the 1930s to the 1960s, when the tradition suffered due to demand.[2] Beginning when she was 9 years old Harris took a keen interest in pottery, learning from both her mother and grandmother.[3] As time past, Harris found herself especially captivated by the pipe-making tradition, later passing down the art to many apprentices.[4] Harris's legacy in Catawba pottery continues past her death.
