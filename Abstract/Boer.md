_BOER_ (;[1] ) is the Dutch and Afrikaans noun for "farmer".[2] In South African contexts, "Boers" () refers to the descendants of the proto Afrikaans speaking settlers of the eastern Cape frontier[3] in Southern Africa during the 18th and much of the 19th century. From 1652 to 1795 the Dutch East India Company controlled this area, but the United Kingdom incorporated it into the British Empire in 1806.[4]
