The MARINE RESERVATION HISTORIC DISTRICT is in the northwestern area of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, just west of the Hospital Reservation Historic District. Beginning in 1911 it reached its maximum development, prior to World War II. The district included four standing buildings and a barracks, which has been demolished. The barracks was a -story brick building similar in design to the other buildings. All of the buildings face the Marine parade ground, which is used as a playfield.[1] The four two-story quarters of brick have Colonial Revival influences in the Georgian Colonial details. Quarters M-l, M-2 and M-3 were designed by Washington, D.C. architect J.H. DeDibour in 1910.[2] The district is a man-made bench cut into the hillside. Each building has a front, side and rear lawn, native plantings and garden areas. The garages were built in the 1930s.[3]
