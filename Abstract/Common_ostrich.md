The COMMON OSTRICH (_Struthio camelus_), or simply OSTRICH, is a species of large flightless bird native to Africa. It is one of two extant species of ostriches, the only living members of the genus _Struthio_ in the ratite order of birds. The other is the Somali ostrich (_Struthio molybdophanes_), which was recognised as a distinct species by BirdLife International in 2014 having been previously considered a very distinctive subspecies of ostrich.[1][2]
