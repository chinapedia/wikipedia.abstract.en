CELL DIVISION ORIENTATION is the direction along which the new daughter cells are formed. Cell division orientation is important for morphogenesis, cell fate and tissue homeostasis. Abnormalities in the cell division orientation leads to the malformations during development and cancerous tissues. Factors that influence cell division orientation are cell shape,[1][2][3] anisotropic localization of specific proteins and mechanical tensions.[4]
