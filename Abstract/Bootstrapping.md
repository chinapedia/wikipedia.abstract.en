In general, BOOTSTRAPPING usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In computer technology the term (usually shortened to BOOTING) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.
