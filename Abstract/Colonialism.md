This one was used during the Second French colonial empire.]] COLONIALISM is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories,[1] generally with the aim of economic dominance[2]. The colonising country seeks to benefit from the colonised country or land mass. In the process, colonisers imposed their religion, economics, and medicinal practices on the natives. Colonialism is largely regarded as a relationship of domination of an indigenous majority by a minority of foreign invaders where the latter rule in pursuit of its interests.[3]
