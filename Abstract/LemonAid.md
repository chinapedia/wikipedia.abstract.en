LEMONAID is a for-profit recruiting organization that connects high school student-athletes with colleges. LemonAid mobile applications suggest possible recruiting matches based on social, academic and athletic metrics that student athletes share with a college. Complementing the search, club and high school coaches can offer vetted recommendations to both college and athlete alike, while college sports fans can also rank, recommend, and read up on college recruiting.
