SEAN and SHAWN were the pen-names of JOHN KLAMIK (July 22, 1935 â€“ January 5, 2005), an American artist specializing in gay male erotica and comics.[1] His homosexual-themed cartoons were among the first to appear in US publications, including a regular feature in the early years of _The Advocate_. He worked under two pen-names: _Shawn_ for more mainstream gay publications such as _In Touch_,[2] and _Sean_ for fetish publications such as _Drummer_ and _Bound & Gagged_.[3]
