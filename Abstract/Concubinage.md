Ishmael was his first-born son.]] CONCUBINAGE () is an interpersonal and sexual relationship in which the couple are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious or professional prohibitions (for example Roman soldiers), or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities. The woman or man in such a relationship is referred to as a CONCUBINE (). In Judaism, a concubine is a marital companion of inferior status to a wife.[1] A concubine among polygamous peoples is a secondary wife, usually of inferior rank.[2]
