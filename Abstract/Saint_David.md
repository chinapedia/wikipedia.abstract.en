SAINT DAVID (; ; was a Welsh bishop of Mynyw (now St Davids) during the 6th century. He is the patron saint of Wales. David was a native of Wales. A relatively large amount of information is known about his life. His birth date, however, is uncertain: suggestions range from 462 to 512.[1] He is traditionally believed to be the son of Saint Non and the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda, king of Ceredigion.[2] The Welsh annals placed his death 569 years after the birth of Christ,[3] but Phillimore's dating revised this to 601.[4]
