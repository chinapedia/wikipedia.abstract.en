_2001 MARS ODYSSEY_ is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US$297Â million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment.[1] It is hoped that the data _Odyssey_ obtains will help answer the question of whether life existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation that future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the Mars Science Laboratory, and previously the Mars Exploration Rovers and _Phoenix_ lander, to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke, evoking the name of _2001: A Space Odyssey_.[2]
