EPIBRASSICASTEROL (also called CRINOSTEROL)[1] is a type of cholesterol most commonly found in marine invertebrates. Epibrassicasterol is a 28 carbon cholesterol with an alpha oriented methyl group at carbon 24. It is often mixed isomerically with the more common beta-isomer, brassicasterol. Epibrassicasterol can be used as a biomarker to identify the presence of marine life in an environment and can be dated based on the location of fossilized remains in various rock structures.[2]
