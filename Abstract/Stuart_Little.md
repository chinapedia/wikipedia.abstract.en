_STUART LITTLE_ is a 1945 American children's novel by E. B. White,[1] his first book for children, and is widely recognized as a classic in children's literature. _Stuart Little_ was illustrated by the subsequently award-winning artist Garth Williams, also his first work for children. It is a realistic fantasy about Stuart Little who, though born to human parents in New York City, ″looked very much like a rat/mouse in every way″ (chapter I).
