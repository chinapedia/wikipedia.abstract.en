FAUSTIN BIRINDWA (1943 – 29 April 1999) was a Congolese politician. A technocrat, he was an advisor to Étienne Tshisekedi and was named his finance minister in October 1991, though Birindwa never took office. He became foreign minister in August 1992. After Tshisekedi was dismissed by Mobutu Sese Seko, Birindwa became Prime Minister on 18 March 1993 as a member of the pro-Mobutu Forces Politiques du Conclave. As a result, he was expelled from the Union for Democracy and Social Progress.[1]
