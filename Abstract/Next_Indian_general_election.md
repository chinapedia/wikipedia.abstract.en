The NEXT INDIAN GENERAL ELECTION is scheduled to be held on or before 19 May 2024 to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha. The previous election resulted in a second consecutive landslide victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is not yet clear whether Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will lead his party in a third general election campaign due to two consecutive losses the party faced in his leadership.[1]
