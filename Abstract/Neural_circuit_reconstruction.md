NEURAL CIRCUIT RECONSTRUCTION is the reconstruction of the detailed circuitry of the nervous system (or a portion of the nervous system) of an animal. It is sometimes called EM RECONSTRUCTION since the main method used is the electron microscope (EM).[1] This field is a close relative of reverse engineering of human-made devices, and is part of the field of connectomics, which in turn is a sub-field of neuroanatomy.
