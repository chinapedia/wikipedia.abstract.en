"MACHINE GUN" MOLLY BOLIN (born MONNA LEA VAN BENTHUYSEN November 13, 1957) is a retired American basketball player who mainly played for the Women's Professional Basketball League. Although her accomplishments for the most part went unrecognized, Bolin, who was the first player signed to play in the WBL, became a pioneering figure in women's basketball, both as a formidable scoring threat and as a sex symbol of the league. Among her accolades, Bolin holds the record for the most points scored in a single game by any professional women's basketball player (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8).
