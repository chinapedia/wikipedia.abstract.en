The POLITICS OF MAYOTTE takes place in a framework of a French overseas region and department, until 2011 an overseas collectivity. Local politics takes place in a parliamentary representative democratic setting whereby the President of the General Council is the head of government, of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. The status of Mayotte changed in 2001 towards one very close to the status of the _départements_ of mainland France, with the particular designation of _collectivité départementale_, although the island is still claimed by the Comoros. This change was approved by 73% at a referendum on Mayotte. After the constitutional reform of 2003 it became a _collectivité d'outre-mer_ while keeping the title _collectivité départementale de Mayotte_. Mayotte became an overseas department of France (_département d'outre-mer_, DOM) on 31 March 2011 following the result of the March 2009 Mahoran status referendum, which was overwhelmingly approved by around 95% of voters.
