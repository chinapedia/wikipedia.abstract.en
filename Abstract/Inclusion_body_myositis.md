INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS (IBM) [my-oh-SIGH-tis] (sometimes called sporadic inclusion body myositis, sIBM) is the most common inflammatory muscle disease in older adults.[1] The disease is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and wasting of both distal and proximal muscles, most apparent in the finger flexors and knee extensors.[2] IBM is often confused with an entirely different class of diseases, called hereditary inclusion body myopathies (hIBM).[3][4] The "M" in hIBM is an abbreviation for "myopathy" while the "M" in IBM is an abbreviation for "myositis". These diseases should not be confused with each other. In IBM, two processes appear to occur in the muscles in parallel, one autoimmune and the other degenerative. Inflammation is evident from the invasion of muscle fibers by immune cells. Degeneration is characterized by the appearance of holes, deposits of abnormal proteins, and filamentous inclusions in the muscle fibers.[5] sIBM is a rare disease, with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 71 individuals per million.[6][7]
