Ehemalige_Hilgenrieder_Bucht_vom_Blandorfer_Geestrand.jpg Geest]] HILGENRIED BAY () is a bay on the German North Sea coast near Hilgenriedersiel, a village in the municipality of Hagermarsch in the Lower Saxon county of Aurich. It was probably formed during the Dunkirk transgression as a result of the washing out of the mouth of one or more small streams, but has now largely silted up.
