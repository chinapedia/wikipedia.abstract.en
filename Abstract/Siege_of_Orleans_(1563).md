The SIEGE OF ORLEANS was part of the First French War of Religion, a conflict provoked by the Massacre of Vassy by Catholic troops of the Duke of Guise on 1 March 1562. As a result, the Prince of Conde, military leader of the Reformers, moved into Orleans to turn it into one of his strongholds. The city became Protestant; only reformed worship was tolerated; its institutions (the governor, the city aldermen, etc.) became dominated by Protestants, the bishop was removed in April 1562 and churches were desecrated and relics destroyed.
