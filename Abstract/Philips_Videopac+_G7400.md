The PHILIPS VIDEOPAC+ G7400 is a video game console released in limited quantities in 1983,[1] and only in Europe; an American release as the ODYSSEY³ COMMAND CENTER was planned but never occurred. The G7400 was the successor to the Philips Videopac G7000, the European counterpart to the American Magnavox Odyssey².[2] The system featured excellently tailored background and foreground graphics.[3]
