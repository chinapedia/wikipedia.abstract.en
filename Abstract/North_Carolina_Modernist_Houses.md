NORTH CAROLINA MODERNIST HOUSES (NCMH) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational archive for Modernist architecture. The mission of the organization is to document, preserve, and promote Modernist houses. Founded in 2007, the organization became a nonprofit in 2009 and operated as Triangle Modernist Houses. In 2013, it changed names to North Carolina Modernist Houses to reflect a statewide focus. Because of the NC State University School of Design (now College of Design), the state has about 2400 Modernist houses starting in the late 1930s. George Smart is the founder and Executive Director. NCMH is recognized nationally for its accomplishments with 12 local, state, and national awards for leadership in preservation. In 2016, NCMH created US Modernist to house its national online archives.
