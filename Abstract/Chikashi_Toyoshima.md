is a Japanese biophysicist.[1] His research interest only focus on two proteins: the Ca²⁺-ATPase of muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase expressed in all animal cells.[2] He is a professor of University of Tokyo and the Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences, USA.[3] His research about the Ca²⁺-ATPase started in 1989. In the next few years, he and his colleagues obtained a series of images of Ca²⁺-ATPase at the revolution of Atomic-level in the world for the first time.[4] By the x-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and other methods, he has determined the crystal structures of ten intermediates of Ca²⁺-ATPase. On September 10, 2015, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him and Poul Nissen the Gregori Aminoff Prize of 2016 for their fundamental contributions to understanding the structural basis for ATP-driven translocation of ions across membrane.[5]
