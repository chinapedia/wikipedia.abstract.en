_THE PERFECT HUSBAND_ is the debut feature film of Priya Singh Paul, an Indian-Jewish filmmaker. Trained in film making in India and the US, she has built a considerable reputation for herself in India's competitive and demanding television scene. The film, a romantic comedy cum social satire, predominantly in English with a smattering of Hindi and Punjabi, is a modern and thought-provoking look at the Indian marriage 'game' â€“ the quest for the only security symbol that most Indian women possesses: a husband, perfect or otherwise![1] [2]
