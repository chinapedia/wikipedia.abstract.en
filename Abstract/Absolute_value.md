Absolute_value.svg of the absolute value function for real numbers]] AbsoluteValueDiagram.svg In mathematics, the ABSOLUTE VALUE or MODULUS _x_{{!}}}} of a real number  is the non-negative value of  without regard to its sign. Namely, _x_{{!}} = _x_}} for a positive , _x_{{!}} = −_x_}} for a negative  (in which case is positive), and 0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.
