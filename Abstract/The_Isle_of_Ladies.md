THE ISLE OF LADIES is an anonymous fifteenth-century dream vision poem about an island governed by women which is invaded by men, after which there ensues a series of courtly romantic exploits.[1] It is thought to draw on Chaucerian conventions, and some believe it to be written on the occasion of an aristocratic betrothal.[2] Others argue that it is a "mock courtly romance."[3] It survives in only two manuscripts (Longleat House MS 256 and British Library MS Additional 10303), and extends to 2235 lines.[4]
