Plymouth_Hoe_from_Mount_Batten_(crop).jpg in 2006.]] PLYMOUTH HOE, referred to locally as THE HOE, is a large south-facing open public space in the English coastal city of Plymouth. The Hoe is adjacent to and above the low limestone cliffs that form the seafront and it commands views of Plymouth Sound, Drake's Island, and across the Hamoaze to Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word _Hoe_, a sloping ridge shaped like an inverted foot and heel.
