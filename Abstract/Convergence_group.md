In mathematics, a CONVERGENCE GROUP or a DISCRETE CONVERGENCE GROUP is a group Γ acting by homeomorphisms on a compact metrizable space M in a way that generalizes the properties of the action of Kleinian group by Möbius transformations on the ideal boundary 𝕊² of the hyperbolic 3-space ℍ³. The notion of a convergence group was introduced by Gehring and Martin (1987) [1] and has since found wide applications in geometric topology, quasiconformal analysis, and geometric group theory.
