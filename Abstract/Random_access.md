Random_vs_sequential_access.svg.]] In computer science, RANDOM ACCESS (more precisely and more generally called DIRECT ACCESS) is the ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence in equal time or any datum from a population of addressable elements roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements may be in the set. It is typically contrasted to sequential access.
