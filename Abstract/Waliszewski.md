WALISZEWSKI (with its female form _Waliszewska_ and plural form _Waliszewscy_ ) is a Polish surname which is most prevalent in the Greater Poland, Łódź, Masovian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian voivodeships[1][2] in central Poland and is also present in the Polish diaspora.[3][4] It was first recorded in 1397[5] and is of toponymic origin, deriving either from _Waliszewice_, two small villages with the name _Waliszew_ or a third, now defunct _Waliszew_ which later separated into _Waliszew Dworski_ and _Stary Waliszew_, small settlements in the Łódź and Masovian voivodeships.[6] The stem of the toponym _Waliszew_ is derived from the diminutive form _Walisz_ of the old Polish male name _Walisław/Wolisław_ (from Polish _wola_ "will" and _sława_ "glory").[7]
