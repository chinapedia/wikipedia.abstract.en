SHERRI PAPINI claims she was abducted on November 2, 2016, while out jogging a mile from her home in Redding, California.[1] Papini was 34 years old at the time. She was found three weeks later on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, having been freed by her putative captors at 4:30 that morning still wearing restraints, on the side of County Road 17 near Interstate 5 in Yolo County, about 150 miles (240Â km) south of where she was kidnapped.[2] The case garnered major media attention, with national law enforcement experts reporting doubts or otherwise baffled as to the unlikely details and inconsistencies of the reported abduction, while no arrests have been made and authorities report the investigation is ongoing as of April, 2017.[3]
