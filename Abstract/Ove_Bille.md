OVE BILLE (died 10 April 1555) was a Danish bishop and royal chancellor to three Danish kings John, Christian II and Frederick. He served as a chancellor for 21 years and was in 1520 rewarded with the bishopric of the Diocese of Aarhus. He was especially known for effective administration and strong defense of the Catholic Church. Following the reformation in Denmar in 1536, Bille was treated more leniently than other Catholic bishops and was released already in 1537.[1][2]
