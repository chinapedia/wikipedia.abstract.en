THE HOUSE OF THE POST OFFICE (Spanish: _Real Casa de Correos_) is an eighteenth century building in Puerta del Sol, Madrid. It was built for the postal service, but currently serves as the office of the President of the Community of Madrid, the head of the regional government of the Autonomous Community of Madrid. This should not to be confused with the Madrid City Council, which is housed in another former post office, the Palacio de Cibeles.
