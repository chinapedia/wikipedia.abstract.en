TEOCHEW CUISINE, also known as CHIUCHOW CUISINE, CHAOZHOU CUISINE or CHAOSHAN CUISINE, originated from the Chaoshan region in the eastern part of China's Guangdong Province, which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang. Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, particularly Southern Min cuisine, due to the similarity of Chaoshan's and Fujian's culture, language, and their geographic proximity to each other.[1] However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.[2]
