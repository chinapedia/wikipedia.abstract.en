PRESBURGER ARITHMETIC is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, named in honor of Moj≈ºesz Presburger, who introduced it in 1929. The signature of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and equality, omitting the multiplication operation entirely. The axioms include a schema of induction.
