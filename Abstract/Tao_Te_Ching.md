The _TAO TE CHING,_ ), Simplified: 道德经, Pinyin: _DAO DE JING_, is a Chinese classic text traditionally credited to the 6th-century BC sage Laozi. The text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are debated.[1] The oldest excavated portion dates back to the late 4th century BC,[2] but modern scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been written—or at least compiled—later than the earliest portions of the _Zhuangzi_.[3]
