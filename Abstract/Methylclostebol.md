METHYLCLOSTEBOL, also known as 4-CHLORO-17Α-METHYLTESTOSTERONE or as 4-CHLORO-17Α-METHYLANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and designer steroid that has been sold on the Internet as a "dietary supplement",[1][2] but it has never been studied for medical use.[3] It is the 17α-alkylated variant of clostebol (4-chlorotestosterone).[4]
