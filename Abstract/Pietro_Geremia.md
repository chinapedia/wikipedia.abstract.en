Blessed PIETRO GEREMIA (10 August 1399 - 3 March 1452) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Order of Preachers.[1] Geremia was born in Palermo but spent an extended period of time in Bologna - where he experienced a radical conversion - and Fiesole for his admittance into the Dominicans before returning to Palermo where he became a sought after and noted preacher and miracle worker.[2][3]
