TRANSPORT TETANY is a disease that occurs in cows and ewes after the stress of prolonged transport in crowded, hot and poorly ventillated vehicles. It is commonly seen in animals in late pregnancy and those transported to slaughter in crowded, hot, and poorly ventillated vehicles. The disease is generally fatal, even with treatment, unless detected early.[1][2] It is also known as transit tetany,[3] railroad disease, railroad sickness, or staggers.[4]
