The PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO; , ) is an organization founded in 1964 with the purpose of the "liberation of Palestine" through armed struggle, with much of its violence aimed at Israeli civilians.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is recognized as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" by over 100 states with which it holds diplomatic relations,[7][8] and has enjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1974.[9][10][11] The PLO was considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization[12][13] until the Madrid Conference in 1991. In 1993, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and rejected "violence and terrorism". In response, Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.[14] However, the PLO has employed violence in the years since 1993, particularly during the 2000â€“2005 Second Intifada. On 29 October 2018, the Palestinian Central Council suspended the recognition of Israel and halted security and economic coordination in all its forms with it.[15]
