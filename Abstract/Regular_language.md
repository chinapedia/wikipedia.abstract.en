In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a REGULAR LANGUAGE (also called a RATIONAL LANGUAGE[1][2]) is a formal language that can be expressed using a regular expression, in the strict sense of the latter notion used in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many regular expressions engines provided by modern programming languages, which are augmented with features that allow recognition of languages that cannot be expressed by a classic regular expression).
