The BENOIT APARTMENTS area pair of apartment houses at 439 and 447 Pearl Street in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Both were built around the turn of the 20th century, and are respectively well-preserved examples of Colonial Revival and Queen Anne architecture with a long period of common ownership. They were each listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, in listings that included street numbers current to that period.[1]
