Lars-Gunnar-Nordstrom-1958.jpg LARS-GUNNAR NORDSTRÖM (19 August 1924, Helsinki – 10 August 2014, Helsinki) was a Finnish artist, one of the leading pioneers of non-representational art in Finland. His genre of art, concretism, is characterized by an extremely precise, finished, deliberate visual expression. Nordström is particularly known for his geometric paintings, in which angular and curved flat colour fields form clear, strong, dynamic compositions. His oeuvre consists mainly of graphic prints, paintings and sculptures.[1]
