CHLAMYDIA INFECTION, often simply known as CHLAMYDIA, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium _Chlamydia trachomatis_.[1] Most people who are infected have no symptoms.[2] When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur.[3] Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination.[4] Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.[5] The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.[6] Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in trachoma, a common cause of blindness in the developing world.[7]
