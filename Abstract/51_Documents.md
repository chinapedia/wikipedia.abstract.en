_51 DOCUMENTS: ZIONIST COLLABORATION WITH THE NAZIS_ is a 2002 book by the American Trotskyist and anti-zionist Lenni Brenner.[1] The book presents 51 documents that Brenner argues show that Zionist leaders collaborated with fascism particularly in Nazi Germany in order to build up a Jewish presence in Palestine. The book continues themes explored in Brenner's earlier and highly controversial work Zionism in the Age of the Dictators.
