The WOLVERHAMPTON OLYMPIQUE is a unique Motorcycle Speedway event that is hosted annually. It was first run in October 1966 by the Newcastle Diamonds club. At the time both Newcastle Diamonds and Wolverhampton Wolves were owned by the same promoter Mike Parker. In 1969 Parker sold his interest in Newcastle Diamonds and a number of his assets were transferred to Wolverhampton Wolves, two of which were the Olympique and speedway rider Ole Olsen.
