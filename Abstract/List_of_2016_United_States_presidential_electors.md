This is a list of members of the Electoral College, known as "electors", who cast ballots to elect the president of the United States and vice president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.[1] In the 2016 presidential election, 227 electors were female while the remaining 312 electors were male. While every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district.These electors are chosen by each party before the general elections. A vote for that party then confirms their position. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector's residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district.
