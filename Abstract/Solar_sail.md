IKAROS_solar_sail.jpg space-probe with solar sail in flight (artist's depiction) showing a typical square sail configuration]] SOLAR SAILS (also called LIGHT SAILS or PHOTON SAILS) are a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large mirrors. A useful analogy may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind. High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing.
