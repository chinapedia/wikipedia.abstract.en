MOBILEPAY is a mobile payment application developed by Danske Bank. The service allows payments by means of a smartphone application and was published on May 7, 2013, after Danske Bank discontinued its cooperation with other Danish banks on a common solution. It is mainly used in Denmark, but also in Finland. MobilePay was also available in Norway, but shut down in January 2018 due to competition from Vipps.
