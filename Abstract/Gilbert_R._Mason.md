GILBERT R. MASON SR. (October 7, 1928 – July 8, 2006), was a physician who was a family practitioner and civil rights leader in Biloxi, Mississippi. He is noted for organizing three wade-ins, from 1959 to 1963, to desegregate the city's public beaches, which had been made with federal funds. This was the first nonviolent civil disobedience action conducted in Mississippi in the 1950s.[1]
