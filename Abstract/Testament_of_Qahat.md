Cave_four.jpg The _TESTAMENT OF QAHAT_ (Kehath or Kohath) was written as a continuation to the Words of Levi followed by Vision of Amram. Qahat, a righteous man, was the second son of Levi, and lived to be 133 years old. He was the father of the Kohathites and was appointed to carry the ark along with sacred utensils of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the desert. The _Testament of Qahat_ is addressed to his son Amram regarding the sacredness of the texts and laws that have been passed down from previous fathers all the way to Noah. Qahat speaks specifically about the inheritance being passed down, which is believed to be the books and laws given from God passed down generationally from Noah to Shem, Abraham to Isaac, Isaac to Jacob, Jacob to Levi and then to Qahat.
