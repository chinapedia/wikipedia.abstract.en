MICHELANGELO DI LODOVICO BUONARROTI SIMONI (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known best as simply MICHELANGELO (;[1] ), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence, who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime, and by some the greatest artist of all time, his artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival, the fellow Florentine and client of the Medici, Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name="Britannica"/[2]
