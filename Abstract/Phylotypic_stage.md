The PHYLOTYPIC STAGE is the most conserved stage of embryogenesis between species within a phylum. It is the point in which developing embryos of species in the same phylum display maximal similarity. Recently, molecular tools have been used to identify the phylotypic period based on the developmental stage that displays maximal conservation of gene expression or minimal gene sequence divergence between species within a phylum.
