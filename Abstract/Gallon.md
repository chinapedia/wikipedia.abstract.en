The GALLON is a unit of measurement for volume and fluid capacity in both the US customary units and the British imperial systems of measurement. Three significantly different sizes are in current use: the imperial gallon defined as litres, which is used in the United Kingdom, Canada, and some Caribbean nations; the US gallon defined as 231 cubic inches (exactly 3.785411784 litres), which is used in the US and some Latin American and Caribbean countries; and the least-used US dry gallon defined as US bushel (approximately 4.405 litres). There are four quarts in a gallon and eight pints in a gallon; they too have different sizes in different systems.
