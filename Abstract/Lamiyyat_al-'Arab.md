The _LĀMIYYĀT AL-‘ARAB_ (the L-song of the Arabs) is the pre-eminent poem in the surviving canon of the pre-Islamic 'brigand-poets' (_al-shu‘arā’ al-ṣa‘ālīk_). It was included in the seminal anthology of pre-Islamic verse, the eighth-century CE _Mufaḍḍaliyāt_, and attracted extensive commentary in the medieval Arabic tradition. The poem also gained a foremost position in Western views of the Orient from the 1820s onwards.[1] The poem takes its name from the last letter of each of its 68 lines, L (Arabic ل, _lām_).
