'''Miklos Porkolab '''(born March 24, 1939) is a Hungarian-American physicist specializing in plasma physics. He emigrated in 1957 from Hungary to Canada, where he studied at the University of British Columbia (Bachelor, 1963) and then at Stanford University, where he obtained his Master degree in 1964 and his PhD in 1968. He then moved to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where he worked as a Senior Research Physicist until 1975. During the following year, Porkolab worked at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching, Germany, under the auspices of the Humboldt Foundation as a winner of the "US Senior Scientist Award". In 1977 he became Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he later led the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) for many years.[1]
