TRAVIS WILKERSON is an American independent film director, screenwriter, producer and performance artist. Named the "political conscience of 21st century American independent cinema," by Sight & Sound Magazine,[1] Wilkerson is heavily influenced by the Third Cinema movement, and known for films that combine "maximalist aesthetics and radical politics."[2] This is owed, in part, to his meeting Cuban filmmaker Santiago √Ålvarez. Following the meeting, Wilkerson made the feature documentary _Accelerated Under-Development_ about that meeting, and he was heavily involved in the rediscovery of Alvarez's films.[3]
