The AFRICA ALPHABET (also INTERNATIONAL AFRICAN ALPHABET or IAI ALPHABET) was developed by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures in 1928, with the help of some Africans led by Diedrich Hermann Westermann, who served as director of the organization from 1926 until 1939. Meanwhile, the aim of the INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND CULTURES, later known as International African Institute (IAI), was to enable people to write all the African languages for practical and scientific purposes without the need of diacritics. It is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet with a few differences, such as _j_ and _y_, which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English.
