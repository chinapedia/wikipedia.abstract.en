COMROCK is the name of a record label created in Mexico in the 1980s that was dedicated to promoting rock bands. It was coordinated by Ricardo Ochoa, guitar player of Kenny y los El√©ctricos, and brought a wide audience to many Mexican bands. Five finalist bands were selected to obtain a recording contract for an LP. Two songs from each of these finalist bands were included on the compilation disk.
