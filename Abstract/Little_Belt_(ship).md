At least six vessels, including two belonging to the British Royal Navy, have borne the name _LITTLE BELT_, a translation from the Danish of _Lilleb√¶lt_, the name of the strait that separates Funen from the Danish mainland and that links the Kattegat to the Baltic Sea. The merchant vessels and the second Royal Navy vessel were named to commemorate , which was one of the protagonists in the Little Belt Affair, or perhaps the affair itself.
