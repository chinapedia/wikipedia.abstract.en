SIXTH AVENUE BRIDGE, aka the NORTH SIXTH STREET BRIDGE, is a pony truss vehicular bridge over the Passaic River in northeastern New Jersey. It connects the Bunker Hill neighbourhood of Paterson and Prospect Park at the border with Hawthorne via North Sixth Street (CR 652). It was originally constructed 1907 as a steel structure supported on stone masonry piers and abutments and is one of several bridges built after the Passaic Flood of 1903. The older span opened was abruptly closed in 1986 after the Passaic County engineer at the time, Gaetano Fabrina, found that some steel beams had rusted and were "banging and clanging."
