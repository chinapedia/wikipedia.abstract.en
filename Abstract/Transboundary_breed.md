A transboundary breed is a breed which is present in several countries.[1] Transboundary species of the five significant livestock types (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens), have been developed for a hundred years or more in intensive manufacturing systems, which has led to global availability. A relatively small number of worldwide transboundary breeds compose the ever-increasing share of total global animal products. However, only in North America and the Southwest Pacific do the number of transboundary breeds surpass that of local breeds.[2]
