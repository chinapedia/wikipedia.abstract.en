STATE QUESTION 790 on the OKLAHOMA BALLOT in 2016 seeks to overturn a provision in the Oklahoma state Constitution called a Blaine Amendment. The impetus for the measure largely resulted from the Oklahoma Blaine Amendment being used as a justification for a 5-year legal battle to deny services and access to state funding for special needs children. The Oklahoma Supreme Court resolved that fight in early 2016 in _Oliver v. Hofmeister_.
