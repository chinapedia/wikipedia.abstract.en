CHITRALâ€“SHANDUR ROAD (also known as KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA HIGHWAY S-2) is a provincial highway which extends from Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to Shandur in Gilgit-Baltistan province, Pakistan. Originally several separate roads, the Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority merged them together to form one continuous road.[1]
