DvinfernoPopeNicholasIII_m.jpg speaks to Pope Nicholas III, committed to the _Inferno_ for his simony, in Gustave Dor√©'s 1861 wood engraving (portrait of the Third Bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell)]] SIMONY is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after Simon Magus,[1] who is described in the Acts of the Apostles as having offered two disciples of Jesus payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone on whom he would place his hands. The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."[2][3]
