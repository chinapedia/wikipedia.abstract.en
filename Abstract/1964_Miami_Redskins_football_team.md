The 1964 MIAMI REDSKINS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Miami University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1964 college football season. In their second season under Schembechler, the Redskins compiled a 6–3–1 record (4–2 against MAC opponents), finished in a tie for second place in the MAC, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 210 to 142.[1][2] On October 17, 1964, in what is regarded as one of the great victories in Miami football history,[3] Miami defeated Northwestern, coached by former Miami mentor Ara Parseghian, by a 28 to 27 score.[4]
