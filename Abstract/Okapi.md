The OKAPI (; _Okapia johnstoni_), also known as the FOREST GIRAFFE, CONGOLESE GIRAFFE, or ZEBRA GIRAFFE, is an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae.
