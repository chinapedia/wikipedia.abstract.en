In computer programming, a FLIP-FLOP is a seldom-used syntactic construct which allows a boolean to flip from false to true when a first condition is met and then back to false when a second condition is met. The syntax is available in the programming languages Perl[1] and Ruby.[2] Similar logic is available in sed and awk.[3]
