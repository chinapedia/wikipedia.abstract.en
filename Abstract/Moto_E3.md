The MOTO E3 (model XT1700) and the MOTO E3 POWER (model XT1706) are Android smartphones developed by Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Lenovo. These phones make up the third generation of the low-end Motorola Moto E series.[1] Released in September 2016 in India[2] exclusively via Flipkart, the E3 Power sold a record 100,000 units on its first day of sale.[3][4] (The base E3, on the other hand, was never launched in India; it was launched elsewhere.) The phones have a similar design to the Moto G3 and come in black or white. They come with a much larger-than-average battery for a budget smartphone. The Moto E3 Power is one of the few budget smartphones which supports rapid charging.[5]
