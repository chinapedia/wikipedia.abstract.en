ABBAHU () was a Jewish Talmudist, known as an _amora_, who lived in the Land of Israel, of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of Caesarea (á¸²isrin). His rabbinic education was acquired mainly at Tiberias, in the academy presided over by R. Johanan, with whom his relations were almost those of a son.[1] He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as rector of the Caesarean Academy.[2]
