The DEMOGRAPHICS OF KAZAKHSTAN enumerate the demographic features of the population of Kazakhstan, including population growth, population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. Some use the word KAZAKH to refer to the Kazakh ethnic group and language (autochthonous to Kazakhstan as well as parts of Russia, China and Mongolia) and KAZAKHSTANI to refer to Kazakhstan and its citizens regardless of ethnicity,[1][2] but it is common to use KAZAKH in both senses.[3][4][5]
