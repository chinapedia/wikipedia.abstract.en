_DONNA MARIANNA_ (or _Donna Mariana_) was a vessel that left Liverpool in 1809. On 22 May 1810 seized _Donna Marianna_ for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. The Vice admiralty court at Freetown, Sierra Leone, condemned _Donna Mariana_ and her owners appealed the decision. The result of the appeal was a finding against the owners in a case that became an important milestone in the suppression of the slave trade.
