The MAX WEDGE, formally the MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE WEDGE, was an engine option produced by the Chrysler Corporation from 1962 to 1964 that was available exclusively in B Platform (intermediate) Dodges and Plymouths. The Max Wedge motor used the Chrysler RB Block, and was produced in 413 and 426 cubic-inch iterations. By the strict definition of a muscle car as an intermediate-bodied vehicle equipped with a big-block engine, the 1962 Max Wedge Dodges and Plymouths were the first muscle cars.
