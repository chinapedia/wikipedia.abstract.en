KASTRIOTI or CASTRIOT OF KANINA,[1] who was a kephale of Kanina in 1368, was the first member of the Kastrioti family mentioned in historical documents. He was the father of Pal Kastrioti, grandfather of Gjon Kastrioti and great-grandfather of Skanderbeg. Some scholars believe that his first name was Branilo, while other scholars suggest that this belief is the result of misreading a historical document.
