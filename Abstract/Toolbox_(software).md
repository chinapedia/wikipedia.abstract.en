TOOLBOX is an integrated development environment designed to introduce computer programming in academic subjects with originally no competences in this matter.[1][2] Its design is based on the premise that, when solving a problem, a student performs a sequence of computations (i.e., proceeds in an algorithmic way), that can be expressed in a computer language, similarly to how it is done on a notebook or blackboard.
