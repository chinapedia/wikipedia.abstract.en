Alexander_of_Aphrodisias_de_Fato_1658_page_7.jpg ALEXANDER OF APHRODISIAS (; ) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of Aristotle. He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school. He wrote many commentaries on the works of Aristotle, extant are those on the _Prior Analytics_, _Topics_, _Meteorology_, _Sense and Sensibilia_, and _Metaphysics_. Several original treatises also survive, and include a work _On Fate_, in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one _On the Soul_. His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" ().
