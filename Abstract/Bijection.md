Bijection.svg In mathematics, a BIJECTION, BIJECTIVE FUNCTION, or ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set _X_ to a set _Y_.
