The GOVERNOR'S CUP STAKES is an American harness racing event run annually for two-year-old standardbred pacers at a distance of one mile. First run in 1985 as a fixed event at Garden State Park, that track closed on May 3, 2001 and the Governor's Cup would then be run at various race venues in the U.S. Northeast and in Ontario, Canada. Since 2013 the race has been part of the 'Fall Four' stakes and has been alternated between Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey and Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario.[1]
