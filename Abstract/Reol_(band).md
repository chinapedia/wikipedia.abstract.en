REOL (stylized as RÎžOL) was a Japanese musical unit that consisted of vocalist/lyricist Reol, music arranger GigaP, and movie director/producer Okiku. The members of REOL originally worked as solo artists, but they signed to Toy's Factory as a group in 2015, using Reol's name for the project. Prior to this unit's formation, Reol and GigaP consistently worked together throughout Reol's solo career, eventually releasing an album together titled _No Title_. Their debut studio album as the unit REOL, _Sigma_, was released on October 19, 2016. They had announced that they had been planning to disband, and so they did in 2017.
