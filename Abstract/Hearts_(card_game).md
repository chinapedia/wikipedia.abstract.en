HEARTS is an "evasion-type" trick-taking playing card game for four players, although variations can accommodate between three and six players. The game is also known as BLACK LADY,[1] BLACK MARIA, BLACK WIDOW, and SLIPPERY BITCH,[2] though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady. The game is a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unusual among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game; players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks, usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether.
