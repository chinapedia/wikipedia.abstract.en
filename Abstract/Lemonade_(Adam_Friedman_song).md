"LEMONADE" is a song by American singer, songwriter and producer Adam Friedman featuring Mike Posner. Friedman and Posner co-wrote the song. But when it was not included after some consideration in Posner's album _At Night, Alone._, Friedman decided to put it on his own album also personalizing the song by tweaking certain lyrics. For example, Friedman, who lives on the United States West Coast, changed Carolina in the lyrics to California.[1]
