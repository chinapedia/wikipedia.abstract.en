Kalava_Mauli_Wikipedia.jpg Mauli_or_Kalava.jpg A KAUTUKA is a red-yellow coloured ritual protection thread, sometimes with knots or amulets, found on the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes called as _kalava_, _mauli_, _moui_, _raksasutra_,[1] _pratisara_ (in North India), _kaapu_, _kayiru_ or _charandu_ (in South India).[2][3][4] A _kautuka_ is a woven thread, cord or ribbon, states the Indologist Jan Gonda, which is traditionally believed to be protective or apotropaeic.[5] The _pratisara_ and _kautuka_ in a ritual thread context appear in the Vedic text _Atharvaveda Samhita_ section 2.11.[6] An even earlier reference to ritual "red and black" colored thread with a dual function, one of driving away "fiends" and the other "binding of bonds" between the bride and the groom by one's relatives appears in hymn 10.85.28 of the _Rigveda_, states Gonda.[7][8]
