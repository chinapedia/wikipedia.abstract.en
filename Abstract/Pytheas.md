PYTHEAS OF MASSALIA (; Ancient Greek: Πυθέας ὁ Μασσαλιώτης _Pythéas ho Massaliōtēs_; Latin: _Pytheas Massiliensis_; fl. 4th century BC) was a Greek geographer and explorer from the Greek colony of Massalia (modern-day Marseille, France). He made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325 BC, but his account of it, known widely in Antiquity, has not survived and is now known only through the writings of others.
