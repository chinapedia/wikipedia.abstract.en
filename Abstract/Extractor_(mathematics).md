An (N, M, D, K, ϵ) -EXTRACTOR is a bipartite graph with N nodes on the left and M nodes on the right such that each node on the left has D neighbors (on the right), which has the added property that for any subset A of the left vertices of size at least K, the distribution on right vertices obtained by choosing a random node in A and then following a random edge to get a node x on the right side is ϵ-close to the uniform distribution in terms of total variation distance.
