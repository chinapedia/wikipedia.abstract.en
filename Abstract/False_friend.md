In linguistics, FALSE FRIENDS are words in different languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English _embarrassed_ and the Spanish _embarazada_ (which means _pregnant_), the word _parents_ and the Portuguese _parentes_ (which means _relatives_), or the word _sensible_, which means _reasonable_ in English, but _sensitive_ in French and Spanish.
