MUSCOVITE (also known as COMMON MICA, ISINGLASS, or POTASH MICA[1]) is a hydrated phyllosilicate mineral of aluminium and potassium with formula KAl₂(AlSi₃O₁₀)(FOH)₂, or (KF)₂(Al₂O₃)₃(SiO₂)₆(H₂O). It has a highly perfect basal cleavage yielding remarkably thin laminae (sheets) which are often highly elastic. Sheets of muscovite 5 meters × 3 meters (16.5 feet × 10 feet) have been found in Nellore, India.[2]
