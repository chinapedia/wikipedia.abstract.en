TROGTALITE is a rare selenide mineral with the formula CoSe_(2.) It crystallizes in the cubic system and is part of the pyrite group, consisting of Co²⁺ and Se₂^(2−) ions. It has a rose-violet colour and its crystals are opaque.[1] It often occurs as grains. It was thought to be dimorphous with hastite, but this was discredited in 2009.[2] Hastite turned out to be the iron selenide mineral ferroselite.[3] It forms a solid solution series with krut'aite.
