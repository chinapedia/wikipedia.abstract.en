JAVA is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented (although not a pure OO language, as it contains primitive types[1]), and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers _write once, run anywhere_ (WORA),[2] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[3] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[4][5] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[6]
