A SPREADSHEET is an interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form.[1][2][3] Spreadsheets developed as computerized analogs of paper accounting worksheets.[4] The program operates on data entered in cells of a table. Each cell may contain either numeric or text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells. A spreadsheet may also refer to one such electronic document.[5][6][7]
