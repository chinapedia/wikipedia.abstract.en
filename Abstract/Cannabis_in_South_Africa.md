CANNABIS IN SOUTH AFRICA has been decriminalised by the country's Constitutional Court for personal consumption by adults in private.[1] However, laws prohibiting use outside of one's private dwelling and buying and selling cannabis still remain.[2] Since regulations against the purchase of products containing cannabis still remain in effect, it also remains unclear how the ruling can be enforced as well.[3]
