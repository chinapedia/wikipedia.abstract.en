MUHAMMAD[1] (, ;[2] c. 570 CE – 8 June 632 CE)[3] was an Arab political, social and religious leader and the founder of Islam.[4] According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.[5][6][7][8] He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief.The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community considers Muhammad to be the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khātam an-Nabiyyīn) and the last law-bearing Prophet but not the last Prophet.
