ZYYX is a Swedish desktop 3D printer, designed primarily for office and educational applications. Launched in 2014 by Magicfirm Europe AB, based at Chalmers Innovation in Gothenburg, the ZYYX 3D Printer is based on FFF technology and features include an automated levelling function, smell-free operation (most 3D printers tend to smell heavily of hot plastic) and an extruder head which is less prone to jamming.[1]
