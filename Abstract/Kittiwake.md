Big_Koniuji_Black-legged_Kittiwake_colony.jpg]] The KITTIWAKES (genus _RISSA_) are two closely related seabird species in the gull family Laridae, the black-legged kittiwake (_Rissa tridactyla_) and the red-legged kittiwake (_Rissa brevirostris_). The epithets "black-legged" and "red-legged" are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where _Rissa brevirostris_ is not found, the black-legged kittiwake is often known simply as KITTIWAKE, or more colloquially in some areas as TICKLEASS or TICKLEACE. The name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'.[1] The genus name _Rissa_ is from the Icelandic name _Rita_ for the black-legged kittiwake.[2]
