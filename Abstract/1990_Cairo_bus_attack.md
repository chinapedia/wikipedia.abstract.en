The CAIRO BUS ATTACK was a terrorist attack that occurred on February 4, 1990. The attack was claimed by two groups, an unknown group calling itself the 'Organisation for the Defense of the Oppressed of Egypts Prisons' which claimed to have done it to protest the torture in Egyptian prisons, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.[1][2] Nine Israeli civilians were killed and 17 more were wounded with automatic fire and hand grenades.[3] The attack was the worst on Israelis in Egypt since the two countries signed a peace agreement in 1979.
