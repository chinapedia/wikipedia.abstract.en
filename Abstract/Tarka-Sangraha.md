TARKA-SANGRAHA is a treatise in Sanskrit giving a foundational exposition of the ancient Indian system of logic and reasoning. The work is authored by Annambhatta and the author himself has given a detailed commentary, called Tarka-Sangraha Deepika, for the text.[1][2] Annambhatta composed the text as well as the commentary in the second half of 17th century CE.[3] The text of Tarka-sangraha is a small book with about 15 pages only[4] and it was composed to help boys and girls learn easily the basic principles of Nyaya. Of all the works of Annambhatta, only Tarka-Sangraha and its commentary attained wide acceptance. They have been used as basic text for beginners for several generations.
