SHIV SENA (IAST: Śiva Sēnā) (translation; _Army of Shivaji_), is a Marathi regional and Hindu nationalist political organisation in India founded on 19 June 1966 by political cartoonist Bal Thackeray.[1] The party originally emerged from a movement in Mumbai demanding preferential treatment for Maharashtrians over migrants to the city. It is currently headed by Thackeray's son, Uddhav Thackeray. Members of Shiv Sena are referred to as SHIVSAINIKS.
