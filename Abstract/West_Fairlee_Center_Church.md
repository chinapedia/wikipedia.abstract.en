The WEST FAIRLEE CENTER CHURCH is a historic church building at Middlebrook and Bear Notch Roads in West Fairlee, Vermont. Built in 1855, it is a fine and little-altered example of rural Greek Revival architecture, also notable for the association of its congregation with Nathaniel Niles, a prominent local minister, landowner, and politician. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[1]
