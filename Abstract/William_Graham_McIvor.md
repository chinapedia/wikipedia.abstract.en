W_G_McIvor_tomb.jpg McIvor was born in Dollar in Scotland where his father John had settled after working to establish a nursery garden at Crieff. McIvor trained in horticulture and arboriculture and worked at Kew before taking up in 1848, a position in southern India as superintendent of the yet to be established Ootacamund botanical garden. At Kew, McIvor took an interest in bryophytes and published a pocket herbarium of British hepatics in 1847. He established the botanical garden at Ootacamund and worked there until his death. He married Anne, eldest daughter of Colonel Edwards of Iscoed, Denbighshire on 31 May 1850.[1][2] McIvor received cinchona plants in 1861 that had been brought from South America by Clements Markham. The first set of plants died but later batches consisting of other species (especially _Cinchona succirubra_) did well.[3] McIvor found that removing strips of barks and allowing them to heal by covering them in moss improved the sustainability of harvesting bark from the trees.[4] Anne_McIvor_Ooty.jpg His funeral was attended by most government officers and among those present included Colonel R. H. Beddome.[5]
