MAIDA SPRINGER KEMP (1910–2005) was an American labor organizer who worked extensively in Africa for the AFL–CIO. Nicknamed "Mama Maida", she advised fledgling labor unions, set up education and training programs, and liaised between American and African labor leaders. In 1945, traveling to England on a labor-exchange trip, she was the first African-American woman to represent US labor abroad. She was also active in the civil rights movement, and advocated for women's rights around the world.
