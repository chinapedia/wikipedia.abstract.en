The MUNICIPALITY OF ENFIELD was a local government area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The municipality was proclaimed as the BOROUGH OF ENFIELD on 17 January 1889 and, with an area of 3.6 square kilometres, included the modern suburbs of Croydon, Croydon Park and Strathfield South ("Druitt Town" until 1890s), with parts of Enfield, Belfield and Greenacre included in the West Ward. In 1949, the council was split into two, with Central and East Wards being added to the Municipality of Burwood and the West Ward being added into the Municipality of Strathfield, with the passing of the _Local Government (Areas) Act 1948_.
