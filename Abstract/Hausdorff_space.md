In topology and related branches of mathematics, a HAUSDORFF SPACE, SEPARATED SPACE or T₂ SPACE is a topological space where for any two distinct points there exists a neighbourhood of each which is disjoint from the neighbourhood of the other. Of the many separation axioms that can be imposed on a topological space, the "Hausdorff condition" (T₂) is the most frequently used and discussed. It implies the uniqueness of limits of sequences, nets, and filters.
