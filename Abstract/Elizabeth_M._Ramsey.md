ELIZABETH M. RAMSEY, M.D. (17 February 1906[1] - 2 July 1993[2]) was an American physician, placentologist, and embryologist known for pioneering the study of early human embryos and the structure and circulatory system of the placenta.[3] She was a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington for nearly forty years.[4] While performing an autopsy in 1934, she discovered a 14-day old human embryo, the earliest yet studied at the time. Later in her career, Dr. Ramsey worked on a team that used cineradiology to reveal the workings of the placental circulatory system in primates.[5]
