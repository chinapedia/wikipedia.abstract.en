The West Indies cricket team toured New Zealand in December 2017 and January 2018 to play two Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.[1][2][3] Three Tests were originally planned, but it was reduced to two by New Zealand Cricket (NZC) to conform to the expected tour make-up when the ICC World Test Championship is implemented.[4][5] Ahead of the Test series, a three-day tour match was planned, which started on 25 November 2017.[6]
