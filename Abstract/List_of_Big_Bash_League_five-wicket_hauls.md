Daniel_Christian.jpg is the only bowler to take two five-wicket hauls in the BBL.[1]]] In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a "five-for" or "fifer")[2][3] refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.[4] The Big Bash League (BBL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in Australia, which has been held annually since its first season in 2011â€“12.[5] In the six seasons played, seven five-wicket hauls have been taken by six different bowlers. Players from five of the eight teams have taken five-wicket hauls.[6]
