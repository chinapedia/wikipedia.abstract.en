AIMOIN OF FLEURY (; ), French chronicler, was born at Villefranche-de-Longchat about 960, and in early life entered the monastery of Fleury, where he became a monk and passed the greater part of his life. Between c. 980 and 985 Aimoin wrote about St. Benedict in Abbey of Fleury-sur-Loire. [1] His chief work is a _Historia Francorum_, or _Libri V. de Gestis Francorum_, which deals with the history of the Franks from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the Middle Ages, but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by G. Waitz and published in the _Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores_, Band xxvi (Hanover and Berlin, 1826â€“1892).[2]
