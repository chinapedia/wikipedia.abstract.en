Besides a means of communication and a store of information, letter writing has played a role in the reproduction of writing as an art throughout history.[2] Letters have been sent since antiquity and are mentioned in the _Iliad_.[3] Historians Herodotus and Thucydides mention and utilize letters in their writings.[4]
