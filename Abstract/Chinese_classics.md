CHINESE CLASSIC TEXTS or CANONICAL TEXTS () refers to the Chinese texts which originated before the imperial unification by the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, particularly the "Four Books and Five Classics" of the Neo-Confucian tradition, themselves a customary abridgment of the "Thirteen Classics". All of these pre-Qin texts were written in classical Chinese. All three canons are collectively known as the CLASSICS (t , s , _jīng_, lit. "warp").[1]
