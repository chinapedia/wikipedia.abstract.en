The mid-sized PRAGA LADY car was built in eight series and replaced the Piccolo 307.[1] First introduced in 1935, it continued to be built until 1947. It was most common as a four-door saloon but also available with two doors or as a convertible and pick-up truck. A variety of ambulance versions were also built.[2] The first series (1935-1937) was also available as a two-seat roadster, bodied by Oldřich Uhlík in Prague.[3]
