The PRIX JEAN-FREUSTIÉ is a French literary prize created in 1987 by Christiane Teurlay-Freustié, second wife of writer and publisher Jean Freustie (1914–1983) to which it pays tribute, and his friends Nicole and Frédéric Vitoux as well as writer Bernard Frank.[1] It rewards a French-speaking writer for a prose work: novel, short stories, autobiography, biography or essay. The prize is awarded annually.
