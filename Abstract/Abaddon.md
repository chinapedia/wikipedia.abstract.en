Christianandapollyon.jpg's _The Pilgrim's Progress_.|250px|thumb]] The Hebrew term _ABADDON_ ( _Avaddon_, meaning "doom"), and its Greek equivalent _APOLLYON_ (, _Apollýōn_) appear in the Bible as both a place of destruction and an angel of the abyss. In the Hebrew Bible, _abaddon_ is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place שְׁאוֹל (_Sheol_), meaning the realm of the dead.
