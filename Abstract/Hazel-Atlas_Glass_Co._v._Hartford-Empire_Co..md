_HAZEL-ATLAS GLASS CO. V. HARTFORD-EMPIRE CO._, 322 U.S. 238 (1944), was a much cited 1944 decision of the United States Supreme Court dealing with fraud on the Patent Office.[1] A widely quoted statement in the Court's opinion is: "The public welfare demands that the agencies of public justice be not so impotent that they must always be mute and helpless victims of deception and fraud."[2] Although the fraud occurred in the late 1920s, the facts became public only much later in the Government's antitrust trial in _United States v. Hartford-Empire Co._[3]
