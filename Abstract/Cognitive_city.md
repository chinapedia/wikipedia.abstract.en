COGNITIVE CITY is a term which expands the concept of the _smart city_[1] with the aspect of cognition or refers to a virtual environment where goal-driven communities gather to share knowledge. A physical cognitive city differs from conventional cities and smart cities in the fact that it is steadily learning through constant interaction with its citizens through advanced information and communications technologies (ICT) based ICT standards like IFGICT & ITU and that, based on this exchange of information, it becomes continuously more efficient, more sustainable and more resilient.[2][3][4] A virtual cognitive city differs from social media platforms and project management platforms in that shared data is critical for the groupâ€™s performance, and the community consists of members spanning diverse expertise, backgrounds, motivations, and geographies but with a common desire to solve large problems. The virtual cognitive city is steadily learning through constant metadata generated by activity in the user community.[5]
