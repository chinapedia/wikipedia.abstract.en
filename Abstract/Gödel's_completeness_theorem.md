Completude̠_logique_premier_ordre.png_x_. _R_(_x_,_x_)) → (∀_x_∃_y_. _R_(_x_,_y_)) holds in all structures (only the simplest 8 are shown left). By Gödel's completeness result, it must hence have a natural deduction proof (shown right).]] GÖDEL'S COMPLETENESS THEOREM is a fundamental theorem in mathematical logic that establishes a correspondence between semantic truth and syntactic provability in first-order logic. It makes a close link between model theory that deals with what is true in different models, and proof theory that studies what can be formally proven in particular formal systems.
