_WINNIE-THE-POOH: THE BEST BEAR IN ALL THE WORLD_ is the second authorised sequel to A. A. Milne's original _Winnie-the-Pooh_ stories. It was published on 6 October 2016 to mark the 90th anniversary of the publication of the first _Winnie-the-Pooh_ book. The sequel is an anthology of four short stories, each written by a leading children's author. The four contributors are Paul Bright, Jeanne Willis, Kate Saunders, and Brian Sibley. The illustrations, in the style of the originals by E. H. Shepard, are by Mark Burgess. The book attracted national press coverage because of the introduction of a new character, Penguin.
