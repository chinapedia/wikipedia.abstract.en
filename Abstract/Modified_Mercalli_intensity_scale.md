The MODIFIED MERCALLI INTENSITY SCALE (MM or MMI), descended from Giuseppe Mercalli's MERCALLI INTENSITY SCALE of 1902, is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the _intensity of shaking_ produced by an earthquake. It measures the _effects_ of an earthquake _at a given location_, distinguished from the earthquake's inherent _force_ or _strength_ as measured by seismic magnitude scales (such as the "" magnitude usually reported for an earthquake). While shaking is driven by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger area. Shaking intensity is localized, generally diminishing with distance from the earthquake's epicenter, but can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of unconsolidated soils.
