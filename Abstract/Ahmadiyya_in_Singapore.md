AHMADIYYA (Malay: Ahmadiyah; Tamil: அகமதியா; Chinese: 阿赫迈底亚) is an Islamic religious community in Singapore. The Community was established during the era of the Second Caliphate, shortly before the Second World War. Ghulam Hussain Ayyaz was the first missionary sent to the region, who under the direction of the caliph, arrived in 1935, in a period when the territory was part of the Straits Settlements.[1] In the 1970s, the Community had roughly 200 followers, represented by 1-2% of the Muslim population.[2]
