In computer science, LR PARSERS are a type of bottom-up parser that efficiently read deterministic context-free languages, in guaranteed linear time.[1] There are several variants of LR parsers: SLR parsers, LALR parsers, CANONICAL LR(1) parsers, MINIMAL LR(1) parsers, GLR parsers. LR parsers can be generated by a parser generator from a formal grammar defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of computer languages.
