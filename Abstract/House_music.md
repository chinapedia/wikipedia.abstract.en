HOUSE MUSIC is a genre of electronic dance music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s.[1] Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines,[2] off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic.[3] The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals; some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words.
