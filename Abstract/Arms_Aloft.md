ARMS ALOFT is an American punk group from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, formed in 2007. As described by frontman Seth Gile, the band's lyrics frequently focus on left politics and how they affect people personally.[1] Their music accordingly has covered explicitly political topics such as pollution, global warming, Wall Street corruption, and drone strikes, as well as time-honored topics such as breakups and boredom.[2][3]
