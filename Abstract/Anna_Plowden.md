Anna_Plowden_conserver.png ANNA BRIDGET PLOWDEN, (18 June 1938 â€“ 21 August 1997) was a British archaeological conservator and restorer. She has been described as the first scientifically trained conservator to work in the private sector, rather than in a museum or university.[1] She worked as a freelance conservator, having set up her own business, _Anna Plowden Ltd_, in 1968. In order to take on larger projects, her business merged with _Peter Smith (R and R) Ltd_ in 1985; _Plowden and Smith Ltd_ remains "one of the largest and most successful businesses in the conservation private sector".[2]
