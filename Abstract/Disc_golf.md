DISC GOLF[1] (occasionally called Frisbee golf or frolf) is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target; it is played using rules similar to golf.[2] It is often played on a course of 9 or 18 holes. Players complete a hole by throwing a disc from a tee area toward a target, throwing again from the landing position of the disc until the target is reached. Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each target are tallied (often in relation to par), and players seek to complete each hole, and the course, in the lowest number of total throws.[3]
