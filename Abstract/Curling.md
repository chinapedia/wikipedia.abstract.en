CURLING is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. It is related to bowls, boules and shuffleboard. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called _rocks_, across the ice _curling sheet_ towards the _house_, a circular target marked on the ice.[1] Each team has eight stones, with each player throwing two. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a _game_; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each _end_, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game usually consists of eight or ten ends.
