The graph gets arbitrarily close to the -axis, but does not meet it.]] In mathematics, the LOGARITHM is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number  is the exponent to which another fixed number, the _base_ , must be raised, to produce that number . In the simplest case, the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g., since 10 × 10 × 10 {{=}} 10³}}, the "logarithm to base " of is . The logarithm of to _base_ is denoted as (or, without parentheses, as , or even without explicit base as , when no confusion is possible). More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so for any two positive real numbers  and  where  is not equal to , is always a unique real number . More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:
