The GÖKTÜRKS, CELESTIAL TURKS, BLUE TURKS or KOK TURKS (Old Turkic: 𐰜𐰇𐰛:𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰, _Kök Türük_; , Middle Chinese: *_duət̚-kʉɐt̚_ (türkut), ; Khotanese Saka: _Ttūrka_, _Ttrūka_; Old Tibetan: _Drugu_, tatar: _kük törek_, bashqurt: _kük török_) were a nomadic confederation of Turkic peoples in medieval Inner Asia. The Göktürks, under the leadership of Bumin Qaghan (d. 552) and his sons, succeeded the Rouran Khaganate as the main power in the region and established the Turkic Khaganate, one of several nomadic dynasties which would shape the future geolocation, culture, and dominant beliefs of Turkic peoples.
