In economics, the GINI COEFFICIENT ( ), sometimes called GINI INDEX, or GINI RATIO, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measurement of inequality. It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper _Variability and Mutability_ ().[1]
