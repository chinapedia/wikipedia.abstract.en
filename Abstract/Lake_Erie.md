Lake_Erie_looking_southward.jpg]] LAKE ERIE[1] (; ) is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the eleventh-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area.[2][3] It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes[4][5] and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is deep.
