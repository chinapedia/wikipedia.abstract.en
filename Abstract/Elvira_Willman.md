AGNES ELVIRA MARIA WILLMAN (10 August 1875 â€“ 17 April 1925) was a Finnish playwright, journalist and a revolutionary socialist who was one of the most prominent women of the early Finnish labour movement. Willman is also considered as the first female working-class writer in Finland, although she came from a bourgeois background. After the 1918 Finnish Civil War Willman and her husband Voitto Eloranta fled to the Soviet Russia. They were later accused of being involved with the Kuusinen Club Incident, a murder of eight Finnish communists. Eloranta was executed in 1922 and Willman 1925.
