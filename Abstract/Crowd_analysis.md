CROWD ANALYSIS involves the interpretation of data gained studying the natural movement of groups or objects. Masses of bodies, particularly humans, are the subjects of these crowd tracking analyses that include how a particular crowd moves and when a movement pattern changes.[1] The data is implemented in order to predict future crowd movement, crowd density, and potential events such as an evacuation route.[2] Applications of crowd analysis can range from video game crowd simulation to security and surveillance.
