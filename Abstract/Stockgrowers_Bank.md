The STOCKGROWERS BANK, also known as the DIXON TOWN HALL, was built in Dixon, Wyoming in 1916. The decorated concrete masonry building was the bank's headquarters until the bank was dissolved in 1923. Following the bank's demise the building served as a soda fountain into the 1940s, which was followed by a store, then the Little Snake River Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10051 hall. In 1975 it became the town hall.[1]
