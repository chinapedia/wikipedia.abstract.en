MAMMARY ANALOGUE SECRETORY CARCINOMA (MASC) (also termed MASC_(SG); the "SG" subscript indicates salivary gland)) is a salivary gland neoplasm that shares a genetic mutation with certain types of breast cancer. MASC_(SG) was first described by Skálová et al. in 2010.[1] The authors of this report found a chromosome translocation in certain salivary gland tumors that was identical to the (12;15)(p13;q25) fusion gene mutation found previously in secretory carcinoma, a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.
