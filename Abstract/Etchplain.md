An ETCHPLAIN is a plain where the bedrock has been subject to considerable "etching" or subsurface weathering. Etchplanation is the process forming etchplains. Contrary to what the name might suggest, etchplains are seldom completely flat and usually display some relief, as weathering of the bedrock does not advance uniformly. This means that weathering is unrelated to the flatness which might be derivative of various other processes of planation including peneplanation and pediplanation.[1] Erosion of etchplains can result in the exposure of inselbergs such as bornhardt and tors.[2] Generally the topography exposed at a stripped etchplain, that is an etch surface,[3] after erosion of regolith is one with many irregularities as result of structurally defined areas of rock strength.[4]
