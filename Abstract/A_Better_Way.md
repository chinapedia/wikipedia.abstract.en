A BETTER WAY is a conservative agenda for U.S. governance, crafted by former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan as well as Kevin Brady, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.[1][2][3] Ryan calls the six-point plan "a complete alternative to the Left's agenda".[4] Shortly after the 2016 United States elections, Speaker Ryan said that the plan, described by Reuters as an "aggressive Republican legislative agenda", provides a blueprint for laws he expects to spearhead in the Republican congress in cooperation with the Republican Trump administration.[5] For someone other than the party's nominee to direct the party's agenda in a presidential election year has been termed "a rare move".[6]
