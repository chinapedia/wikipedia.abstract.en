The SWANTON COVERED RAILROAD BRIDGE was a covered bridge in Swanton, Vermont. Built in 1898, it carried the St. Johnsbury and Lamoille County Railroad across the Missisquoi River just west of Swanton village. It was destroyed by fire in 1987, and its site is now occupied by the former West Milton Bridge. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and has not been delisted despite its destruction.[1]
