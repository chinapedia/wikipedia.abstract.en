In propositional logic, DISJUNCTION ELIMINATION[1][2] (sometimes named PROOF BY CASES, CASE ANALYSIS, or OR ELIMINATION), is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof. It is the inference that if a statement P implies a statement Q and a statement R also implies Q, then if either P or R is true, then Q has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.
