The 1971 NYPD WORK STOPPAGE occurred for five days between January 14 and January 19, 1971, when around 20,000 New York City police officers refused to report for regular duty.[1] While officers maintained that they would continue to respond to serious crimes and emergencies, they refused to carry out routine patrolling duties, leading in some cases, to as little as 200 officers being on the street in the city.[2][3]
