AL-AMĪR AL-MUKHTĀR ʿIZZ AL-MULK ABŪ ʿABD ALLĀH MUḤAMMAD IBN ABIʾL QĀSIM ʿUBAYD ALLĀH IBN AḤMAD IBN ISMĀʿĪL IBN ʿABD AL-AZĪZ AL-ḤARRANĪ AL-MUSABBIḤĪ AL-KĀTIB, commonly known simply as AL-MUSABBIHI (4 March 977 – April/May 1030), was a Fatimid historian, writer and administrative official. He is known to have authored some 40,000 pages of manuscripts dealing with an array of topics, including history, psychology, law, grammar, sexology and cooking. _Akhbār Miṣr_, a contemporary chronicle of Egyptian history and news, was among al-Musabbihi's well-known works. However, like the vast majority of al-Musabbihi's works, only fragments of _Akhbār Miṣr_ survived; most of his writings disappeared not long after his death.
