MicaSheetUSGOV.jpg mica-from-alstead.jpg Dark_Mica_from_Eastern_Ontario.jpg]] The MICA group of sheet silicate (phyllosilicate) minerals includes several closely related materials having nearly perfect basal cleavage. All are monoclinic, with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals, and are similar in chemical composition. The nearly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms.
