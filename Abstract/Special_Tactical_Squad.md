The SPECIAL TACTICAL SQUAD (Abbreviation: STS; Chinese: 特別戰術小隊, nicknamed ELITE TEAM, or RAPTORS/SPEEDY DRAGONS; Chinese: 速龍小隊) is an elite paramilitary task force of the Hong Kong Police Force, being a sub-division of the Police Tactical Unit (PTU). It was created in June 2014 to handle mass riot or protests with its main task being assuring a smooth progress of riot control and bring order to chaos if the situation has been on-going for prolonged periods or time or even out of control, and/or if the PTU suffered from heavy blockade or obstruction, using rapid maneuvers to remove obstacles, secure an area and to conduct arrests, provide first aid, etc. The STS will also conduct observational and command related tasks, to ensure and review the Police Tactical Unit's use of force and tactics are appropriate, to further improve from past events.
