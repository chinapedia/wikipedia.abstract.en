APPLE COMPUTER 1, also known later as the APPLE I, or APPLE-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak.[1][2] The idea of selling the computer came from Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs.[3][4] The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus,[5] for a few hundred dollars, and Steve Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary.[6] It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.[7]
