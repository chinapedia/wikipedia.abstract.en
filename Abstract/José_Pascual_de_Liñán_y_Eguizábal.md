JOSÉ PASCUAL DE LIÑÁN Y EGUIZÁBAL, COUNT OF DOÑA MARINA (1858–1934) was a Spanish writer, publisher and a Carlist politician. He is known mostly as the manager of two Traditionalist dailies, issued in the 1890s and 1900s in the Vascongadas, and as the author of minor works related to jurisprudence and history. As a politician he briefly headed the Carlist regional party organization in Castile, though he is recognized rather as an architect of political rebranding of Carlism in the late 19th century.
