CHICANO or CHICANA is a chosen identity of some Mexican Americans in the United States.[1] The term _Chicano_ is sometimes used interchangeably with _Mexican-American_. Both names are chosen identities within the Mexican-American community in the United States; however, these terms have a wide range of meanings in various parts of the Southwest. The term became widely used during the Chicano Movement by Mexican Americans to express pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity.
