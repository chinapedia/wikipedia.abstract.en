CZECH (; _čeština_ ), historically also BOHEMIAN[1] (; _lingua Bohemica_ in Latin), is a West Slavic language of the Czech–Slovak group.[2] Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree.[3] Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin[4] and German.[5]
