ALCOHOL INTOXICATION, also known as DRUNKENNESS or ALCOHOL POISONING,[1] is the negative behavior and physical effects due to the recent drinking of ethanol (alcohol).[2][3] Symptoms at lower doses may include mild sedation and poor coordination.[4] At higher doses, there may be slurred speech, trouble walking, and vomiting.[5] Extreme doses may result in a decreased effort to breathe (respiratory depression), coma, or death.[6] Complications may include seizures, aspiration pneumonia, injuries including suicide, and low blood sugar.[7][8]
