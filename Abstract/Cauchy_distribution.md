The CAUCHY DISTRIBUTION, named after Augustin Cauchy, is a continuous probability distribution. It is also known, especially among physicists, as the LORENTZ DISTRIBUTION (after Hendrik Lorentz), CAUCHY–LORENTZ DISTRIBUTION, LORENTZ(IAN) FUNCTION, or BREIT–WIGNER DISTRIBUTION. The Cauchy distribution f(x; x₀, γ) is the distribution of the -intercept of a ray issuing from (x₀, γ) with a uniformly distributed angle. It is also the distribution of the ratio of two independent normally distributed random variables if the denominator distribution has mean zero.
