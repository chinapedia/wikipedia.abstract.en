HOLLIE HUGHES (October 16, 1888 - January, 1981) was a trainer of Thoroughbred racehorses who won the 1916 Kentucky Derby and was a six-time winner of the most prestigious steeplechase race in the United States, the American Grand National. His career successes earned him induction into the U. S. Racing Hall of Fame in 1973.[1] [2][3] In 1979, a New York-bred race at Aqueduct Racetrack was named in his honor.[4]
