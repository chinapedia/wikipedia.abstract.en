Libya is a country that is located in the northern part of Africa, it is mostly dominated by Muslims as such the laws of the country are bent on the Islamic religion. Sharia based banks all over the world are in front of a number of challenges, and Libya cannot be excluded. Islamic banks are still not well-devised in its mechanism because banking without interest that could provide funding in the short term and are faced with the problem of financing of consumer loans and the government deficit. All Sharia based Libyan banks have resorted to financing that delivers a predetermined return on investment to avoid the increased risk of short-term financing, and then the banks have only changed the name of their transactions. Banks that are based on the Sharia do not have the support of the central bank of Libya, and a lack of trained staff to choose.[1]
