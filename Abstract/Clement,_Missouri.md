CLEMENT is an unincorporated community in Jackson Township in southeastern Sainte Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. It is situated near the Mississippi River, approximately eight miles northwest of Ste. Genevieve. The community was also referred to as _Establishment_ in the past due to its proximity to Establishment Creek and the adjacent Establishment Island in the Mississippi floodplain. A small stream in Staples Hollow joins Establishment Creek at the site.[1]
