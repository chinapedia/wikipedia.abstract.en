The IRGUN (; full title: __, lit. "The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel") was a Zionist paramilitary organization that operated in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948. It was an offshoot of the older and larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah (Hebrew: , Defence). When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the _Haganah Bet_ (Hebrew: literally "Defense 'B' " or "Second Defense", ), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit () or Hama'amad ().[1] Irgun members were absorbed into the Israel Defense Forces at the start of the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli war. The Irgun is also referred to as ETZEL (), an acronym of the Hebrew initials, or by the abbreviation IZL.
