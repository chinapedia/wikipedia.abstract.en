Redshirt_characters_from_Star_Trek.jpg (1967).]] A "REDSHIRT" is a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced. The term originates from the original _Star Trek_ (NBC, 1966â€“69) television series in which the red-shirted security personnel frequently die during episodes.[1] Redshirt deaths are often used to dramatize the potential peril that the main characters face.
