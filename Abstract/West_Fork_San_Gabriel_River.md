The WEST FORK is one of two major streams, the other being the East Fork, that combine to form the San Gabriel River in Los Angeles County, California. The West Fork flows for [1] in an easterly direction from its origins at Red Box Gap, in the San Gabriel Mountains, eventually reaching San Gabriel Reservoir where it is bridged by SR 39 just above its mouth.
