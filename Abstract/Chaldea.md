Chaldean}} Chaldea_-_Map_-_The_Countries_around_Chaldea.png Chaldea_-_Map_-_Chaldea_and_Neighboring_Countries.png CHALDEA (, also spelled CHALDAEA) was a country that existed between the late 10th or early 9th and mid-6th centuries BCE, after which the country and its people were absorbed and assimilated into Babylonia.[1] Semitic-speaking, it was located in the marshy land of the far southeastern corner of Mesopotamia and briefly came to rule Babylon. The Hebrew Bible uses the term (_Ka≈õdim_) and this is translated as _Chaldaeans_ in the Greek Old Testament, although there is some dispute as to whether _Kasdim_ in fact means _Chaldean_ or refers to the south Mesopotamian _Kaldu_.
