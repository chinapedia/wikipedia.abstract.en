The 2017 SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE BASEBALL TOURNAMENT was held from May 23 through May 28 at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in Hoover, Alabama. The annual tournament determined the tournament champion of the Division I Southeastern Conference in college baseball. The tournament champion earned the conference's automatic bid to the 2017 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament[1][2] After a search for potential new sites, the SEC named Hoover the host for the 2017 and future events, with a specific term to be negotiated.[3]
