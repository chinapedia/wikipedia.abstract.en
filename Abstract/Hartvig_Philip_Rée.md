HARTVIG PHILIP RÉE (12 October 1778 – 1 October 1859) was a Jewish-Danish merchant and author who built a large shipping and trade business to become one of the wealthiest people of his time. He created the first Jewish cemetery and synagogue in Aarhus at a time when Jews were frequently discriminated against and the Jewish population was negligible. He published a number of written works, mostly related to Jewish theology but also dealing with broader subjects such as economics. [1][2][3]
