SIBYLLE MERTENS-SCHAAFFHAUSEN (29 January 1797 – 22 October 1857) was a German art collector and musician who became significant due in part to interest in archaeology. She hosted a salon of importance.[1] She became notable for knowledge of gems and coins and was invited to scientific meetings in Rome.[2] She supported the German revolutions of 1848–49 and had affectionate relationships with women such as Adele Schopenhauer. She has been referred to as the "countess from the Rhine," and her nation's first recognized female archaeologist.[3]
