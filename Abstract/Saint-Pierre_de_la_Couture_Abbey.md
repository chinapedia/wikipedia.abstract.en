Grand_hall_pr√©fecture_Le_Mans.JPG SAINT-PIERRE DE LA COUTURE ABBEY (_abbaye Saint-Pierre de la Couture_) was a former Benedictine monastery in Le Mans. All that survives of it is the abbey church and some of the abbey buildings - the latter date to a rebuild between 1760 and 1775 and are now used to house the prefecture for Sarthe. Dating to the 11th century, the monastery was considered one of the most powerful in western France before the French Revolution.[1]
