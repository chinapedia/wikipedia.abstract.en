JOSEPH THOMAS BURTON-GIBBS was one of Sydney's "oldest business identities".[1] Born in Derby, England, Burton-Gibbs emigrated to Melbourne in 1853 aboard the ship _Indian Queen_. In 1866 he helped establish a printing and publishing house, Clarson, Shallard & Co, with partners Joseph Shallard, Alfred Henry Massina and William Clarson. In 1862 he moved to Sydney to open a branch of the company at 207 Pitt Street.[2] Although the original partnership was dissolved in 1866, Burton-Gibbs continued his partnership with Joseph Shallard, trading as Gibbs, Shallard and Co, which went on to become a leading printer and publisher in the city. One well-known publication was the _Illustrated Sydney News_. In 1889, he became a founding director of the Imperial Arcade Company Ltd which developed the Imperial Arcade, Sydney.[3]
