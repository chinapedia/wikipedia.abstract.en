WILLS, ESTATES AND SUCCESSION ACT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (WESA) is a provincial statute that governs the law of inheritance in British Columbia, Canada.[1] The bill was introduced in Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on September 24, 2009 and received royal consent on October 29, 2009. WESA amalgamated and in some cases replaced five earlier pieces of legislation. These include: Estate Administration Act RSBC 1996, c. 122,Probate Recognition RSBC 1996, c. 376, Wills Act RSBC 1996, c. 489, Wills Variation Act RSBC 1996, c. Law and Equity Act RSBC 1996, c. 253, s. 46, 49, 50 & 51 and Survivorship and Presumption of Death Act RSBC 1996, c. 444.[2] WESA has given the court curative discretion under Part 5, and in Section 60 allows the court to invalidate and supplant testamentary instruments that are deemed by the court defective as regards proper maintenance and support of the will-maker's spouse or children.
