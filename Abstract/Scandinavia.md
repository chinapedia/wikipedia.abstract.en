SCANDINAVIA ( ) is a region in Northern Europe, with strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties. The term _Scandinavia_ in local usage covers the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The majority national languages of these three, belong to the Scandinavian dialect continuum, and are mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.[1] In English usage, Scandinavia also sometimes refers to the Scandinavian Peninsula, or to the broader region including Finland and Iceland, which is always known locally as the Nordic countries.[2][3]
