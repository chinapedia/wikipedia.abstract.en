SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS (; ;[1] 11 April 145 – 4 February 211), also known as SEVERUS, was Roman emperor from 193 to 211. He was born in Leptis Magna in the Roman province of Africa. As a young man he advanced through the _cursus honorum_—the customary succession of offices—under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus seized power after the death of Emperor Pertinax in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors.
