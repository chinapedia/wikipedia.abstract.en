JOSEPH JOHN CAMPBELL (March 26, 1904 â€“ October 30, 1987) was an American Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.
