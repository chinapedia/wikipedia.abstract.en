The PICO-8 (stylized as PICO-8) is a virtual machine created by Lexaloffle Games. It is designed to mimic a "fantasy video game console".[1] The coding is accomplished through a Lua-based environment,[2] in which users can create sounds, sprites, maps, and games. Users are able to upload creations to Lexaloffle's official BBS where other users are able to play the games in browser, and view the source code.[3]
