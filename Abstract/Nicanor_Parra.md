NICANOR SEGUNDO PARRA SANDOVAL (5 September 1914 â€“ 23 January 2018) was a Chilean poet, mathematician, and physicist. He was considered an influential poet in Chile and throughout Latin America. Parra described himself as an "anti-poet," due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he would exclaim _"Me retracto de todo lo dicho"_ ("I take back everything I said").
