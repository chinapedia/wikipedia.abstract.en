Set-game-cards.png _SET_ is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, stadium), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple).[1] Each possible combination of features (e.g., a card with [three] [striped] [green] [diamonds]) appears as a card precisely _once_ in the deck.
