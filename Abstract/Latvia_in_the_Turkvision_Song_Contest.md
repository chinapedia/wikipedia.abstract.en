The participation of LATVIA IN THE TURKVISION SONG CONTEST was expected to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Turkvision Song Contest 2016. The national broadcaster responsible for the selection process of Latvia's participants has yet to be known. Latvia had selected Oksana Bilera with her song "Yakışıyor bize bu sevgi", as their debut entry. However, the 2016 contest was subsequently cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings.
