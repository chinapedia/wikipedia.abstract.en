BIOHUB[1][2] is a collaborative effort by Berkeley, UCSF and Stanford, who have joined forces in a new medical science research center funded by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. It is trademarked as well as CZ BIOHUB.[3] It is currently co-led by Stephen Quake and Joseph DeRisi. Gajus Worthington was named as Biohub's Chief Operating Officer in 2017.[4] The idea for Biohub originated in 2015 when the current leaders, along with Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, discussed the need for a collaborative effort by those three universities for fundamental medical research.[5]
