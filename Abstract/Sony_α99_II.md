The SONY Α99 II is the flagship Sony DSLR and continues the Sony α SLT line of Sony A-mount camera bodies.[1] It was first announced by Sony on September 19, 2016 at photokina 2016 and replaced the original Sony α99. Its single-lens translucent design allows for faster focusing and shooting than other DSLRs.[2] Consequently, at 12 FPS, it can shoot roughly twice as fast in continuous burst mode as competing models as of 2016.[3] The α99 II also features best-in-class low-light autofocus.
