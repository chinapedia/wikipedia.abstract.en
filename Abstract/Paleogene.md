The PALEOGENE (; also spelled PALAEOGENE or PALÆOGENE; informally LOWER TERTIARY or EARLY TERTIARY) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the span of time now covered by the Paleogene and subsequent Neogene periods; despite no longer being recognised as a formal stratigraphic term, 'Tertiary' is still widely found in earth science literature and remains in informal use.[1] The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.[2] The United States Geological Survey uses the abbreviation PE for the Paleogene,[3][4] but the more commonly used abbreviation is PG with the PE being used for Paleocene.
