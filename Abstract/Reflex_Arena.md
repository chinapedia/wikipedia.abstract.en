_REFLEX ARENA_ (colloquially known as _REFLEX_) is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Turbo Pixel Studios and released onto Steam's Early Access program on 4 November 2014, and launched out of Early Access on 8 March 2017. It is an arena FPS that is heavily influenced by the Challenge ProMode Arena mod for Quake III Arena.[1] Players must navigate arena-like levels and fight other players using a focused set of situational weapons. Reflex uses an engine built from scratch specifically for the arena FPS genre[2] and features many skill-based movement features, including strafe-jumping, rocket-jumping, and multi-jumping.[3]
