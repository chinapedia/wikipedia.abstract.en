PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS () are Christian citizens of the State of Palestine. In the wider definition of Palestinian Christians, including the Palestinian refugees, diaspora and people with full or partial Palestinian Christian ancestry this can be applied to an estimated 500,000 people worldwide as of the year 2000.[1] Palestinian Christians belong to one of a number of Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Catholicism (Eastern and Western rites), Anglicanism, Lutheranism, other branches of Protestantism and others. They number 6â€“7% of the 12 million Palestinians. 70% live outside Palestine and Israel. In both the local dialect of Palestinian Arabic and in Classical Arabic or Modern Standard Arabic, Christians are called _Nasrani_ (the Arabic word Nazarene) or _Masihi_ (a derivative of Arabic word _Masih_, meaning "Messiah").[2] Hebrew-speakers call them _Notzri_ (also spelt _Notsri_), which means Nazarene (originated from Nazareth).[3]
