Cassius Clay (soon Muhammad Ali) fought an eight-round boxing match with LaMar Clark in Louisville on April 19, 1961. Clark had entered the ring with a formidable reputation of knocking out 45 of his previous opponents. However, Clay broke Clark's nose in the fight and won the bout through a knockout in the second round following which Clark retired from boxing.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
