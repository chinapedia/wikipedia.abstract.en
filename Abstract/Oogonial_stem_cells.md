OOGONIAL STEM CELLS (OSCs), also known as EGG PRECURSOR CELLS or FEMALE GERMLINE CELLS, are diploid germline cells with stem cell characteristics: the ability to renew and differentiate into other cell types, different from their tissue of origin.[1] Present in invertebrates and some lower vertebrate species, they have been extensively studied in _Caenorhabditis elegans_, _Drosophila melanogaster_ and _Xenopus laevis_ (the African clawed frog). OSCs allow the production of new female reproductive cells (oocytes) by the process of oogenesis during an organism's reproductive life.[2][3]
