A portion of the lattice of ideals of Z illustrating prime, semiprime and primary ideals of a portion of the lattice of ideals of the integers . The purple nodes indicate prime ideals. The purple and green nodes are semiprime ideals, and the purple and blue nodes are primary ideals.]] In algebra, a PRIME IDEAL is a subset of a ring that shares many important properties of a prime number in the ring of integers.[1][2] The prime ideals for the integers are the sets that contain all the multiples of a given prime number, together with the zero ideal.
