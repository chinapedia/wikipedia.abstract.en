PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING (often shortened to PRO WRESTLING or simply WRESTLING) is a form of performance art[1][2][3][4][5] and entertainment[6][7] that combines athletics with theatrical performance.[8] It takes the form of events, held by touring companies, that mimic a title-match combat sport. The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on classical and "catch" wrestling, with modern additions of striking attacks, strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers. Much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts. An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included.[9][10]
