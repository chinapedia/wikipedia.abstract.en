A DEER HAY WIND,[1] DEER FOLD or ELRICK is an artificial,[2] natural or modified natural feature used in the culling, capture or management of deer in relation to deer parks or natural woodland and open countryside. These structures have existed for many centuries and after falling out of use and their function having been forgotten the more substantial earth or stone examples have attracted names such as _Roman Trenches_, _Old Fortifications_, etc.[3][4][5] The hinds were the main target of the hunt.[6]
