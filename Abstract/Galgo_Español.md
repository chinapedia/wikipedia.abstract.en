The GALGO ESPAÃ‘OL (_Spanish galgo_) or SPANISH SIGHTHOUND is an ancient breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. The English greyhound is possibly a descendant of the Spanish greyhound and, for several years in the 20th century, some breeders did cross-breed Galgos and Greyhounds in order to produce faster and more powerful Galgos, specifically for track racing purposes.[1]
