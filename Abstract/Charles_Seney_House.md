The CHARLES SENEY HOUSE, also known as the VAN HEEL RESIDENCE, is a historic building located in Mason City, Iowa, United States. This house is attributed to local architect Einar Broaten and built by Sivert Rivedal, a native of Norway.[1] It utilizes the Mason City variant of the Prairie School style to stucco over corbelled masonry to form the wall panels for visual effect.[2] The two-story house, completed in 1913, is capped with a hip roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[3]
