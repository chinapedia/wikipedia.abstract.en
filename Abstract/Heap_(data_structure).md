Max-Heap.svg max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100]] In computer science, a HEAP is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete[1] tree that satisfies the HEAP PROPERTY: in a _max heap_, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the _key_ (the _value_) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a _min heap_, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[2] The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the _root_ node.
