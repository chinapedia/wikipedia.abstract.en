POPE CALLIXTUS III (31 December 1378 â€“ 6 August 1458), also known as _ALFONSO DE BORGIA_ (), was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 8 April 1455 to his death in 1458. He is the most recent pope to have taken the pontifical name of "Callixtus" upon his election. A member of the powerful Borgia family, Callixtus III was the uncle of Pope Alexander VI, whom he appointed to the College of Cardinals.
