The _HERO SYSTEM_ is a generic role-playing game system that was developed from the superhero RPG _Champions_. After _Champions_ fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as _The Hero System Rulesbook_ in 1990. As a spinoff of _Champions_, the _Hero System_ is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to _Champions_ 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition. However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as _Champions_, rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes.
