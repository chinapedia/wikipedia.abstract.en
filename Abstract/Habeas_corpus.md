_HABEAS CORPUS_ (; Medieval Latin meaning "[we, a Court, command] THAT YOU HAVE THE BODY [of the detainee brought before us]")[1] is a recourse in law through which a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.[2]
