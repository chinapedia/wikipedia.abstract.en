The EPISTLE OF PAUL TO TITUS, usually referred to simply as TITUS, is one of the three Pastoral Epistles (along with 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy) in the New Testament, historically attributed to Paul the Apostle. It is addressed to Saint Titus and describes the requirements and duties of elders and bishops.[1]
