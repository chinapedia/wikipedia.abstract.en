JUNGLE JUSTICE or MOB JUSTICE is a form of public extrajudicial killings in Sub-Saharan Africa, most notably Nigeria and Cameroon, where an alleged criminal is humiliated, beaten or summarily executed by a crowd or vigilantes.[1][2][3] Treatments can vary from a "muddy treatment", where the perceived perpetrator is made to roll in mud for hours[4] to severe beatings followed by necklacing. This form of street justice occurs where a dysfunctional and corrupt judiciary system and law enforcement have "lost all credibility. European principles of justice have likewise become discredited."[5][6]
