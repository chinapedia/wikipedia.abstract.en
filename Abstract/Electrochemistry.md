Faraday-Daniell.PNG (left) and physicist Michael Faraday (right), both credited as founders of electrochemistry today.]] ELECTROCHEMISTRY is the branch of physical chemistry that studies the relationship between electricity, as a measurable and quantitative phenomenon, and identifiable chemical change, with either electricity considered an outcome of a particular chemical change or vice versa. These reactions involve electric charges moving between electrodes and an electrolyte (or ionic species in a solution). Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change.
