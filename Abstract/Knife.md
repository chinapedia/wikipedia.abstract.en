Mankind's first tool, knives were used at least two-and-a-half million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools.[2][3] Originally made of rock, bone, flint, and obsidian, over the centuries, in step with improvements in metallurgy or manufacture, knife blades have been made from bronze, copper, iron, steel, ceramics, and titanium. Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin.
