SCORPIONS are predatory arachnids of the order SCORPIONES. They have eight legs[1] and are easily recognized by the pair of grasping pedipalps and the narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, ending with a venomous stinger. Scorpions range in size from 9 mm / 0.3 in. (_Typhlochactas mitchelli_) to 23 cm / 9 in. (_Heterometrus swammerdami_).[2]
