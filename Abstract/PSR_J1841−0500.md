PSR J1841−0500 is a pulsar located 22,800 light-years from the Sun in the Scutum–Centaurus Arm of the Milky Way. It was discovered in December 2008 by Fernando Camilo, who was using the Parkes Observatory when he discovered the object. At the time of discovery, it was spinning once every 0.9 seconds.[1] However, in 2009, it stopped emitting pulses completely.
