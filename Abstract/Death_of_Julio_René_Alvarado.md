JULIO RENÉ ALVARADO RUANO (2002?-20 April 2016) was a fourteen-year-old Guatemalan male that was killed in the Belize–Guatemala adjacency zone during an armed confrontation between the Belize Defence Force, Belizean park rangers and Guatemalan farmers.[1][2] The incident raised tensions between Belize and Guatemala, who have an ongoing border dispute since 1821.[3][4] Belizean officials maintain that the Belize Defence Force acted in self-defence.[5] However, the Guatemalan government claims the incident was a deliberate attack carried out by Belize's military.[6] After the incident, the Organisation of American States agreed to investigate the death of Julio Alvarado at the request of both countries.[7]
