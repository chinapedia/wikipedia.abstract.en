BAGONG LIPUNAN (), also known as MARCH OF THE NEW SOCIETY (), was a Filipino patriotic song during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. The lyrics were written by Levi Celerio and the music was composed by Felipe Padilla de Le√≥n in 1973.[1][2][3][4] The anthem is not to be confused with _Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Lipunan_, which is also known as _Hymn of the New Society_ (Filipino: _Awit ng Bagong Lipunan_) and was based from _Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas_.[5]
