MARY MAGDALENE, sometimes called simply the MAGDALENE or the MADELEINE, was a Jewish woman who, according to the four canonical gospels, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.[1] She is mentioned by name twelve times in the canonical gospels, more than most of the apostles. Mary's epithet _Magdalene_ most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala, a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.
