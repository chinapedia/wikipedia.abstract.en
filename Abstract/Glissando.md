In music, a GLISSANDO (; plural: _glissandi_, abbreviated _gliss._) is a glide from one pitch to another (). It is an Italianized musical term derived from the French _glisser_, "to glide". In some contexts, it is distinguished from the continuous portamento. Some colloquial equivalents are SLIDE, SWEEP (referring to the "discrete glissando" effects on guitar and harp, respectively), BEND, SMEAR, RIP (for a loud, violent gliss to the beginning of a note),[1] LIP (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one's embouchure on a wind instrument),[2] PLOP, or FALLING HAIL (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails).[3]
