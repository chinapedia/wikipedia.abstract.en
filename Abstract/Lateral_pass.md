US_Navy_031108-N-9593R-011_Navy_quarterback_Craig_Candeto_pitches_the_ball_out.jpg In American football and Canadian football, a LATERAL PASS or LATERAL (officially BACKWARD PASS in American football and ONSIDE PASS in Canadian football) occurs when the ball carrier throws the football to a teammate in a direction parallel to or away from the opponents' goal line. A lateral pass is distinguished from a forward pass, in which the ball is thrown forward, towards the opposition's end zone. In a lateral pass the ball is not advanced, but unlike a forward pass a lateral may be attempted from anywhere on the field by any player to any player at any time.
