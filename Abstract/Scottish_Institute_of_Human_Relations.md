THE SCOTTISH INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RELATIONS (SIHR) was an organisation founded in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1972, to promote a broader understanding of mental health and training in Talking therapies. Its origins go back to the practice of Dr W.R.D. Fairbairn, the Scottish psychoanalyst, and the return to Scotland in 1968 of Dr J. D. Sutherland, one-time medical director of the Tavistock Clinic in London.[1] Other founding contributors included T. Drummond Hunter, a senior NHS administrator, the educationalist Alan Harrow, the philanthropist Sheila Oppenheim, the Kirk minister and son-in-law of Lord Reith, Murray Leishman, and the psychiatrist, Dr J. Douglas Haldane.[2][3]
