DARNELL LAMONT BOONE (born January 21, 1980) is an American professional boxer. Despite having never challenged for a world title, Boone is notable for facing several future world champions over the course of his career, from middleweight to light heavyweight.[1][2] In 2004, he was the first to score a knockdown against undefeated Olympic gold medalist Andre Ward, who went on to win a unanimous decision over Boone.[3] In 2010, Boone caused a major upset when he knocked out future world champion Adonis Stevenson, who later gained revenge by knocking out Boone in 2013.[4] Boone also defeated Willie Monroe Jr. in 2011, who later challenged twice for a world title. Other world champions Boone has faced include Jean Pascal, Erislandy Lara, and Sergey Kovalev (twice).[5]
