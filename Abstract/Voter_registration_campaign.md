A VOTER REGISTRATION CAMPAIGN or VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE is an effort undertaken by government authorities, political parties, and other entities to register to vote all persons otherwise entitled to vote. In some countries, voter registration is automatic, and is carried out by the government, so there is no need for organized efforts to register voters. In many other countries the functions of electoral authorities includes endeavours to get as many people to register to vote as possible. In most jurisdictions, registration on the electoral roll is a prerequisite to a person being able to vote at elections.
