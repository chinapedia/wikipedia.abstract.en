RIGHT ASCENSION (abbreviated RA; symbol ) is the angular distance of a particular point measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the (hour circle of the) point above the earth in question.[1] When paired with declination, these astronomical coordinates specify the direction of a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system.
