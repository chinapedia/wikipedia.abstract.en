'''Distributed computing '''is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A _distributed system_ is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.[1] The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.[2] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.
