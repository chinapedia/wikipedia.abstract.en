The RANKINE SCALE () is an absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine, who proposed it in 1859. (The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848.)[1] It may be used in engineering systems where heat computations are done using degrees Fahrenheit.
