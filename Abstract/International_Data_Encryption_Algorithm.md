In cryptography, the INTERNATIONAL DATA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM (IDEA), originally called IMPROVED PROPOSED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (IPES), is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai and was first described in 1991. The algorithm was intended as a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard (DES). IDEA is a minor revision of an earlier cipher Proposed Encryption Standard (PES).
