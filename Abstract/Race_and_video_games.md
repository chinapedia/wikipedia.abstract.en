The relationship between RACE and VIDEO GAMES has received substantial academic and journalistic attention. Game theory, based on Johann Huizinga's _Homo Ludens_, argues that playing video games provides a way to learn about the world. Games offer opportunities for players to explore, practice, and re-enforce cultural and social identities. Video games predominantly created and played by one racial group can unintentionally perpetuate racial stereo-types and limit players' choices to preconceived notions of racial bias.[1]
