YAMATO YUKIHARA (大和雪原) was an Antarctic territory claimed by Japanese Army Lieutenant Shirase Nobu for Japan in 1912, spanning the entirety of the Ross Ice Shelf in what is now considered part of the New Zealand claim to Antarctic territory. This claim was reportedly not taken seriously by even the government of Japan, and quickly faded into historical and political oblivion after Shirase's return.[1]
