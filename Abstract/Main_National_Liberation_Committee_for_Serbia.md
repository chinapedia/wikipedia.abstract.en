The MAIN NATIONAL LIBERATION COMMITTEE FOR SERBIA[1] () was the body of the "National Liberation Movement" (the Yugoslav Communists and Yugoslav Partisans) in German-occupied Serbia, recognized within the movement as the civilian government in Serbia. It was established in October or November 1941, active during the Republic of Užice, a short-lived liberated territory in western Serbia in the second half of 1941, and in 1944–45 during the liberation of Yugoslavia.
