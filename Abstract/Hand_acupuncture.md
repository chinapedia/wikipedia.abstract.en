HAND ACUPUNCTURE, also known as _Koryo hand acupuncture_,[1] is a modern system of acupuncture, created by Yu Tae-u in the 1970s,[2] in which the hand represents the entire body and is needled or stimulated during treatment.[3] Hand acupuncture is popular among the general population as a form of self-medication in Korea, and has adherents in Japan and North America;[4] it is also popular among overseas Koreans.[5] Korean hand acupuncture is different from American hand reflexology, another form of alternative medicine.[6]
