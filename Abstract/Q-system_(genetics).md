Q-SYSTEM is a genetic tool that allows to express transgenes in a living organism.[1] Originally the Q-system was developed [2][3] for use in the vinegar fly _Drosophila melanogaster_, and was rapidly adapted for use in cultured mammalian cells,[4] zebrafish,[5] worms[6] and mosquitoes.[7] The Q-system utilizes genes from the _qa_ cluster[8] of the bread fungus _Neurospora crassa_, and consists of four components: the transcriptional activator (QF/QF2/QF2^(w)), the enhancer QUAS, the repressor QS, and the chemical de-repressor quinic acid. Similarly to GAL4/UAS[9] and LexA/LexAop,[10] the Q-system is a binary expression system that allows to express reporters or effectors (e.g. fluorescent proteins, ion channels, toxins and other genes) in a defined subpopulation of cells with the purpose of visualising these cells or altering their function. In addition, GAL4/UAS, LexA/LexAop and the Q-system function independently of each other and can be used simultaneously to achieve a desired pattern of reporter expression, or to express several reporters in different subsets of cells.
