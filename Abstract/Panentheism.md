PANENTHEISM (meaning "all-in-God", from the Ancient Greek _pân_, "all", _en_, "in" and _Theós_, "God")[1] is the belief that the divine pervades and interpenetrates every part of the universe and also extends beyond space and time. The term was coined by the German philosopher Karl Krause in 1828 to distinguish the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed pantheism of Baruch Spinoza.[2] Unlike pantheism, which holds that the divine and the universe are identical,[3] panentheism maintains an ontological distinction between the divine and the non-divine and the significance of both.
