"DANCE WITH ME NOW!" (stylized as "DANCE WITH ME NOW!" in digital formats) is a song recorded and performed by Japanese musical unit E-girls. It was released by Rhythm Zone and Avex Music Creative Inc. on February 10, 2016 as a promotional single to their first greatest hits album, _E.G. Smile: E-girls Best_ (2016). The concept for the single was to emphasize a cooler, sexier and edgier image than their previous singles, which was then later developed and included onto the band's fourth studio and concept album, _E.G. Crazy_ (2017).
