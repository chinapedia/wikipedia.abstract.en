CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, also known as the DEATH PENALTY, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is killed by the state as a punishment for a crime. The sentence that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a DEATH SENTENCE, whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an EXECUTION. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as CAPITAL CRIMES, CAPITAL OFFENCES or CAPITAL FELONIES, and they commonly include extreme offences such as murder, mass murder, aggravated cases of rape or child sexual abuse, terrorism, treason, espionage, offences against the State, such as attempting to overthrow government, piracy, aircraft hijacking, drug trafficking, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and in some cases, the most serious acts of recidivism, but may include a wide range of offences depending on a country. Etymologically, the term _capital_ (lit. "of the head", derived via the Latin __ from __, "head") in this context alluded to execution by beheading.[1]
