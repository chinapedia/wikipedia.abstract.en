MARIO BEAUREGARD (born 1962)[1] is a Canadian cognitive neuroscientist who is affiliated with the University of Arizona's psychology department.[2] He is known for arguing that matter is not all that exists, writing that "Along with an increasing number of scientists, I believe vehemently that the materialist framework is not science."[3] For this reason, he contends that the mind and the brain are fundamentally separate entities.[4]
