ESTRATOS DE PUPUNAHUE is the name given to the sedimentary strata of Oligocene-Miocene age that crop out in Pupunahue and Mulp√∫n near Valdivia, Chile. Outside this locality Estratos de Pupunahue extends below the surface over a larger area. The thickness of the strata varies from a few meters to 530 meters. The strata were initially described by Henning Illies.[1] The strata are made up of conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone (Chilean Spanish: _fangolita_). The clast of the conglomerates are made up of metamorphic rock and the disposition of the conglomerates varies from clast-supported to matrix-supported. The sandstone and mudstone contain layers of lignite coal that exceed 30 cm in thickness.[2]
