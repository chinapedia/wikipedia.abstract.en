CONSUL (abbrev. _cos._; Latin plural _consules_) was the title of one of the two chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently also an important title under the Roman Empire. The title was used in other European city states through antiquity and the Middle Ages, then revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The related adjective is CONSULAR, from the Latin _consularis_.
