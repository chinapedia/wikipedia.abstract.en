Muonium.svg MUONIUM is an exotic atom made up of an antimuon and an electron,[1] which was discovered in 1960 by Vernon W. Hughes [2] and is given the chemical symbol Mu. During the muon's lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride (MuCl) or sodium muonide (NaMu).[3] Due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron, muonium () is more similar to atomic hydrogen () than positronium (). Its Bohr radius and ionization energy are within 0.5% of hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, and thus it can usefully be considered as an exotic light isotope of hydrogen.[4]
