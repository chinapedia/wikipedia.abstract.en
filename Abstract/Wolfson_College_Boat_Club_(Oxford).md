WOLFSON COLLEGE BOAT CLUB is rowing club for the members of both Wolfson College, Oxford and St Cross College, Oxford. The club has competed since 1969 and takes part in the collegiate competitions Torpids and Summer Eights.[1] Due to the membership being drawn from graduate colleges, the club races actively during the vacation periods at external races.[2] Both squads also participate in the annual head races in London on the tideway (HoRR, WEHoRR, and HOR4s).[3]
