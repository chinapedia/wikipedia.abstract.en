SOLIDARITY (, ; full name: INDEPENDENT SELF-GOVERNING LABOUR UNION "SOLIDARITY"—_Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy "Solidarność"_ ) is a Polish labour union that was founded on 17 September 1980 at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa.[1] It was the first trade union in a Warsaw Pact country that was not controlled by a communist party. Its membership peaked at 10 million members at its September 1981 Congress,[2][3] which constituted one third of the total working-age population of Poland.[4]
