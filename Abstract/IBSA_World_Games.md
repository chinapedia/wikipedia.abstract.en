The IBSA WORLD GAMES (formerly IBSA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS AND GAMES) or WORLD BLIND GAMES are an international multi-sport event, occurring every four years, organized by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA). The events enable blind and partially sighted athletes to compete in a number of sports.[1] The first event took place at Madrid, Spain in 1998.[2]
