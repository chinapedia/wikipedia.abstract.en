In 2001, as part of International Alert's _Women Building Peace_ campaign, the United Nations Development Fund for Women awarded a MILLENNIUM PEACE PRIZE FOR WOMEN.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The bronze prize was commissioned from American figurative sculptor Tim Holmes, who has created several such international awards.[7][8] The sculpture, entitled _ANIMA MUNDI_,[9][10] depicts a woman whose facial features combine elements of many races, reaching and striding forward, hand on heart.
