LAMIA, short for _Línea Aérea Mérida Internacional de Aviación_, was a Bolivian charter airline headquartered in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, as an Ecojet Airlines subsidiary. It had its origins in the failed Venezuelan airline of the same name. Founded in 2015, LaMia operated three Avro RJ85 aircraft as of November 2016. The airline received international attention when one of its aircraft crashed in November 2016, killing many members of Brazilian football club Chapecoense. In the aftermath, LaMia's air operator's certificate was suspended by the Bolivian civil aviation authority.
