DEAD DOG BEACH_,_ also known as SATO BEACH_,_ is located at Playa Lucia within the municipality of Yabucoa on Puerto Rico's south-eastern coast. The name "Dead Dog Beach" is attributed to this spot because it is known as the dumping spot for a large number of stray animals, mainly dogs, which the inhabitants of Yabucoa can no longer afford to keep. Most of the dogs at Sato beach are not spayed or neutered. This lack of neutering allows the stray dogs to breed uncontrollably, which gives rise to more homeless dogs.
