APOLLONIUS (or APOLLONIOS, ; 3rd century BC) was the _dioiketes_ or chief finance minister of Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 283â€“246 B.C.). Little is known about his personal life; in ancient documents, he is called simply "Apollonius the _dioiketes_" without recording his home city or his father's name.[1] But a great amount of information has survived about his public role, in the archive of papyri kept by his assistant Zenon.
