(1766)]] _AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING_ is a book by the Scottish empiricist philosopher David Hume, published in English in 1748.[1] It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's _A Treatise of Human Nature_, published anonymously in London in 1739â€“40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the _Treatise_, which "fell dead-born from the press,"[2] as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.
