POPE MARCELLUS I (6 January 255 â€“ 16 January 309) was the Bishop of Rome or Pope from May or June 308 to his death in 309. He succeeded Pope Marcellinus after a considerable interval. Under Maxentius, he was banished from Rome in 309, on account of the tumult caused by the severity of the penances he had imposed on Christians who had lapsed under the recent persecution. He died the same year, being succeeded by Pope Eusebius.[1] His relics are under the altar of San Marcello al Corso in Rome. His third-class feast day is kept on January 16.
