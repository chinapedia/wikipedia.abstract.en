DYADOBACTER is a genus of gram negative rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the family Cytophagaceae in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Typical traits of the genus include yellow colony colour, positive flexirubin test and non-motile behaviours. They possess an anaerobic metabolism (oxidase positive), can utilise a broad range of carbon sources, and test positive for peroxide catalase activity. The type species is _Dyadobacter fermentans_, which was isolated from surface sterilised maize leaves, (apparently named after its ability to ferment glucose and fructose).[1]
