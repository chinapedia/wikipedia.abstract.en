The THOMAS E. CAVIN HOUSE is a historic building located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. Built in 1887, it is an unusual and well-preserved brick example of an eclectic combination of Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, and Queen Anne architectural elements.[1] Cavin owned a dry goods store nearby. He lived here until he died in 1911, and the house remained in the family until 1919. At some point it had been converted into apartments. The house was damaged in a fire in 1934, and had to be partially rebuilt, especially the roof. The front porch is not original.
