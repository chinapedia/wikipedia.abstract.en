_DAWKINS V. STATE_, 252 P.3d 214 (Okla. 2011), is a legal case involving limitations on the right to self-defense and stand your ground laws.[1] The court determined that stand your ground laws do not justify use of deadly force, if defendant is engaged in other unlawful activity at the time. The case involved a defendant with a right to lawfully protect where he stood, but who used an illegal weapon with deadly force to stand his ground.
