The AGRAM TRIAL or ZAGREB TRIAL (known as the "High treason trial" in Serbo-Croatian, _veleizdajnički proces_) was the trial of 53 Serbs in Austria-Hungary, who were accused of conspiracy to overthrow the state and place Croatia-Slavonia under Serbian rule. The Austro-Hungarian government had discredited the Croat-Serb Coalition and created an internal discussion accusing Serbs of massive conspiracy. The Pure Party of Rights, led by Josip Frank, participated in attacks on the accused Serbs (most supporters of the Serb Independent Party) and also the Croat-Serb Coalition, with government directives. Arrests were made during the Bosnian crisis, made to justify the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of the accused were held under bad circumstances, until the trial began in March 1909. The trial caused sensation across Europe, and was viewed as a blatant attempt to crush Serb minority politics in Croatia-Slavonia. Austria-Hungary pursued Trialism, which clashed with the popular Yugoslavism. Minister János Forgách forged documents against the accused Serbs. 31 were convicted and given 184 years in October 1909. The obvious bias and unreliable evidence led to the defendants' later release after appeal.
