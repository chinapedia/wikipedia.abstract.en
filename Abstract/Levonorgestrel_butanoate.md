LEVONORGESTREL BUTANOATE (LNG-B) (developmental code name HRP-002),[1][2] or LEVONORGESTREL 17Β-BUTANOATE, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group which was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as a long-acting injectable contraceptive.[3][4][5] It is the C17β butanoate ester of levonorgestrel, and acts as a prodrug of levonorgestrel in the body.[6] The drug is at or beyond the phase III stage of clinical development, but has not been marketed at this time.[7] It was first described in the literature, by the WHO, in 1983, and has been under investigation for potential clinical use since then.[8][9]
