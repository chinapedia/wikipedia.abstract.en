In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, the SIMPLE MODULES over a ring _R_ are the (left or right) modules over _R_ that are not zero and have no non-zero proper submodules. Equivalently, a module _M_ is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a non-zero element of _M_ equals _M_. Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory.
