_PLAYBOY_ is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine. It was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.[1] Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude[2] models (Playmates), _Playboy_ played an important role in the sexual revolution[3] and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), with a presence in nearly every medium.[4] In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of _Playboy_ are published worldwide.
