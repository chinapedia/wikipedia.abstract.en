Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations.svg of the Commonwealth of Nations]] The use of the English language in most member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations was inherited from British colonisation. Mozambique is an exception â€“ although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996. English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as Cyprus and Malaysia, it does not have official status, but is widely used as a lingua franca.
