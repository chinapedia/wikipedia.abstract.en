_APERTURE PHOTOMETRY TOOL_ (APT) is software with a graphical user interface for computing aperture photometry on astronomical imagery, which is a common research task in astronomy. Image overlays, graphical representations, statistics, models, options and controls for aperture-photometry calculations are brought together into a single package. The software also can be utilized as a FITS-image viewer. APT is executed on desktop and laptop computers, and is free of charge under a license that limits its use to astronomical research and education. The software may be downloaded from its official website, and requires the Java Virtual Machine to be installed on the user's computer.
