A VIRTUAL REALITY ROLLER COASTER is a special kind of amusement park ride attraction, consisting of a roller coaster facility or ride that can be experienced with virtual reality headsets.[1] The first publicly operated virtual reality roller coasters have been opened in late 2015.[2][3] Since then, several theme parks all over the world have been adapting this technology to extend their existing coaster facilities.[4][5]
