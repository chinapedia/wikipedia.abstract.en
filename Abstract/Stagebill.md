_STAGEBILL_ was a monthly U.S. magazine for theatregoers. Most copies of the publication were printed for particular productions and distributed at the door as the show's program. It was launched as a direct rival to the highly successful monthly _Playbill_. But after five years of head-to-head tough competition with _Playbill_, _Stagebill_ became insolvent and was acquired by its rival who also kept the _Stagebill_ trademark.[1]
