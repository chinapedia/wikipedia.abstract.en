Batavia|and|Batavi (disambiguation){{!}}Batavi}} Funerary_Stela_Corporis_Custodes.jpg's _Corporis Custodes_, the imperial Germanic bodyguard. The bodyguard, Indus, was of the Batavian tribe.]] The BATAVI were an ancient Germanic tribe that lived around the modern Dutch Rhine delta in the area that the Romans called Batavia, from the second half of the first century BC to the third century AD. The name is also applied to several military units employed by the Romans that were originally raised among the Batavi. The tribal name, probably a derivation from _batawjō_ ("good island", from Germanic _bat-_ "good, excellent," which is also in the English "better," and _awjō_ "island, land near water"),[1] refers to the region's fertility, today known as the _fruitbasket of the Netherlands_ (the Betuwe).
