FLAHERTY HALL is the newest of the 31 Residence Halls on the campus of the University of Notre Dame and one of the 15 female dorms. It is located on Mod Quad, between Knott Hall and McCourtney Hall. Built in 2016 together with its twin dorm Dunne Hall, it was the first dorm built since Ryan Hall in 2009.[1][2] The coat of arms is taken form the Flaherty family, with the bears (the hall mascot) replacing the Flaherty dragons.
