JUSTIFICATION AND EXCUSE are different defenses in a criminal case.[1] Both defenses admit that the defendant committed an act proscribed by law.[2] The proscribed act has justification if the act had positive effects that outweigh its negative effects, or is not wrong or blameworthy.[3] The proscribed act is excused if the defendant's violation was not entirely voluntary, such as if they acted under duress or under a false belief.[4] _Martin v. Ohio_ (1986) established that states may make justification an affirmative defense, placing the burden of proof on defendant.[5] _Patterson v. New York_ (1977) established that states may make excuses, such as involving mental state, an affirmative defense, rather than part of the mens rea element the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.[6]
