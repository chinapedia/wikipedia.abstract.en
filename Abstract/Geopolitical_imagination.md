GEOPOLITICAL IMAGINATIONS are constructed views of the world that reflect the vision of a place’s, a country’s or a society’s role within world politics. [1] Geopolitical imaginations are constituted by shared assumptions and representations of power relations and conflicts in world politics within a certain geographical territory. [2] By critically analyzing how and why these imaginations are constructed, it is possible to reveal underlying power relations and to get a better understanding of various conflicts. Therefore, geopolitical imaginations are closely connected to the academic field of critical geopolitics. [3]
