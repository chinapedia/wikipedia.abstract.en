ROMUALD RAJS, _nom de guerre_ "Bury",[1] (30 November 1913 â€“ 30 December 1949) was a Polish soldier and anti-communist insurgent. Member of Home Army (AK) and National Military Union (NZW),[2] he was sentenced to death in a show trial held by the Polish communist government in 1949, charged with membership in delegalized NZW, and the 1946 killings of Polish Belarusians.[3] Rajs denied the charges of war crimes, and was executed in prison three months later. His death penalty was nullified by the Military Court of Warsaw in 1995, as a communist crime.[4]
