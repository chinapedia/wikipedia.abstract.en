REVEREND RICHARD ASLATT PEARCE (1855â€“1928) was the first deaf person to be ordained as an Anglican clergyman.[1][2][3] He was educated via the sign language of his era, he became Chaplain to the Deaf and Dumb, and he fulfilled this duty in the Southampton area for the rest of his life. In 1885 he was introduced to Queen Victoria, who then ordered the _Royal Commission on the Blind, the Deaf and Dumb and Others of the United Kingdom_, 1889.
