ICI-85966 (former tentative brand name STILBOSTAT), also known as DIETHYLSTILBESTROL (DES) BIS(DI(2-CHLOROETHYL)CARBAMATE), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen and cytostatic antineoplastic agent of the stilbestrol group and a nitrogen mustard ester of diethylstilbestrol (DES) which was developed for the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer but was never marketed (possibly due to the toxicity of DES).[1][2][3][4][5]
