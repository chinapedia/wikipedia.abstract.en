MUNAWAR SULTANA (1924â€“2007) (her name in all her films opening credits), also written as MUNAWWAR SULTANA,[1] was an Indian cinema actress, who acted in Hindi/Hindustani films. She is cited as one of the "popular" actresses of the late 1940s to early 1950s period, along with Noor Jehan, Swarnalata and Ragini.[2] Her specialty was playing a selfless woman, enduring the rough treatment meted by her husband and family, but who eventually "brought her erring husband back home".[3]
