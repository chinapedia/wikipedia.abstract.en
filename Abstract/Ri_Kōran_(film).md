is a two-part historical and biographical film portraying the turbulent life and times of legendary pan-Asian singer and actress Ri Koran. A tragic figure pitted into the limelight of fame by the unpredictable forces of history, Ri is caught between competing nationalisms and political conflicts, her life and career sculpted by the turbulence of war and global power shifts. Loosely based on Otaka's memoir _Ri Kouran wo Ikite: Watashi no Rirekisho,_ the two-episode film production was directed by Horikawa Tonko and starred Ueto Aya as Ri Koran, first broadcasting in Japan by TV Tokyo on February 11 and 12, 2007. Subtitled versions were subsequently made available online to pan-Asian audiences on major Asian video sharing platforms.
