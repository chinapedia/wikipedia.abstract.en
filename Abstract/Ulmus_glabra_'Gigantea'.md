The Wych Elm cultivar _ULMUS GLABRA_ 'GIGANTEA' was listed as _U. montana_ var. _gigantea_ Hort. by Kirchner (1864).[1] An _U. montana gigantea_ was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s. It did not appear in Späth's 1903 catalogue.[2] A specimen at Kew was judged by Henry to be "not distinct enough to deserve a special name".[3] Both Späth and the Hesse Nursery of Weener, Germany, supplied it in the 1930s.[4][5]
