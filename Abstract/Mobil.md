Mobil_Gas_Station.jpg, Saugus, Massachusetts - night view]] MOBIL, previously known as the SOCONY-VACUUM OIL COMPANY, is a major American oil company that merged with Exxon in 1999 to form a parent company called EXXONMOBIL. It was previously one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s until the 1970s. Today, Mobil continues as a major brand name within the combined company, as well as still being a gas station sometimes paired with its own store or On the Run. The former Mobil headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia, was used as ExxonMobil's downstream headquarters[1] until 2015 when ExxonMobil consolidated employees into a new corporate campus in Spring, Texas.[2]
