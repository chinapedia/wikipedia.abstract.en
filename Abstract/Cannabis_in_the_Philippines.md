The cultivation and use of CANNABIS in the PHILIPPINES is illegal under Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.[1][2] As the Philippines is a signatory to the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,[3] Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which limits its use to medical and scientific purposes. Marijuana is the second most used drug in the Philippines, after _shabu_ (methamphetamine), and most cultivation in the country is for local consumption. Cannabis is cultivated mostly in the remote, mountainous regions of Luzon and Mindanao[4]
