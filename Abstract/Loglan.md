LOGLAN is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapirâ€“Whorf Hypothesis. The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. In 1960 _Scientific American_ published an article introducing the language.[1] Loglan is the first among, and the main inspiration for, the languages known as logical languages, which also includes Lojban.
