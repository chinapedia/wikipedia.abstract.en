PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA ( _Prokópios ho Kaisareús_; ; ) was a prominent late antique Byzantine Greek scholar from Palaestina Prima. Accompanying the Byzantine general Belisarius in Emperor Justinian's wars, Procopius became the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, writing the _History of the Wars_, the _Buildings_, and the _Secret History_. He is commonly classified as the last major historian of the ancient Western world.
