MARY CATHERINE CHASE (religious, SISTER MARY FRANCIS DE SALES, of the Sisters of the Visitation; pen names, WINNIE ROVER and F. M. EDSELAS; 1835 â€“ c. 1905) was a 19th-century American Catholic nun and writer. A fervent Episcopalian for years, she was later influenced by a Catholic woman and entered an enclosed order. Starting in 1874, she wrote under the pen name "Winnie Rover", switching to "F. M. Edselas" in 1892, when she became a frequent contributor of reminiscences of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and other great writers.
