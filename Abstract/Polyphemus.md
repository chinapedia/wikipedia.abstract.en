POLYPHEMUS (; _PolyphÄ“mos_) is the one-eyed giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology, one of the Cyclopes described in Homer's _Odyssey_. His name means "abounding in songs and legends".[1] Polyphemus first appears as a savage man-eating giant in the ninth book of the _Odyssey_. Some later Classical writers link his name with the nymph Galatea and present him in a different light.
