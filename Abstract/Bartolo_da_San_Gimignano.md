Blessed BARTOLO DA SAN GIMIGNANO (1228 â€“ 12 December 1300) - born BARTOLO BUONPEDONI - was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Third Order of Saint Francis.[1] Bartolo was born to nobles near Siena and fled home to become a priest to escape his father's wrath. He tended to poor people in the streets and used his income to provide alms to them and to alleviate their suffering while himself contracting a disease from working with the poor and succumbing to that same disease as a result.[2][3]
