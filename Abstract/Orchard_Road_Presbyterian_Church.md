The ORCHARD ROAD PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (ORPC), also known as GREJA KECHIL ("small church" in Malay) and the SCOTCH CHURCH, is a Presbyterian church in Singapore. The church was completed in 1878, and it is the oldest Presbyterian church in Singapore.[1] The church was founded to serve the Scottish community in Singapore, but now caters to a congregation of a widely different background and holds services in a number of different languages.[2][3]
