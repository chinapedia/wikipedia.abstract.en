WINTER ICE CREAM ( or __ ) is a Hungarian confectionary similar in appearance to ice cream in a cone, but traditionally having ganache or a similar kind of sweet cream filling with usually a chocolate-cocoa flavoring.[1][2] It gained popularity in the 1970s in communist Hungary,[3] being produced as a winter alternative to "summer" ice creams, which were deemed to be too cold for winter sweets.[4] Apart from grocery shops, it was frequently sold as part of the national railway's catering service (__).[5] The confectionary's popularity faded in the early 1990s, when, after the end of communism, foreign candy manufacturers and their products appeared on the Hungarian market.[6] However, along with some other snack foods and soft drinks of communist-era Hungary, winter ice cream garnered renewed interest in the late 2000s and 2010s.[7][8][9]
