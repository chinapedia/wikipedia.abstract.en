They are the highest part of Bohemian Massif. They stretch from the Saxon capital of Dresden in the northwest, to the Głubczyce plateau (_Płaskowyż Głubczycki_) in Poland and to the Ostrava Basin and Moravian Gate (_Moravská brána_) in the Czech Republic in the east. Geographically the Sudetes are a _Mittelgebirge_ with some characteristics proper of high mountains.[1] Its plateaus and subtle summit relief makes the Sudetes more akin to mountains of Northern Europe than to the Alps.[2]
