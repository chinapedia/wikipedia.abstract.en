FRA LUCA BARTOLOMEO DE PACIOLI (sometimes _Paccioli_ or _Paciolo_; 1447 â€“ 19 June 1517)[1] was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and an early contributor to the field now known as accounting. He is referred to as "The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping" in Europe and he was the second person to publish a work on the double-entry system of book-keeping on the continent.[2] He was also called LUCA DI BORGO after his birthplace, Borgo Sansepolcro, Tuscany.
