BEAVER BROOK is a former MBTA Commuter Rail station in Waltham, Massachusetts. It served the Fitchburg Line. It was located near Main Street east of the center of town, and was named after a nearby brook of the same name. It was closed in June 1978 along with Clematis Brook station on the Fitchburg Line and Winchester Highlands station on the Lowell Line. All three stops served only rush hour trains at the time of their closing.[1] The station building is no longer extant, but a short section of platform remains.
