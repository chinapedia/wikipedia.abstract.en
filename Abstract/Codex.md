Devil_codex_Gigas.jpg'', 13th century, Bohemia.]] A CODEX (from the Latin _caudex_, meaning "trunk of a tree", “block of wood” or “book”), plural CODICES (), is a book constructed of a number of sheets of paper, vellum, papyrus, or similar materials. The term is now usually only used of manuscript books, with hand-written contents,[1] but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world. The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a spine, which may just be thicker paper (paperback or softback), or with stiff boards, called a hardback, or in elaborate historical examples a treasure binding.
