The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at Pennsylvania State University, known as Detachment 720, provides undergraduate students the opportunity to earn a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force immediately upon graduation from Penn State. The Air Force ROTC program takes 3 to 4 years to complete. Students do not incur an obligation to the Air Force unless they have accepted a scholarship or have entered the Professional Officer Course. [1] [2]
