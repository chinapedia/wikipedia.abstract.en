The CAPE MOUNTED POLICE (originally CAPE POLICE) was the principal law enforcement agency of the Cape Colony during its last three decades. In addition to its ordinary policing duties, it was a para-military organisation, which saw active service in several campaigns and operations, including the Anglo-Boer War (1899â€“1902). The force was fully militarised in 1913 and transferred to the new South African Army as a mounted rifle regiment.
