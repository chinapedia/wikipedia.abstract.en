The BOOKER PRIZE FOR FICTION (formerly known as the BOOKER–MCCONNELL PRIZE (1969-2001) and the MAN BOOKER PRIZE (2002-2019)) is a literary prize awarded each year for the best original novel written in the English language and published in the United Kingdom. The winner of the Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.[1] From its inception, only novels written by Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014 it was widened to any English-language novel—a change which proved controversial.[2][3]
