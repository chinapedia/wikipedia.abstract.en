From the Buddhist perspective, the term Guanyin encompasses the entire spectrum of Mahayana Buddhist practices related to Avalokitesvara ranging from the Lotus Sutra and extending towards Shingon as well as Tibetan Vajrayana. It also includes localized practices different from other regions; localizations are however found throughout the Buddhist world. Guanyin also refers to the bodhisattva as adopted by other Eastern religions such as Taoism, where she is revered as an immortal, as well as Chinese folk religions, Japanese Shinto, Korean blending of Guanyin worship with native beliefs and in Vietnam the adoption of Guanyin by Cao Daism. In western languages, she was first given the appellation of "GODDESS OF MERCY" or the MERCY GODDESS by Jesuit missionaries in China.[2] The Chinese name Guanyin, is short for GUANSHIYIN, which means "[The One Who] Perceives the Sounds of the World".[3]
