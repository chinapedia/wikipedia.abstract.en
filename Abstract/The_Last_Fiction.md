_THE LAST FICTION_ is an animated film adaptation of the story of "Zahhak", a page from the historical identity of Iranians and one of the central tales of _Shahnameh_ by Ferdowsi. Ashkan Rahgozar is the director of _The Last Fiction_.[1] The main idea of the recounting of this tale is to lend a different perspective to the legends and heroes of ancient Iranians. Production started in 2010, and since then over 100 animators have worked on the film.[2]
