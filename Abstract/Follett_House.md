The FOLLETT HOUSE is a historic house at 63 College Street in Burlington, Vermont. Built in 1840 for a prominent local businessman, it is the last surviving grand 19th-century lakeside mansion in the city, and one of the state's finest examples of Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[1] It has seen commercial and institutional uses since 1885.
