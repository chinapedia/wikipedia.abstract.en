TELLURIUM NITRIDE describes chemical compounds of Te containing N^(3−). Efforts have been made toward the binary nitrides but the results are inconclusive and it appears that such materials are unstable. Still unconfirmed is Te₄N₄, which would be an analogue of Se₄N₄ and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S₄N₄). It has long been known that ammonia reacts with tellurium tetrachloride, which is similar to the method of synthesis of S₄N₄.[1][2] The reaction of TeCl₄ with a THF solution of N(SiMe₃)₃ gives a well-defined tellurium nitride [Te₆N₈(TeCl₂)₄(THF)₄].[3]
