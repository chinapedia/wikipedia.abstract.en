Gr√®s_chinois_Guimet_231102.jpg YAOZHOU WARE () is a type of celadon or greenware in Chinese pottery, which was at its height during the Northern Song dynasty. It is the largest and typically the best of the wares in the group of NORTHERN CELADON wares.[1] It is especially famous for the rich effects achieved by decoration in shallow carving under a green celadon glaze which sinks into the depressions of the carving giving contrasts of light and dark shades.[2]
