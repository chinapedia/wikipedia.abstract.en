FIRST CHURCH UCC (or “First Church,” or “First Church Sandwich,” or “First Church of Christ”) is a Congregational church in Sandwich Massachusetts founded in 1638 under Plymouth Colony Charter and the Mayflower Compact.[1] It is either the oldest church on Cape Cod or the second oldest depending on the interpretation. First Church boasts Mayflower Pilgrims and their first-generation descendants as charter members.[2] By Plymouth Colony Charter, a church was required as an official part of the governance of any newly founded township, and First Church was founded as the official church within the town of Sandwich.[3] First Church is now a congregation of the United Church of Christ, a large theologically and socially liberal denomination. The Church is Open and Affirming – an appellation signifying both openness to and active affirmation of all persons regardless of status (and including LGBTQI persons). First Church is well known to tourists because of the inclusion of its current steeple on the cover of Elvis Presley's "How Great Thou Art" Gospel Album .
