POPER SCIENTIFIC STAND UP is the first Latin American stand-up comedy group that is engaged in the popularization of science. It is an independent continuation of an early 2015 initiative by Diego Golombek, which was made in conjunction with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Tecnopolis and TECtv.[1] The proposal was to invite university students and graduates of different science fields to participate in a Scientific Stand Up comedy course given by renowned humorist Diego Wainstein, for them to create monologues with scientific content. Using the Stand Up format as a resource, they speak about scientific topics to all age groups, whether they have previous knowledge or not, and they also talk about scientists as people and about the perception of science in society. The name "Poper" is a pun on the initials of _"Popularizaci√≥n Entre Risas"_ (Popularizing Among Laughter), and a tribute to Epistemologist Karl Popper.
