A MUD (; originally MULTI-USER DUNGEON, with later variants MULTI-USER DIMENSION and MULTI-USER DOMAIN) is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language.
