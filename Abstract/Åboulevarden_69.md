ÅBOULEVARDEN 69 or NY JYDSKE KJØBSTAD CREDITFORENING is a building in the city of Aarhus, Denmark, located in the Indre By neighborhood in the Midtbyen district on the street Åboulevarden. The building was constructed in 1910 for the credit union _Ny Jydske Kjøbstad Creditforening_ (New Jut Market Town Credit Union), a name which still adorns the facade of the building. The building has functioned as a financial institution since it was built and was owned by _Steen Mengel_ and rented to Danske Bank, who use it for their main Aarhus branch.[1]
