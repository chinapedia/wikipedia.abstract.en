The MEN'S COXED FOUR (M4+) competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas in Ventura County, California, United States. It was held from 30 July to 5 August and the dominant nations were missing from the event due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. The teams from the United States and New Zealand were regarded as favourites, but it was Great Britain that dominated the regatta, thus winning the nation's first rowing gold since the 1948 Summer Olympics, back then in front of their home crowd at the Henley Royal Regatta course. The 1984 event started Steve Redgrave's Olympic rowing success that would eventually see him win five Olympic gold medals.
