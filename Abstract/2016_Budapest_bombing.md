The SEPTEMBER 2016 BUDAPEST EXPLOSION occurred on 24 September 2016 when a young man detonated a nail bomb to kill two patrolling police officers. A policeman and a policewoman suffered injuries but survived the attack. After the incident the police chief in charge announced a full-scale investigation and promised to give 10 million HUF to the ones who report the perpetrator. According to Zsolt Moln√°r, the chairman of the National Security Commission of the Hungarian Parliament, the attack unlikely has anything to do with other terror-related incidents in 2016 in Europe.[1]
