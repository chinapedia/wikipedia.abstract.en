SCALES OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION are classification schemes of different sexual orientations. Definitions of the term _sexual orientation_ normally include two components: the "psychological" and the "behavioral" component, but the definitions of the two components vary between researchers and across time.[1] Those difficulties motivate researchers to define scales to measure and describe sexual orientation. Most sexual behavior and sexual orientation scales are motivated by the view that sexual orientation is a continuum. The Kinsey scale works from a continuum viewpoint and is the most prevalent sexual orientation scale.
