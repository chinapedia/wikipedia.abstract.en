HAEMOPHILIA is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding.[1][2] This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain.[3] Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery.[4] Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness.[5]
