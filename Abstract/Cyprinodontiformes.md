CYPRINODONTIFORMES is an order of ray-finned fish, comprising mostly small, freshwater fish.[1] Many popular aquarium fish, such as killifish and live-bearers, are included. They are closely related to the Atheriniformes and are occasionally included with them. A colloquial term for the order as a whole is TOOTHCARPS, though they are not actually close relatives of the true carps â€“ the latter belong to the superorder Ostariophysi, while the toothcarps are Acanthopterygii.
