LASSA FEVER, also known as LASSA HEMORRHAGIC FEVER (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus.[1] Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms.[2] When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains.[3] Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract.[4] The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.[5] Among those who survive about a quarter have hearing loss, which improves over time in about half.[6]
