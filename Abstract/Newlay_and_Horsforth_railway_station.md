NEWLAY AND HORSFORTH RAILWAY STATION, until 1889 and from 1961 called NEWLAY STATION, was a station on the route of the former Leeds and Bradford Railway (now part of the Airedale Line and the Wharfedale Line), located on the right bank of the River Aire and on the left bank of the Leeds and Liverpool canal between Horsforth in the north and Bramley in the south. It was accessed from Pollard Lane, which still crosses the railway on a bridge there, and served mainly the southern parts of Horsforth in West Yorkshire, England.
