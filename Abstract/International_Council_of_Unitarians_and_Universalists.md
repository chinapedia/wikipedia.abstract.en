The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF UNITARIANS AND UNIVERSALISTS (ICUU) is an umbrella organization founded in 1995 bringing together many Unitarian, Universalist, and Unitarian Universalist organizations. The size of the affiliated organizations varies widely. Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the Unitarian Universalist Association, has over 160,000 members[1] and is larger than all the other groups put together.
