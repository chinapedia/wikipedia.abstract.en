The RAQQA CAMPAIGN[1] (codenamed _OPERATION WRATH OF EUPHRATES_) was a military operation launched by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the Raqqa Governorate, with the goal of isolating and eventually capturing the Islamic State's capital city, Raqqa. The SDF also completed their other main goals and captured the Tabqa Dam, the nearby city of al-Thawrah,[2] and the Baath Dam further downstream.[3]
