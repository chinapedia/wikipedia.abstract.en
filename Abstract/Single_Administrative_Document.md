The SINGLE ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENT (SAD), also known as FORM C88 in the UK,[1] is the main customs form used in international trade to or from the European Union Customs Union. Traders and agents can use the SAD to assist with declaring import, export, transit and community status declarations in manual processing situations.
