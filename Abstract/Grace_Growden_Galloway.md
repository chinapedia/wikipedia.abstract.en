GRACE GROWDEN GALLOWAY (1727â€“1782) was the wife of loyalist Joseph Galloway. She nearly lost everything in the aftermath of the American Revolution. Grace Galloway's property was confiscated because of the political position of her husband.[1][2] This loss of property led to the loss of her social standing and pride.[3] Grace Galloway notably left a detailed diary documenting her daily life and her fight to regain her property.[4] This diary has been a strong source for historians to learn from and grasp what it was like to be a female loyalist. Galloway's diary provides a fresh perspective into a side of the Revolutionary War that was previously often omitted from history.
