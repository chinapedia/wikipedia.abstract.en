The PASSENGER PIGEON or WILD PIGEON (_Ectopistes migratorius_) is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America. Its common name is derived from the French word _passager_, meaning "passing by", due to the migratory habits of the species. The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics. The morphologically similar mourning dove (_Zenaida macroura_) was long thought to be its closest relative, and the two were at times confused, but genetic analysis has shown that the genus _Patagioenas_ is more closely related to it than the _Zenaida_ doves.
