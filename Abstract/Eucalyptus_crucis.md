_EUCALYPTUS CRUCIS_ is a species of mallee that is endemic in Western Australia. There are three subspecies, commonly known as SILVER MALLEE or SOUTHERN CROSS MALLEE, (subspecies _crucis_), NARROW-LEAVED SILVER MALLEE, (subsp. _lanceolata_) and PAYNES FIND MALLEE, (subsp. _praecipua_).[1][2] It has rough bark that is shed in curling flakes, more or less round, glaucous juvenile leaves, egg-shaped intermediate leaves and lance-shaped adult leaves. The type of bark and the proportion of juvenile, intermediate and adult leaves in the crown of mature plants varies with subspecies. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils, the flowers are whitish to pale yellow and the fruit is a conical to hemispherical capsule.
