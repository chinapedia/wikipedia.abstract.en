The MURRAY RIVER (or RIVER MURRAY[1]) (Ngarrindjeri: _Millewa_, Yorta Yorta: _Tongala_)[2] is Australia's longest river, at in length.[3] The Murray rises in the Australian Alps, draining the western side of Australia's highest mountains, and then meanders across Australia's inland plains, forming the border between the states of New South Wales and Victoria as it flows to the northwest into South Australia. It turns south at Morgan for its final , reaching the ocean at Lake Alexandrina.
