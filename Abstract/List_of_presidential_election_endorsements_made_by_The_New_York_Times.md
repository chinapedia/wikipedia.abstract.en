Since its founding in 1851, _The New York Times_ has endorsed a candidate for President of the United States for all but two presidential elections (1852 and 1856) in the paper's history. The first endorsement was in 1860 for Abraham Lincoln and the most recent one was for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Its first six endorsements were for Republicans, and it was not until 1884 that it backed its first Democrat, Grover Cleveland. Since then it has endorsed the Democratic candidate 26 times, the Republican six times (the last being Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956), and a third-party candidate once (in 1896).[1]
