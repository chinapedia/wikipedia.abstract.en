AACHEN (,[1][2] ; ), also known as BAD AACHEN ("Aachen Spa"), and in French and traditional English as AIX-LA-CHAPELLE, is a spa and border city[3] in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Aachen developed from a Roman settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Charlemagne,[4] and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans.[5]
