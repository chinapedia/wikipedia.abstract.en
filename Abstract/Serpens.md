SERPENS ("the Serpent", Greek ) is a constellation of the northern hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, SERPENS CAPUT (Serpent Head) to the west and SERPENS CAUDA (Serpent Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the "Serpent-Bearer". In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in _Serpens Caput_ and Nu Serpentis in _Serpens Cauda_.
