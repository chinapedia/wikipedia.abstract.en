PYRIDINE is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula C₅H₅N. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH−) replaced by a nitrogen atom. It is a highly flammable, weakly alkaline, water-soluble liquid with a distinctive, unpleasant fish-like smell. Pyridine is colorless, but older or impure samples can appear yellow. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and vitamins. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar. Today it is synthesized on the scale of about 20,000 tonnes per year worldwide.[1]
