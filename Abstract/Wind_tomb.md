A WIND TOMB (or SEANCE GRAVE, WIND GRAVE; Vietnamese "Mộ gió") is an empty tomb that does not contain a person's corpse. As with "wind graves", which are "land mounds" or rounded masses projected above the ground, wind tombs are typically made by families or loved ones to commemorate a person whose body cannot be found, such as those lost at sea or who have died in combat.[1]
