The General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony enacted a law in November 1646 providing, among other things,[1] for the capital punishment of male children that were disobedient to their parents.[2] Although death as a penalty was later removed and punishment for disobedient daughters was added, the law was not repealed until 1973.[3] Similar laws were enacted in Connecticut in 1650, Rhode Island in 1688, and New Hampshire in 1679.[4]
