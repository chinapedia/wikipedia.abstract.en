The BOWN MANUFACTURING COMPANY was established in 1862 in Birmingham by local machinist, William Bown, making a variety of patented mechanical parts. The name AEOLUS had been used as a trademark since 1877 and especially for cycle parts. A second-cousin took over the company when the founder died in 1900 and began making powered-cycles also under the AEOLUS brand. Production was interrupted by the First World War, after which motorcycles were marketed under the BOWN brand until 1924. The company was subsequently acquired by the Aberdale Cycle Company in the 1930s.
