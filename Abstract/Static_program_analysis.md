STATIC PROGRAM ANALYSIS is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is analysis performed on programs while they are executing.[1] In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.
