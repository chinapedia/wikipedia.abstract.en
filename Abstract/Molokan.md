A MOLOKAN ( or , "dairy-eater") is a member of various Spiritual Christian sects that evolved from Eastern Christianity in the East Slavic lands. Their traditions—especially dairy consumption during Christian fasts—did not conform to those of the Russian Orthodox Church, and they were regarded as heretics (_sektanty_). The term _Molokan_ is an exonym used by their Orthodox neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as SPIRITUAL CHRISTIANS (духовные христиане _dukhovnye khristiane_).
