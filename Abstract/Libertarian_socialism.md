LIBERTARIAN SOCIALISM (also known as SOCIALIST LIBERTARIANISM)[1] is a set of anti-authoritarian[2] political philosophies within the socialist movement which rejects the conception of socialism as a form where the state retains centralized control of the economy.[3] Libertarian socialism is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism[4][5] and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace,[6] instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace[7] and decentralized structures of political organization.[8][9][10]
