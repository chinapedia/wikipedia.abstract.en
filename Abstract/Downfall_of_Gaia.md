DOWNFALL OF GAIA are a German extreme metal band formed in 2008 by Dominik Goncalves dos Reis (vocals, guitar) and Anton Lisovoj (vocals, bass). Their current lineup is completed by drummer Michael Kadnar and guitarist Marco Mazzola. Transforming their initial crust punk sound with prominent black metal, doom metal, and post-rock influences, they have released five studio albums, the last four of them on Metal Blade Records.
