INTRINSIC LOCALIZATION is a method used in mobile laser scanning to recover the trajectory of the scanner, after, or during the measurement. Specifically, it is a way to recover the spatial coordinates and the rotation of the scanner without the use of any other sensors, i.e, extrinsic information. To function in practice, intrinsic localization relies on two things. First, a priori knowledge of the scanning instruments, and second, on sensor data overlap employing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods. The term was coined in.[1]
