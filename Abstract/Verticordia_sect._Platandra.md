_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _PLATANDRA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes two species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section resemble _V. pritzelii_ in section _Catocalypta_ but differ in they do not have tufts of hair on their sepals. The anthers are flattened and the hairs on the style are forked.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3]
