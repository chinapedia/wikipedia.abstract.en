_GUITARS FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS_ is the sixth solo studio album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in August 2014 by Cleopatra Records. In 2016, it received a Best Compilation Album nomination by the Independent Music Awards. All tracks were recorded at Tarquin's Jungle Room Studios in New Paltz (village), New York. Being moved by the lack of support for returning veterans through his life Tarquin decided to compose a heavy instrumental rock album as a way to show his appreciation to all veterans. So once again he enlisted top notch players to guest with him on the album, Billy Sheehan on _Black Hawk_, Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal and Reb Beach on _Taliban Terror_, Steve Morse on _Freedom_, Chris Poland on _Charlie Surfs_ and _Hunting_, Chuck Loeb on _Escape Kabul_, Hal Lindes on _Sand & Blood_, Gary Hoey on _5 Klicks To Hell_ and _Baghdad_, Alex De Rosso Dokken on _Broken Arrow_, and The Flyin' Ryan Brothers on _Surgical Strike_. The entire album was engineered, produced and composed by Tarquin especially for each one of the guest guitarists. Partial proceeds are donated to the Fisher House Foundation from sales.
