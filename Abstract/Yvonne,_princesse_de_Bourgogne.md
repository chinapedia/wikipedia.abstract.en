_YVONNE, PRINCESSE DE BOURGOGNE_ is a 2009 opera by Philippe Boesmans to a libretto by Swiss dramatist and director Luc Bondy based on the anti-conformist play _Iwona, księżniczka Burgunda_ by Witold Gombrowicz.[1] _Yvonne_ is the fourth in a series of operas with librettos by Luc Bondy, and the first of the four to be written in French not German. The libretto for Boesmans' subsequent French opera, _Au monde_ (2014), was provided by Joël Pommerat.
