_MAD_ (stylized as _MAD_) is an American humor magazine founded in 1952 by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines,[1] launched as a comic book before it became a magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1974 circulation peak.[2] From 1952 until 2018, _Mad_ published 550 regular issues, as well as hundreds of reprint "Specials", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. The magazine's numbering reverted to 1 with its June 2018 issue, coinciding with the magazine's headquarters move to the West Coast.
