The CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND COURT SERVICES ACT 2000 is a United Kingdom Act of Parliament that advances a number of agendas related to criminal justice. It instituted the National Probation Service as well as the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. The Act also makes the parents of persistent truants criminally liable and subject to a maximum penalty of three months in prison,[1][2] a legal change that led to the first imprisonment of parents in 2002.[3][4]
