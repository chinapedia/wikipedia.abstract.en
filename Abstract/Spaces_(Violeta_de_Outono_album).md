_SPACES_ is the seventh studio album by Brazilian psychedelic rock band Violeta de Outono, released on October 14, 2016 through Voiceprint Records. The band began work on the album circa June 2016,[1] but it wouldn't be officially announced until September 19, 2016, when they uploaded a short teaser on their official YouTube channel;[2] later on, a lyric video for the track "A Painter of the Mind" was uploaded on October 5, 2016.[3] The album is an homage of sorts to Swiss-German artist Paul Klee (1879â€“1940); it uses a sketch made by him as its cover art, and the lyrics to "A Painter of the Mind" consist of many excerpts of some of his poems.[4]
