A MULTIVIBRATOR is an electronic circuit used to implement a variety of simple two-state[1][2][3] devices such as relaxation oscillators, timers and flip-flops. It consists of two amplifying devices (transistors, vacuum tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors. The first multivibrator circuit, the astable multivibrator oscillator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch during World War I.[4][5] They called their circuit a "multivibrator" because its output waveform was rich in harmonics.[6]
