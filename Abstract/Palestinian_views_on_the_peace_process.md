PALESTINIAN VIEWS ON THE PEACE PROCESS with Israel are wide ranging. The goal that unites Palestinians is the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Some Palestinians want a two-state solution where the West Bank and the Gaza Strip form a distinct Palestinian state, whereas other Palestinians want a one-state solution (Palestinian or binational) with equal rights for all citizens whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews.[1] In this scenario, Palestinian refugees may be allowed to resettle the land they were forced to flee in the 1948 Palestinian exodus.[2] However, Anti-semitic sentiments in Palestinian society and in Palestinian militants have hindered the peace process.[3]
