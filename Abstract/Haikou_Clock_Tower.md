The HAIKOU CLOCK TOWER (海口钟楼, Zhōnglóu) is a clock tower located on the south side of the Haidian River, at the north end of the Bo'ai Road area, just west of the Renmin Bridge, in Haikou, Hainan, China.[1] It was originally built around 1928-1929, an initiative by then-trade union leader 周成梅.[2] During the Cultural Revolution it was partially destroyed. In 1987, it was rebuilt near its original site to make room for the new, wider road that runs along the river.[3] The present tower is similar to the original, but not an exact replica. It stands 27.3 metres high and is made of red brick in European Gothic style.
