NICOLAS CHAUVIN () is a legendary, possibly apocryphal French soldier and patriot who is supposed to have served in the First Army of the French Republic and subsequently in _La Grande Arm√©e_ of Napoleon. His name is the eponym of _chauvinism_, originally a term for excessive nationalistic fervor, but later used to refer to any form of bigotry or bias (e.g., male chauvinism).
