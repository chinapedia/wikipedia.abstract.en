The 2018 EUROPEAN KORFBALL B-CHAMPIONSHIP is held in the Netherlands from 13 to 21 October 2018. Matches are played in Drachten, Gorredijk, Heerenveen and Leeuwarden. It is the first edition where the European Korfball Championship is split into an A-Championship and a B-Championship, with the idea that a certain number of teams will relegate from the A-Championship to the B-Championship after each edition, and a certain number of teams from the B-Championship will be promoted. Whether this will be a direct promotion or relegation, or whether play-offs will need to be played, is yet to be determined. The tournament was originally scheduled to be played by eight teams, but following a late withdrawal by Turkey, only seven teams took part.
