The CHINESE ROOM ARGUMENT holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a "mind", "understanding" or "consciousness", regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave. The argument was first presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_ in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of the argument is a thought experiment known as the _Chinese room_.[1]
