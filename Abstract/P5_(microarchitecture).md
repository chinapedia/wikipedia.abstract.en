The first Pentium microprocessor was introduced by Intel on March 22, 1993.[1][2] Dubbed P5, its microarchitecture was the fifth generation for Intel, and the first superscalar IA-32 microarchitecture. As a direct extension of the 80486 architecture, it included dual integer pipelines, a faster floating-point unit, wider data bus, separate code and data caches and features for further reduced address calculation latency. In 1996, the _Pentium with MMX Technology_ (often simply referred to as _Pentium MMX_) was introduced with the same basic microarchitecture complemented with an MMX instruction set, larger caches, and some other enhancements.
