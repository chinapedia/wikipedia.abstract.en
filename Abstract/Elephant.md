ELEPHANTS are large mammals of the family Elephantidae in the order Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (_Loxodonta africana_), the African forest elephant (_L. cyclotis_), and the Asian elephant (_Elephas maximus_). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mastodons, anancids and stegodontids; Elephantidae itself also contains several now extinct groups, such as the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants.
