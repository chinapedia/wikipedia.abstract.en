VATNAJÖKULSVEGUR is an ancient highland trail linking southern to eastern Iceland across the highlands. The exact route is not known today but is believed to have been either through Vonarskarð pass, or by going to the north of Tungnafellsjökull and then by the western edge of Dyngjujökull across the Gæsavötn area. The lawyer Árni Oddsson (d. 1665) is said to have travelled with his documents this route on horseback in the summer of 1618 because it was the shortest way between Vopnafjörður and Alþingi at Þingvellir where he needed to defend his father bishop Oddur Einarsson. In the summer 1839 Björn Gunnlaugsson and pastor Siguður Gunnarsson travelled along Vatnajökulsvegur.[1]
