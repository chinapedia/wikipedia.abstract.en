SCHIJNPOORT is an underground station in the Antwerp premetro network. The station was named after the Schijnpoort gate, part of the Brialmont fortifications, which was demolished in 1970 when constructing the R1 ring road.[1] It was opened in 1996 as part of the northern premetro axis and was originally only served by tram route 3. Currently, it is also serviced by tram route 5 (since 2006),[2] tram route 6 (since 2007)[3] and tram route 2 (since 2012).[4]
