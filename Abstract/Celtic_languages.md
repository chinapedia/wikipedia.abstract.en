The CELTIC LANGUAGES ( , )[1] are a group of related languages descended from Proto-Celtic. They form a branch of the Indo-European language family.[2] The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707,[3] following Paul-Yves Pezron, who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.[4]
