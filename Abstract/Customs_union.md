A CUSTOMS UNION is generally defined as a type of trade bloc which is composed of a free trade area with a common external tariff.[1] Customs unions are established through trade pacts where the participant countries set up common external trade policy (in some cases they use different import quotas). Common competition policy is also helpful to avoid _competition deficiency_.[2]
