ROBERT DONATI (June 4, 1940 â€“ c. September 21, 1991), who went by BOBBY and was known by the nickname BOBBY D, was an American career criminal associated with the New England-based Patriarca crime family, along with his twin brother Richard ("Dicky"). His criminal history dates to 1958, when he was 17; he and his brothers were long believed to be part of the Angiulo Brothers' crew, with whom they carried out burglaries. On September 24, 1991, three days after he had last been seen alive leaving his house in the Boston suburb of Revere, his body, bound, beaten and stabbed, was found in the trunk of his Cadillac a short distance away.[1] The killing remains unsolved.
