KRISTIENE CLARKE is a documentary director, producer and academic. She is the first transgender filmmaker in the world to have created documentaries addressing the topic.[1][2] She has had extensive education and training in various forms of filming and production,[3] and over 70 flagship films to her name since she began directing and producing in 1988.[4] Her work contains themes of cultural, political and sexual diversity and documents the lives and adversity of a variety of people from contrasting backgrounds. Throughout her work she strives to challenge stereotypes and ensure individuals' sexuality and trans identity are not withheld from them.[5] She believes that analysing how the LGBT community is represented via media platforms such as books, TV and film can provide an insight into the contemporary values held within society.[6] Clarke states that there is a popular assumption that transgender individuals are part of a homogeneous group with identical values, and through her filmmaking she aims to unhinge this notion.[7]
