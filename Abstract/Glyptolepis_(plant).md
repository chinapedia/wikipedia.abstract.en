_GLYPTOLEPIS_ is an extinct morphogenus of female conifer cones from the Triassic. It was established in 1872 by the French botanist Wilhelm Philippe Schimper.[1][2][3] The morphogenus is characterized by having bract scale complexes with elongated seed scale stalks. The seed scales each contain two recurved ovules and are distinctively flattened with five or six lobes.[4][5][6] The name is derived from Ancient Greek γλυπτό (_glyptó_, "sculpture" or "carved") and λεπίς (_lepís_, "scale").
