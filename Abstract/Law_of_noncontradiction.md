In logic, the LAW OF NON-CONTRADICTION (LNC) (also known as the LAW OF CONTRADICTION, PRINCIPLE OF NON-CONTRADICTION (PNC), or the PRINCIPLE OF CONTRADICTION) states that contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, e. g. the two propositions "_A is B_" and "_A is not B_" are mutually exclusive. Formally this is expressed as the tautology ¬(p ∧ ¬p).
