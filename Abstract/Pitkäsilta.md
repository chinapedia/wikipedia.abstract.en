The PITKÄSILTA (, ) is a bridge in Helsinki, Finland, connecting the districts of Kruununhaka and Siltasaari. It was completed in 1912 by the design of the architect Runar Eklund. Pitkäsilta is one of the best known landmarks of Helsinki. The bridge's name comes from near the end of the 19th century, when the district of Siltasaari was still an island. Two bridges led to the island, and bridge in the spot of the current Pitkäsilta was longer.[1]
