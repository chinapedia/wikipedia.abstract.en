The CULTURE OF CANADA embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and social elements that are representative of Canada and Canadians. Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions, especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures.[1] Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated to form a Canadian cultural mosaic.[2][3] The population has also been influenced by American culture because of a shared language, proximity, television and migration between the two countries.[4][5]
