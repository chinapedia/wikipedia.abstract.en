LULUWA (also ACLIMA) according to some religious traditions was the oldest daughter of Adam and Eve, the twin sister of Cain and wife of Abel.[1] According to these traditions, she was the first female human who was born naturally.[2] According to Islamic and rabbinic tradition, a marriage between Luluwa and Abel was proposed and arranged by their father Adam. In order to commence contentment from Luluwa's twin brother, Adam (their father) suggested that a sacrifice be made, yet sacrifice was subsequently rejected by God.[3][4] The reason behind the commotion was that Cain viewed Luluwa as being aesthetically more attractive than Awan.[5]
