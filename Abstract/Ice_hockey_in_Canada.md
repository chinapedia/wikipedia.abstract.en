ICE HOCKEY IN CANADA dates back to the 19th century. The sport is very popular and played year-round and at every level.[1] Born of various influences from stick-and-ball games brought from the United Kingdom and indigenous games, the contemporary sport of ice hockey originated in Montreal. It is the official national winter sport of Canada[2] and is widely considered Canada's national pastime, with high levels of participation by children, men and women at various levels of competition.[3][4]
