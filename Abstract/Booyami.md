BOOYAMI INC. (also often referred by its brand names FINAGRAPH or BBC EASY) is a provider of automation tools and business intelligence software for small business accounting. The company was founded in 2011 by a former Microsoft employee James Walter and a former vice-president of Bank of America, Corey Ross.[1][2] The synergy produced BBC Easy and Finagraph â€” two technological solutions for small business that offer strategic financial intelligence and streamline obtaining business loans.[3] After Moody's acquisition of the stake in Booyami in May 2016, Booyami announced that it now intends to expand its Finagraph service to medium-size businesses.[4][5]
