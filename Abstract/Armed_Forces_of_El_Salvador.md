The ARMED FORCES OF EL SALVADOR () are the official governmental military forces of El Salvador. The Forces have three branches: the Salvadoran Army, the Air Force of El Salvador and the Navy of El Salvador. The Forces were founded in 1840 at the time of the dissolution of the United Provinces of Central America. Between 1978 and 1992, the Salvadoran armed forces fought a civil war against the _Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional_ (FMLN). The military is accused of committing massacres, killings, torture and abuses of human rights during this time.
