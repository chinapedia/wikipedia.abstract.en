The _DURRĀʿAH_ was a ceremonial robe worn by the Abbasid court from the time of caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775) until it was replaced by the shorter _qabāʾ_ in the mid-9th century. It was black, the official colour of the Abbasid dynasty, and was closed in the front by buttons. Its use as court dress for civilian and military officials—but not religious, who wore the _ṭaylasān_ instead—gave it great prestige.
