The LEHMAN-TUNNELL MANSION, also known as the TUNNELL HOUSE, is a Queen Anne style house in Laramie, Wyoming, built in 1891. The house was built by Frank Cook for merchant Edward Lehman and his wife Pauline. In 1919 the Lehmans sold the house to Edward's business partner Frank J. Terry, who defaulted on his loan. During a period of bank ownership the house served for a time as the Kappa Delta sorority house for the University of Wyoming. In 1940 the house was sold to Dr. H.E. Tunnell, a chiropractor, and his wife Ida. Dr. Tunnell died in 1966 and his widow sold the house in 1970.[1]
