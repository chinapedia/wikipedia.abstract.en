QUININE is a medication used to treat malaria and babesiosis.[1] This includes the treatment of malaria due to _Plasmodium falciparum_ that is resistant to chloroquine when artesunate is not available.[2][3] While used for restless legs syndrome, it is not recommended for this purpose due to the risk of side effects.[4] It can be taken by mouth or used intravenously.[5] Malaria resistance to quinine occurs in certain areas of the world.[6] Quinine is also the ingredient in tonic water that gives it its bitter taste.[7]
