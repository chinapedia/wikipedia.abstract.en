GYRO-STABILIZED CAMERA SYSTEMS use modern electronic position data to correct for movements of the platforms they are mounted on to enable a high degree of stabilization. The systems often use a multi-axis gyro stabilization to enable the use of zoom lenses and high definition capture, despite the high amounts of vibrations and movements in aircraft, helicopters or other vehicles. The applications range from security and military operations, law enforcement, ENG, sports broadcasting documentary, natural history, and feature film productions..[1]
