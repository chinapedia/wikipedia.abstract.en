PARALYSIS is a loss of muscle function for one or more muscles. Paralysis can be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage as well as motor. In the United States, roughly 1 in 50 people have been diagnosed with some form of permanent or transient paralysis.[1] The word comes from the Greek παράλυσις, "disabling of the nerves",[2] itself from παρά (_para_), "beside, by"[3] and λύσις (_lysis_), "making loose"[4]. A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called "palsy".[5][6]
