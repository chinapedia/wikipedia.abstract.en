AUTOMATIC MANUAL TRANSMISSION (AMT) is a type of automatic sequential manual transmission. Offered by Renault Group's Dacia under the "Easy-R" name, it is founded on electro-mechanical rather than hydraulic technology. The Easy-R automated transmission uses a traditional manual gearbox with an electronically controlled clutch; the gear shifts are automatic, and the need for a clutch pedal is eliminated.[1]
