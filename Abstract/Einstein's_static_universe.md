EINSTEIN'S STATIC UNIVERSE, also known as the EINSTEIN UNIVERSE or the EINSTEIN WORLD, is a relativistic model of the universe proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917.[1][2] Shortly after completing the general theory of relativity, Einstein applied his new theory of gravity to the universe as a whole. Assuming a universe that was static in time, and possessed of a uniform distribution of matter on the largest scales, Einstein was led to a finite, static University of spherical spatial curvature.
