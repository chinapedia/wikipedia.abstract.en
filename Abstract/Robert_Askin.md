SIR ROBERT WILLIAM ASKIN, GCMG (4 April 1907 â€“ 9 September 1981), was an Australian politician and the 32nd Premier of New South Wales from 1965 to 1975, the first representing the Liberal Party. He was born in 1907 as ROBIN WILLIAM ASKIN, but always disliked his first name and changed it by deed poll in 1971. Before being knighted in 1972, however, he was generally known as BOB ASKIN. Born in Sydney in 1907, Askin was educated at Sydney Technical High School. After serving as a bank officer and as a Sergeant in the Second World War, Askin joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the seat of Collaroy at the 1950 election.
