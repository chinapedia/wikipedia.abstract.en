_THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE_ is a theatre production produced by State Theatre Company South Australia and Frantic Assembly, directed by Geordie Brookman and Scott Graham. It was written by Andrew Bovell and features the music of Nils Frahm. The play is naturalistic but features a great use of non-naturalistic physical movement to emphasise the emotional connection between the characters - following the story of the Price Family and their problems.The play is set in Adelaide, Australia, which is where the play held its World Premiere in May 2016. It subsequently toured the United Kingdom twice.[1]
