SODIUM THIOPENTAL, also known as SODIUM PENTOTHAL (a trademark of Abbott Laboratories, THIOPENTAL, THIOPENTONE, or TRAPANAL (also a trademark), or FATAL-PLUS in veterinary euthanasia contexts, is a rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate general anesthetic. It is the thiobarbiturate analog of pentobarbital, and an analog of thiobarbital. Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines,[1] which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system, but was supplanted by propofol.[2] Despite this thiopental is still listed as an acceptable alternative to propofol, depending on local availability and cost of these agents.[3] It was previously the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States, but the U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped manufacturing the drug and the EU banned the export of the drug for this purpose.[4] Although thiopental abuse carries a dependency risk, its recreational use is rare.[5]
