Cape York}} CapeYork-Map-2014.png PIA21490capes.jpg CAPE YORK is a location on Mars, on the western rim of Endeavour crater.[1] The _Opportunity_ rover spent about two years exploring this portion of the rim in the early 2010s before moving south.[2] The CRISM instrument on the orbiting Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified clay smectites in an area of Cape York, and the rover was sent to explore this location.[3] MER-B _Opportunity_ spend its fifth Martian Winter at Greeley Haven at Cape York, and also took a panorama at that location.[4] MER-B spent 19 weeks stationed at Greeley Haven surviving the winter and went on the move again in May 2012, to further explore Cape York.[5]
