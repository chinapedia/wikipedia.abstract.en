Massalia_large_coin_5th_1st_century_BCE.jpg inscribed with MASSA[LIA] (), dated 375-200 BC, during the Hellenistic period of Marseille, bearing the head of the Greek goddess Artemis on the obverse and a lion on the reverse]] Marseille, France was originally founded circa 600 BC as the Greek colony of Massalia and populated by settlers from Phocaea (modern Fo√ßa, Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek _polis_ in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul. The city-state allied with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar.
