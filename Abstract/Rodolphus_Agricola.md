Lucas_Cranach_d._Ä._045.jpg Rudolf_Agricola_1.jpg RODOLPHUS AGRICOLA (; August 28, 1443 or February 17, 1444[1] – October 27, 1485) was a pre-Erasmian humanist of the northern Low Countries, famous for his supple Latin and one of the first north of the Alps to know Greek well. Agricola was a Hebrew scholar towards the end of his life, an educator, musician and builder of a church organ, a poet in Latin as well as the vernacular, a diplomat and a sportsman of sorts (boxing). He is best known today as the author of _De inventione dialectica_, as the father of northern European humanism and as a zealous anti-scholastic in the late-fifteenth century.
