The ALLAM POWER CYCLE or ALLAM CYCLE is a process for converting fossil fuels into mechanical power, while capturing the generated carbon dioxide and water. It is an emission free natural gas fired power plant, where natural gas is used as fuel and instead of air uses pure oxygen eliminating emissions of nitrogen oxides; while a part of emitted carbon dioxide is recirculated in the system, the excess carbon dioxide is transferred for sequestration or other industrial uses. [1] The main inventor behind the process is English engineer Rodney John Allam.[2]
