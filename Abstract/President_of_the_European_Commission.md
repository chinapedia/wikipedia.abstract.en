The President of the Commission leads a cabinet of Commissioners, referred to as the _college_, collectively accountable to the European Parliament.

The college directs the Commission's civil service, sets the policy agenda and determines the legislative proposals it produces. (The Commission is the only body that can propose EU laws.)
