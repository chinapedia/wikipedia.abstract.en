NICOTINAMIDE (NAM), also known as NIACINAMIDE, is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication.[1][2][3] As a supplement, it is used by mouth to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency).[4] While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing.[5] As a cream, it is used to treat acne.[6]
