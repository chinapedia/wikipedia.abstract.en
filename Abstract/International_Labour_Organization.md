The INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (ILO) is a United Nations agency whose mandate is to advance social justice and promote decent work by setting international labour standards.[1] It was the first specialised agency of the UN. The ILO has 187 member states: 186 of the 193 UN member states plus the Cook Islands are members of the ILO. The tripartite structure is unique to the ILO where representatives from the government, employers and employees openly debate and create labour standards.
