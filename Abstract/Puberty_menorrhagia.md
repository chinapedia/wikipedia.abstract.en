Excessive menstruation between puberty and 19 years of age is called PUBERTY MENORRHAGIA. Excessive menstruation is defined as bleeding over 80 ml per menstrual period or lasting more than 7 days.[1] The most common cause for puberty menorrhagia is dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The other reasons are idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hypothyroidism, genital tuberculosis, polycystic ovarian disease, leukemia and coagulation disorders.[2] The most common physiological reason for puberty menorrhagia is the immaturity of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to inadequate positive feedback and sustained high estrogen levels. Most patients present with anemia due to excessive blood loss.
