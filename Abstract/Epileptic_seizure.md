A SEIZURE, formally known as an EPILEPTIC SEIZURE, is a period of symptoms due to abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.[1] Outward effects vary from uncontrolled shaking movements involving much of the body with loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizure), to shaking movements involving only part of the body with variable levels of consciousness (focal seizure), to a subtle momentary loss of awareness (absence seizure).[2] Most of the time these episodes last less than 2 minutes and it takes some time to return to normal.[3][4] Loss of bladder control may occur.[5]
