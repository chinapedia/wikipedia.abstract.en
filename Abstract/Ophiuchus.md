OPHIUCHUS () is a large constellation straddling the celestial equator. Its name is from the Greek _Ophioukhos_; "serpent-bearer", and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake (Unicode U+26CE). The serpent is represented by the constellation Serpens. Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It was formerly referred to as SERPENTARIUS and _Anguitenens_.
