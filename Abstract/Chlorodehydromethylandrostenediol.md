CHLORODEHYDROMETHYLANDROSTENEDIOL (CDMA), also known as 4-CHLORO-17Α-METHYLANDROST-1,4-DIENE-3Β,17Β-DIOL, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 4-androstenediol that was never marketed.[1] It was first encountered in 2005 when it was introduced as a "dietary supplement" and putative prohormone under the name HALODROL-50 by an online vendor called Gaspari Nutrition.[2][3] The drug was the subject of a scathing and highly critical article by the Washington Post in November 2006.[4] CDMA was voluntarily discontinued by Gaspari Nutrition in mid-2006, likely fearing government sanctions if it continued to sell the product.[5] During the brief period of time that CDMA was sold online, it was an extremely well-selling product; its total sales are estimated to have been in the tens of millions of dollars, and by some estimates, CDMA may have been the best-selling hormonal product ever sold "over-the-counter" (i.e., without a prescription) in the United States.[6]CDMA continued to be sold online until the 2014 prohormone ban as generic versions known as clones.
