_CATAN: CITIES & KNIGHTS_ (), formerly _The Cities and Knights of Catan_ is an expansion to the board game _The Settlers of Catan_ for three to four players (five to six player play is also possible with the _Settlers_ and _Cities & Knights_ five to six player extensions; two-player play is possible with the _Traders & Barbarians_ expansion). It contains features taken from _The Settlers of Catan_, with emphasis on city development and the use of knights, which are used as a method of attacking other players as well as helping opponents defend Catan against a common foe. _Cities & Knights_ can also be combined with the _Catan: Seafarers_ expansion or with Catan: Traders & Barbarians scenarios (again, five to six player play only possible with the applicable five to six player extension(s)).
