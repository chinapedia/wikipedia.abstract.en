EQUIANO (foaled 27 February 2005) is a French-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. A specialist sprinter, he began his racing career in Spain where he won two races as a two-year-old in 2007. He began his second season in France, winning the Listed Prix des Sorbiers before being sent to England where he recorded an upset victory in the Group One King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was then relocated to England but failed to win in 2009 before returning to his best form as a five-year-old in 2010. In that year he won the Abernant Stakes and the Palace House Stakes before winning the King's Stand Stakes for a second time. After his retirement from racing he became a breeding stallion and had had some success as a sire of winners.
