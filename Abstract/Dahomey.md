The KINGDOM OF DAHOMEY () was an African kingdom (located within the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, BÃ©hanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast.
