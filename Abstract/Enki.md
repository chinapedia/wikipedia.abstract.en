ENKI (; Sumerian: ) is the Sumerian god of water, knowledge (_gestú_), mischief, crafts (_gašam_), and creation (_nudimmud_), and one of the Anunnaki. He was later known as EA in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was associated with the southern band of constellations called _stars of Ea_, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, _the Field_ (Square of Pegasus).[1] Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for "40", occasionally referred to as his "sacred number".[2][3][4] The planet Mercury, associated with Babylonian _Nabu_ (the son of Marduk) was, in Sumerian times, identified with Enki.
