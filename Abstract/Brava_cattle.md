The BRAVA or RACE DE COMBAT is a French breed of domestic cattle raised in the Camargue, the delta of the Rhône in southern France. It is bred specifically for bull-fighting, either Spanish-style (on foot) or Portuguese-style (on horseback). It is one of two cattle breeds raised in semi-feral conditions in the Camargue: the other is the Raço di Biòu or Camargue breed, which is not a fighting breed but is used in a bloodless bull-sport, the _course camarguaise_. The Brava derives from Iberian fighting cattle imported in the nineteenth century, and may also be known as the ESPAGNOLE BRAVA.
