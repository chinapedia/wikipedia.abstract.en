TITUS LIVIUS (; ; 64 or 59 BCAD 12 or 17) – simply rendered as LIVY () in English – was a Roman historian. He wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people – _Ab Urbe Condita Libri_ (_Books from the Foundation of the City_) – covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own lifetime. He was on familiar terms with members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and even in friendship with Augustus,[1] whose young grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, he exhorted to take up the writing of history.[2]
