In linguistics, a COLLECTIVE NOUN refers to a collection of things taken as a whole. Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and _not_ specific to just one kind, such as the word "group", which is applied to "people" in phrase "a group of people", but is also applied to "dogs" in the phrase "a group of dogs". Some collective nouns _are specific_ to one kind, especially terms of venery, which identify specific groups of animals. For example, "pride" as a term of venery always refers to lions, never to dogs or cows. Other specific examples come from popular culture such as a group of owls, which is called a "parliament".[1][2]
