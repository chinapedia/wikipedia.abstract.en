_THE NEUROMANCER_ is the fourth studio album by William Control. Preceded by a lyric video for _Illuminator_, the album was released on April 4, 2014, through Control Records, and was produced and engineered by William Control. It was recorded at Control's own Hell's Half Acre studio in September/October 2013, mixed by Ryan O John, and mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side. All lyrics are by William Francis. The single _Revelator_ was also released in April, and accompanied by a video.[1] This was followed in May by a second single, _Price We Pay_.[2] The album had been scheduled for release in late 2013, but was delayed in order to make it 'the best it could possibly be'.[3]
