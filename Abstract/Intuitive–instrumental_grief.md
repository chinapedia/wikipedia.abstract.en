INTUITIVE GRIEF and INSTRUMENTAL GRIEF are two patterns of grieving styles identified by psychiatrists Terry Martin and Kenneth Doka. Intuitive and instrumental grief describes two ends of a grieving scale. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the intuitive grieving style are called intuitive grievers. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the instrumental grieving style are called instrumental grievers. Common qualities of intuitive grieving are: an internal experience characterized by extreme sadness and pain as well as an outward experience characterized by emotional expression (ex: tears).[1] Common qualities of instrumental grieving are: an internal experience characterized by mental separation from the loss as well as an outward experience characterized by lack of emotion. Identification of an individual’s particular style of grieving is important because an individual’s particular style of grieving helps in creating an adequate treatment plan to assist the individual in coping with his or her loss.[2]
