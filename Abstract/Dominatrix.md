Aristotle_and_Phyllis.jpg. Work from 1515.]] A DOMINATRIX (, plural DOMINATRICES ), is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (_pro-domme_) as the term _dominatrix_ is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.
