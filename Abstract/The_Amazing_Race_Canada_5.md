The FIFTH SEASON of _THE AMAZING RACE CANADA_ is a reality game show based on the American series _The Amazing Race_. It features teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship. The grand prize includes: a cash payout, a "once-in-a-lifetime" trip for two around the world, and a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox "True North Edition" for each.[1] For the fifth year in a row, Jon Montgomery returned as the host.
