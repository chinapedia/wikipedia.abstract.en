The LECLAIR AVENUE HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a small residential development on LeClair Avenue and North Street in Winooski, Vermont. Subdivided and developed by Francis LeClair, a prominent local businessman, the well-preserved working-class residences typify development of the period catering to the area's growing French-Canadian immigrant community. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.[1]
