HOMININAE, also called "AFRICAN HOMINIDS" or "AFRICAN APES", is a subfamily of Hominidae.[1][2] It includes two tribes, with their extant as well as extinct species: 1) the Hominini tribe (with the genus _Homo_ including modern humans and numerous extinct species; the subtribe Australopithecina, comprising at least two extinct genera; and the subtribe Panina, represented only by the genus _Pan_, which includes common chimpanzees and bonobos)â€•and 2) the Gorillini tribe (gorillas). Alternatively, the genus _Pan_ is sometimes considered to belong to its own third tribe, Panini. Homininae comprises all hominids that arose after orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) split from the line of great apes. The Homininae cladogram has three main branches, which lead to gorillas (through the tribe Gorillini), and to humans and chimpanzees via the tribe Hominini and subtribes Hominina and Panina (see the evolutionary tree below). There are two living species of Panina (chimpanzees and bonobos) and two living species of gorillas, but only one extant human species. Traces of hypothetical _Homo_ species, including _Homo floresiensis_ and _Homo denisova_, have been found with dates as recent as 40,000 years ago. Organisms in this subfamily are described as HOMININE or HOMININES (not to be confused with the terms hominins or hominini).
