Today’s Jamaican broadcasting, such as the cable television and radio, is governed by the Jamaica Broadcasting Commission (JBC).[1] JBC aims to regulate and monitor the media industry; more importantly, it runs with full power of the regulation making and the control of the programming’s standard and technical quality.[2] However, broadcasting regulation contains some very vague clauses, like Regulation 30(d) and Regulation 30(l)...[3] which causes more difficult for JBC of dealing with the related issues. CENSORSHIP IN JAMAICA has been reported extensively on the issues of dancehall culture, film, and street art. Broadcasting in Jamaica has been characterized by increased imported foreign media, mostly from United Kingdom or United States.[4]
