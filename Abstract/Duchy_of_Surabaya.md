The DUCHY OF SURABAYA (Indonesian and Javanese: __) was a Javanese principality centered in Surabaya, on the northeastern coast of Java (in today's East Java, Indonesia), that existed as an independent polity from to 1625. It became independent following the disintegration of the Demak Sultanate, and by the beginning of the 17thcentury had become the leading power in east Java and the most important port on Java's northeastern coast. Subsequently, it entered into decades of conflict with the Mataram Sultanate that ended in the victory of Mataram and the fall of Surabaya in 1625.
