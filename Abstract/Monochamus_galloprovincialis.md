The PINE SAWYER BEETLE (_MONOCHAMUS GALLOPROVINCIALIS_), also referred to as the BLACK PINE SAWYER BEETLE,[1] is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was described by Olivier in 1795, originally under the genus _Cerambyx_. It has a wide distribution, occurring naturally throughout Europe and the Caucasus. It has also been introduced into the Canary Islands. It serves as a vector for the parasitic nematode species _Bursaphelenchus xylophilus_, and also acts as a host to the parasitoid wasp species _Dolichomitus tuberculatus_.[2]
