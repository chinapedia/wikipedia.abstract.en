BIG BAD WOLF BOOKS (THE BIG BAD WOLF BOOK SALE or BBW BOOKS) is a Malaysian book fair frequently held in Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. The books were majorly taken from the stocks of BookXcess, a book store dealing in excess or remaindered books from international distributors. The Sale was the brainchild of BookXcess founders Andrew Yap and Jacqueline Ng. It was first held on 13â€“18 May 2009 for 5 days at Dataran Hamodal, Petaling Jaya.
