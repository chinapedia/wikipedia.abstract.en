LISP (historically LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.[1] Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.[2][3] Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Clojure, Common Lisp, and Scheme.
