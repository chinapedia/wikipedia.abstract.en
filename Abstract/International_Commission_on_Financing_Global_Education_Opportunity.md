EC-logos-3line-green-600.png THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON FINANCING GLOBAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY (also known as the Education Commission) was set up in 2015 to reinvigorate the case for investing in education and to chart a pathway for increasing investment, especially in low- and middle-income countries.[1] Chaired by United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the Commission presented its report, _The Learning Generation: Investing in Education for a Changing World_, to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on September 18, 2016. The report called for "the largest expansion of educational opportunity in history.”[2] The Secretary-General indicated that he will act on the Commission’s recommendations.
