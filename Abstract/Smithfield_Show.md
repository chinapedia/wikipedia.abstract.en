The SMITHFIELD SHOW, formerly the SMITHFIELD CLUB CATTLE SHOW and later the ROYAL SMITHFIELD SHOW, was an annual British agricultural show, organised by the Royal Smithfield Club. It was founded in 1799 and was first held at Wootton's Livery Stables in Dolphin Yard, Smithfield, London. From 1862 until 1938 it was held at the Agricultural Hall in Islington, London. From 1949 it was held at the Earl's Court Exhibition Centre in Earl's Court, London. The last show was held there in 2004; it was the last major livestock show in London.
