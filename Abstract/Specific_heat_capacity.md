The SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY of a substance is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the mass of the sample. Informally, it is the amount of energy that must be added, in the form of heat, to one unit of mass of the substance in order to cause an increase of one unit in its temperature. The SI unit of specific heat is joule per kelvin per kilogram, J/K/kg or J/(K kg).[1] [2] For example, at a temperature of , the heat required to raise the temperature of of water by (equivalent to ) is , meaning that the specific heat of water is .[3]
