_"SÓLO PIENSO EN TI"_ is a 1979 hit song sung and composed by Víctor Manuel.[1] The song was written in 1978, but was first released on the album _Soy un corazón tendido al sol_ in 1979, which was recorded in Milan with producer Danilo Vaona. The song reached the top of the charts and is considered by many to be his best song. In 2004 it was chosen as the 6th most popular song in Spanish on the TVE program _Nuestra mejor canción_.[2] In 2010 Rolling Stone placed the song 196 on its all-time 200 best songs of Spanish pop-rock.[3] Also in 2010 the Fundación Crisálida honoured Víctor Manuel, and Judith Colell filmed a documentary based on the song, also titled _Sólo pienso en ti_.[4][5]
