HONEY is a sweet, viscous food substance produced by bees and some related insects.[1] Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called a honeycomb.[2][3] The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus _Apis_) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.[4] Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture.
