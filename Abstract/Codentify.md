CODENTIFY is the name of a product serialization system developed and patented by Philip Morris International (PMI) for tobacco product authenticity verification and supply chain control. In the production process, each cigarette package is marked with a unique visible code (also called “Codentify”), that allows authenticating the code against a central server.[1][2]
