_CALADENIA CATENATA_, commonly known as WHITE CALADENIA, WHITE FINGERS and LADY'S FINGERS, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two white, sometimes pink flowers on a thin, sparsely-hairy stem. It is similar to _Caladenia carnea_ but lacks the red and white bars on the labellum of that species.
