ANNABELLE is a feminine given name of English origin, a combination of the Latin name Anna, which comes from the Hebrew word for grace, and the French word _belle_, meaning beauty.[1] Its creation was likely influenced by the name Amabel, a variant of Mabel. Additionally, within the Hispanophone, Annabelle, spelled Anabel, may serve as either a Spanish form of the name or as a contracted form of Ana Isabel.
