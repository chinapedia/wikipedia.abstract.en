Junior Enterprise USA is the association of Junior Enterprises in the United States. The international federations of Junior Enterprises in Europe and Brazil are well recognized internationally by the European Commission and Brazilian government as beneficial student organizations which provide experiential learning opportunities and foster a strong entrepreneurial spirit among junior entrepreneurs. However, the United States movement did not start to show a strong presence in the worldwide movement until the creation of JE USA. The first Junior Enterprise, CUBE Consulting, was founded in the United States in 2012 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and was followed by the establishment of other two during the period of 2012-2015. Only in 2016, along with the creation of Lumnus Consulting at UC San Diego, the unification of current student-run companies in the USA through the JE USA association was envisioned. By finding founders across the nation and spreading the JE concept, Junior Enterprise USA showed exceptional growth and successful creation of development programs that would support initiatives in its first months of operation. The number of Junior Enterprises and Junior Initiatives in the USA is now increasing exponentially, with chapters at UC Berkeley, Columbia University, UC San Diego, University of Pennsylvania, New York University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and others.[1]
