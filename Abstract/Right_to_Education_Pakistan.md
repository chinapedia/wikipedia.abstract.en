RIGHT TO EDUCATION PAKISTAN, also known as RTE PAKISTAN or simply RTE, is an advocacy campaign for equal education rights for all children in Pakistan.[1] The RTE campaign stems from low enrollment levels in Pakistani schools, and low literacy levels (especially among Pakistani females) depicted by the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER).[2] It functions under the _Citizens Movement for Quality Education_, an initiative by Idara-e-Taleem o Aagahi (ITA), or "The Centre of Education and Consciousness."[3]
