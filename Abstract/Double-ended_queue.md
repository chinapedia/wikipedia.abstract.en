In computer science, a DOUBLE-ENDED QUEUE (abbreviated to DEQUE) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).[1] It is also often called a HEAD-TAIL LINKED LIST, though properly this refers to a specific data structure _implementation_ of a deque (see below).
