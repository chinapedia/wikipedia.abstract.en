COLD AND HEAT ADAPTATIONS IN HUMANS are a part of the broad adaptability of _Homo sapiens_. Adaptations in humans can be physiological, genetic, or cultural, which allow people to live in a wide variety of climates. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, acclimatization, and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.
