An AMYL ALCOHOL is any of 8 alcohols with the formula C₅H₁₂O.[1] A mixture of amyl alcohols (also called amyl alcohol) can be obtained from fusel alcohol. Amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in esterfication, by which is produced amyl acetate and other important products. The name _amyl alcohol_ without further specification applies to the normal (straight-chain) form, 1-pentanol.
