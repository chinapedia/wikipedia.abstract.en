MUKUL R. KUNDU (10 February 1930 â€“ 16 June 2010), was an Indian solar physicist, known best as a pioneer of radio observations of the Sun. Early in his career, he showed that the Sun's 10.7 centimetre radio flux is correlated with the level of ionisation in the Earth's ionosphere.[1] The 10.7cm flux is now used as a standard proxy for the level of magnetic activity on the Sun. He served on the editorial board of the journal _Solar Physics_ and was awarded the George Ellery Hale Prize in 2007.
