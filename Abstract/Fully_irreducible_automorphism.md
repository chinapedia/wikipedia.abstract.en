In the mathematical subject geometric group theory, a FULLY IRREDUCIBLE AUTOMORPHISM of the free group _F_(n)_ is an element of Out(_F_(n)_) which has no periodic conjugacy classes of proper free factors in _F_(n)_ (where _n_ > 1). Fully irreducible automorphisms are also referred to as "irreducible with irreducible powers" or "iwip" automorphisms. The notion of being fully irreducible provides a key Out(_F_(n)_) counterpart of the notion of a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group of a finite type surface. Fully irreducibles play an important role in the study of structural properties of individual elements and of subgroups of Out(_F_(n)_).
