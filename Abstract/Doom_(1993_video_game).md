_DOOM_ (typeset as _DOOM_ in official documents and stylized as _DOOM_ in other media)[1] is a 1993 first-person shooter (FPS) video game developed by id Software for MS-DOS. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history for having helped to pioneer, along with the 1992 game _Wolfenstein 3D_, the now-ubiquitous FPS gameplay type, and has been frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. _THE ULTIMATE DOOM_, an updated version featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.
