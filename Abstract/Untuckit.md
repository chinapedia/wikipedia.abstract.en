UNTUCKIT LLC (styled as "UNTUCKit" in branding materials) is an American casual men's apparel company established in 2011 and headquartered in New York City. The company focuses on selling casual shirts that are designed not to be tucked into pants, and thus are cut a bit shorter than typical men's dress shirts. The first Untuckit brick-and-mortar store was opened in September 2015, and the company now has 51 stores in various cities across the United States and Canada. Its flagship store is on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
