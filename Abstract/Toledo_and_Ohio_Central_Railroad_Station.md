The TOLEDO AND OHIO CENTRAL RAILROAD STATION is a former railroad station located west of downtown Columbus, Ohio, known for its "whimsical and unusual" architecture.[1] Built by the Toledo and Ohio Central Railroad in 1895, it served as a passenger station until 1930. It served as an office building for Volunteers of America for many years afterwards, and now serves as a meeting hall for a firefighters union. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
