KRAFTWERK (, "power station") is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered as innovators and pioneers of electronic music, they were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre.[1] The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, vocoders, and custom-made musical instruments. On commercially successful albums such as _Autobahn_ (1974), _Trans-Europe Express_ (1977), and _The Man-Machine_ (1978), Kraftwerk developed a self-described "robot pop" style[2] that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits.
