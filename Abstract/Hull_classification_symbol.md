The United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) use a HULL CLASSIFICATION SYMBOL (sometimes called HULL CODE or HULL NUMBER) to identify their ships by type and by individual ship within a type. The system is analogous to the pennant number system that the Royal Navy and other European and Commonwealth navies use.
