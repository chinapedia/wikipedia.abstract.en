The GIRAFFE (_Giraffa_) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, _Giraffa camelopardalis_, with nine subspecies. However the existance of up to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of _Giraffa_. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils.
