The SOUTH UNION STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a historic 19th-century residential neighborhood for the upper middle class in Burlington, Vermont. Developed along South Union Street between Main and Howard Streets, South Union grew between about 1835 and 1938 as a popular area for well-to-do yet middle class Burlingtonians, affording views of Lake Champlain to the west. The architecturally diverse district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]
