MESO-PAPILIONOIDEAE is a monophyletic clade of the flowering plant subfamily Faboideae (or Papilionoideae) that includes the majority of papilionoid legumes. This clade is consistently resolved in molecular phylogenies.[1][2][3][4][5] It contains many agronomically important genera, including _Arachis_ (peanut), _Cicer_ (chickpea), _Glycine_ (soybean), _Medicago_ (alfalfa), _Phaseolus_ (common bean), _Trifolium_ (clover), _Vicia_ (vetch), and _Vigna_ (mung bean).
