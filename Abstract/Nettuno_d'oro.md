The '''Golden Neptune '''(Italian: NETTUNO D'ORO) is a prize conferred by the City of Bologna, since 1974, to citizens, companies, associations and cultural institutions that have brought honour to the city, through their professional or public activity.[1] The prize, awarded by resolution of the municipal council of Bologna, is a reproduction of the statue of the Neptune fountain in Piazza Maggiore, a symbol of the city.
