The Persian term for RIDDLE is _CHĪSTĀN_ (), literally 'what is it?', a word that frequently occurs in the opening formulae of Persian riddles. However, the Arabic loan-word _lughaz_ is also used.[1] Traditional Persian rhetorical manuals almost always handle riddles, but Persian riddles have enjoyed little modern scholarly attention.[2] Yet in the assessment of A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, 'Persian literary riddles provide us with some of the most novel and intricate metaphors and images in Persian poetry'.[3]
