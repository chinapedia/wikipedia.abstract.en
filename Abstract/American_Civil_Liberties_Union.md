The AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION (ACLU) is a nonprofit organization[1][2] whose stated mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States."[3] Officially nonpartisan, the organization has been supported and criticized by liberal and conservative organizations alike.[4] The ACLU works through litigation and lobbying and it has over 1,200,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers civil liberties to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of _amicus curiae_ briefs expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.
