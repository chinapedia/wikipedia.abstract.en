'''Château de Druyes '''is a medieval castle located in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines in Yonne,  Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It was built in the 12th century[1] by the Counts of Nevers, and remained in their possession until the 18th century. It was as much a noble residence as it was a fortified castle. It was a frequented dwelling place of Peter II of Courtenay, the Emperor of Constantinople in the 13th century, and his daughter Matilda, Countess of Nevers, Auxerre and Tonnerre.
