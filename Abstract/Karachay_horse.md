The KARACHAY (Karach.-Balk. _Къарачай ат_) is a horse breed developed in the Northern Caucasus. It came from highland Karachay at the rise of Kuban. The Karachay is registered with number 9354442 (breeder № 1278)[1] in the official journal of The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation (Moscow 2016).[2] They are developed by crossing regional horses with eastern stallions.[3] Karachay horses are summered in rugged mountain country where there are large changes in temperature and humidity, and wintered in the foothill and plains with some hay feeding. These conditions made the Karachay horse strong-limbed and sturdy.[4]
