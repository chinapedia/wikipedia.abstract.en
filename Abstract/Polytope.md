Assorted_polygons.svg is a 2-dimensional polytope. Some polygons of different kinds: open (excluding its boundary), bounding circuit only (ignoring its interior), closed (both), and self-intersecting with varying densities of different regions.]] In elementary geometry, a POLYTOPE is a geometric object with "flat" sides. It is a generalization in any number of dimensions of the three-dimensional polyhedron. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions _n_ as an _n_-dimensional polytope or _N_-POLYTOPE. Flat sides mean that the sides of a (_k_+1)-polytope consist of _k_-polytopes that may have (_k_-1)-polytopes in common. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope.
