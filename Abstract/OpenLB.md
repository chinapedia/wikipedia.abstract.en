OPENLB is an object-oriented implementation of the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM). It is the first implementation of a generic platform for LBM programming, which is shared with the open source community (GPLv2).[1] The code is written in C++ and is used by application programmers as well as developers, with the ability to implement custom models[2] OpenLB supports complex data structures that allow simulations in complex geometries and parallel execution using MPI and OpenMP on high-performance computers. The source code uses the concepts of interfaces and templates, so that efficient, direct and intuitive implementations of the LBM become possible.[3] The efficiency and scalability has been checked and proved by code reviews.[4] A user manual and a source code documentation by DoxyGen are available on the project page.
