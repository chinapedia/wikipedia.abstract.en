DONNA BLACKMOND, Ph.D., (born April 19, 1958) is an American chemical engineer whose work focuses on prebiotic chemistry, specifically, the origin of enantiopurity (homochirality) and kinetics of asymmetric catalytic reactions. Notable works include the development of Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA), analysis of non-linear effects of catalyst enantiopurity, biological homochirality and amino acid behavior.[1] She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2013.
