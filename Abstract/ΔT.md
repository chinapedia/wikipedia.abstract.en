Delta_t.svg In precise timekeeping, Δ''T'' (DELTA _T_, DELTA-_T_, DELTA_T_, or D_T_) is a measure of the cumulative effect of the departure of the Earth's rotation period from the fixed-length day of atomic time.[1] Formally it is the time difference obtained by subtracting Universal Time (UT, defined by the Earth's rotation) from Terrestrial Time (TT, independent of the Earth's rotation): . The value of ΔT for the start of 1902 is approximately zero; for 2002 it is about 64 seconds. So the Earth's rotations over that century took about 64 seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time.
