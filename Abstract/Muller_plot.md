A MULLER PLOT, also known as Muller diagram, combines information about the succession of different OTUs (genotypes, phenotypes, species, ...) and information about dynamics of their abundances (populations or frequencies) over time. Muller plots may be used to visualize evolutionary dynamics.[1][2] They may be also employed in the study of diversity and its dynamics; that is, how diversity emerges and how changes over time.
