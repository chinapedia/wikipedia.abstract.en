SAINT BONIFACE (; 675[1] – 5 June 754 AD), born WINFRID (also spelled WINIFRED, WYNFRITH, WINFRITH or WYNFRYTH) in the Devon town of Crediton, England, was a leading figure in the Anglo-Saxon mission to the Germanic parts of the Frankish Empire during the 8th century. He organised significant foundations of the Catholic Church in Germany and was made archbishop of Mainz by Pope Gregory III. He was martyred in Frisia in 754, along with 52 others, and his remains were returned to Fulda, where they rest in a sarcophagus which became a site of pilgrimage. Boniface's life and death as well as his work became widely known, there being a wealth of material available—a number of _vitae_, especially the near-contemporary _Vita Bonifatii auctore Willibaldi_, legal documents, possibly some sermons, and above all his correspondence. He became the patron saint of Germania, known as the "APOSTLE OF THE GERMANS".
