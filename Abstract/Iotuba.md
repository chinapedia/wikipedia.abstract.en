_IOTUBA CHENGJIANGENSIS_ (sometimes mis-spelt _Lotuba_[1]) is a problematic Cambrian fossil with a U-shaped gut and tentacles, known from the Chengjiang biota. Originally interpreted as a phoronid marine animal, its affinity is currently disputed.[2] It, and the possibly-synonymous taxon _EOPHORONIS_, resemble the 'priapulid' _Louisella_.[3]
