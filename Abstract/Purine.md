PURINE is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound that consists of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. It is water-soluble. Purine also gives its name to the wider class of molecules, PURINES, which include substituted purines and their tautomers. They are the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycles in nature.[1]
