DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE (DHEA), also known as ANDROSTENOLONE, is an endogenous steroid hormone.[1] It is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in humans,[2] in whom it is produced in the adrenal glands,[3] the gonads, and the brain.[4] It functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids both in the gonads and in various other tissues.[5][6][7] However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors,[8] and acting as a neurosteroid and modulator of neurotrophic factor receptors.[9]
