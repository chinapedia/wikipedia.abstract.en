The UEFA A LICENCE is a coaching licence mandated by UEFA, the official governing body of European football. The licence is one level below the UEFA Pro Licence and allows holders to be head coaches of youth teams up to age 18, reserve teams (also known as 'B' teams) for top-flight clubs, and men's professional second-tier clubs.[1]
