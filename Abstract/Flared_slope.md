thumb, a landmark flared slope in Western Australia.]] A FLARED SLOPE is a landform consisting in a rock-wall with a smooth transition into a concavity at the foot zone. Flared slopes form due to weathering being more effective at the regolith or soil-covered base of rock walls. These landforms are common in granitic rocks but occur in other rock types as well,[1] such as ignimbrite.[2] Flared slopes are can be found in a variety of climates.[3]
