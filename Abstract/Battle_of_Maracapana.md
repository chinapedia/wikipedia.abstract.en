The BATTLE OF MARACAPANA (1567 or 1568) was an important military engagement between the Spanish conquistadors[1] and their allied indigenous people, and the coalition of Caribbean tribes who were led by Guaicaipuro and commanded by Chief Tiuna. The battle finished with the defeat of the Caribbean power in the Caracas Valley, Venezuela[2] where Spanish intentions for colonization had been held at bay for 7 years.[3]
