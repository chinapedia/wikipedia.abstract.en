In a dynamical system, BISTABILITY means the system has two stable equilibrium states.[1] Something that is BISTABLE can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to stored energy. An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a light switch. The switch lever is designed to rest in the "on" or "off" position, but not between the two. Bistable behavior can occur in mechanical linkages, electronic circuits, nonlinear optical systems, chemical reactions, and physiological and biological systems.
