Chromatische_toonladder.png An EQUAL TEMPERAMENT is a musical temperament, or a system of tuning, in which the frequency interval between every pair of adjacent notes has the same ratio. In other words, the ratios of the frequencies of any adjacent pair of notes is the same, and, as pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency,[1] equal perceived "distance" from every note to its nearest neighbor.
