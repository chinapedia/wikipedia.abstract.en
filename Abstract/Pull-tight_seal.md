Imgpsh_fullsize_(2).png A PULL-TIGHT SEAL (or PULL-UP SEAL) is a disposable tamper-evident seal which restricts access to closed objects for those who do not have access. The tightening seal is needed in cases where the use of more sophisticated security measures are impossible or impractical. The seal is not established for the physical protection of the object which is sealed, but for indicating attempts to interfere.
