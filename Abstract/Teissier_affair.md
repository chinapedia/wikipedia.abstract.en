Elizabeth_Teissier.jpg in 2009]] The TEISSIER AFFAIR was a controversy that occurred in France in 2001. French astrologer Ã‰lizabeth Teissier was awarded a Doctorate in Sociology by Paris Descartes University for a doctoral thesis in which she argued that astrology was being oppressed by science. Her work was contested by the scientific community within the context of the science wars, and compared to the Sokal hoax. Criticisms included the alleged failure to work within the field of sociology and also lacking the necessary scientific rigour for a doctoral thesis in any scientific field. The university and jury who awarded the degree were harshly criticised, though both they and Teissier had supporters and defenders.
