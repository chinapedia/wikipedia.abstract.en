UniCarb-DB[1] is a structural and mass spectrometric database used in glycomics. UniCarb-DB provides over 1000 LC-MS/MS spectra for _N_- and _O_-linked glycans released from glycoproteins that were manually annotated. Each entry contains reference to published work, information about structure, GlyToucan Accession Number, MS/MS fragmentation with complete peak lists, biological contexts and experimental metadata.[2] The database was created by a collaboration between University of Gothenburg and Macquarie University[3][4] and since November 2016 is hosted by Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics. The database is the first to implement the Minimum Information standard MIRAGE (Minimum Information Required About a Glycomics Experiment) for submission of glycomic MS/MS data into the database[5].
