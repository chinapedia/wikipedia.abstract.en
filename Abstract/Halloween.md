HALLOWEEN or HALLOWE'EN (a contraction of HALLOWS' EVEN or HALLOWS' EVENING),[1] also known as ALLHALLOWEEN,[2] ALL HALLOWS' EVE,[3] or ALL SAINTS' EVE,[4] is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide,[5] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.[6][7]
