The PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY (PA or PNA; __) is the interim self-government body established in 1994 following the Gazaâ€“Jericho Agreement to govern the Gaza Strip and Areas A and B of the West Bank,[1] as a consequence of the 1993 Oslo Accords.[2][3] Following elections in 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties, its authority had extended only in areas A and B of the West Bank. Since January 2013, the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority uses the name "State of Palestine" on official documents.[4][5][6]
