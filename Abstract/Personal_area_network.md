A PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (PAN) is a computer network for interconnecting devices centered on an individual person's workspace.[1] A PAN provides data transmission among devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and personal digital assistants. PANs can be used for communication among the personal devices themselves, or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet where one master device takes up the role as gateway. A PAN may be wireless or carried over wired interfaces such as USB.
