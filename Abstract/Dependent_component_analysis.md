DEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (DCA) is a blind signal separation (BSS) method and an extension of Independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is the separating of mixed signals to individual signals without knowing anything about source signals. DCA is used to separate mixed signals into individual sets of signals that are dependent on signals within their own set, without knowing anything about the original signals. DCA can be ICA if all sets of signals only contain a single signal within their own set.[1]
