Harbor_seal_with_skeleton_GS.jpg The SEALS, PHOCIDS or TRUE SEALS are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family PHOCIDAE . They are sometimes called CRAWLING SEALS to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals, are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates. The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.
