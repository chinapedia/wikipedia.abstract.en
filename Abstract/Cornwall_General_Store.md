The CORNWALL GENERAL STORE, also known as the LAVALLEY GENERAL STORE, was a historic commercial building at 2635 Vermont Route 30 in the center of Cornwall, Vermont. Built in 1880 and in retail use for more than half a century, it was a well-preserved example of a dwindling business type, the rural general store with attached residence, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.[1] Sold to the town for preservation in 2000, it was demolished about 2013.
