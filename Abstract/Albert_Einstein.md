ALBERT EINSTEIN ( ;[1] ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[2] who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][4] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[5][6] He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[7] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[8] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
