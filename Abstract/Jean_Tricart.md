JEAN TRICART (16 September 1920 – 6 May 2003) was a French geomorphologist. In 1948 he became professor at the University of Strasbourg where he remained for the rest of his career.[1] The Tricart's doctoral thesis dealt with the Paris Basin and resulted in a publication acclaimed in France.[2] He collaborated often with his friend André Cailleux.[3] Beginning in 1962 he and Callieux published a band of five works on the subject of geomorphology and climate, publishing the last one in 1974. The bulk of his works were published in French.[4]
