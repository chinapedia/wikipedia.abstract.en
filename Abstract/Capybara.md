The CAPYBARA (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is a mammal native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world. Also called CHIGÜIRE, CHIGÜIRO (in Colombia and Venezuela) and CARPINCHO, it is a member of the genus _Hydrochoerus_, of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara (_Hydrochoerus isthmius_). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the coypu. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species but it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin, which is used in the pharmaceutical trade.[1]
