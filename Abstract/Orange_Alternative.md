Krasnal-Wroclaw-ulSwidnicka.jpg.]] PL_Orange_Alternative_Warsaw.jpg]] The ORANGE ALTERNATIVE (Polish: _Pomarańczowa Alternatywa_) is a Polish anti-communist underground movement, started in Wrocław, a city in south-west Poland and led by Waldemar Fydrych (sometimes misspelled as Frydrych), commonly known as _Major (Commander of Festung Breslau)_ in the 1980s.[1] Its main purpose was to offer a wider group of citizens an alternative way of opposition against the authoritarian regime by means of a peaceful protest that used absurd and nonsensical elements.
