David_Deutsch.jpg with David Deutsch, proponent of invariant scientific explanations. _See ยง DNA example_ below.]] The SCIENTIFIC METHOD is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are _principles_ of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.[1][2][3]
