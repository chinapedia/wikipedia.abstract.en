POPE GREGORY IV (; died 25 January 844) was Bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from October 827 to his death in 844.[1] His pontificate was notable for the papacyâ€™s attempts to intervene in the quarrels between the emperor Louis the Pious and his sons. It also saw the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in 843.
