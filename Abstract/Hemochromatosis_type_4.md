HEMOCHROMATOSIS TYPE 4, is a hereditary iron overload disorder that affects ferroportin, an iron transport protein needed to export iron from cells into circulation.[1] Although the disease is rare, it is found throughout the world and affects people from various ethnic groups. While the majority of individuals with type 4 hemochromatosis have a relatively mild form of the disease, some affected individuals have a more severe form. As the disease progresses, iron may accumulate in the tissues of affected individuals over time, potentially resulting in organ damage.[2]
