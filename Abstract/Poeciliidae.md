The POECILIIDAE are a family of freshwater fishes of the order Cyprinodontiformes, the tooth-carps, and include well-known live-bearing aquarium fish, such as the guppy, molly, platy, and swordtail. The original distribution of the family was the southeastern United States to north of RÃ­o de la Plata, Argentina, and Africa, including Madagascar. However, due to release of aquarium specimens and the widespread use of species of the genera _Poecilia_ and _Gambusia_ for mosquito control, poeciliids can today be found in all tropical and subtropical areas of the world. In addition, _Poecilia_ and _Gambusia_ specimens have been identified in hot springs pools as far north as Banff, Alberta.[1]
