ABUTSU-NI (1283) (Japanese: ; the _-ni_ suffix means "nun") was a Japanese poet and nun. She served as a lady-in-waiting to Princess Kuni-Naishinn≈ç, later known as Empress Ankamon-in.[1] In approximately 1250 she married fellow poet Fujiwara no Tameie. She had two children with him. Following his death in 1275, she became a nun. A dispute over her son's inheritance led her, in either 1277 or 1279, to travel from Kyoto to Kamakura in order to plead on her son's behalf.[2] Her account of this journey, told in poems and letters, was published as _Izayoi nikki_ (_Diary of the Waning Moon_ or _Journal of the Sixteenth-Night Moon_), her most well-known work.[3]
