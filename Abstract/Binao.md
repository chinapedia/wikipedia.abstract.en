Queen_Binao_1904.jpg BINAO (1867–1927) was a queen of the Sakalava people of Madagascar between 1881–1927. She was the granddaughter of King Andriantsoly of the Boina Kingdom, and acceded in 1881 to the throne of the Bemihisatra group of the Sakalava following the death of her mother, Safy Mozongo.[1] She controlled a relatively small territory on the north-western coast of Madagascar consisting of the island of Nosy Be and a stretch of the mainland coast opposite. During the early years of her reign she faced the challenge posed by the ambitions of the mainland's dominant power, the Merina Kingdom.[2]
