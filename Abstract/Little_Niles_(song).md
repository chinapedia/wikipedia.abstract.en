"LITTLE NILES" is a composition by jazz pianist Randy Weston written in waltz time that has become a jazz standard. It was first recorded in 1956 for his album _With These Hands..._, and was subsequently included in his 1958 album, also called _Little Niles_, which was inspired by his two then young children, Niles (later known as Azzedine) and Pamela.[1] Other Weston albums that feature the composition include _Tanjah_ (1973), _Niles Littlebig_ (1969), and _Monterey '66_. Lyrics to the song were composed by Jon Hendricks, recorded on the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross album _The Swingers!_ (1958).[2]
