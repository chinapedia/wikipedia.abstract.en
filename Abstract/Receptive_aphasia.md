WERNICKE'S APHASIA, also known as RECEPTIVE APHASIA,[1] SENSORY APHASIA, or POSTERIOR APHASIA, is a type of aphasia in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language.[2] Patients with Wernicke's aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities, and effortless speech output.[3] Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning. In most cases, motor deficits (i.e. hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke's aphasia.[4] Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. Wernicke's aphasia was named after Carl Wernicke who is credited with discovering the area of the brain responsible for language comprehension.[5] Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are typically unaware of their errors in speech and do not realize their speech may lack meaning.[6] They typically remain unaware of even their most profound language deficits.
