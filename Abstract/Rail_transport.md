RAIL TRANSPORT is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which is also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as TRAIN TRANSPORT. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) set in ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track. This is where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.
