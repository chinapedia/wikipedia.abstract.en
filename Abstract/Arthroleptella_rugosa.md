_ARTHROLEPTELLA RUGOSA_ is a species of frog in the family Pyxicephalidae. It is endemic to South Africa and only known from the Klein Swartberg Mountain,[1][2] an inselberg near Caledon, Western Cape.[3] The specific name _rugosa_ is Latin for _wrinkled_ or _rough_ and refers to the rough appearance of this species (caused by distinct glandular tubercles ) as well as its rough sounding advertisement call. Accordingly, common name ROUGH MOSS FROG has been suggested for it.[4]
