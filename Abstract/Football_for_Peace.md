FOOTBALL FOR PEACE is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) with its headquarters in London and supported by the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace. It was co-founded internationally in 2013 by English-born Pakistani footballer Kashif Siddiqi and Chilean FIFA legend Elias Figueroa. The Movement uses soft power as a diplomatic tool to build resilient communities and to foster understanding.
