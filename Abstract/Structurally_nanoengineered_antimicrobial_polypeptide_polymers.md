STRUCTURALLY NANOENGINEERED ANTIMICROBIAL POLYPEPTIDE POLYMERS (SNAPPs) are a type of artificially designed synthetic antimicrobial peptide. The development of the polymers is potentially a treatment for bacterial diseases.[1] The research takes a novel approach to combating bacteria; rather than poisoning them as antibiotics do, SNAPPs and other antimicrobial peptides tear the bacteria apart.[2]
