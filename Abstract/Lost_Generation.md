The LOST GENERATION is the generation that came of age during World War I. "Lost" in this context also means "disoriented, wandering, directionless"—a recognition that there was great confusion and aimlessness among the war's survivors in the early post-war years."[1] The term is particularly used to refer to a group of artists,[2] and particularly American expatriate writers, living in Paris during the 1920s.[3][4] Gertrude Stein is credited with coining the term; it was subsequently popularized by Ernest Hemingway who used it in the epigraph for his 1926 novel _The Sun Also Rises_: "You are all a lost generation." The generation is described as the cohort born between 1883 and 1900. Since the death of Nabi Tajima (4 August 1900 – 21 April 2018),[5] this generation is extinct.
