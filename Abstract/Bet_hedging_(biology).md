Bonasa_umbellus_eggs_and_nest.JPG BIOLOGICAL BET HEDGING occurs when organisms suffer decreased fitness in their typical conditions in exchange for increased fitness in stressful conditions. Biological bet hedging was originally proposed to explain the observation of a seed bank, or a reservoir of ungerminated seeds in the soil.[1] For example, an annual plant's fitness is maximized for that year if all of its seeds germinate. However, if a drought occurs that kills germinated plants, but not ungerminated seeds, plants with seeds remaining in the seed bank will have a fitness advantage. Therefore, it can be advantageous for plants to "hedge their bets" in case of a drought by producing some seeds that germinate immediately and other seeds that lie dormant. Other examples of biological bet hedging include female multiple mating,[2] foraging behavior in bumble bees,[3] nutrient storage in rhizobia,[4] and bacterial persistence in the presence of antibiotics.[5]Evolution_of_bet_hedging.png
