AFONSO I[1] (; 1106 / 25 July 1109 / August 1109 / 11116 December 1185), nicknamed THE CONQUEROR (), THE FOUNDER () or THE GREAT () by the Portuguese, and _El-Bortukali_ [in Arabic ] ("the Portuguese") and _Ibn-Arrink_ or _Ibn Arrik_ [in Arabic or ] ("son of Henry", "Henriques") by the Moors whom he fought, was the first King of Portugal. He achieved the independence of the southern part of the Kingdom of Galicia, the County of Portugal, from Galicia's overlord, the King of Le√≥n, in 1139, establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the _Reconquista_, an objective that he pursued until his death in 1185, after forty-six years of wars against the Moors.
