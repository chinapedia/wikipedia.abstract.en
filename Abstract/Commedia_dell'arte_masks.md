COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE MASKS are one of the biggest classifiers for each character. Every mask goes with a specific character based on the way it looks. Masks were originally all made of leather, but now more commonly made of neoprene. The Commedia masks must show emotion and intelligence as they are covering the face which is the main place emotion can be seen on someone. Masks should be an extension of an actor and their costume, hair and accessories.[1] A mask creates a completely different face for the person that is wearing it.[2] Mask, in Commedia dell'Arte speaks of the types of characters that each represents and includes all of the characters including the lovers. It is almost as speaking to the character rather than the masks, saying that they are a type that is unchanged.[3][4]
