The WILLIAM FREDERICK HOLMES HOUSE, also known as THEOSA, is a historic Queen Anne-style house in McComb, Mississippi. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[1] Theosa received her name from the present owner in the year 2000. The owner reports that after trying for several years to find a name to fit the old house, the owner finally found the name Theosa and thought it suited her very nicely.
