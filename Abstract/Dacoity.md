DACOITY is a term used for "banditry" in Bengali, Odia, Hindi, Kannada and Urdu. The spelling is the anglicized version of the Hindustani word, and as a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning, it appears in the _Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases_ (1903).[1] Banditry is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836â€“1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule. Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.
