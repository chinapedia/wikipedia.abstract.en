ERNST THEODOR AMADEUS HOFFMANN (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. HOFFMANN; born ERNST THEODOR WILHELM HOFFMANN; 24 January 177625 June 1822) was a German Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic and artist.[1][2][3] His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's opera _The Tales of Hoffmann_, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella _The Nutcracker and the Mouse King_, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet _The Nutcracker_ is based. The ballet _Copp√©lia_ is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's _Kreisleriana_ is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler.
