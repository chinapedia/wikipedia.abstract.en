Ensuring national security, increasing influence among its Arab neighbours, and securing the return of the Golan Heights, have been the primary goals of Syria's foreign policy.

Syria enjoyed an improvement in relations with several of the states in its region in the 21st century, prior to the Arab Spring and the Syrian Civil War.
