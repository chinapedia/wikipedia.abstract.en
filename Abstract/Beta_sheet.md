The Β-SHEET (also Β-PLEATED SHEET) is a common motif of regular secondary structure in proteins. Beta sheets consist of BETA STRANDS (also Β-STRAND) connected laterally by at least two or three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of β-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the amyloidoses such as Alzheimer's disease.
