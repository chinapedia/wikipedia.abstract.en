The CRO-HOOK, is a special double-ended crochet hook used to make double-sided crochet. It employs the use of a long double-ended hook, which permits the maker to work stitches on or off from either end.[1] Because the hook has two ends, two alternating colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged, working loops over the hook.[2][3] Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit. Cro-hook is a variation of Tunisian crochet and also shows similarities with the Afghan stitch used to make Afghan scarves, but the fabric is typically softer with greater elasticity.[4][5]
