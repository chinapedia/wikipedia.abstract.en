ISTVÁN GYŐRKÖS (born 20 November 1940) is a Hungarian far-right political figure and convicted murderer. He was the founder and leader of the Hungarist and neo-Nazi paramilitary movement Hungarian National Front (MNA) from 1989 to 2016. He had been a leading and prominent figue in Hungarian extremist and neo-Nazi politics in the 1990s.[1] In 1995, he proclaimed himself the sole leader of the Hungarist movement under the title _Vezető_ ("Leader"), a term similar to Duce (Italian) for Benito Mussolini, Führer (German) for Adolf Hitler and Nemzetvezető (Hungarian) for Ferenc Szálasi.[2]
