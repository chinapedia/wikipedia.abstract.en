ETIOCHOLANOLONE GLUCURONIDE (ETIO-G) is a endogenous, naturally occurring metabolite of testosterone.[1][2] It is formed in the liver from etiocholanolone by UDP-glucuronyltransferases.[3] ETIO-G has much higher water solubility than etiocholanolone and is eventually excreted in the urine via the kidneys.[4][5] Along with androsterone glucuronide, it is one of the major inactive metabolites of testosterone.[6][7]
