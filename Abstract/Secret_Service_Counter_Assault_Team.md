The COUNTER ASSAULT TEAM (CAT) is a specialized tactical unit of the U.S. Secret Service that provides tactical support to the Presidential Protective Division to protect the President of the United States.[1][2] This is in contrast to the Presidential Protective Division whose mission is to shield the president from an attack and to evacuate the president to a place of safety. The CAT can also provide tactical support to other designated protectees, at venues and National Special Security Events.[3][4]
