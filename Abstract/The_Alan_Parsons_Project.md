THE ALAN PARSONS PROJECT were a British rock band active between 1975 and 1990,[1] whose core membership consisted of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson. They were accompanied by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent band members such as guitarist Ian Bairnson, arranger Andrew Powell, bassist and vocalist David Paton, drummer Stuart Elliott, and vocalists Lenny Zakatek and Chris Rainbow. Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer. Almost all the songs on the Project's albums are credited to "Woolfson/Parsons". The Alan Parsons Project released eleven studio albums in its 15-year career (the twelfth, _The Sicilian Defence_ - which was originally recorded in 1979 - was released posthumously in 2014), and some of their most notable songs are "The Raven", "(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether", "I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You", "Games People Play", "Time", "Snake Eyes", "Eye in the Sky", "Old and Wise" and "Don't Answer Me".
