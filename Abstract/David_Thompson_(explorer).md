DAVID THOMPSON (30 April 1770 â€“ 10 February 1857) was a British-Canadian fur trader, surveyor, and cartographer, known to some native peoples as _Koo-Koo-Sint_ or "the Stargazer". Over Thompson's career, he traveled some across North America, mapping of North America along the way.[1] For this historic feat, Thompson has been described as the "greatest land geographer who ever lived."[2]
