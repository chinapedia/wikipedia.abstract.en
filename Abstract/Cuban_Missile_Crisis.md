The CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, also known as the OCTOBER CRISIS OF 1962 (), the CARIBBEAN CRISIS (), or the MISSILE SCARE, was a 13-day (October 16â€“28, 1962) confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union initiated by the American discovery of Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba. The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war.[1]
