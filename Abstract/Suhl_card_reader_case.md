THE SUHL CARD READER CASE deals with the 1956 verdict on Charlotte Marquardt (born 1902 in Berlin, died 1975 in Suhl, East Germany). A court in Eastern Germany had condemned Marquardt, an amateur psychic and cartomancy practitioner, to twelve years' imprisonment. The verdict referred to so called _Kriegs- und Boykotthetze_, incitement to war and boycott: Marquardt had provided favorable forecasts for families preparing to leave East Germany, and when arrested, was in possession of an astrological handbook including a horoscope with a positive outlook on Western Germany.
