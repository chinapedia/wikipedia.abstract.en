This is a LIST OF CHARACTERS APPEARING IN _THE SANDMAN_ comic book, published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. This page discusses not only events which occur in _The Sandman_ (1989–94), but also some occurring in spinoffs of _The Sandman_ (such as _The Dreaming_ (1996–2001) and _Lucifer_ (1999–2007)) and in earlier stories that _The Sandman_ was based on. These stories occur in the DC Universe, but are generally tangential to the mainstream DC stories.
