The CAPER CAT (or Caper Cat 14) is a 14Â ft sailing catamaran manufactured by Calypso Sailcraft in Brisbane, Australia.[1] While in many ways similar to other catamarans of its size (notably the Hobie Cat), a unique feature of the catamaran is its large storage capacity.[2] Each hull contains large storage bins that make it an ideal boat for camping and short island-to-island cruising trips.[3]
