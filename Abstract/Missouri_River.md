The MISSOURI RIVER is the longest river in North America.[1] Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for [2] before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles (1,300,000 km²), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi, the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer[3] and carries a comparable volume of water.[4][5] When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.[6]
