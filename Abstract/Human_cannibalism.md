Os_Filhos_de_Pindorama._Cannibalism_in_Brazil_in_1557.jpg to illustrate Hans Staden's account of his captivity in 1557]] HUMAN CANNIBALISM is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a CANNIBAL. The expression _cannibalism_ has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism. Some scholars have argued, however, that no firm evidence exists that cannibalism has ever been a socially acceptable practice anywhere in the world, at any time in history.[1]
