NumberSetinC.svgs of the complex numbers.]] A NUMBER is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth.[1] A written symbol like "5" that represents a number is called a numeral. A numeral system is an organized way to write and manipulate this type of symbol, for example the Hinduâ€“Arabic numeral system allows combinations of numerical digits like "5" and "0" to represent larger numbers like 50.[2] A numeral in linguistics can refer to a symbol like 5, the words or phrase that names a number, like "five hundred", or other words that mean a specific number, like "dozen". In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, _number_ may refer to a symbol, a word or phrase, or the mathematical object.
