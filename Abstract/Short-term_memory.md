'''Short-term memory ''' (or "PRIMARY" or "ACTIVE MEMORY") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. For example, short-term memory can be used to remember a phone number that has just been recited. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal or active maintenance is prevented) is believed to be in the order of seconds. The most commonly cited capacity is _The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two_ (which is frequently referred to as _Miller's Law_), despite the facts that Miller himself stated that the figure was intended as "little more than a joke" (Miller, 1989, page 401) and that Cowan (2001) provided evidence that a more realistic figure is 4Â±1 units. In contrast, long-term memory can hold the information indefinitely.
