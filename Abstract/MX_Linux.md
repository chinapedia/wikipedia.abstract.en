MX LINUX is a midweight Linux operating system based on Debian stable and using core antiX components, with additional software created or packaged by the MX community.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] It is developed as a cooperative venture between the antiX and former MEPIS communities, aiming to use the best tools and talents from each of these distributions. The community's stated goal is to "combine an elegant and efficient desktop with simple configuration, high stability, solid performance and medium-sized footprint".[12] MX Linux uses the Xfce desktop environment, while KDE and other environments can be added or are available as "spin-off" ISO images.
