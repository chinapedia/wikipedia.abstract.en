URJA GANGA GAS PIPELINE PROJECT was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his constituency Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. A pipeline of length 2540 km is planned to be laid across the states from Uttar Pradesh to Odisha. A paper titled _Subsidies for Whom_ in _The Economic and Political Weekly_ (EPW), published in 2012, shows that only 18 percent households consume LPG as cooking fuel and the rest use other ways of cooking like wood, kerosene, dung cakes etc which is harmful to their health.[1]
