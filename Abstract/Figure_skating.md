FIGURE SKATING refers to any sporting, artistic or recreational skating that utilises the moves and techniques that are derived from The English and The International styles of ice figure skating. It can be undertaken by individuals, duos or groups. All forms of figure skating are a test of a skater's control and balance.[1] For example, Skate Canada categorise the core skating skills as balance, control and agility and assert that developing these prepares athletes (of any age) to excel in ice skating sports including figure skating. .[2] Partner or group skating additionally tests the coordination and synchronisation between members of the team/group.
