PIKE is a variety of potato bred by the Cornell and Pennsylvania Experimental Stations in March 1996. This clone originated from a cross made in 1981, between 'Allegany' and 'Atlantic potato' varieties.[1] It is resistant to infection by golden nematode, common scab, golden necrosis, and foliage infection by Phytophthora.[2] Pike is intended to be used agriculturally, specifically for use in potato chips.
