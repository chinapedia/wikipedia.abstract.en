The longer wavelengths (red) and the shorter wavelengths (blue) are separated. ]] LIGHT is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to VISIBLE LIGHT, which is the visible spectrum that is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight.[1] Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10^(−7) to 7.00 × 10^(−7) m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).[2][3] This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz).
