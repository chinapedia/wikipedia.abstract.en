The LCDR _AEOLUS_ CLASS was a class of four steam locomotives of the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement. They were supplied to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) by R. & W. Hawthorn & Co. acting as agents for Robert Stephenson & Co. which built the locomotives, but had subcontracted some components to Hawthorn. They were delivered to the LCDR between September 1860 and April 1861. They were all renewed by William Martley as 2-4-0T at the LCDR's Longhedge works in 1872â€“73, using components from the original locomotives, including the boilers.
