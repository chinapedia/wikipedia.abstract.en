CHAIN SCISSION is a term used in polymer chemistry describing the degradation of a polymer main chain.[1] It is often caused by thermal stress (heat) or ionizing radiation (e.g. light, UV radiation or gamma radiation), often involving oxygen. During chain cleavage, the polymer chain is broken at a random point in the backbone to form two - mostly still highly molecular - fragments.[2]
