_GEEKS & GREEKS_ is a semi-autobiographical graphic novel written by humorist Steve Altes, illustrated by Andy Fish, and colored by Veronica Fish. It includes a foreword by novelist Matthew Pearl and is dedicated to Sean Collier. _Geeks & Greeks_ is set at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and locations in Boston, Cambridge, and the Quincy Quarries.[1] The story was inspired by MIT's hacking culture and the writer's experiences with fraternity hazing.[2][3] At MIT a hack is a clever, benign prank or unsanctioned public display or installation that requires technical sophistication to execute and often incorporates an offbeat sense of humor.[4] _Geeks & Greeks_ has been described as _Good Will Hunting_ meets _Animal House_.[5]
