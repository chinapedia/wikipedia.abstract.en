A FATWĀ (; ; plural _FATĀWĀ_ ) is a nonbinding legal opinion on a point of Islamic law (_sharia_) given by a qualified jurist in response to a question posed by a private individual, judge or government. A jurist issuing fatwas is called a _mufti_ and the act of issuing fatwas is called _IFTĀʾ_. Fatwas have played an important role throughout Islamic history, taking on new forms in the modern era.
