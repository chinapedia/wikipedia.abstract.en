, also known as SHINMEN TAKEZŌ, MIYAMOTO BENNOSUKE or, by his Buddhist name, NITEN DŌRAKU,[1] was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). He is considered the _Kensei_, sword-saint of Japan.[2] He was the founder of the Niten-Ichi-Ryū-School or Nito-Ichi-ryū style of swordsmanship, and in his final years authored , and _Dokkōdō_ (_The Path of Aloneness_). Both documents were given to Terao Magonojō, the most important of Musashi's students, seven days before Musashi's death. _The Book of Five Rings_ deals primarily with the character of his Niten-Ichi-Ryū-School in a concrete sense e.g. his own practical martial art and its generic significance; _The Path of Aloneness_ on the other hand, deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life's philosophy in a few short aphoristic sentences.
