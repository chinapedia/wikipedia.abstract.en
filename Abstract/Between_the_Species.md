_BETWEEN THE SPECIES: A JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY AND ANIMALS_ (formerly _BETWEEN THE SPECIES: A JOURNAL OF ETHICS_ and _BETWEEN THE SPECIES: AN ONLINE JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY AND ANIMALS_, also known as _BTS_) is a peer reviewed academic journal devoted to philosophical examinations of human relationships with other animals. It is, in part, a continuation of _ETHICS & ANIMALS'' (_E&A''), a journal which ran from 1980â€“4. _Between the Species_ was founded as a print journal in 1985, published by the Schweitzer Center of the San Francisco Bay Institute/Congress of Cultures. The print version ceased publication in 1996. It was revived as an open access online-only journal in 2002. It is published by the Philosophy Department and Digital Commons at the California Polytechnic State University; Joseph Lynch is the current editor-in-chief.
