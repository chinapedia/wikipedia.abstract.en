The SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH is a Protestant Christian denomination[1] which is distinguished by its observance of Saturday,[2] the seventh day of the week in Christian and Jewish calendars, as the Sabbath, and its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and it was formally established in 1863.[3] Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.[4]
