The STONEWALL RIOTS (also referred to as the STONEWALL UPRISING or the STONEWALL REBELLION) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community[1] against a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[2][3][4][5] and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[6][7]
