The line of control which lies between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Kashmir and Jammu is the de facto boundary which is generally respected by both sides. Indian and Pakistani troops have on occasion tried to alter the areas under their control in large scale operations. There have also been punitive expeditions across the border. This is a list of all reported instances since the re-designation of the cease fire line as the line of control.
