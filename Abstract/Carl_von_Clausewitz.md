CARL PHILIPP GOTTFRIED (or GOTTLIEB) VON CLAUSEWITZ (; 1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831)[1] was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the "moral" (meaning, in modern terms, psychological) and political aspects of war. His most notable work, _Vom Kriege_ (_On War_), was unfinished at his death. Clausewitz was a realist in many different senses and, while in some respects a romantic, also drew heavily on the rationalist ideas of the European Enlightenment.
