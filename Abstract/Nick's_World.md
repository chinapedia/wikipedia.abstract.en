"NICK'S WORLD" (also known as "NICK'S WORLD...")[1] is a twelve-page comic book story featured in the second issue of _Marvel Knights: Double Shot_ written by Grant Morrison[2] and drawn by Manuel Guti√©rrez.[3][4] The story concerns a young spy who tries to trick Nick Fury.[5][6][7] The story was originally intended to be a part of a much longer series but after the follow-up series proposal was ignored by Marvel, Morrison incorporated much of the psychedelic super-spy material into his Vertigo title _The Filth_.[8][9][10]
