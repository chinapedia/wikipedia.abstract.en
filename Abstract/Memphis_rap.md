MEMPHIS RAP, also known as MEMPHIS HIP HOP and in some forms MEMPHIS HORRORCORE,[1] is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in Memphis, Tennessee in the early 1990s. It has been characterized by its often low budget, repetitive production and its occasional lo-fi sound[2] that also heavily utilizes the Roland TR-808 drum machine[3] and minimal synth melodies,[4] as well as double time flows and samples ranging from soul and funk to horror film scores and classical music, as well as hooks from songs by related rappers in the same genre, although DIY production without sampling is common as well.[5]
