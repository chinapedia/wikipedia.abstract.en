PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION (PR) characterizes electoral systems in which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body.[1] If _n_% of the electorate support a particular political party as their favorite, then roughly _n_% of seats will be won by that party.[2] The essence of such systems is that all votes contribute to the resultâ€”not just a plurality, or a bare majority. The most prevalent forms of proportional representation all require the use of multiple-member voting districts (also called super-districts), as it is not possible to fill a single seat in a proportional manner. In fact, the implementations of PR that achieve the highest levels of proportionality tend to include districts with large numbers of seats.[3]
