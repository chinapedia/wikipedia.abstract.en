Electrostatic_Potential.jpg ELECTRONEGATIVITY, symbol _Ï‡_, is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons (or electron density) towards itself.[1] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons towards itself.
