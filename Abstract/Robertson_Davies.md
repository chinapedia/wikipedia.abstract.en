WILLIAM ROBERTSON DAVIES, (28 August 1913 â€“ 2 December 1995) was a Canadian novelist, playwright, critic, journalist, and professor. He was one of Canada's best known and most popular authors and one of its most distinguished "men of letters", a term Davies is variously said to have both gladly accepted for himself and to have detested.[1] Davies was the founding Master of Massey College, a graduate residential college associated with the University of Toronto.
