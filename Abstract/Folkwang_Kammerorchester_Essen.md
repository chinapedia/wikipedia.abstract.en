The FOLKWANG KAMMERORCHESTER ESSEN is a chamber orchestra historically formed mostly by students of the Folkwang University in Essen, Germany, and other _Musikhochschulen_ in Northrhine-Westphalia, to prepare them for a future position in an orchestra; however, it currently employs a core of permanent members from all over Germany and the world. Members are auditioned and trialed as in a professional orchestra, and, if successful, are offered a permanent contract up to the age of 35. It was founded in 1958 by the director of the _Folkwangschule_ . More than 500 musicians were since employed in opera- and symphony orchestras in Germany and abroad.[1]
