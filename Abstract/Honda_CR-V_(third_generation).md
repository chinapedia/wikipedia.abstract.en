The THIRD GENERATION HONDA CR-V was launched for the 2007 model year. It went on sale in the US during late September 2006. Unlike preceding models it features a rear liftgate rather than a side-opening rear door and no longer has the spare tire mounted on the rear door. The new CR-V is lower, wider, and shorter than the previous models; the length decrease is attributed mostly to the fact that the spare wheel no longer adds length to the back of the vehicle. A lowering of the center of gravity is another benefit of the spare wheel being located underneath the rear cargo area. The center rear seat pass-through was also introduced as a new feature on the third generation.
