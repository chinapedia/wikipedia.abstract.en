_STREPTOCOCCUS_ is a genus of gram-positive __ (plural ) or spherical bacteria that belongs to the family Streptococcaceae, within the order Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria), in the phylum Firmicutes.[1] Cell division in STREPTOCOCCI occurs along a single axis, so as they grow, they tend to form pairs or chains that may appear bent or twisted. (Contrast with that of staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes, thereby generating irregular, grape-like clusters of cells.)
