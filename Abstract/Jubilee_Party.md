The JUBILEE PARTY OF KENYA is the ruling political party of the Republic of Kenya. The party was founded on 8 September 2016, following the merger of 11 smaller parties. During the 2017 election, the Jubilee Party secured a plurality of seats in Parliament and the party leader, Uhuru Kenyatta, was reelected president. Since January 2019, the party's stability has been threatened by growing infighting.
