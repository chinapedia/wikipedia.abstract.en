QOM RAILWAY STATION (_Persian:_ ايستگاه راه آهن قم, _Istgah-e Rah Ahan-e Qom_) is located in Qom, Qom Province. The station is owned by IRI Railway. All train services were moved to Mohammadieh railway station on the outskirts of the city, however due to public demand and drop in passenger levels, some services were restored in this city centre station. There are connections planned to Qom Metro lines A and Monorail.
