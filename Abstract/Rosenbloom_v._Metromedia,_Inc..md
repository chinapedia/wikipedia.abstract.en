_ROSENBLOOM V. METROMEDIA, INC._, 403 U.S. 29 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court case that examined the lawsuit between George Rosenbloom and Metromedia under the pretense of libel.[1] This case was responsible for establishing the idea that the knowingly and recklessly false standard for defamatory statements should apply to private individuals as well as public officials. Concluding that the story was a matter of public concern the Supreme Court ruled that it did not matter that Rosenbloom was a private citizen; however, the evidence provided in the case did not support the damages awarded to Rosenbloom. The decision was made June 7, 1971 with a 5-3 decision.[2]
