_COUNTING ON_ (formerly _JILL & JESSA: COUNTING ON_) is an American reality television show that has aired on the cable channel TLC since 2015. A spin-off show of _19 Kids and Counting_, it features the Duggar family: Jessa Seewald, Jinger Vuolo, Joy-Anna Forsyth, fourteen of their sixteen siblings (Josh Duggar and Jill Dillard are not featured on the show: Josh from the beginning and Jill since 2017) as well as parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. The show was created in the wake of the Josh Duggar molestation controversy and subsequent cancellation of _19 Kids and Counting_.[1]
