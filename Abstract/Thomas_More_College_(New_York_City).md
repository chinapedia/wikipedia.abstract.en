THOMAS MORE COLLEGE was a coeducational, undergraduate college of liberal arts and sciences that was open from the fall of 1964 until it merged with Fordham College at Rose Hill in 1974.[1] It offered arts and science programs for women as well as programs, such as drama, for men that were unavailable at Fordham University, which, at that time, only admitted men into its undergraduate programs. While the undergraduate school of Fordham University was all men's, many of Fordham's graduate schools, such as the School of Education, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Law School, College of Pharmacy and School of Social Service were coeducational. Thomas More College, however, provided women the opportunity to earn an undergraduate liberal arts degree.[2]
