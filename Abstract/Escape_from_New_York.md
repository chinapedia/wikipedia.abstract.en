_ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK_ is a 1981 American dystopian science fiction action film co-written, co-scored and directed by John Carpenter. It stars Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasence, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film is set in what was then the near-future year of 1997, in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum-security prison. When Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists and crashes into New York City, ex-soldier and federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Russell) is given 24 hours to rescue the President of the United States.
