_MACRODINYCHUS MULTISPINOSUS_ is a mite that lives as an ectoparasitoid on the invasive _Paratrechina longicornis_. These mites complete their development on a single host, sucking all of its body content and therefore killing it. This is the ninth species of _Macrodinychus_ reported as ant parasite, and the third known as parasitoid of invasive ants, confirming a unique habit in the evolution of mite feeding strategies and suggesting that the entire genus might be parasitic on ants.[1]
