Muhammad Ali and Jimmy Ellis fought each other in a boxing match at the Astrodome in Houston on July 26, 1971. Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round. This was Ali's first boxing match after Fight of the Century,[1][2][3][4][5] and had originally been scheduled as a bout between Wilt Chamberlain, who had challenged him, then trained for the bout with Cus D'Amato, but later withdrew from the fight.[6]
