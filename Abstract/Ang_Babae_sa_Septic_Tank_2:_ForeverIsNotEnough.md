_ANG BABAE SA SEPTIC TANK 2: FOREVER IS NOT ENOUGH_ (; its subtitle stylized as _#FOREVERISNOTENOUGH_) is a 2016 Filipino comedy film distributed by Quantum Films. It is the sequel to the 2011 film _Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank_. The film was directed by Marlon Rivera, written by Chris Martinez, and stars Eugene Domingo, Jericho Rosales, Kean Cipriano (as film director Rainier de la Cuesta), Cai Cortez (as Rainier's line producer, Jocelyn), Khalil Ramos and Joel Torre.[1] While the first film was a satire on the Philippine indie film industry and the dishonesty of Filipino filmmakers participating in foreign film festivals, _Ang Babae sa Septic Tank 2_ satirizes the mainstream film industry.[2]
