DOWN SYNDROME (DS or DNS), also known as TRISOMY 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.[1] It is usually associated with physical growth delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features.[2] The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.[3]
