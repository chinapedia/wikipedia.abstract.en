_SIRODOTIA_ Kylin (1912) is a freshwater red alga which was described by Kylin in 1912. The family Batrachospermaceae belongs to the order Batrachospermales and has six well known genera namely _Batrachospermum_, _Kumanoa_, _Sirodotia_, _Nothocladus_, _Tuomeya_, and _Sheathia_. The morphology of the gametophyte of _Batrachospermum_, _Sirodotia_, _Tuomeya_, and _Nothocladus_ are more are less similar to each other. Necchi and Timothy John Entwisle (1990) proposed to delimit them from Generic level to section level of genus _Batrachospermum_ _Sheathia_ was the member of genus _Batrachospermum_ and recently rose to generic level). Later phylogenetic studies revealed a distinctive genus level of the above with full support in bootstrap analysis[1] (Vis et al., 1998) and _Sirodotia_ has been raised to generic level.[2]
