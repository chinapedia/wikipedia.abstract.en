DISTRIBUTED COLLABORATION is a way of collaboration wherein participants, regardless of their location, work together to reach a certain goal.[1][2][3][4] This usually entails use of increasingly popular cyberinfrastructure, such as emails, instant messaging and document sharing platforms to reduce the limitations of the users trying to work together from remote locations by overcoming physical barriers of geolocation (using cyberinfrastructure) and also to some extent, depending on the application used, the effects of working together in person.[5] For example, a caller software that can be used to bring all collaborators into a single call-in for easier dissemination of ideas.
