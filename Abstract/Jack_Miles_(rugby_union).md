JOHN HENRY MILES known as JACK MILES (born 14 February 1880, died 23 February 1953) was a rugby union wing who played 93 times for Leicester Tigers between 1899 and 1904 scoring 75 tries for 223 points. Miles made his Leicester debut against Handsworthy on 9 September 1899 scoring a hat trick. However that was not enough to keep his place in the team and he did not play again until 25 October 1899 against Bedford School where he scored 2 tries. He did not become a regular in the first team until the 1901/02 season where he scored 20 tries in 26 appearances; continuing that form he scored 14 tries in 17 games the next season to earn his England cap.
