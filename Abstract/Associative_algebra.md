In mathematics, an ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRA is an algebraic structure with compatible operations of addition, multiplication (assumed to be associative), and a scalar multiplication by elements in some field. The addition and multiplication operations together give _A_ the structure of a ring; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give _A_ the structure of a vector space over _K_. In this article we will also use the term _K_-algebra''' to mean an associative algebra over the field _K_. A standard first example of a _K_-algebra is a ring of square matrices over a field _K_, with the usual matrix multiplication.
