In many common law jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore), an INDICTABLE OFFENCE is an offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a _prima facie_ case to answer or by a grand jury (in contrast to a summary offence). In the United States, a crime of similar severity and rules is called a felony, which also requires an indictment.
