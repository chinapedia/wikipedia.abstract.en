The LAGOA SÃO PAULO RESERVE () is an ecological reserve is the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It was created in 1942, but over the years suffered considerable degradation by illegal invasions and squatters. It was largely flooded after construction of the Eng Sérgio Motta Dam on the Paraná River. Only a small part of the original reserve remains, but some efforts are being made to restore it.
