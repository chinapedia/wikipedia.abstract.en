Left_Hand_Off_Spin_Bowling_Animation.gif LEFT-ARM UNORTHODOX SPIN, also known as SLOW LEFT-ARM WRIST-SPIN BOWLING and formerly as CHINAMAN, is a type of left arm wrist leg spin bowling in the sport of cricket. Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball, and make it deviate, or ‘turn’ from left to right after pitching.[1] The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler; however, the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist.
