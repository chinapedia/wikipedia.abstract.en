György_Ligeti_(1984).jpg in 1984]] The Hungarian composer György Ligeti published three string quartets throughout his life: two string quartets proper (1953–54, 1968) and a student piece from 1950 published towards the end of Ligeti's life. The first two string quartets proper represent both his early period, inspired by Béla Bartók, and middle period, which was largely micropolyphonic.[1][2]
