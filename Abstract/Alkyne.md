), the simplest alkyne]] In organic chemistry, an ALKYNE is an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon—carbon triple bond.[1] The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula _(_n_)_(2_n_−2). Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name _acetylene_ also refers specifically to C₂H₂, known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.
