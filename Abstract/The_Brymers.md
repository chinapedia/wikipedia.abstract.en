THE BRYMERS were an American garage rock band from San Joaquin Valley, California, who were active in the 1960s. They had a regional hit with the song "Sacrifice", which also received distribution overseas and managed to garnish airplay in parts of Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Although they only released one single, they recorded numerous unissued tracks that would subsequently be released on CD between 2007 and 2008. The group reunited in 2007 and have since been active on stage and in the studio, releasing five CDs containing old and new material. "Sacrifice" and their version of "The House of the Rising Sun" were both featured in the film _Jobs_ starring Ashton Kutcher. Their song "I Want to Tell You" was included in a scene from the ABC TV series _Once Upon A Time_.
