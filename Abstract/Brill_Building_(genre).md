BRILL BUILDING (also known as BRILL BUILDING POP or the BRILL BUILDING SOUND)[1] is a subgenre of pop music[2] originating from the Brill Building in New York City, where numerous teams of professional songwriters penned material for girl groups and teen idols in the early 1960s.[3] The term has also become a catch-all for the period in which those songwriting teams flourished. In actuality, most hits of the mid 1950s and early 1960s were written elsewhere.
