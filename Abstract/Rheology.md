RHEOLOGY (; from Greek ῥέω _rhéō_, "flow" and -λoγία, -_logia_, "study of") is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a liquid state, but also as "soft solids" or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force. It is a branch of physics which deals with the deformation and flow of materials, both solids and liquids.[1]
