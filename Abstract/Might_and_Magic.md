_MIGHT AND MAGIC_ is a series of role-playing video games from New World Computing, which in 1996 became a subsidiary of The 3DO Company. The original _Might and Magic_ series ended with the closure of the 3DO Company. The rights to the _Might and Magic_ name were purchased for US$1.3 million by Ubisoft,[1] who "rebooted" the franchise with a new series with no apparent connection to the previous continuity, starting with the games _Heroes of Might and Magic V_ and _Dark Messiah of Might and Magic_.
