The GRANVILLE RAIL/TRAIN DISASTER occurred on Tuesday 18 January 1977 at Granville, New South Wales, a western suburb of Sydney when a crowded commuter train derailed, running into the supports of a road bridge that collapsed onto two of the train's passenger carriages. It remains the worst rail disaster in Australian history and the greatest loss of life in a confined area post war: 84[1] people died, more than 213 were injured, and 1,300 were affected.
