HUTCHINSON'S MASK is a patient's sensation that the face is covered with a mask or a gauzy network like cobwebs. This medical sign is associated with tabes dorsalis[1] affecting the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve CN V). It is named in honour of the English physician Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828â€“1913).
