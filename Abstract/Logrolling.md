LOGROLLING is the trading of favors, or _quid pro quo_, such as vote trading by legislative members to obtain passage of actions of interest to each legislative member.[1] In organizational analysis, it refers to a practice in which different organizations promote each other's agendas, each in the expectation that the other will reciprocate. In an academic context, the _Nuttall Encyclopedia_ describes logrolling as "mutual praise by authors of each other's work".
