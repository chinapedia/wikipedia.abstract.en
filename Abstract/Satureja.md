_SATUREJA_ is a genus of aromatic plants of the family Lamiaceae, related to rosemary and thyme. It is native to North Africa, southern and southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. A few New World species were formerly included in _Satureja_, but they have all been moved to other genera. Several species are cultivated as culinary herbs called SAVORY, and they have become established in the wild in a few places.[1][2]
