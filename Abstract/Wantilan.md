Cockfighting_Pavilion,_Pura_Taman_Ayun_1490.jpg, with a lowered central area for a stage used to held a cockfighting ceremony.]] A WANTILAN is a Balinese pavilion (_bale_) used for activities involving large crowd. A wantilan is the largest type of _bale_ in Balinese architecture. A wantilan is basically a large wall-less hall placed under a large multi-tiered roof. A wantilan as a public building is usually located at a village's main square or main junction and functioned as an open hall to hold large community activities such as meeting halls or a public musical gamelan performance. A wantilan is also a religious building, an integral part of Balinese temples used to hold the Balinese cockfighting ceremony (Balinese _tajen_).
