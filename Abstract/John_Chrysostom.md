SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM (; ; â€“ 14 September 407),[1] Archbishop of Constantinople, was an important Early Church Father. He is known for his preaching and public speaking, his denunciation of abuse of authority[2] by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, the _Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom_, and his ascetic sensibilities. The epithet (_Chrysostomos_, anglicized as Chrysostom) means "golden-mouthed" in Greek and denotes his celebrated eloquence.[3][4] Chrysostom was among the most prolific authors in the early Christian Church, exceeded only by Augustine of Hippo in the quantity of his surviving writings.[5]
