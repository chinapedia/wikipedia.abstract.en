ACHDUART (Gaelic: _ACHADH DHUBHAIRD_[1]) is a small hamlet in Coigach, in Wester Ross in northwestern Scotland, now within the Highland council area.[2][3] It is situated about 4Â km southeast of the village of Achiltibuie, at the end of a minor road. A footpath continues on to the hamlet of Culnacraig, then along the coast past Ben More Coigach to Strathcanaird.[4] Achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the ocean as well as its seclusion and remoteness. There is a Scottish Youth Hostels Association hostel in Acheninver, a short distance to the north.
