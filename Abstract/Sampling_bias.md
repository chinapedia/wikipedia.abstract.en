In statistics, SAMPLING BIAS is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower sampling probability than others. It results in a BIASED SAMPLE, a non-random sample[1] of a population (or non-human factors) in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.[2] If this is not accounted for, results can be erroneously attributed to the phenomenon under study rather than to the method of sampling.
