The individual dressage in equestrian at the 1948 Olympic Games in London was held in Aldershot from 9 to 10 August. Swiss rider Hans Moser won the gold medal. The silver was won by André Jousseaume of France and the bronze by Swedish rider Gustaf Adolf Boltenstern, Jr.. The sixth place finisher, Gehnäll Persson, was disqualified when it was discovered that he was only a noncommissioned officer and thus ineligible to compete.[1]
