CONSTANTINE, SON OF ÁED (Medieval Gaelic: _Causantín mac Áeda_; Modern Gaelic: _Còiseam mac Aoidh_, known in most modern regnal lists as CONSTANTINE II; born no later than 879; died 952) was an early King of Scotland, known then by the Gaelic name _Alba_. The Kingdom of Alba, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was situated in modern-day Scotland. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the River Tay. Its southern limit was the River Forth, northwards it extended towards the Moray Firth and perhaps to Caithness, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather Kenneth I of Scotland (Cináed mac Ailpín, died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as king of the Picts. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of Pictland and the origins of the Kingdom of Alba are traced to Constantine's lifetime.
