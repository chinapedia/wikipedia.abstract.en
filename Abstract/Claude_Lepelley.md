CLAUDE LEPELLEY (8 February 1934[1] – 31 January 2015[2]) was a 20th-21st-century French historian, a specialist of late Antiquity and North Africa during Antiquity. His thesis, _Les cités de l'Afrique romaine au Bas-Empire_, defended in 1977 under the direction of William Seston, profoundly changed the understanding of the urban world in the third - fourth centuries: far from declining, the cities of Africa had some prosperity at that time.
