DEMOCIDE is a term proposed by R. J. Rummel since at least 1994[1] who defined it as "_the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command_".[2] According to him, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims; killings by "unofficial" private groups; extrajudicial summary killings; and mass deaths due to the governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate famines, as well as killings by _de facto_ governments, i.e. civil war killings.[3] This definition covers any murder of any number of persons by any government.[4]
