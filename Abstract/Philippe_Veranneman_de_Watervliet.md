PHILIPPE VERANNEMAN DE WATERVLIET (3 December 1787 - 9 March 1844) was a politician in the Southern Netherlands. During the period of the United Netherlands he was a member of the Second Chamber in the States General (national parliament). He was also, between 1828 and 1830, the last mayor of Bruges before 1830, when the southern part of the country broke away to form the separate state of Belgium.[1][2]
