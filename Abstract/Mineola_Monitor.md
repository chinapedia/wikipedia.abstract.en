The _MINEOLA MONITOR_ was a newspaper in Mineola, Texas serving Wood County, Texas and the communities of Alba, Golden, Hawkins and parts of unincorporated Wood County. It was established in 1876 by D.C. Williams. In 1907 the Monitor was purchased by J.A. Thomas. Although a weekly newspaper, it was published as a daily twice during its history.[1] The _Mineola Monitor_ was recently owned by ASP Westward before being sold to Texas Community Media, LLC. In 2012, the newspaper was purchased by Bluebonnet Communications.[2]
