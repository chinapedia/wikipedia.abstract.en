BARBARA DUMETZ (born 1947) is an American photographer and pioneer in the field of commercial photography. She began working in Los Angeles as a commercial photographer in the 1970s, when very few women had established and maintained successful careers in the field, especially African-American women.[1][2][3][4] Over the course of her career, "she made a major contribution to diversifying the landscape of images that defined pop culture in the United States."[5]
