EPIETIOCHOLANOLONE, also known as 3Β-HYDROXY-5Β-ANDROSTAN-17-ONE or as ETIOCHOLAN-3Β-OL-17-ONE, is an etiocholane (5β-androstane) steroid as well as an inactive metabolite of testosterone that is formed in the liver.[1][2][3] The metabolic pathway is testosterone to 5β-dihydrotestosterone (via 5β-reductase),[4] 5β-dihydrotestosterone to 3β,5β-androstanediol (via 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and 3β,5β-androstanediol to epietiocholanolone (via 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).[5] Epietiocholanolone can also be formed directly from 5β-androstanedione (via 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).[6][7] It is glucuronidated and sulfated in the liver and excreted in urine.[8][9]
