FK1012, a derivative of tacrolimus, is used as a research tool in chemically induced dimerization applications. The protein FKBP does not normally form dimers but can be caused to dimerize in the presence of FK1012. Genetically engineered proteins based on FKBP can be used to manipulate protein localization, signalling pathways and protein activation.[1]
