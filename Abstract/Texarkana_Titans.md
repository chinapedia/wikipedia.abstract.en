The TEXARKANA TITANS were a professional American football team based in Texarkana, Texas. They began play in 1967 as a member of the Southern Football League [1] and by 1968 joined the Texas Football League, and became a member of the Continental Football League when the former merged operations with it in 1969. The Titans played in the TFL's championship game in 1968, losing 21-16 to the San Antonio Toros. After the Continental Football League dissolved in 1970, most of the Texas Division teams (including the Titans) returned to an autonomous TFL.
