Adolf_Loos's_Dvořák_mausoleum.jpg In 1921 the Austrian architect Adolf Loos completed a plan for a mausoleum for the Austrian Czech art historian Max Dvořák, who had died earlier that year.[1] The mausoleum was never built; but a scale version of it was realised by the British architect Sam Jacob as a temporary installation called _A Very Small Part of Architecture_ commissioned by the Architecture Foundation at London's Highgate Cemetery in September 2016.[2]
