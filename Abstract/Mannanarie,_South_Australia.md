MANNANARIE is a rural locality in the Mid North region of South Australia, situated in the Northern Areas Council.[1] It was established in April 2001, when boundaries were formalised for the "long established local name". It comprises most of the cadastral Hundred of Mannanarie, apart from a northern section which lies in Tarcowie and Yatina.[2] The name stems from an Aboriginal word, "manangari", meaning "good string or cord", stemming from a local native plant useful for string making.[3]
