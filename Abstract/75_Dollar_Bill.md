75 DOLLAR BILL is a musical duo formed in New York City in 2012. Its members are Che Chen (guitar), formerly of True Primes, and Rick Brown (drums), formerly of V-Effect and Curlew.[1] Sasha Frere-Jones described their music as displaying "a certain kind of formal fullness and technical freedom," which he said has helped introduce jazz to a new generation.[2] Other critics have noted that their music shows signs of Mauritanian influences, because Chen studied Moorish music in that country with Jheich Ould Chighaly in 2013.[3] Their first full-length album, _Wooden Bag_, was released in 2015 by Other Music Recording Company.[4] Their second album, _Wood/Metal/Plastic/Pattern/Rhythm/Rock_, was released in 2016 on the Los Angeles-based label Thin Wrist.[5]
