_PRIMA FACIE_ (; ) is a Latin expression meaning _on its first encounter_ or _at first sight_.[1] The literal translation would be "at first face" or "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of _primus_ ("first") and _facies_ ("face"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be "on the face of it". The term _prima facie_ is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, _prima facie_ denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a _prima facie_ case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.[2]
