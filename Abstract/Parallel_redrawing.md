In geometric graph theory, and the theory of structural rigidity, a PARALLEL REDRAWING of a graph drawing with straight edges in the Euclidean plane or higher-dimensional Euclidean space is another drawing of the same graph such that all edges of the second drawing are parallel to their corresponding edges in the first drawing. A PARALLEL MORPH of a graph is a continuous family of drawings, all parallel redrawings of each other.
