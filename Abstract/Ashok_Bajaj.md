ASHOK BAJAJ is a restaurateur based in Washington, DC. He is head of the Knightsbridge Restaurant Group. __NOTOC__ Bajaj was born in New Delhi. He left India in his early twenties,[1] working in Sydney and in London, where he managed the Bombay Brasserie before moving the United States[2] in 1988.[3] He opened the Bombay Club, his first restaurant in Washington, in 1989 in his 20s, in initially working with an Australian partner, Nelson Blanks, though the two parted ways after a year and a half.[4] His restaurant group has since expanded and now includes Rasika, for which chef Vikram Sunderam won a 2014 James Beard Award.[5] Sunderam and Bajaj met in London working together at the Bombay Brasserie.[6] With Sunderam and chef and cookbook author David Hagedorn, Bajaj is co-author of the cookbook, _Rasika: Flavors of India_,[7] published by the Ecco imprint of HarperCollins.[8]
