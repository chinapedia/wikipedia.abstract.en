A NEUTRINO ( or ) (denoted by the Greek letter Î½) is a fermion (an elementary particle with half-integer spin) that interacts only via the weak subatomic force and gravity.[1][2] The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (_-ino_) that it was long thought to be zero. The mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles.[3] The weak force has a very short range, the gravitational interaction is extremely weak, and neutrinos, as leptons, do not participate in the strong interaction. Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected.[4][5]
