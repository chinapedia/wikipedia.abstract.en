STORMFALL: AGE OF WAR is a social browser game created in 2012 by Plarium and then moved to Facebook in November.[1][2][3] This game franchise builds on the success of Plarium's earlier Facebook titles in the crowded web-based PvP strategy game market, though a pay-to-win aspect of the game raises concerns.[4] Plarium which has a global registered player base of 250 million players introduced Stormfall: Rise of Balur as the sequel to the hugely popular Stormfall: Age of War.[5]
