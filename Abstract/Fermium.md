Ferrum|Fermion}} FERMIUM is a synthetic element with the symbol FM and atomic number 100. It is an actinide and the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared.[1] A total of 19 isotopes are known, with ²⁵⁷Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.
