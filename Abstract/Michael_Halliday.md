MICHAEL ALEXANDER KIRKWOOD HALLIDAY (often M.A.K. HALLIDAY; 13 April 1925 â€“ 15 April 2018) was an English-born linguist who developed the internationally influential _systemic functional linguistics_ (SFL) model of language. His grammatical descriptions go by the name of _systemic functional grammar_.[1] Halliday describes language as a semiotic system, "not in the sense of a system of signs, but a systemic resource for meaning".[2] For Halliday, language is a "meaning potential"; by extension, he defines linguistics as the study of "how people exchange meanings by 'languaging'".[3] Halliday describes himself as a _generalist_, meaning that he has tried "to look at language from every possible vantage point", and has described his work as "wander[ing] the highways and byways of language".[4] But he has claimed that "to the extent that I favoured any one angle, it was the social: language as the creature and creator of human society".[5]
