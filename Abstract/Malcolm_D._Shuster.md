MALCOLM D. SHUSTER (31 July 1943 - 23 February 2012) was an American physicist and aerospace engineer, whose work contributed significantly to spacecraft attitude determination[1][2]. In 1977 he joined the Attitude Systems Operation of the Computer Sciences Corporation in Silver Spring, Maryland, during which time he developed the QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) algorithm for static attitude determination[3]. He later, with F. Landis Markley, helped to develop the standard implementation of the Kalman filter used in spacecraft attitude estimation[4]. During his career, he authored roughly fifty technical papers[5][6] on subjects in physics and spacecraft engineering, many of which have become seminal within the field of attitude estimation, and held teaching assignments at Johns Hopkins University, Howard University, Carnegie-Mellon University and Tel-Aviv University[7]. In 2000 the American Astronautical Society awarded him the Dirk Brouwer Award[8][9]. In June 2005 the American Astronautical Society held a special three-day Astronautics symposium in his honor[10]
