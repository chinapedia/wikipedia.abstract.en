Southern_Gondwana.png The OKAVANGO DYKE SWARM is a giant dyke swarm of the Karoo Large Igneous Province in northeast Botswana, southern Africa. It consists of a group of Proterozoic and Jurassic dykes, trending east-southeast across Botswana, spanning a region nearly long and wide.[1] The Jurassic dykes were formed approximately 179 million years ago,[2] composed of mainly tholeiitic mafic rocks.[3] The formation is related to the magmatism at the Karoo triple junction, induced by the plate tectonic break up of the Gondwana supercontinent in the early Jurassic.
