International_Court_of_Justice.jpg in The Hague, Netherlands, home to the Permanent Court of International Justice]] The PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE, often called the WORLD COURT, existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an international court attached to the League of Nations. Created in 1920 (although the idea of an international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation. With the heightened international tension of the 1930s, the Court became less used. By a resolution from the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist and were replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.
