_ZASMIDIUM CELLARE_, also known as cellar mold, is a species of fungus that exists in dark, ethanol-rich environments and is brown to black in colour.[1][2] This species primarily exists in wine and brandy cellars in central and southern Europe,[3][4] but can be found in surrounding regions and is thought to be helpful in the wine making process by some[5] and a hygienic issue by others.[6][7] Not much is known about _Z. cellare_'s sexual biology[8] and is thought to be beneficial to the cleanliness of cellar air due to its ability to consume musty odours.[9]
