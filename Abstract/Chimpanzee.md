The CHIMPANZEE (_Pan troglodytes_), also known as the COMMON CHIMPANZEE, ROBUST CHIMPANZEE, or simply "CHIMP", is a species of great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo (sometimes called the "pygmy chimpanzee") are classified in the genus _Pan_. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that _Pan_ is a sister taxon to the human lineage and are humans' closest living relatives.
