The NIGER–CONGO LANGUAGES constitute one of the world's major language families and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages.[1] It is generally considered to be the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages,[2][3] ahead of Austronesian, although this is complicated by the ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language; the number of named Niger–Congo languages listed by _Ethnologue_ is 1,540.[4]
