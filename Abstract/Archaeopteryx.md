_ARCHAEOPTERYX_ (), meaning "old wing" (sometimes referred to by its German name __ ("original bird" or "first bird")), is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs that is transitional between non-avian feathered dinosaurs and modern birds. The name derives from the ancient Greek (_archaīos_) meaning "ancient", and (_ptéryx_), meaning "feather" or "wing". Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, _Archaeopteryx_ had been generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae).[1] Older potential avialans have since been identified, including _Anchiornis_, _Xiaotingia_, and _Aurornis_.[2]
