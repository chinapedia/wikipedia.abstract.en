The HISTORY OF ISLAM concerns the political, social, economic and developments of Islamicate civilization. Despite concerns about the reliability of early sources,[1] most historians[2] believe that Islam originated in Mecca and Medina at the start of the 7th century CE, approximately 600 years after the founding of Christianity. Muslims, however, believe that it did not start with Muhammad, but that it was the original faith of others whom they regard as prophets, such as Jesus, David, Moses, Abraham, Noah and Adam.[3][4][5]
