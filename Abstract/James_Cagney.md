JAMES FRANCIS CAGNEY JR. (July 17, 1899March 30, 1986)[1] was an American actor and dancer, both on stage and in film (though primarily known for the latter).[2] Known for his consistently energetic performances, distinctive vocal style, and deadpan comic timing, he won acclaim and major awards for a wide variety of performances.[3] He is best remembered for playing multifaceted tough guys in films such as _The Public Enemy_ (1931), _Taxi!_ (1932), _Angels with Dirty Faces_ (1938), _The Roaring Twenties_ (1939) and _White Heat_ (1949), finding himself typecast or limited by this reputation earlier in his career.[4] In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked him eighth among its list of greatest male stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.[5] Orson Welles said of Cagney, "[he was] maybe the greatest actor who ever appeared in front of a camera".[6]
