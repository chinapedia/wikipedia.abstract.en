LILLY MARIE RODRIGUEZ, known by her artist name ISIS RODR√çGUEZ (born 1964 in Los Angeles, CA), is an American contemporary painter who uses the cartoon as a conceptual tool to discuss issues that focuses on the empowerment and liberation of women. Combining classical realism with contemporary influences including tattoo art, graffiti, and especially cartoons, her works bridge traditional distinctions between high and low art, creating a hybrid style that expresses new possibilities for female identity and spirituality. Judy Chicago and Edward Lucie Smith highlight Rodriguez as one of the few female artists to ever discuss the sex industry in her work,[1] and Sherri Cullison includes Rodriguez among the most noteworthy American women artists of the 20th century.[2]
