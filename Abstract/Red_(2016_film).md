_RED_ is a short dark thriller set in the underground world of illegal organ smuggling, the so-called red market. It's the directing debut of Branko Tomovic who is probably best known in the US for playing Jack Bauer's sidekick in the recent "24: Live Another Day" series and stars British actress Francesca Fowler (Doctor Who, Rome, Closure) with the acclaimed Irish actress Dervla Kirwan (Ondine, Ballykissangel, The Silence, Doctor Who) as the sadistic and cruel crime boss.
