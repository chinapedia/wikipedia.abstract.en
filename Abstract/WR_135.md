WR 135 is a variable Wolf-Rayet star located around 6,000 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, surrounded by a faint bubble nebula blown by the intense radiation and fast wind from the star. It is three times the radius of the sun, but due to a temperature of 63,000 K it is 190,000 times as luminous as the sun.
