ANATOLIA (from Greek: , __; , "east" or "[sun]rise"), also known as ASIA MINOR (Medieval and Modern Greek: , __, "small Asia"; ), ASIAN TURKEY, the ANATOLIAN PENINSULA or the ANATOLIAN PLATEAU, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.
