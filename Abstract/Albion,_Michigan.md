ALBION is a city in Calhoun County in the south central region of the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 8,616[1] at the 2010 census and is part of the Battle Creek Metropolitan Statistical Area. From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as _The Forks_, because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the Kalamazoo River. The _Festival of the Forks_ has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.
