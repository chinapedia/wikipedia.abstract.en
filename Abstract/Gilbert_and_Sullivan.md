GILBERT AND SULLIVAN refers to the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert (1836–1911) and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900) and to the works they jointly created. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which _H.M.S. Pinafore_, _The Pirates of Penzance_ and _The Mikado_ are among the best known.[1]
