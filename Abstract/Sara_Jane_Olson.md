SARA JANE OLSON (born KATHLEEN ANN SOLIAH on January 16, 1947) was a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in the 1970s. She grew up in Palmdale, California, the daughter of Norwegian-American parents,[1][2] Elsie Soliah (n√©e Engstrom)[3] and Palmdale High School English teacher[4] and coach Martin Soliah.[5][6] She went into hiding in 1976 after having been indicted in a bombing case. She has lived much of her life in Minnesota under the alias Sara Jane Olson, which is now her legal name. Arrested in 1999, she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder, and in 2003 to second-degree murder, both stemming from her SLA activities in the 1970s. She received a sentence of 14 years in prison.
