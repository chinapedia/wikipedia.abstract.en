The ECONOMY OF PAKISTAN is the 24th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and 39th largest in terms of nominal gross domestic product. Pakistan has a population of over 207 million [1] (the world's 6th-largest), giving it a nominal GDP per capita of $1,357 in 2019,[2] which ranks 154th in the world and giving it a PPP GDP per capita of 5,839 in 2019, which ranks 132th in the world for 2019. However, Pakistan's undocumented economy is estimated to be 36% of its overall economy, which is not taken into consideration when calculating per capita income.[3] Pakistan is a developing country[4][5][6] and is one of the Next Eleven countries identified by Jim O'Neill in a research paper as having a high potential of becoming, along with the BRICS countries, among the world's largest economies in the 21st century.[7] The economy is semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River.[8][9][10] Primary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals, carpets/rugs and medical instruments.[11][12]
