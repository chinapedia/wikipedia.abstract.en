ALMA GOULD DALE (October 27, 1854 – August 29, 1930), "a legendary figure in Canada history,"[1] founded the first monthly Quaker meeting in western Canada, at Hartney, Manitoba, in 1899. She represents the Quaker presence in Canada on one of the seventy-five panels in the Quaker Tapestry at Friends' House, in London, where she is credited with a major role in the growth of Quakerism in Canada from 1800 on.[2] On the tapestry, she is depicted driving a palomino team to a Quaker settlement in western Canada, which she drove in all weather.[3] She was well known as a dynamic speaker and was invited to speak in Canada, England, and New Zealand.
