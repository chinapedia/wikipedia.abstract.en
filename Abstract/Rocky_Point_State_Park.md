ROCKY POINT STATE PARK is a passive use state park on Narragansett Bay in Warwick, Rhode Island. The land has been a public attraction since the mid-1800s, most notably as Rocky Point Amusement Park. When the amusement park closed in 1995, it sat abandoned for years until the city and state purchased the land in stages between 2008-2013. It reopened to the public as a state park in October 2014.
