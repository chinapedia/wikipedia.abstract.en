SPAGHETTI (; sing. _spaghetto_) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.[1] _Spaghettoni_ is a thicker form of spaghetti, while _capellini_ is a very thin spaghetti. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Authentic Italian spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina, but elsewhere it may be made with other kinds of flour.[2] Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.
