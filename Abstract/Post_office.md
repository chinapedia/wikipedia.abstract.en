Post House}}A post office is a public department that provides a customer service to the public and handles their mail needs.[1] Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery. In addition, many post offices offer additional services: providing and accepting government forms (such as passport applications), processing government services and fees (such as road tax), and banking services (such as savings accounts and money orders).[2] The chief administrator of a post office is called a postmaster.
