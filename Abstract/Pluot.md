Raspberry_jewel_pluot.jpg PLUOTS, APRIUMS, APRIPLUMS, or PLUMCOTS, are some of the hybrids between different _Prunus_ species that are also called interspecific plums. Whereas plumcots and apriplums are first-generation hybrids between a plum parent (_P. salicina_ or _P. cerasifera_ or their hybrids) and an apricot (_P. armeniaca_), pluots and apriums are later-generations.[1][2] Both names "plumcot" and "apriplum" have been used for trees derived from a plum seed parent, and are therefore equivalent.[3][4]
