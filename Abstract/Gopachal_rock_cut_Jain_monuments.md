GOPACHAL ROCK-CUT JAIN MONUMENTS, also called _Gopachal Parvat_ Jaina monuments, are a group of Jain carvings dated to between 7th and 15th century. They are located on the south side of Gwalior Fort, Madhya Pradesh. They depict Tirthankaras in seated Padmasana posture as well as standing Kayotsarga posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography. This group of Jain monuments is related to numerous others found in the north side of the fort including the Siddhachal Caves.
