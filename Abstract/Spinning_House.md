The SPINNING HOUSE, also known as the CAMBRIDGE HOUSE OF CORRECTION and HOBSON'S BRIDEWELL,[1] was a workhouse and prison built in Cambridge in the 1600s[2] and demolished in 1901.[3] In the Victorian era it held local women suspected by Proctors of having a corrupting influence on the male student population, until this power was removed by Act of Parliament in 1893.[4] This removal followed the high-profile case of 17-year-old Daisy Hopkins, who was arrested in 1891 for the crime of "walking with a member of the university"; she sued the Proctor and lost in a trial that severely attacked her moral character[5] but nevertheless prompted public debate about the legitimacy of such arrests.
