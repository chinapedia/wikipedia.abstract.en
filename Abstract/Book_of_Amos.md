The '''Book of Amos ''' is the third of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Tanakh/Old Testament and the second in the Greek Septuagint tradition. Amos, an older contemporary of Hosea and Isaiah,[1] was active c. 750 BC during the reign of Jeroboam II[2] (788â€“747 BC),[3] making Amos the first prophetic book of the Bible to be written. Amos lived in the kingdom of Judah but preached in the northern kingdom of Israel.[4] His major themes of social justice, God's omnipotence, and divine judgment became staples of prophecy.[5]
