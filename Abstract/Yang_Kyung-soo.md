YANG KYUNG-SOO (born 1983) is a South Korean artist. Yang's single-frame webtoons which capture the unique hierarchy of the typical Korean workplace and uploaded regularly on his Instagram have gained a popular following among Korean office workers. The pictures are receiving thousands of "likes" and comments on social media, with people remarking how relatable and vicariously satisfying the scenes are. "The whole point of my pictures is to say what you can't in real life. I think that's why people like them," he said. Though he started sketching the webtoons for fun.[1][2]
