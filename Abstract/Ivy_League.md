Flags_of_the_Ivy_League.jpg]] The IVY LEAGUE is an American collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States. The term _Ivy League_ is typically used to refer to those eight schools as a group of elite colleges beyond the sports context.[1] The eight members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. _Ivy League_ has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.
