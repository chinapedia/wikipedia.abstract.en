APULEIUS (; also called LUCIUS APULEIUS MADAURENSIS; c. 124 â€“ c. 170 AD)[1] was a Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorician.[2] He was a Numidian who lived under the Roman Empire[3] and was from Madauros (now M'Daourouch, Algeria). He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty _tour de force_ in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the _Apologia_.
