_SIGNALS THROUGH THE FLAMES_[1] is a 1983 documentary film on the work of Julian Beck and Judith Malina as the founders of The Living Theatre performance company.[2] The title of the film is taken from the work of Antonin Artaud in his book on theatre theory called _The Theatre and its Double_.[3] The film was produced by Mystic Fire Video as a project of the now defunct Mystic Fire Video bookstore in New York City. It was directed and edited by Sheldon Rochlin.[4]
