The SNOWDEN HOUSE is a historic building located in Waterloo, Iowa, United States. William Snowden was a local pharmacist. He had this house built in 1878. It became the home of the Waterloo Women's Club in 1922.[1] The house is a two-story, brick, rectangular Italianate structure. It features a hip roof, a shallow gable with a blind oculus on the main facade, bracketed eaves, and a full length front porch. The house has segmentally arched windows throughout, with the windows on the front capped with hoodmolds. The two-story wing on the back is a later addition. The interior was completely rebuilt after a 1955 fire. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[2]
