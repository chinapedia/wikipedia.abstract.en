REMDESIVIR (GS-5734) is an antiviral drug, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, though it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and MERS-coronavirus.[1] GS-5734 was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013â€“2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results have been promising and it is being used in the emergency setting for the 2018 Kivu Ebola outbreak along with further clinical trials.[2][3][4][5][6] It may also help protect against Nipah and Hendra virus infections.[7][8]
