BABADIL ISLANDS (a.k.a. Beşparmak Islands) are two small Mediterranean islands in Turkey. They are named after the former name of the village Sipahili in the mainland facing the islands. According to the British captain Francis Beaufort who was tasked to map the Mediterranean coasts of Turkey in 1811-12, the names of the islands were Papadoulae, in the antiquity.[1] Modern scholarship identifies the island group with Akonesiai,[2] and the northern island with ancient Crambusa or Krambousa (Κράμβουσα).[3]
