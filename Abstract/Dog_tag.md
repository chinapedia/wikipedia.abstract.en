Dogtags.jpg]] "DOG TAG" is an informal but common term for a specific type of identification tag worn by military personnel. The tags' primary use is for the identification of dead and wounded soldiers; as such, they have personal information about the soldiers written on them, and convey essential basic medical information such as the soldier's blood type[1] and history of inoculations. They often indicate religious preference as well.
