EDWARD VINCENT SULLIVAN (September 28, 1901 – October 13, 1974) was an American television personality, sports and entertainment reporter, and syndicated columnist for the _New York Daily News_ and the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. He is principally remembered as the creator and host of the television variety program _The Toast of the Town_, later popularly—and, eventually, officially—renamed _The Ed Sullivan Show_. Broadcast for 23 years from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in US broadcast history.[1] "It was, by almost any measure, the last great TV show," said television critic David Hinckley. "It's one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories."[2]
