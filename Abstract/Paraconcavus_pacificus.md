_PARACONCAVUS PACIFICUS_, the RED-STRIPED ACORN BARNACLE,[1] is a species of balanid barnacle known from subtidal sandy habitats of the outer northeastern Pacific coast, from Baja California north to Monterey Bay.[2] It grows to 35Â mm in diameter, with pink longitudinal stripes over white plates, and can be distinguished from other large, pink-striped barnacles in its range (e.g. _Amphibalanus amphitrite_) by the longitudinal striations across the growth rings of its plates.[3] While it will attach to many different kinds of hard substrate, it shows a preference for attaching the shells of other organisms, particularly sand dollars.[4]
