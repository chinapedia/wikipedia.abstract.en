NEGRO (or NIGGER) HEAD ROAD is a place outside Wilmington, North Carolina[1][2] with similar displays in other Southern towns,[3] where body parts of slaves or blacks were displayed in consequence of a purported crime. It is modeled after displays like Blackhead Signpost Road in Southampton County, Virginia. It was here, in 1831, where the head of a slave, Alfred, was displayed on a stake for being part of Nat Turner's slave rebellion, as a warning for any future rebels.[4]
