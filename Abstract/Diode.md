Diode-closeup.jpg Dioden2.jpg. In most diodes, a white or black painted band identifies the cathode into which electrons will flow when the diode is conducting. Electron flow is the reverse of conventional current flow.[1][2][3][4]]] Diode-english-text.svg diode. The filament itself may be the cathode, or more commonly (as shown here) used to heat a separate metal tube which serves as the cathode.]]
