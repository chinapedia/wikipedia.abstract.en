COCAINE, also known as COKE, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug.[1] It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein.[2] Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation.[3] Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils.[4] High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature.[5] Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.[6] Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.[7]
