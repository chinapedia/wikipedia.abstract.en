BURSCOUGH METHODIST CHURCH, formally WESLEYAN CHAPEL AT BURSCOUGH BRIDGE, is situated in Burscough and is part of the Lancashire West Methodist Circuit. It was built in between 1868 and 1869 of a brick construction in a cruciform layout. The church was opened on 26 March 1869, with construction coming in under budget. The contractor, foreman and architect all donated gifts to the church for its opening, as did the Mayor of Southport. A large portion of the church was used by the Methodist's Sunday school.
