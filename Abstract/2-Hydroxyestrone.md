2-HYDROXYESTRONE (2-OHE1), also known as ESTRA-1,3,5(10)-TRIEN-2,3-DIOL-17-ONE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring catechol estrogen and a major metabolite of estrone and estradiol.[1][2][3] It is formed irreversibly from estrone in the liver and to a lesser extent in other tissues via 2-hydroxylation mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly the CYP3A and CYP1A subfamilies.[4][5] 2-OHE1 is the most abundant catechol estrogen in the body.[6] It is not significantly uterotrophic in bioassays, whereas other hydroxylated estrogen metabolites including 2-hydroxyestradiol, 16α-hydroxyestrone, estriol (16α-hydroxyestradiol), 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone all are.[7][8]
