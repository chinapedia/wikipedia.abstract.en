Beverly_Hillbillies_Episode_18_Jed_Saves_The_Drysdales_Marriage.ogg _THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES_ is an American sitcom television series originally broadcast on CBS from 1962 to 1971. The show had an ensemble cast featuring Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, Donna Douglas, and Max Baer Jr. as the Clampetts, a poor backwoods family from the Ozarks region who move to posh Beverly Hills, California, after striking oil on their land. The show was produced by Filmways and was created by writer Paul Henning. It was followed by two other Henning-inspired "country cousin" series on CBS: _Petticoat Junction_, and its spin-off _Green Acres_, which reversed the rags-to-riches, country-to-city model of _The Beverly Hillbillies_.
