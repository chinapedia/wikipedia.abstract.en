Rawa}} The REVOLUTIONARY ASSOCIATION OF THE WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN (RAWA) (Persian:جمعیت انقلابی زنان افغانستان, _Jamiyat-e Enqelābi-ye Zanān-e Afghānestān_, Pashto:د افغانستان د ښڅو انقلابی جمعیت) is a women's organization based in Quetta, Pakistan, that promotes women's rights and secular democracy. It was founded in 1977 by Meena Keshwar Kamal, an Afghan student activist who was assassinated in February 1987 for her political activities.[1] The group, which supports non-violent strategies,[2] had its initial office in Kabul, Afghanistan, but then moved to Pakistan in the early 1980s.
