ZYNOVIY BOHDAN KHMELNYTSKY (Ruthenian: Ѕѣнові Богдан Хмелнiцкiи;[1] modern ; 6 August 1657) was a Ukrainian[2][3][4] Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host, then in the Polish Crown of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (now part of Ukraine). He led an uprising against the Commonwealth and its magnates (1648–1654) that resulted in the creation of a state led by the Cossacks. In 1654, he concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with the Russian Tsardom and thus allied the state with Russia.
