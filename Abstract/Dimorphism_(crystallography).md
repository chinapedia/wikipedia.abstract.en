Calcite_jaune.jpg Aragonite_2_Enguidanos.jpg DIMORPHISM is the property of some minerals to exist in two different crystal systems, while still having the same chemical formula. Examples include CaCOâ‚ƒ, which exists as trigonal calcite or orthorhombic aragonite. A mineral's dimorph is the mineral that it is dimorphic with.[1][2] Dimorphism is not to be confused with allotropy, which refers to a difference in crystal structure of pure elements.
