SECURITY BSIDES (commonly referred to as BSides) is a series of loosely affiliated information security conferences.[1] It was co-founded by Mike Dahn, Jack Daniel, and Chris Nickerson in 2009.[2] Due to an overwhelming number of presentation submissions to Black Hat USA in 2009, the rejected presentations were presented to a smaller group of individuals.[3][4] Over time the conference format matured and was released to enable individuals to start their own BSides conferences.
