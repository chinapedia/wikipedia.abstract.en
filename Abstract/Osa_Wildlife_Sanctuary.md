The OSA WILDLIFE SANCTUARY () or CAÃ‘A BLANCA WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, is an animal rescue center located in Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. The Sanctuary is accessible only by boat and is completely surrounded by Piedras Blancas National Park. The centre is dedicated to the rehabilitation of mistreated, injured, orphaned, and/or confiscated animals.[1] Once the animals are fully rehabilitated,[2] they are reintroduced into their natural habitats in protected areas within Costa Rica, including the Corcovado National Park.[3]
