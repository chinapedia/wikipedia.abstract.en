SUB ROSA is a Brazilian rock band, created in 2006 with influences of progressive rock and classic rock. Their debut album, "The Gigsaw (2009)",[1] was an independent release and, because it sold well in the US and Europe, it was re-released in Brazil by the label "Progressive Rock Worldwide / Megahard Records", in a remixed, remastered deluxe digipack version, with three bonus tracks and new artwork.[2]
