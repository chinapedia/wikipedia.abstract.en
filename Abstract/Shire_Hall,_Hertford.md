The_Shire_Hall,_Hertford_-_geograph.org.uk_-_142920.jpg The SHIRE HALL in Hertford, the county town of Hertfordshire, England, is an 18th-century building. It was designed to provide assembly rooms, courts and a council chamber.[1] It also housed the town's corn exchange until the mid-nineteenth century.[2] It was proposed as a joint project by Robert Adam and his younger brother James Adam, but James took charge of the commission and the design is credited to him.[3] Built around 1768â€“9, the building was expanded several times in subsequent years.
