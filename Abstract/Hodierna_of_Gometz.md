She made great donations to the new religious of the order of Saint-Benoît, installed in the Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Garde Basilica of Longpont-sur-Orge, a monastery founded by her husband. Guy obtained the concession of the church of Long Pont in 1061 of Godfrey, Bishop of Paris. According to _Gallia Christiana_: "She herself went to Cluny to obtain from the abbot a certain number of monks; And she presented to the abbey a golden chalice of thirty ounces and a precious chasuble.”
