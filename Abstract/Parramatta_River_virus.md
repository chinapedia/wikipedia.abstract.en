PARRAMATTA RIVER VIRUS (PARV) is an insect virus belonging to _Flaviviridae_ and endemic to Australia. It was discovered in 2015.[1] The virus was identified from the mosquito _Aedes vigilax_ collected from Sydney under the joint research project by scientists at the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney. In experimental infections, the virus is unable to grow in vertebrate cells, but only in _Aedes_-derived mosquito cell lines. This suggests that the virus does not infect vertebrates. The name is given because it was discovered from Silverwater, a suburb of Sydney on the southern bank of the Parramatta River. The mosquitoes from which the virus was isolated were actually collected in 2007, and had been preserved since then. The study commenced only after the development of the technique of viral detection in mosquitoes in the University of Queensland.[2]
