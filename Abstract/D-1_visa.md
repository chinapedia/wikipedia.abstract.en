The D-1 VISA is a non-immigrant visa which allows travel to United States for those serving as a crewman on marine vessel or aircraft, who will depart the US on the same vessel on which they arrived.[1] Those who will depart on a different vessel would normally instead qualify for a D-2 visa. Individuals are not eligible for a D-1 visa if their vessel is in dry dock, is a fishing vessel, they are a coasting officer, they are serving on a private yacht, or if they are destined for the outer continental shelf.[2] The maximum duration of stay is 29 days.[3]
