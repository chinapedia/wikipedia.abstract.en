_ABACUS: SMALL ENOUGH TO JAIL_ is a 2016 American documentary film by Steve James.[1] The film centers on the Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a family-owned community bank situated in Manhattan's Chinatown in New York City which, because it was deemed "small enough to jail" rather than "too big to fail", became the only financial institution to actually face criminal charges following the subprime mortgage crisis.[2]
