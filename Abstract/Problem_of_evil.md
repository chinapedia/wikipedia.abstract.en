The PROBLEM OF EVIL is the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God (see theism).[1][2] An ARGUMENT FROM EVIL claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of theodicy. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of theology and ethics.
