Cable car}} A CABLE CAR (usually known as a CABLE TRAM outside North America) is a type of cable railway used for mass transit where rail cars are hauled by a continuously moving cable running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are distinct from funiculars, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable, and cable railways, which are similar to funiculars, but where the rail vehicles are attached and detached manually.11_Cable_Car_on_Powell_St_crop,_SF,_CA,_jjron_25.03.2012.jpg on the Powell & Hyde line]] Cable_car.theora.ogv
