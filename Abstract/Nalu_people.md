The NALU PEOPLE are an African people who live in Guinea and Guinea Bissau. They speak the Nalu language. Their population is over 20,000. They have been described as "pre-Mandingas", as they settled in the region before the arrival of the Mandinka people.[1] In this respect Walter Rodney places them alongside the Landuma people, the Cocoli people, the Baga people and the Temne people.[2]
