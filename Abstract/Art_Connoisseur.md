ART CONNOISSEUR (foaled 20 March 2006) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for his upset victory in the 2009 edition of the Golden Jubilee Stakes. He showed high-class form as a two-year-old in 2008, winning his first three races including the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and then finishing second in a strong renewal of the Phoenix Stakes. In 2009 he was well-beaten on his seasonal debut before defeating a top-class international field in the Golden Jubilee Stakes at odds of 20/1. He failed to reproduce anything approaching his Ascot form in four subsequent starts and was retired from racing at the end of the year. He has had little success as a breeding stallion.
