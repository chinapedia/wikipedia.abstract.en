The BARNET CENTER HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a small cluster of buildings and a cemetery, which make up the original town center of Barnet, Vermont. Located on Barnet Center Road, it includes the 1849 Presbyterian church, vestry, and two residences, built between 1790 and 1898, as well as the town's first cemetery and a c. 1915 toolshed. It was the first town in Vermont to be settled by direct immigration from Scotland. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[1]
