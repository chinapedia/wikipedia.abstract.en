AYESHA MARY BARBARA VARDAG (born March 1968)[1] is an English solicitor specialising in family law. She has gained notoriety for representing in divorce proceedings high net worth individuals, such as members of the Royal Family,[2] heiresses,[3] international footballers, artists, professionals, entrepreneurs and celebrities.[4] Her first case of note came with her Supreme Court victory in the 2010 case _Radmacher v Granatino_, which shifted the attitude of the law on prenuptial agreements, making courts less reluctant to vary their stipulations in England and Wales.[5]
