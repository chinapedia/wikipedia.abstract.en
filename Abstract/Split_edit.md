A SPLIT EDIT, is a transition from one shot to another in film or video, where transition of the audio and video happen at different times.[1][2] This is often done to enhance the aesthetics or flow of the film, allowing the audience to see context—either before or after—of speaking rather than simply the speaking itself. Without split edit, a conversation between two people can feel like a tennis match.[3]
