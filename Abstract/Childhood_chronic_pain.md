ChildwithHeadAche_2010.jpg CHILDHOOD CHRONIC PAIN affects at least 5% of the population under the age of 18, according to conservative epidemiological studies. Rates of paediatric chronic pain have also increased in the past 20 years.[1] While chronic pain conditions vary significantly in severity, they often affect children's mental health, academic performance, and general quality of life.[2] The outcomes of childhood chronic pain are affected by a number of factors, including demographic factors, genetics, and school and family support.[3]
