FEMINISM is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.[1][2][3][4] Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unfairly within those societies.[5] Efforts to change that include fighting gender stereotypes and seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.
