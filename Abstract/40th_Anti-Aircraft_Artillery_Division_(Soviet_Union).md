The 40TH ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY DIVISION () was an anti-aircraft artillery division of the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II. Formed in the Volga Military District in June 1943, the division was sent into combat a year later with the 7th Army, fighting in the Svir-Petrozavodsk Offensive. The division then transferred to the 14th Army in October, and fought in the Petsamoâ€“Kirkenes Offensive. After the end of the offensive the division served with the army in northern Norway until the end of the war. The division was disbanded postwar.
