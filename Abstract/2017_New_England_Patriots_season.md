The 2017 NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS SEASON was the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League, the 58th overall and the 18th under head coach Bill Belichick. The New England Patriots entered the season as the defending champions of Super Bowl LI.[1] They failed to match their 14â€“2 record from last season with their Week 14 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[2] Despite that, in Week 15, the Patriots secured their 9th consecutive AFC East title, their 15th of the last 17 seasons, with their victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.[3] With their win over the Buffalo Bills in week 16, the Patriots obtained their 8th consecutive 12-or-more win season stretching all the way from 2010, an NFL record.[4] Their Week 17 victory over the New York Jets clinched their top seed in the AFC for the second straight year, thus giving the Patriots home-field advantage throughout the entire AFC playoffs for the second year in a row.[5]
