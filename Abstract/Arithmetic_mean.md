In mathematics and statistics, the ARITHMETIC MEAN (, stress on third syllable of "arithmetic"), or simply the mean or AVERAGE when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.[1] The collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study, or frequently a set of results from a survey. The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.
