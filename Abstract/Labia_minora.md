The LABIA MINORA (Latin for _smaller lips,_ singular: _labium minus_ "smaller lip"), also known as the INNER LABIA, INNER LIPS, VAGINAL LIPS or NYMPHAE,[1] are two flaps of skin on either side of the human vaginal opening in the vulva, situated between the labia majora (Latin for _larger lips;_ also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color and shape from individual to individual.
