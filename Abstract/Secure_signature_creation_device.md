A SECURE SIGNATURE CREATION DEVICE is a specific type of computer hardware or software that is used in creating an electronic signature. To be put into service as a secure signature creation device (SSCD), the device must meet the rigorous requirements laid out under Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS), where it is referred to as a qualified (electronic) signature creation device (QSCD). Using secure signature creation devices helps in facilitating online business processes that save time and money with transactions made within the public and private sectors.[1][2] [3]
