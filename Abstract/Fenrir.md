Odin_and_Fenris.jpg _' Fenrir_' (Old Norse: "fen-dweller")[1] or FENRISÚLFR (Old Norse: "Fenrir's wolf", often translated "Fenris-wolf"),[2] also referred to as HRÓÐVITNIR ("fame-wolf")[3] and VÁNAGANDR ("monster of the [River] Ván"),[4] or VANARGAND, is a monstrous wolf in Norse mythology. Fenrir is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the _Prose Edda_ and _Heimskringla_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both the _Poetic Edda_ and _Prose Edda_, Fenrir is the father of the wolves Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson, is a son of Loki, and is foretold to kill the god Odin during the events of Ragnarök, but will in turn be killed by Odin's son Víðarr.
