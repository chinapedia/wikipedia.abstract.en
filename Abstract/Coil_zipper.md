Coil_zipper.png COIL ZIPPER—also known as NYLON COIL ZIPPER—is a type of zipper whose teeth/elements are made from coiled monofilament that is traditionally nylon. The coil is sewn to a zipper tape to make the final product. The final zipper product is completed when the nylon coiled teeth are sewn onto the zipper tape. Nylon coil zippers have a continuous coil chain made from nylon. When this coil is positioned on the back of the zipper and not in the front, this kind of zipper is called invisible zipper.
