Seafarers_of_Catan_-_Midgame.jpg _CATAN: SEAFARERS_, or _SEAFARERS OF CATAN_ in older editions, () is an expansion of the board game _The Settlers of Catan_ for three to four players (five-to-six-player play is also possible with both of the respective five-to-six-player extensions). The main feature of this expansion is the addition of ships, gold rivers, and the pirate to the game, allowing play between multiple islands. The expansion also provides numerous scenarios, some of which have custom rules. The _Seafarers_ rules and scenarios are also, for the most part, compatible with _Catan: Cities & Knights_ and _Catan: Traders & Barbarians_.
