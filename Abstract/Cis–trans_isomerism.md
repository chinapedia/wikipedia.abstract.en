Cis-2-butene.svg Trans-2-butene.svg _CIS_–_TRANS_ ISOMERISM, also known as GEOMETRIC ISOMERISM or CONFIGURATIONAL ISOMERISM, is a term used in organic chemistry. The prefixes "_cis_" and "_trans_" are from Latin: "this side of" and "the other side of", respectively. In the context of chemistry, _cis_ indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain[1] while _trans_ conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain. Cis-trans isomers are stereoisomers, that is, pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three-dimensional space. It is not to be confused with _E_–_Z_ isomerism, which is an _absolute_ stereochemical description. In general, stereoisomers contain double bonds that do not rotate, or they may contain ring structures, where the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented.[2] _Cis_ and _trans_ isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes. _Cis_ and _trans_ descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert, such as most open-chain single-bonded structures; instead, the terms "_syn_" and "_anti_" are used.
