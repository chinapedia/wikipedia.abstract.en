Dr HORMASJI DORABJI KANGA (9 April 1880 - 29 December 1945) was an Indian cricketer who played first-class cricket for the Parsis (sometimes spelt Parsees) cricket team between 1899 and 1921 as an all-rounder and opening batsman. He was the first Indian to score a double century in a first-class match, and the Kanga Cricket League is named after him. His older twin brothers Dinshaw and MD also played first-class cricket for Parsees.[1][2]
