The EUROPEAN TRAINING STRATEGY (ETS) of the European Commission outlines findings, objectives, and measures to sustain the quality and recognition of youth work in Europe. It was introduced as part of the European Union's YOUTH programme (2000-2006) and is revised regularly in accordance with new youth programmes going into effect.[1] The most recent version adapts to Erasmus+, covering the time period between 2014 and 2020.[2][3]
