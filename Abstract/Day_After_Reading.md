DAY AFTER READING is an artistic & editorial documentary project started by Swiss graphic artist :de:Ludovic Balland in San Francisco in 2014. For the project, Balland interviews people about their consumption of the News. Essentially starting with "What did you read in the news yesterday?" the interviews consist of a set of standard questions, and others as interviewee availability permits. Common questions are about one's first memory of the news, how one gets their news currently, what the subject thinks the news will be like in the future, and whether they dream about the news.
