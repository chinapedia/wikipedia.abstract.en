DEBABELIZER (original name), renamed "DeBabelizer Pro" when DeBabelizer Lite, its single image transcoder was released, is a frame-based batch processor and image editor and file converter utility software developed during the 1990s by Equilibrium Technologies, Inc. (now Automated Media Processing Solutions, Inc. dba Equilibrium) for Mac OS and Windows. It was noted for handling over 50 bitmap graphics file types from many different platforms, growing to over 300 file types.[1] It could work either interactively displaying a interface similar to programs like Adobe Photoshop, however, before Photoshop had actions, DeBabelizer had the ability to WatchMe to create batch image processing task lists. DeBabelizer was one of the first programs that allowed Photoshop filters to be animated. DeBabelizer also had, before Automator on Macintosh existed, the ability to be controlled by AppleScript. This provided processing of content into and out of other third party applications. Over 500,000 copies of DeBabelizer Pro/Lite were sold worldwide having versions in German, French, Japanese and Korean.
