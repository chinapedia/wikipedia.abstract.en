The COMMON LANGUAGE INFRASTRUCTURE (CLI) is an open specification (technical standard) developed by Microsoft and standardized by ISO[1] and ECMA[2] that describes executable code and a runtime environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures. This implies it is platform agnostic. The .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, DotGNU and Portable.NET are implementations of the CLI.
