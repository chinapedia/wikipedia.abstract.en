TraceCache.png TRACE CACHE (also known as _execution trace cache_) is a very specialized cache which stores the dynamic stream of instructions known as _trace_. It helps in increasing the instruction fetch bandwidth and decreasing power consumption (in the case of Intel Pentium 4) by storing traces of instructions that have already been fetched and decoded.[1] Trace Processor[2] is an architecture designed around the Trace Cache and processes the instructions at trace level granularity.
