While there is no clear definition, a senior cat is generally considered to be either mature (7–10 years old), senior (11–15 years old) or geriatric (over 15 years old).[1] As the population of senior cats appears to be growing in North America based on numbers for geriatric populations, important nutritional considerations need to be made when choosing an appropriate diet for a healthy senior cat.[2] Dietary management of many age-related conditions becomes more important in senior cats because changes in their physiology and metabolism may alter how their system responds to various medications and treatments.[3][4]
