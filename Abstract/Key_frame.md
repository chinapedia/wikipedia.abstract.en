A KEYFRAME in animation and filmmaking is a drawing that defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition. The drawings are called as "FRAMES" because their position in time is measured in frames on a strip of film. A sequence of keyframes defines which movement the viewer will see, whereas the position of the keyframes on the film, video, or animation defines the timing of the movement. Because only two or three keyframes over the span of a second do not create the illusion of movement, the remaining frames are filled with inbetweens.
