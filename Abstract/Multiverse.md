The MULTIVERSE,[1] also known as an OMNIVERSE OR META-UNIVERSE, is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.[2][3][4][5] The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes", or "alternate universes".[6][7][8]
