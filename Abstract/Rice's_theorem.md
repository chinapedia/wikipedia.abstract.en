In computability theory, RICE'S THEOREM states that all non-trivial, semantic properties of programs are undecidable. A semantic property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, does the program terminate for all inputs), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, does the program contain an if-then-else statement). A property is _non-trivial_ if it is neither true for every computable function, nor false for every computable function.
