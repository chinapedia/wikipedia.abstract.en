TOM DAUGHERTY (born February 22, 1975) is a right-handed American professional ten-pin bowler residing in Riverview, Florida. He is a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), having joined in 2001. He is one of the few PBA bowlers to successfully use the one-handed no-thumb delivery. Although Daugherty has won two PBA Tour titles and nine PBA Regional titles, he is perhaps best known for rolling a nationally-televised 100 game at the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions, the lowest score ever bowled in a televised PBA event. He has accumulated 19 career 300 games in PBA events. Daugherty is a pro staff member for Hammer bowling balls, Dexter shoes, and Ultimate Inserts.[1]
