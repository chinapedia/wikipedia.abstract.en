7Β-HYDROXYEPIANDROSTERONE (7Β-OH-EPIA), also known as 5Α-ANDROSTAN-3Β,7Β-DIOL-17-ONE, is an endogenous androgen, estrogen, and neurosteroid that is produced from dehydroepiandrosterone and epiandrosterone.[1][2][3] It has neuroprotective effects and, along with 7α-hydroxyepiandrosterone, may mediate the neuroprotective effects of DHEA.[4]
