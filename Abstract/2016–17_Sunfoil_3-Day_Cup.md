The 2016–17 SUNFOIL 3-DAY CUP was a first-class cricket competition that took place in South Africa from 6 October 2016 to 9 April 2017.[1][2] The competition was played between the thirteen South African provincial teams and Namibia. Unlike its counterpart, the Sunfoil Series, the matches were three days in length instead of four. The tournament was played in parallel with the 2016–17 CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge, a List A competition which featured the same teams.
