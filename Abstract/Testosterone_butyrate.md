TESTOSTERONE BUTYRATE, or TESTOSTERONE BUTANOATE, also known as ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-BUTANOATE, is a synthetic, steroidal androgen and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β butanoate ester of testosterone – which was first synthesized in the 1930s and was never marketed.[1][2][3][4] Its ester side-chain length and duration of effect are intermediate between those of testosterone propionate and testosterone valerate.[5]
