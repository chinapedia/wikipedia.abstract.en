CYCLIC ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE (CAMP, CYCLIC AMP, or 3',5'-CYCLIC ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE) is a second messenger important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway. It should not be confused with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase).
