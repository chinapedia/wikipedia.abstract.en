MALGIUM is a hitherto unidentified ancient Mesopotamian city which thrived especially in the Middle Bronze Age, ca. 2000 BC - 1600 BC.[1] Located on the river Tigris, south of where the Diyala River branches off and upstream of Maškan-šapir, it formed a small city-state in an area where the edges of the territories controlled by Larsa, Babylon and Elam converged.[2] Inscribed in cuneiform as ma-al-gi-im^(KI), its chief deities were Ea and Damkina.[3]
