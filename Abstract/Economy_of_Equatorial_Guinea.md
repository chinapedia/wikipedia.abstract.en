Equatorial Guinea is a small nation of 1.2 million located on the west coast of Central Africa which gained independence from Spain in 1968. Thanks to the discovery and exploitation of significant oil reserves in the 1990s, it enjoys a purchasing power parity GDP per capita of more than US$38,699 which is as of 2016 the highest in Africa and the 31st highest in the world. However, the country has been ranked only 138th out of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index in 2015. After the oil price collapsed in 2014, the economy has gone into a free for all which has put growth in a downwards spiral from around 15% to âˆ’10%.
