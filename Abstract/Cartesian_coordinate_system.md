Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg A CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM (, ) is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical COORDINATES, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a _coordinate axis_ or just _axis_ (plural _axes_) of the system, and the point where they meet is its _origin_, at ordered pair . The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.
