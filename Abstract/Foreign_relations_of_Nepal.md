Though the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is the government agency responsible for the conduct of FOREIGN RELATIONS OF NEPAL, historically, it is the OFFICE OF PRIME MINISTER (PMO) that has exercised the authority to formulate and conduct policies related to Nepal's foreign affairs. As a landlocked country wedged between two larger and far stronger powers, Nepal has tried to maintain good relations with both of its neighbor, People's Republic of China and Republic of India.[1] However, relationship with India, the country with greater hegemonic power over Nepal, has seen major ups and downs in recent years. Given Nepal's geographical vulnerabilities, traditionally Nepal's southern neighbor India, has been able to shape Nepal's foreign policy to serve India's interest even to the detriment of Nepal's own interest. However, with the ongoing democratization of Nepal, and, shifting of the state-power from the hands of few elitists to democratically elected government institution, India has been facing increasing resistance within Nepal in implementing foreign policies that are detrimental to Nepal's own interest. In recent years, Indian government's attempts to deny landlocked Nepal 'Transit rights' via India as a fundamental right for a member of the UN, as guaranteed in the UN charter, and, the issues of occupation of some Nepalese territories by Indian forces have significantly hampered the relationship between the two countries.[2] For most part though, Nepal has traditionally maintained a non-aligned policy and enjoys friendly relations with neighboring countries and almost all the major countries of the world.
