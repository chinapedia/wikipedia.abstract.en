DESERT TRIP was a six-day music festival that took place on October 7–9 and 14–16, 2016, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, United States. The performers were the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Roger Waters, and The Who.[1][2] The festival was dubbed "Oldchella" by _Stereogum_ a few weeks before it was officially announced, referencing both the age of the performers and the fact that the concert was arranged by Goldenvoice, the company that also promotes the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[3]
