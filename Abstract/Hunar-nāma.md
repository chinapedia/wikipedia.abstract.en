_HUNAR-NĀMA_ ('the book of excellence', also transliterated _Honarnāme_) is a 487-distich Persian _mathnavī_ poem composed by ‘Uthmān Mukhtārī at Tabas in the period 500-508 (1105-13 CE), when he was at the court of Seljuqs in Kirmān. The poem is dedicated to the ruler of Tabas, Yamīn al-Dowla (aka Ḥisām ad-Dīn Yamīn ad-Dowla Shams al-Ma‘ālī Abū ’l-Muẓaffar Amīr Ismā‘īl Gīlakī, and can be read as a 'letter of application' demonstrating Mukhtārī's skill as a court poet.[1] It has been characterised as 'perhaps the most interesting of the poems dedicated to Gīlākī'.[2]
