Christianity_percent_population_in_each_nation_World_Map_Christian_data_by_Pew_Research.svg CHRISTENDOM[1][2] has several meanings. In one contemporary sense, as used in a secular or Protestant context, it may refer to the "Christian world": Christian-majority countries and the countries in which Christianity dominates[3] or prevails,[4] or, in the historic, Catholic sense of the word, the nations in which Catholic Christianity is the established religion, having a Catholic Christian polity.[5]
