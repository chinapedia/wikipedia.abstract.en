The_Craigy_Bield_by_David_Allan.jpg The BLUE BONNET was a type of soft woollen hat that for several hundred years was the customary working wear of Scottish labourers and farmers. Although a particularly broad and flat form was associated with the Scottish Lowlands, where it was sometimes called the "scone cap",[1] the bonnet was also worn in parts of northern England and became widely adopted in the Highlands.
