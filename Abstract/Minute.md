The MINUTE is a unit of time or angle. As a unit of time, the minute is most of times equal to (the first sexagesimal fraction[1]) of an hour, or 60 seconds. In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system). As a unit of angle, the minute of arc is equal to of a degree, or 60 seconds (of arc). Although not an SI unit for either time or angle, the minute is accepted for use with SI units for both.[2] The SI symbols for _minute_ or _minutes_ are MIN for time measurement, and the prime symbol after a number, e.g. 5â€², for angle measurement. The prime is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time.
