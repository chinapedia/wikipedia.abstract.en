In poker, the NUT HAND is the strongest possible hand in a given situation. The SECOND-NUT HAND or THIRD-NUT HAND (and so on) may refer to the second and third best possible hands. The term applies mostly to community card poker games where the individual holding the strongest possible hand, with the given board of community cards, is capable of knowing that they have the nut hand.
