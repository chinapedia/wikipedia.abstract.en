LIN LEE, full name , is a fictional character from Monolith Soft's 2015 role-playing video game _Xenoblade Chronicles X_, part of their overarching _Xeno_ series of video games. The character herself was generally well received by critics, though Nintendo's alteration of some of her more revealing outfits between the original Japanese and her Western release in North America and Europe received more of a mixed response, eliciting much discussion about censorship and differences between cultures from journalists.
