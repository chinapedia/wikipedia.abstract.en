CASPAR VOPEL (1511–1561) was a German cartographer and instrument maker. Born in Medebach, he studied mathematics and medicine at the University of Cologne in 1526–1529.[1] He taught mathematics at the Gymnasium of Cologne and in the early 1530s established a workshop to produce celestial and terrestrial globes, armillary spheres, sundials, quadrants and astrolabes.[2] In 1545 he began to prepare maps and atlases.[3] His mappemonde of 1545 is titled _NOVA ET INTEGRA VNIVERSALISQVE ORBIS TOTIVS IVXTA GERMANVM NEOTERICORVM TRADITIONEM DESCRIPTIO_ (A New Complete and Universal Description of the Whole World, according to the Modern German Tradition).[4] Vopel is sometimes credited with the promotion of the ancient asterism Coma Berenices to constellation status.[5]
