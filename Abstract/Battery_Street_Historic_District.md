The BATTERY STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses one of the oldest developed areas of Burlington, Vermont. With a history dating to 1790, this area, south of downtown Burlington and initially bounded roughly by Main, St. Paul, and Maple Streets, and Lake Champlain, this area includes a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses, with architecture spanning from its early period to the 20th century, including one of the city's oldest houses. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and has twice been enlarged, extending west to South Union Street.[1]
