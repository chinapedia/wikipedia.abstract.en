InfantBaptism.jpg INFANT BAPTISM[1][2] is the practice of baptising infants or young children. In theological discussions, the practice is sometimes referred to as PAEDOBAPTISM, or PEDOBAPTISM, from the Greek _pais_ meaning "child". This can be contrasted with what is called "believer's baptism", or CREDOBAPTISM, from the Latin word _credo_ meaning "I believe", which is the religious practice of baptising only individuals who personally confess faith in Jesus, therefore excluding underage children. Opposition to infant baptism is termed CATABAPTISM. Infant baptism is also called "christening" by some faith traditions.
