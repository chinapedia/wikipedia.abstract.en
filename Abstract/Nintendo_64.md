The NINTENDO 64 (officially abbreviated as N64, model number: NUS,[1] stylized as NINTENDO⁶⁴) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America and Brazil, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, and September 1997 in France. It was the last major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format until the Nintendo Switch in 2017.[2] The Nintendo 64 was discontinued in mid-2002 following the launch of its successor, the GameCube, in 2001.
