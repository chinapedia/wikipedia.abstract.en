BC LIQUOR STORES are a chain of crown corporation retail outlets operated by the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch to distribute alcoholic beverages in the province of British Columbia, Canada.[1] They are accountable to the Attorney General of British Columbia.[2] BC Liquor Stores currently operate 196 locations across the province.[3] The chain was established in June 1921, following the result of a plebiscite in favour of liquor availability through government liquor stores.[4] Prior to the plebiscite, alcohol had been illegal through the _Prohibition Act_, introduced on May 23, 1916, with exceptions to sacramental, medicinal or industrial purposes.[5]
