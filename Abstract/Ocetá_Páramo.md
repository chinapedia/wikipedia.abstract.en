The OCETÁ PÁRAMO (Spanish: _Páramo de Ocetá_) is a páramo at altitudes between and in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. It covers parts of the municipalities Monguí, Mongua and Tópaga, belonging to the Sugamuxi Province, Boyacá. The Ocetá Páramo is known for its collection of frailejones and other flora, as well as Andean fauna. Hiking tours from Monguí or Mongua to the páramo take a full day.
