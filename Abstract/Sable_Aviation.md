Sable Aviation operates a BN-2A-21 Britten-Norman Islander, with an oversize tire modification that allows it to land safely on the sandy south beach of Sable. The flights run year-round on an as-needed basis, providing support to the Sable Island Station by bringing out supplies, station personnel, researchers, contractors, etc. Sable Aviation also flies out tourist groups who are interested in visiting the Sable Island National Park Reserve.
