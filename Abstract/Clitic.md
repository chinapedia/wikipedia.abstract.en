A CLITIC (, backformed from Greek "leaning" or "enclitic") is a morpheme in morphology and syntax that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependentâ€”always attached to a host.[1] The term derives from the Greek for _leaning_.[2] A clitic is pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at the phrase level. In other words, clitics have the _form_ of affixes, but the distribution of function words. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in _I'm_ and _we've_ are clitics.
