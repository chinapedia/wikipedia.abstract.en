The SYRIAN CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH (also known as SCPR) is an independent, non-governmental, and non-profit think tank based in Syria. It seeks to bridge the gap between the research and policy making processes through public policy oriented research. As an organization, it claims to develop a participatory evidence-based policy dialogue, intending to achieve policy alternatives that promote sustainable, inclusive, and human-centered development.
