SMOKING IN VIETNAM is highly common, with an estimated 50% of men and 5% of women using tobacco, an estimated 18 million smokers.[1] 47 million non-smokers in Vietnam are also regularly exposed to tobacco smoke.[2] Vietnamâ€™s Health Education and Communication Center estimates that 40,000 people die annually in Vietnam from first or second hand smoking, and that if nothing is done 10% of the Vietnamese population will have died from smoking by 2030.[3][4] Smoking is an integral part of Vietnamese culture and exchanging cigarettes is seen as a common greeting.[5]
