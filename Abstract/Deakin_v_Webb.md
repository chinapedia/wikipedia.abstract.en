_DEAKIN V WEBB_[1] was one of a series of cases concerning whether the States could tax the income of a Commonwealth officer. The High Court of Australia overruled a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, holding that the States could not tax the income of a Commonwealth officer. This resulted in conflict with the Privy Council, a conflict which was ultimately resolved by the passage of Commonwealth law in 1907, that permitted the States to tax the income of a Commonwealth officer.[2] The constitutional foundation of the decision was overturned by the subsequent decision of the High Court in the 1920 _Engineers' Case_.[3]
