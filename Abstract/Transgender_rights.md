A person may be considered to be a transgender person if their gender identity is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, and consequently also with the gender role and social status that is typically associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. _Transsexual_ is generally considered a subset of _transgender_,[1][2][3] but some transsexual people reject being labelled _transgender_.[4][5][6][7]
