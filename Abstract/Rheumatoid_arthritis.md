'''Rheumatoid arthritis ''' (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints.[1] It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints.[2] Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest.[3] Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.[4] The disease may also affect other parts of the body.[5] This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart.[6] Fever and low energy may also be present.[7] Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.[8]
