BACILLUS CALMETTE–GUÉRIN (BCG) VACCINE is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB).[1] In countries where tuberculosis or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible.[2] In areas where tuberculosis is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated.[3] Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well.[4] BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections.[5] Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer.[6][7]
