THE TRAITS were an American garage rock band formed in New Rochelle, New York, in 1967. The group's brief career is highlighted by their role as the studio recording band for the novelty song "Nobody Loves the Hulk", released in 1969. At the time of its distribution it was publicized by Marvel Comics, and since then the tune has appeared on compilation albums, covered by other artists, and remains a peculiar artifact among Marvel enthusiasts.
