1,3-DIFLUORO-TRISULFANE-1,1-DIFLUORIDE is an inorganic molecular substance consisting of sulfur in a low oxidation state with fluorine. The structural formula is SF₃SSF containing a chain of three sulfur atoms. At one end there are three fluorine atoms bound, and at the other one. The formula can also be written S₃F₄. It has a melting point of -62°C and a boiling point of 94°C. As a gas, it is unstable and breaks up to form SSF₂ and SF₄.[1]
