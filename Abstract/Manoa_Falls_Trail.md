MÄ€NOA FALLS TRAIL is a 1.6 mile trail on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.[1] The trail is a part of the Honolulu Makau Trail System, and leads to a popular 150 foot waterfall called Manoa Falls.[2] Hiking the trail is approximately a one-hour round trip.[3] Many tourists are attracted to the waterfall and scenery throughout the trail. The trails have a history as one of the earlier Hawaiian trails. There are many legends of the Night Marchers, or ancient Hawaiian warriors associated with Manoa Falls.[4] Scenes in movies such as Jurassic Park[5] and Catching Fire[6] were filmed at Manoa Falls. The Manoa Falls trail harbors many native Hawaiian plant species and tropical birds as well.[7] The Lyon Arboretum, located in the Manoa Valley at the base of the trail is another popular tourist attraction and aims to preserve endangered Hawaiian plants. Rain showers are very common in on the trail and the path to the waterfall is often muddy and slippery. Flash floods may also occur at any time.[8] Swimming in the pools of water on the trail is highly discouraged due to the threat of Leptospirosis.[9]
