AMBROSIUS AURELIANUS (; Anglicised as AMBROSE AURELIAN and called AURELIUS AMBROSIUS in the _Historia Regum Britanniae_ and elsewhere) was a war leader of the Romano-British who won an important battle against the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th century, according to Gildas. He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century _Historia Brittonum_. Eventually he was transformed into the uncle of King Arthur, the brother of Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, and predeceases them both.
