The ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT (ACC) is an ocean current that flows clockwise from west to east around Antarctica. An alternative name for the ACC is the WEST WIND DRIFT. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the Southern Ocean and has a mean transport estimated at 100-150 Sverdrups (Sv, million m³/s),[1] or possibly even higher,[2] making it the largest ocean current. The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet.
