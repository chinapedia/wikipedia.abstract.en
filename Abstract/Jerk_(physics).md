In physics, JERK is the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the time derivative of acceleration, and as such the second derivative of velocity, or the third time derivative of position. According to the result of dimensional analysis of jerk, [length/time³], the SI units for its magnitude are m/s³ (or m⋅s^(−3)); this can also be expressed in standard gravity per second (_g_/s).
