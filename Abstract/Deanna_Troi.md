Commander DEANNA TROI is a main character in the science-fiction television series _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and related TV series and films, portrayed by actress Marina Sirtis. Troi is half-human, half-Betazoid and has the psionic ability to sense emotions. She serves as the ship's counselor on USS _Enterprise_-D. Throughout most of the series, she holds the rank of lieutenant commander. In the seventh season, however, Troi takes the bridge officer's examination and is promoted to the rank of commander, but continues as counselor. Deanna and Riker were the last _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ main cast members to appear on television in the 2005 finale of the later _Star Trek: Enterprise_ TV show, until Patrick Stewart announced he would return to the role of Jean-Luc Picard in 2019 in _Star Trek: Picard_. Deanna appears in all four _TNG_ theatrical films, and also in three episodes of _Star Trek: Voyager_.
