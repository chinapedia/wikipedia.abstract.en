The UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA is the second largest economy in the East African Community and the tenth largest in Africa. The country is largely dependent on agriculture for employment, accounting for about half of the employed workforce. The economy has been transitioning from a command economy to a market economy since 1985. Although total GDP has increased since these reforms began, GDP per capita dropped sharply at first, and only exceeded the pre-transition figure in around 2007.[1]
