AFRICAN AMERICANS constitute one of the longer-running ethnic presences in New York City. The majority of the African American population were forcibly abducted from their villages in West and Central Africa and brought to the American South via the Atlantic slave trade, with smaller portions of the population being abducted from Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Latin American, and more recent Sub-Saharan African nations.
