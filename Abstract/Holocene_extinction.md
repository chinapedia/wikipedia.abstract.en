The HOLOCENE EXTINCTION, otherwise referred to as the SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION or ANTHROPOCENE EXTINCTION, is a current event, and is one of the most significant extinction events in the history of the Earth. This ongoing extinction of species coincides with the present Holocene epoch (approx. 11,700 years), and is a result of human activity.[1][2] This large number of extinctions spans numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be _undocumented_, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.[3][4][5][6][7][8] The _Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services_ published by IPBES in 2019 posits that roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction caused by anthropogenic impacts.[9][10]
