FARM NO. 1, IOWA MEN'S REFORMATORY, also known as the WEST FARM, is located west of Anamosa, Iowa, United States. It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.[1] At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 10 resources, including seven contributing buildings, and three non-contributing buildings.[2] When the property for the reformatory was acquired by the State of Iowa in 1872 it included of farmland. Farming at the facility did not become a significant enterprise here until the turn of the 20th century. Before then the prisoners maintained a vegetable garden within the walls, and they raised sixty-five hogs. The state bought of land in 1904 for farming operations and built a hog house and a stone barn, both are no longer extant. Minimum security prisoners did the farm work. The historic buildings were built between 1912 and 1939. They are all stone structures built in a simplified Romanesque Revival style. The influence of the style is found in the "heavy massing, texture of the stone, and the window, door, and corner treatments."[3] The buildings were built for the following uses: South barn (1912, 1926 addition), barn granary (1915), root cellar (1919), North barn (c. 1919), slaughter house (1921-1922), processing plant (1922), and the seed house, dining hall, cold frame (1939).
