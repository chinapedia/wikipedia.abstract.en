66Ã¨me_Festival_de_Venise_(Mostra)_Palais_du_Cinema.jpg is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the most prestigious and publicized]] A FILM FESTIVAL is an organized, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region. Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.[1] Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases. Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e.g., film noir) or subject matter (e.g., horror film festivals). A number of film festivals specialise in short films of a defined maximum length. Film festivals are typically annual events. Some film historians, including Jerry Beck,[2] do not consider film festivals official releases of film.
