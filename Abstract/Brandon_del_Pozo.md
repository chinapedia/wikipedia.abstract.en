BRANDON DEL POZO (born 1974) is the chief of police in the city of Burlington, Vermont, United States. He assumed the position on September 1, 2015.[1] His appointment was contested by some locals due to his prior work with the New York Police Department (NYPD)[2] and an article about racial profiling he published in a peer-reviewed law journal in 2002.[3] After a public discussion of this work of scholarship and his views, his nomination was unanimously approved by the Burlington City Council.[4]
