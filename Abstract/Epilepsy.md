EPILEPSY is a group of neurological disorders characterized by epileptic seizures.[1][2] Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking.[3] These episodes can result in physical injuries, including occasionally broken bones.[4] In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and, as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause.[5] Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy.[6] People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition.[7]
