The ROBINHOOD FREE MEETINGHOUSE is a historic church building at 210 Robinhood Road in Georgetown, Maine. Built in 1856, it is a modest example of vernacular Greek Revival architecture, distinctive as one of Maine's few rural 19th-century churches to have its sanctuary space on the second floor. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016;[1] it has recently been converted for use as a restaurant.
