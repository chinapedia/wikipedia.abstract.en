The BRIGADÉR HALLING HOUSE is a listed property at Lille Strandstræde 14 in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It takes its name after William Halling, a Dane who acquired the building shortly after returning to Denmark from India where he had served in the British army. He was known as Brigadér Halling (Brigadér von Hallling) after he acquired the _Brigadér_ title in 1872. The building now houses the Maltese embassy.
