The 1996 DNIPRODZERZHYNSK TRAM ACCIDENT occurred on 2 July 1996, in Dniprodzerzhynsk (now Kamianske), Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, when an overcrowded tram derailed during the evening rush hour, and crashed into a concrete wall. An investigation by the local railway department discovered that the brakes on the tram car failed as it was going down a hill. The derailment and subsequent crash killed a total of 34 people, and left over 100 others injured. The incident was the deadliest tram accident in the Ukraine,[1] and one of the deadliest tram disasters anywhere in the world, surpassing the 1954 Zagreb tram accident which killed 19 people.[2]
