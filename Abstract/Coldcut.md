COLDCUT are an English electronic music duo composed of Matt Black and Jonathan More. Credited as pioneers for pop sampling in the 1980s,[1] Coldcut are also considered the first stars of UK electronic dance music [2] due to their innovative style, which featured cut-up samples of hip-hop, soul, funk, spoken word and various other types of music, as well as video and multimedia. According to _Spin_, "in '87 Coldcut pioneered the British fad for 'DJ records'".[3]
