__, also known as __ ( 787) is an 1823 one-act singspiel by Franz Schubert after a libretto by Ignaz Franz Castelli with spoken dialogue by the composer. Castelli's libretto was based on _Lisistrata, ou Les Athéniennes, Comédie en un acte et en prose, mêlée de vaudevilles_ by François-Benoît Hoffman, which had premiered at the Théâtre Feydeau in Paris in 1802. The French play in turn was based on _Lysistrata_ by Aristophanes (411 BCE).
