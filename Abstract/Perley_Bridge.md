The PERLEY BRIDGE was a bridge connecting Hawkesbury, Ontario and Grenville, Quebec. It crossed the Ottawa River via Chenail Island. It was named for George Perley, Canadian Member of Parliament representing the Argenteuil district in southern Quebec. He first advocated for a crossing at Hawkesbury in 1909. The bridge was known as the Hawkesbury–Grenville Bridge, or less frequently the Grenville–Hawkesbury Bridge prior to its completion in 1931 when the name Perley was applied. It was replaced by the Long-Sault Bridge in 1998.
