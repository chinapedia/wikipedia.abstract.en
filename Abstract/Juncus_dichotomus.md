_JUNCUS DICHOTOMUS_ (common name is FORKED RUSH[1]) is a monocot which belongs to the Juncaceae family of rushes. The plant is native in the Americas in temperate zones but has been introduced to other parts of the world. The species is often confused with other _Juncus_ plants due to morphological similarity. _Juncus dichotomus_ often is found in areas which prove to be very moist, and rainfall is a common occurrence. _Juncus dichotomus_ is often most recognizable in the spring and summer months of the year due to its conspicuous flowers and infructescence.
