In computer science, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), sometimes called MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the NATURAL INTELLIGENCE displayed by humans. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
