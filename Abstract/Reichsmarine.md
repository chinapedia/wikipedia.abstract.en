The _REICHSMARINE_ (, "Navy of the Realm") was the name of the German Navy during the Weimar Republic and first two years of Nazi Germany.[1] It was the naval branch of the _Reichswehr_, existing from 1919 to 1935. In 1935, it became known as the _Kriegsmarine_, a branch of the _Wehrmacht_; a change implemented by Adolf Hitler. Many of the administrative and organizational tenets of the _Reichsmarine_ were then carried over into the organization of the _Kriegsmarine_.[2]
