The_pagan_tribes_of_Borneo;_a_description_of_their_physical,_moral_and_intellectual_condition,_with_some_discussion_of_their_ethnic_relations_(1912)_(14598224757).jpg The KLEMANTAN PEOPLE were a purported ethnic group indigenous to the island of Borneo. The term was established in Western literature by British scientist and colonial administrator Charles Hose in the early 20th century, but has since been rejected as an invented term of convenience that does not properly represent the people it claims to describe.[1] Since then, the term has fallen largely out of use.
