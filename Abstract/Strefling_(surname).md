STREFLING is an uncommon surname that originates in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, England. It is a variant of Stribling from the Old English Stryplynge which means "a youth".[1] Perhaps the name was given to a person with a youthful appearance. The most recent adaptation of the Strefling surname occurred in the Ukraine in the late 1800s and was solidified when the Ukrainian-German Strefling family immigrated to North America.
