The PIBOR MASSACRE occurred in Pibor County, South Sudan from 23 December 2011 to 4 January 2012. The fighting was between the Murle and the Lou Nuer, mostly over raiding cattle and abducting children to raise as their own. The Nuer White Army released a statement stating its intention to "wipe out the entire Murle tribe on the face of the earth as the only solution to guarantee long-term security of Nuerâ€™s cattle".[1] A report by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan estimated that about 900 were killed.[2][3] Joshua Konyi, the commissioner of Pibor County and a Murle, estimated that 2,182 women and children and 959 men were killed, 1,293 children were abducted and 375,186 cows were stolen.[4]
