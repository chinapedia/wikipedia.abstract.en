SOYUZ MS-10 was a manned Soyuz MS spaceflight which aborted shortly after launch on 11 October 2018[1][2] due to a failure of the Soyuz-FG launch vehicle boosters.[3][4] MS-10 was the 139th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. It was intended to transport two members of the Expedition 57 crew to the International Space Station. A few minutes after liftoff, the craft went into contingency abort due to a booster failure and had to return to Earth. By the time the contingency abort was declared, the launch escape system (LES) tower had already been ejected and the capsule was pulled away from the rocket using the launch escape solid rocket motors on the capsule fairing.[5] Both crew members, Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, were recovered alive in good health.[6] The MS-10 flight abort was the first instance of a Russian manned booster accident in 35 years, since Soyuz T-10-1 exploded on the launch pad in September 1983.[7][8][9][10] On 1 November 2018, Russian scientists released a video recording of the mission.[11]
