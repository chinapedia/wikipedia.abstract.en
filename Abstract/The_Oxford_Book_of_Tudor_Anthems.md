_THE OXFORD BOOK OF TUDOR ANTHEMS_ is a collection of vocal scores of music from the Tudor era of England (c.1550-1625). It was published in 1978 by Oxford University Press and was compiled by the organist and publisher Christopher Morris (1922-2014), the editor of OUP who also launched the popular _Carols for Choirs_ series of books in the 1970s.[1] The preface is written Sir David Willcocks.
