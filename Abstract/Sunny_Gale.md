SUNNY GALE (born SELMA SEGA, February 20, 1927) is a retired American pop singer who was popular in the 1950s. Gale reached the _Billboard_ Hot 100 several times throughout the earlier half of the decade, scoring her biggest R& B hit with "Wheel of Fortune" with the Ed Wilcox Orchestra in 1952, prompting Capitol to cover the recording (in almost exactly the same arrangement) by Kay Starr for a #1 pop hit the same year.
