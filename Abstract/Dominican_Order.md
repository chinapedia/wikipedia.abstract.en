The ORDER OF PREACHERS (, postnominal abbreviation OP), also known as the DOMINICAN ORDER, is a mendicant Catholic religious order founded by the Spanish priest Dominic of Caleruega (also called Dominic de Guzm√°n) in France, approved by Pope Innocent III via the Papal bull _Religiosam vitam_ on 22 December 1216. Members of the order, who are referred to as _Dominicans_, generally carry the letters _OP_ after their names, standing for _Ordinis Praedicatorum_, meaning _of the Order of Preachers_. Membership in the order includes friars,[1] nuns, active sisters, and affiliated lay or secular Dominicans (formerly known as tertiaries, though recently there has been a growing number of associates who are unrelated to the tertiaries).
