KOWTOW, which is borrowed from _kau tau_ in Cantonese (_ketou_ in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one's head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is _ketou_; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: _kou_ () has the general meaning of _knock_, whereas _ke_ () has the general meaning of "touch upon (a surface)", _tou_ () meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the Spring and Autumn period, or the Warring States period of China's history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the Qin dynasty (221 BC â€“ 206 BC).
