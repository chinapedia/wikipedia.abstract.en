Narcissus-Caravaggio_(1594-96)_edited.jpg depicts Narcissus gazing at his own reflection.]] In Greek mythology, NARCISSUS (; Ancient Greek: Νάρκισσος _Nárkissos_) was a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia who was known for his beauty. According to Tzetzes, he was a Laconian hunter who loved everything beautiful.[1] Narcissus was proud, in that he disdained those who loved him, causing some to commit suicide to prove their unrelenting devotion to his striking beauty. Narcissus is the origin of the term _narcissism_, a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance or public perception.
