ALICE SPRINGS (foaled 4 May 2013) is an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. As a two-year-old in 2015 she failed to win a group race but showed consistently high-class form, winning a valuable sales race, finishing second in the Silver Flash Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf, third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes and fourth in the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she was beaten in her first four races but finished third in both the 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes. She then won three Group One races in her next four starts taking the Falmouth Stakes, Matron Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes.
