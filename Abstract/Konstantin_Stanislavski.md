KONSTANTIN SERGEIEVICH STANISLAVSKI (_n√©_ ALEXEIEV; ; 7 August 1938) was a seminal Russian theatre practitioner.[1] He was widely recognised as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation.[2] His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his 'system' of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.[3]
