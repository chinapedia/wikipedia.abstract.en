The CHICAGO LIGHTING INSTITUTE opened on April 11, 1930 as an educational and marketing association for the lighting industry in the Midwest. Supported by five full corporate members and fifty associate corporate members, it sought to acquaint architects, interior designers, electrical engineers, urban planners and the general public with the latest developments and applications in lighting. It was the largest cooperative Institute fostering better lighting practices in the United States and, as such, was the pioneer U.S. institution promoting appropriate use of light in the earlier years of the lighting industry.[1] In 1968, after thirty-eight years of service, the Institute merged with the Chicago Electric Association.[2]
