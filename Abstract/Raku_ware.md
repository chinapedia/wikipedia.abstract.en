Hon'ami_Koetsu_Fujisan_1.jpg) by Honami K≈çetsu, Edo period, 17th century. National Treasure.]] Colorful_Handmade_Raku_Pottery_Pitcher.jpg is a type of Japanese pottery traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies, most often in the form of _chawan_ tea bowls. It is traditionally characterised by being hand-shaped rather than thrown, fairly porous vessels, which result from low firing temperatures, lead glazes and the removal of pieces from the kiln while still glowing hot. In the traditional Japanese process, the fired raku piece is removed from the hot kiln and is allowed to cool in the open air. The familiar technique of placing the ware in a container filled with combustible material is not a traditional Raku practice.
