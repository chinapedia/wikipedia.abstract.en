ABD AL-RAHMAN III (_′Abd al-Rahmān ibn Muhammad ibn ′Abd Allāh ibn Muhammad ibn ′abd al-Rahman ibn al-Hakam al-Rabdi ibn Hisham ibn ′abd al-Rahman al-Dakhil_; ();[1] 11 January 889/91[2]15 October 961) was an Arab Emir and Caliph of Córdoba (912–961) of the Umayyad dynasty in al-Andalus. Called _al-Nasir li-Din Allah_ ("the Defender of God's Faith"), he ascended the throne in his early 20s and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of Iberia.[3] Although people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and freedom of religion under his rule, he repelled the Fatimids, partly by supporting their Maghrawa enemies in North Africa, and partly by claiming the title Caliph (ruler of the Islamic world) for himself.
