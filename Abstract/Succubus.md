Succubus_bracket_02.jpg 45_El_s√∫cubo.jpg'', an 1889 sculpture by Auguste Rodin]] A SUCCUBUS is a demon in female form, or supernatural entity in folklore (traced back to medieval legend), that appears in dreams and takes the form of a woman in order to seduce men, usually through sexual activity. The male counterpart to the succubus is the incubus. Religious traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or mental state, or even death.
