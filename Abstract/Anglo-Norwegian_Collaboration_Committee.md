The ANGLO-NORWEGIAN COLLABORATION COMMITTEE, or ANCC, was a joint military committee during World War II composed of British and Norwegian military officers, which was tasked with controlling covert operations on occupied Norwegian territory and to ensure the 'harmonious working between British and Norwegians in this country [Great Britain] and full confidence and cooperation between them'.[1]
