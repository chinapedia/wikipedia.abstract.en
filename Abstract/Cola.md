COLA is a sweetened, carbonated soft drink flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils and other flavorings. Most contain caffeine, which was originally sourced from the kola nut, leading to the drink's name, though other sources are now also used. Cola became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886.[1][2] His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863.[3]
