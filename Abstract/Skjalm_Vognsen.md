SKJALM VOGNSEN (born ??? - died 1215) was a bishop between 1204 and 1215 in the Ancient See of Aarhus in Aarhus, Denmark. Skjalm Vognsen was the brother of his predecessor Peder Vognsen. Skjalm Vognsen was first a canon at Lund Cathedral under Bishop Absalon until he became archdeacon in Aarhus Cathedral under his brother. In 1204 Peder Vognsen died and Skjalm became bishop after him. Through large gifts of land he secured Aarhus Cathedral greater revenue and expanded it with more prebends. With support from Pope Innocent III and king Valdemar Sejr he continued the construction of Aarhus Cathedral although he never got to finish it. Skjalm Vognsen died in 1215 and was buried next to Absalon in Sor√∏ Convent Church.[1]
