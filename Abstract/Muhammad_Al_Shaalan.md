Lieutenant General MUHAMMAD BIN AHMED AL-SHAALAN (; died June 2015) was a Saudi military officer and commander of the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) from 2014 up until his death in London.[1] Al-Shaalan was initially reported to have died from a heart attack outside the country by the Saudi Ministry of Defense, during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war. In early June 2015, several Scud missiles were fired by the Houthis from Yemen and hit King Khalid Air Base, which serves as the center of the Saudi bombing campaign against them, and the Shia Houthis militia claimed he was killed in the missile attack.[2][3] Al Shaalan was from a tribal family that spans Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and southern Iraq.[4]
