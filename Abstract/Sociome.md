The SOCIOME is a concept used by scientists in Biology and Sociology referring to the dimensions of existence that are social. The term is also an indication of the convergence of systems biology and the study of society as a complex system that has begun to occur among early 21st Century scientists. Just as the _phenome_ is typically thought of as the set of expressed phenotypes of an organism, the sociome can be thought of as the set of observed characteristics of societies. For example, while all societies consisting of humans might be thought of as having the potential to become egalitarian social democracies, not all observed societies are egalitarian or social democracies. Thus, the sociome can also be thought of indirectly as an ideal type of the unrealized potential of any given organization of social beings.
