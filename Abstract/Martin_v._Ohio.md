_MARTIN V. OHIO_, 480 U.S. 228 (1987), is a criminal case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the presumption of innocence requiring prosecution to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt only applies to elements of the offense, and does not extend to the defense of justification, whereby states could legislate a burden on the defense to prove justification.[1] The decision was split 5-4.[2] The decision does not preclude states from requiring such a burden on the prosecution in their laws.[3]
