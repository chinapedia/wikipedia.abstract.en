Mt._Aetna_by_Sarah_Cole,_Albany_Institute_of_History_and_Art.jpg SARAH COLE (1805-1857) was an American landscape painter and the sister of prominent American landscape painter Thomas Cole.[1] Many of Cole’s paintings are similar in subject and visuals to her brother’s. Though she was one of the earliest female landscape painters working in the United States, little is known of her life, and very few of her works have survived or can be located today.
