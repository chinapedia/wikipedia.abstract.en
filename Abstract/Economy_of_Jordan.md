Jordan's GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s.[1] Jordan is classified as an emerging market. After king Abdullah II's accession to the throne in 1999, liberal economic policies were introduced that resulted in a boom that continued through 2009. Jordan's economy has been growing at an annual rate of 8% after King Abdullah II's accession to throne in 1999 and up to 2008. However, growth has slowed to just 2% after the Arab Spring erupted in 2011. Substantial increase of the population, coupled with slowed economic growth and rising public debt led to a worsening of poverty and unemployment in the country. As of 2015, Jordan boasts a GDP worth $37.6 USD bn, ranking it 89th worldwide.[2]
