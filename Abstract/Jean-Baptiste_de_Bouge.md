JEAN-BAPTISTE DE BOUGE (1757â€“1833)[1] was a Belgian cartographer whose career spanned decades of major political upheaval, his country in turn being (part of) the Austrian Netherlands, the United Belgian States, the French First Republic, the Napoleonic Empire, and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before becoming the Kingdom of Belgium.[2] He often worked with the cartographic engraver Philippe Joseph Maillart.
