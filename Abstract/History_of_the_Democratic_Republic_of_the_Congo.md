The earliest discovered human remains in the DR Congo, were discovered in the 1990s and have been dated to approximately 90,000 years ago. The first real states, such as the Kongo, the Lunda, the Luba and Kuba, appeared south of the equatorial forest on the savannah from the 14th century onwards. [1]
