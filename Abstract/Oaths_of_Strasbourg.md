The OATHS OF STRASBOURG (; ; ) were mutual pledges of allegiance between Louis the German (†876), ruler of East Francia, and his half-brother Charles the Bald (†877), ruler of West Francia made on 12 February 842.[1] They are written in three different languages: Medieval Latin, Old Gallo-Romance and Old High German, all in Caroline minuscule.[2] The Romance passages are generally considered to be the earliest texts in a language that is distinctly Gallo-Romance.
