SOCIETY OF MUSLIM MOJAHEDS () or SOCIETY OF MOJAHEDIN OF ISLAM (), alternatively translated as SOCIETY OF MUSLIM WARRIORS, was a Shia Islamist organization in Iran founded in late 1948. Led by Abol-Ghasem Kashani, the organization served as his multi-task religious, political, cultural, and social executive arm and mouthpiece.[1] It was adept at mobilizing crowds for street control, gang fights, strikes and demonstrations.[2]
