The NICARAGUAN CANAL (), formally the NICARAGUAN CANAL AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (also referred to as the NICARAGUA GRAND CANAL, or the GRAND INTEROCEANIC CANAL) was a proposed shipping route through Nicaragua to connect the Caribbean Sea (and therefore the Atlantic Ocean) with the Pacific Ocean. Scientists were concerned about the project's environmental impact, as Lake Nicaragua is Central America's key freshwater reservoir[1] while the project's viability was questioned by shipping experts and engineers.[2]
