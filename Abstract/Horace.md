QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS (8 December 65 BC â€“ 27 November 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as HORACE (), was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus (also known as Octavian). The rhetorician Quintilian regarded his _Odes_ as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: "He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words."[1]
