_SYSTEMA VEGETABILIUM_ (abbreviated as Syst. Veg.) is a book published in four editions, following twelve earlier editions known as _Systema Naturae_. The first edition, published in 1774 and edited by Johan Andreas Murray is counted as edition 13 because it continues from the 12th edition of _Systema Naturae_. All the names in it are attributed to Carl Linnaeus.[1][2] The second edition, (counted as the 14th of _Systema Naturae_) published in 1784, includes plant species described by J.A. Murray and Carl Peter Thunberg.[3][4] The third edition (counted as the 15th), was edited by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon[5][6]
