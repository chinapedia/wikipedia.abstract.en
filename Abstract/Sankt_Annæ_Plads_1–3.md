The SANKT ANNÆ PLADS 1–3, also known as the FIBIGER HOUSE (Danish: Fibigers Gård), is a Late Neoclassical property at Sankt Annæ Plads in Copenhagen, Denmark. Built in 1849, it originally contained high-end apartments for well-to-do members of the bourgeoisie but was converted into office space in the second half of the 20th century. It was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and in 1932. Danmarks Skibskredit A/S is now based in the building.
