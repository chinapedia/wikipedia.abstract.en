The BAMBARA (Bamana) language, _BAMANANKAN_, is a lingua franca and national language of Mali spoken by perhaps 15 million people, natively by 5 million Bambara people and about 10 million second-language users. It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language. It has a subject–object–verb clause structure and two lexical tones. The native name bamanankan means "the language () of heathens (), people who refuse Islam",[1] as opposed to speakers of Dyula, who are Muslim.[2]
