Bulgarian_State_Railways_148.jpg BULGARIAN STATE RAILWAYS LOCOMOTIVES 142-150 provided motive power on Bulgaria's first railway, opened in 1866 to connect Ruse on the River Danube with Varna on the Black Sea. Ordered from England shortly after the opening of the railway, they were intended as mixed-traffic locomotives to supplement the line's original locomotive fleet. They were powerful 2-cylinder 0-6-0 locomotives with 6-wheeled tenders.[1]
