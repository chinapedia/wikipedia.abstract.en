The ALEPPO OFFENSIVE OF OCTOBERâ€“NOVEMBER 2016, named the "BATTLE OF THE HERO MARTYR ABU OMAR SARAQIB" by the Army of Conquest,[1] refers to a military operation launched on the western outskirts of Aleppo at the end of October 2016 by rebel forces in Syria, against the Syrian government forces and its allies. The aim of the offensive was to establish a new supply line into Aleppo city, after an Army-initiated summer campaign had cut off all rebel access to Aleppo.
