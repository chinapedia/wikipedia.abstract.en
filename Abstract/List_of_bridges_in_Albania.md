There are hundreds of BRIDGES and bridge ruins found throughout Albania. A total of 90 have achieved the status of monument of cultural heritage. The oldest standing bridge in the country is the _Kauri Bridge_, located in the village of Poshnjë - it dates back to the late antiquity. The longest spanning bridge is the _Shushica Bridge (520 m)_ - it crosses the Devoll river as a segment of the Banjë-Gramsh road. The tallest bridge in the country is the _Vasha Bridge (156 m)_, currently under construction - it is part of the important Arbër Road project which aims to connect the central region of the country with the western border of North Macedonia in a much shorter period than the existing route[1][2]
