The SPANIARD CLOAK or SPANISH CLOAK is a garment typically worn in the Spanish-speaking world, and dates back to the late nineteenth century. It was the garment of priests and traditional Christians. It is called "Spanish" or even "Pa√±osa," being made of cloth, wide flight and with bands of velvet lining revealing colour at the front edges.
