RONALD LLOYD MYREN (4 June 1937 â€“ 10 Nov 2003)[1] was a Canadian artist and landscape painter.[2] He was a well known artist in Western Canada [3] (Alberta and British Columbia) who painted mostly in the foothills and mountainous areas of those provinces. He was the Chief Preparator and Registrar, and was in charge of installations at the Edmonton Art Gallery (from 1966 to 1980), now known as the Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA). He was not a religious man in the traditional church sense of the word, and was not baptized. He believed in nature and was often quoted as saying, "Nature is my church." He expressed his belief and feeling about nature through his art. He spent a great deal of time every summer out in the foothills of Alberta painting, taking photos and fishing. He said he was recording scenes of nature that were going to disappear because of logging and development, and in some respects this prediction has come true.
