FUGL-MEYER ASSESSMENT (FMA) scale is an index to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who have had stroke.[1] This scale was first proposed by Axel Fugl-Meyer and his colleagues as a standardized assessment test for post-stroke recovery in their paper titled _The post-stroke hemiplegic patient: A method for evaluation of physical performance_. It is now widely used for clinical assessment of motor function.[2][3] The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score has been tested several times, and is found to have excellent consistency, responsivity and good accuracy.[4][5] The maximum possible score in Fugl-Meyer scale is 226, which corresponds to full sensory-motor recovery.[6] The minimal clinically important difference of Fugl-Meyer assessment scale is 6 for lower limb in chronic stroke[7] and 9-10 for upper limb in sub-acute stroke.[8]
