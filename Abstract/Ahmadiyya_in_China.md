_'Ahmadiyya_ under the spiritual leadership of the caliph in London is considered as an Islamic community in China. Although the history of the Ahmadiyya movement in China starts in the early 20th century, reportedly during the lifetime of the first caliph of the movement, Hakeem Noor-ud-Din, there are no known organized Ahmadi communities in existence, besides a number of refugees, students and expatriates. The Chinese section of the movement is itself based in Surrey, United Kingdom, as opposed to being based in China.[1]
