The RAID ON RAS TANURA was an attempted aerial bombing of the Ras Tanura oil production facility in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. Employing Mirage F1 fighters loaded with incendiary bombs, and two MiG-23s as fighter cover, Iraq intended to demonstrate to the coalition that it was capable of offensive air actions. Although the aircraft penetrated well into Saudi airspace due to skilled flying and luck, both bombers were shot down before they could reach their target by a Royal Saudi Air Force F-15C after their fighter cover fled.
