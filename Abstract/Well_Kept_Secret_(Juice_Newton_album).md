_WELL KEPT SECRET_ is the first solo album and fourth album overall by country pop singer Juice Newton. Her first three albums – _Juice Newton and Silver Spur_ (1975) and _After the Dust Settles_ (1976) for RCA Records, and _Come to Me_ for Capitol (1977) – were credited to the group Juice Newton and Silver Spur. _Well Kept Secret_ was released by Capitol in 1978 and is Newton's first album as a solo artist.[1] The album marked Newton's most rock-oriented record up to that time and features five songs written by her long-time collaborator Otha Young. Other songs on the album include cover versions of Bruce Channel's 1961 hit "Hey! Baby" and the Holland–Dozier–Holland song, "A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)", which was originally recorded in 1963 by Martha and the Vandellas as the B-side to their hit single "Heat Wave".[2][3] Newton's rendition of "Hey! Baby" was the only single released from _Well Kept Secret_. Neither charted, prompting rock critic Jim Worbois to note: "The title of this album seems to apply to her career as much as anything. She was still a couple years away from any substantial success. Newton seems to be without direction on this record and, as such, is trying some harder-edged material."[4]
