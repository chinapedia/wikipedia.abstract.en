7Β-HYDROXYDEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE (7Β-HYDROXY-DHEA; 7Β-OH-DHEA), also known as 3Β,7Β-DIHYDROXYANDROST-4-ENE-17-ONE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring steroid and a metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The major metabolic pathway of DHEA outside the liver is via 7-hydroxylation into 7α-OH-DHEA and 7β-OH-DHEA.[1] 7β-OH-DHEA has weak antiestrogenic activity, selectively antagonizing the estrogen receptor ERβ.[2][3]
