_SOVETSKAYA LITVA_ (literally: _Soviet Lithuania_; ) was a Russian-language daily newspaper published in the Lithuanian SSR. In tandem with the Lithuanian-language _Tiesa_, it was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR. After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the newspaper became an independent daily under the name _ECHO LITVY_ (literally: _Echo of Lithuania_; ). Its circulation was 79,000 copies in 1981, 26,000 copies in 1993, and 12,000 copies in 1997.[1] It discontinued publication in 2001 due to financial difficulties.[2]
