ANIMISM (from Latin __, "breath, spirit, life")[1] is the religious belief that objects, places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence.[2][3][4][5] Potentially, animism perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork and perhaps even words—as animated and alive. Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples,[6] especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions.[7]
