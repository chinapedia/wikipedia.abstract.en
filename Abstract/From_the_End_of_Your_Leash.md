_FROM THE END OF YOUR LEASH_ is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Bobby Bare Jr. The album was released in June 2004, close to 2 years after the release of Bobby Bare Jr.'s previous album, _Young Criminals' Starvation League_. _From the End of Your Leash_, like Bare's previous album, was noted for its songwriting and its use of elements from multiple genres, with the Nashville City Paper noting its mix of "traditional country, prototype rock 'n' roll or Americana... plus R&B, punk and even some pop".[1][2][3][4][5]
