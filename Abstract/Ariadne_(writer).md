Original Manuscript cover for She Ventures and He Wins, with the author sited as "A Young Lady" ARIADNE was the pseudonym of a "Young Lady" who wrote the play _She Ventures and He Wins_, which was first performed at The New Theatre in its 1694-95 season.[1] Little is known of her, however she was likely a novice writer who was "keenly aware of theatrical conventions and the politics of the theater".[2] In the preface to her play, Ariadne says that she is not "altogether unacquainted with the Stage". Then, in her prologue, she attacks the owners of a rival theatre, saying that they "out of spite / Trump'd up a Play upon us in a Night",[3] suggesting that she was at least some way involved with the theatre world of 17th century London.
