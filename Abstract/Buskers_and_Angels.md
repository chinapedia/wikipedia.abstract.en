_BUSKERS AND ANGELS_ is a rock musical written by Australian rock musician Jon English. This was his second musical, following _Paris_ in 1990.[1] The show follows a busker going from the streets to stardom[2] as well as canvassing the pitfalls of the entertainment industry for women. English said "It's probably the most misogynistic industry left" and cites his feisty mother and suffragette grandmother as role models, and points out that both his musicals deliberately feature "forthright, strong women trapped by circumstances but not by their own sex. And I sort of miss that badly in a lot of musicals."[3]
