The CORNWALL WOMEN'S FOOTBALL LEAGUE, known during the 2019-20 season as the EARTHBOUND ELECTRICAL CORNWALL WOMEN'S FOOTBALL LEAGUE for sponsorship reasons,[1] is a football league which sits at level 7 of the league structure of women's football in England. The winner of the division is eligible for promotion to Division One of the South West Regional Women's Football League and there is no relegation from this league - although there is relegation and promotion between the two divisions - as there are no leagues ranked below this one in the pyramid system. It is affiliated to the Cornwall County Football Association.[2]
