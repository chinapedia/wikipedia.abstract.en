Syrian,_Iraqi,_and_Lebanese_insurgencies.png''' ROJAVA]] The Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (also known as Rojava) shares much culturally with Kurdistan Region of Iraq (also known as Iraqi Kurdistan), but has many political differences. There has been military cooperation with Iraqi Kurdistan and the United States in the conflict against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), although neither gives official support for Rojava or its People's Protection Units (YPG). The Kurdistan Regional Government, which the Kurdistan Democratic Party runs, is an ally of Turkey and has co-operated to enforce a unilateral economic blockade against Rojava which has damaged and limited the region's economy. The "Sultanistic system" of Iraqi Kurdistan[1] stands in stark contrast to the democratic confederalist system of the Rojava.
