is a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and prospective sire. In a three-year track career he won twelve of his twenty races including seven Grade 1 events, won four JRA Awards and set the record for prize money won in Japan. He was a stayer who has produced most of his best performances over distances of 2400 metres or further. Unraced as a juvenile in 2014 he proved himself one of the best colts of his generation in Japan in the following year with wins in the Spring Stakes, St Lite Kinen and Kikuka Sho as well as third-place finishes in the Satsuki Sho and the Arima Kinen. He continued his good form in the first half of 2016 with a win in the spring edition of the Tenno Sho and a close third in the Takarazuka Kinen. He returned to the track in autumn to win the Kyoto Daishoten and the Japan Cup. His performances in 2016 saw him being voted Japanese Horse of the Year. In the following year he added four more G1 wins and was again named Horse of the Year.
