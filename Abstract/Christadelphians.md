The CHRISTADELPHIANS () are a millenarian Christian group who hold a view of Biblical Unitarianism. There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries.[1] The movement developed in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas, who coined the name _Christadelphian_[2][3] from the Greek language-term for "Brethren in Christ".[4][5][6]
