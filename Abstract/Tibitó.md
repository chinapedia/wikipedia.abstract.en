TIBITÓ is the second-oldest dated archaeological site on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Colombia.[1] The rock shelter is located in the municipality Tocancipá, Cundinamarca, Colombia, in the northern part of the Bogotá savanna. At Tibitó, bone and stone tools (knives and scrapers mostly) and carbon have been found. Bones from _Haplomastodon_, _Cuvieronius_, _Cerdocyon_ and white tailed deer from the deepest human trace containing layer of the site is carbon dated to be 11,740 ± 110 years old. The oldest dated sediments are lacustrine clays from an ancient Pleistocene lake.
