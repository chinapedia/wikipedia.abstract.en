_EXPLORE: THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & HEALING_ is a bimonthly peer-reviewed interdisciplinary journal that publishes papers on alternative medicine. It was established in 2005 and is published by Elsevier. The executive editor is faith healing advocate Larry Dossey, and the co-editors-in-chief are hypnotherapist, acupuncturist, and herbalist Benjamin Kligler, an associate professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine,[1] and parapsychologist Dean Radin. The journal has been described as a "sham masquerading as a real scientific journal" which publishes "truly ridiculous studies",[2] such as Masaru Emoto's claimed demonstration of the effect of "distant intention" on water crystal formation.[3]
