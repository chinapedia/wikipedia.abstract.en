BBC NEWS (also known as the BBC NEWS CHANNEL) is a British free-to-air television news channel. It was launched as BBC NEWS 24 on 9 November 1997 at 5:30Â pm as part of the BBC's foray into digital domestic television channels, becoming the first competitor to Sky News, which had been running since 1989.[1] For a time, looped news, sport and weather bulletins were available to view via BBC Red Button.
