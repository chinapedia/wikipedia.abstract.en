_SKELETOCUTIS BIGUTTULATA_ is a species of poroid fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It was first described scientifically by Swedish mycologist Lars Romell in 1932.[1] Tuomo Niemelä redescribed and illustrated the fungus in 1998, and explained that collections of this fungus had previously been attributed to the related _Skeletocutis subincarnata_. _S. biguttulata_ may be distinguished from the latter fungus by its biguttulate spores (containing two oil droplets), more regularly arranged pores, and the cracking pore surface seen in older specimens.[2]
