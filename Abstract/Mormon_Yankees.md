The MORMON YANKEES were an exhibition basketball team in Australia from 1937-1961. Composed of young Mormon missionaries the team played all over Australia and became widely known. One Mormon Yankees squad played exhibition games against International teams preparing for the 1956 Summer Olympics, which were held in Australia that year.
