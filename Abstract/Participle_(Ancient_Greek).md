The ANCIENT GREEK PARTICIPLE is a non-finite nominal verb form declined for gender, number and case (thus, it is a verbal adjective) and has many functions in Ancient Greek. It can be active, middle or passive and can be used in the present, future, aorist and perfect tense; these tenses normally represent not absolute time but only time relative to the main verb of the sentence.[1][2] In general, as it shows no personal endings, its main use is to express an action or situation that accompanies the action or situation expressed by the main verb.[3]
