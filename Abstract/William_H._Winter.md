WILLIAM H. WINTER (1819-1879) was an American explorer. He was born in Vigo County, Indiana.[1] He settled in Missouri in 1841. In 1843 he emigrated with Overton Johnson to the Oregon Country, and then (without Johnson) to Alta California.[2] Winter and Johnson published an |account of their journey in 1846 entitled _Route across the Rocky Mountains with a Description of Oregon and California_. The first six chapters were published in the _Oregon Historical Quarterly_, volume 7 (1906); the full manuscript was republished by the _Princeton University Press_ (1932), which noted significance of a chapter which had not been published in the _OHQ_ reprint to the historical understanding of the Whitman massacre.[3]
