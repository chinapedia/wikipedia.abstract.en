SEVERE ACHONDROPLASIA WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS (SADDAN), is a very rare genetic disorder. This disorder is one that affects bone growth and is characterized by skeletal, brain, and skin abnormalities.[1][2] Those affected by the disorder are severely short in height and commonly possess shorter arms and legs.[3][4] In addition, the bones of the legs are often bowed and the affected have smaller chests with shorter rib bones, along with curved collarbones.[5][6] Other symptoms of the disorder include broad fingers and extra folds of skin on the arms and legs.[7][8] Developmentally, many individuals who suffer from the disorder show a higher level in delays and disability. Seizures are also common due to structural abnormalities of the brain.[9][10] Those affected may also suffer with apnea, the slowing or loss of breath for short periods of time.[11][12]
