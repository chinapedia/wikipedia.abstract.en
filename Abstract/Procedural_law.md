PROCEDURAL LAW, ADJECTIVE LAW, in some jurisdictions referred to as REMEDIAL LAW, or RULES OF COURT comprises the rules by which a court hears and determines what happens in civil, lawsuit, criminal or administrative proceedings. The rules are designed to ensure a fair and consistent application of due process (in the U.S.) or fundamental justice (in other common law countries) to all cases that come before a court.
