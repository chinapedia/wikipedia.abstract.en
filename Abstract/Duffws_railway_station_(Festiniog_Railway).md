DUFFWS was the Festiniog Railway's (FR) second passenger station in Blaenau Ffestiniog, then in Merionethshire, now in Gwynedd, Wales. This station is not to be confused with the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's (F&BR) station which stood some distance away on the opposite side of Church Street. During that station's life from 1868 to 1883 passengers travelling from (say) on the F&BR to on the Festiniog would walk between the two stations much as passengers walk between the standard gauge and narrow gauge in modern-day Blaenau Ffestiniog.
