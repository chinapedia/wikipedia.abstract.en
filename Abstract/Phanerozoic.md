The PHANEROZOIC Eon is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when animals first developed hard shells preserved in the fossil record. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words () and (), meaning _visible life_, since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The term "Phanerozoic" was coined in 1930 by the American geologist George Halcott Chadwick (1876â€“1953).[1][2] The time before the Phanerozoic, called the _Precambrian_, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.
