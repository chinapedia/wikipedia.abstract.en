SOUTHEAST VERMONT TRANSIT (SEVT) is the public transportation network serving Windham County, Vermont, southern Windsor County, and parts of southern Bennington County by local bus. The agency was born in July 2015 when the more localized Connecticut River Transit, doing business as the CURRENT (including the former Brattleboro BeeLine), and the Deerfield Valley Transit Association, doing business as the MOOVER, merged.[1]
