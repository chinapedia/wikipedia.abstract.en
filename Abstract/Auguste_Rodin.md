FRANÇOIS AUGUSTE RENÉ RODIN (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as AUGUSTE RODIN (; ), was a French sculptor.[1] Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture,[2] he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition,[3] although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.
