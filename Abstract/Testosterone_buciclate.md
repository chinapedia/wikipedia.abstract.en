TESTOSTERONE BUCICLATE (developmental code names 20 AET-1, CDB-1781) is a synthetic, injected anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) which was never marketed.[1][2][3] It was developed in collaboration by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1970s and early 1980s for use in androgen replacement therapy for male hypogonadism and as a potential male contraceptive.[4] It was first described in 1986.[5] The medication is an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β buciclate (4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate) ester of testosterone – and is a prodrug of testosterone with a very long duration of action when used as a depot via intramuscular injection.[6][7] Testosterone buciclate is formulated as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension with a defined particle size of at least 75% in the range of 10 to 50 μm.[8]
