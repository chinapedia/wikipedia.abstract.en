_DESIRE_ (aka _The Magic Skin_) is a 1920 British silent fantasy film directed by George Edwardes-Hall, produced by Edward Godal, and starring Dennis Neilson-Terry, Yvonne Arnaud and Christine Maitland[1]. The film was known in England as _The Magic Skin_. The screenplay was based on the 1831 Honore de Balzac novel _Le Peau de Chagrin_, which strangely was adapted to film three different times in 1920 alone, the other two being released as _The Dream Cheater_ and _Narayama_[2].
