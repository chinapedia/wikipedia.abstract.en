BOTSWANA (), officially the REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA (), is a landlocked country in Southern Africa. Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966.[1] Since then, it has been a representative republic, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections and the best perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998.[2] It is currently Africa's oldest continuous democracy.[3]
