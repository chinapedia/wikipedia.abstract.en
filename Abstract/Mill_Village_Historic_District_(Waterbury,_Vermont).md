The MILL VILLAGE HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a small 19th-century industrial on Stowe Street in Waterbury, Vermont. The area is a compact and somewhat isolated example of a mill village of the mid-19th century; it is roughly bounded by Stowe Street, Graves Brook, and the northbound offramp of Exit 10 from Interstate 89. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[1]
