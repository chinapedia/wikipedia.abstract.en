The RIO CAJARI EXTRACTIVE RESERVE () is an extractive reserve in the state of Amapá, Brazil. It protects a region of dense rainforest, _cerrado_ fields and flooded riparian zones that is rich in biodiversity. Formerly it was used for rubber extraction, and later efforts were made to develop a pulp industry. Extraction of timber for sale is now prohibited. The residents, who are poorly educated and suffer poor health, engage in subsistence hunting, fishing and farming, and extract forest products such as Brazil nuts, açaí palm fruit and heart of palm.
