The APPLETON INSTITUTE is a multidisciplinary research hub residing within the Adelaide campus of CQUniversity Australia, located south of the Adelaide CBD, in Wayville, South Australia. Formerly the Centre for Sleep Research, the Appleton Institute was established as part of CQUniversity in January 2012.[1][2] The institute is overseen by Professor Drew Dawson, an expert in fatigue and human factors, and was named after the late Dr. Arthur Appleton, the first Vice-Chancellor of CQUniversity, who had strong ties to South Australia.[3]
