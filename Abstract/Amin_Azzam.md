AMIN AZZAM is a clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine. He is also a clinical professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the associate director of the UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Medical Program, and the director of the program's "Problem-Based Learning" curriculum.[1][2] He is known for teaching an elective class for fourth-year medical students that consists entirely of editing Wikipedia articles about medical topics.[3] He originally got the idea from one of his students, Michael Turken, in 2012, and was skeptical at first, but later became convinced that it could be a good idea. He then developed the class with Turken.[4][5] He first taught the monthlong course in December 2013.[6] With regard to the class, he has said, "It is part of our social contract with society, as physicians, to be contributing to Wikipedia and other open-access repositories because that is where the world reads about health information.”[7] His class continues to the present.
