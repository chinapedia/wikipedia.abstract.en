_TEXTRIX DENDICULATA_, the TOOTHED WEAVER,[1] is a funnel web spider of the family Agelenidae found in much of Europe. It was described by the French entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1789. An older name coined by Martini & Goeze in 1778, _Aranea cruciger_, has been declared a nomen oblitum, allowing Olivier's later name to stand.[2]
