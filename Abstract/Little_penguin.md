The LITTLE PENGUIN (_Eudyptula minor_) is the smallest species of penguin. It grows to an average of in height and in length, though specific measurements vary by subspecies.[1][2] It is found on the coastlines of southern Australia and New Zealand, with possible records from Chile. In Australia, they are often called FAIRY PENGUINS because of their small size. In New Zealand, they are more commonly known as LITTLE BLUE PENGUINS or BLUE PENGUINS owing to their slate-blue plumage; they are also known by their Māori name: _KORORĀ_.
