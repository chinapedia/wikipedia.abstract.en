LEE HARRY is an American film director and editor, best known for directing the Christmas horror film _Silent Night Deadly Night 2_ and _Street Soldiers_. Along with fellow Burbank editor Joseph H. Earle, Harry was tasked to use his editing skills to make _Silent Night, Deadly Night: Part 2_ look like a different film than the original, which would then be repackaged as a sequel.[1] It has since become a cult horror classic.[2] Harry admits to being pleased by the reception the notoriously inept film has received.
