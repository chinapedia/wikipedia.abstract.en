"LETTERA A PINOCCHIO" is a 1959 Italian song composed by Mario Panzeri. The song premiered at the first edition of the children song festival Zecchino d'Oro. In spite of not winning the competition, the song got a large commercial success thanks to the version recorded by Johnny Dorelli, at the time very popular thanks to the two Sanremo Music Festival he had just won in couple with Domenico Modugno, with the songs "Volare" and "Piove (Ciao, ciao bambina)".[1]
