METHYLEPITIOSTANOL, known by the nicknames EPISTANE, HEMAPOLIN, HAVOC, and EPI PLEX, is a synthetic and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) group which was first described in the literature in 1974 but was never marketed for medical use.[1][2][3] It is the 17α-methylated derivative of epitiostanol, an AAS and antiestrogen which was formerly used in the treatment of breast cancer in Japan.[4][5] Similarly to mepitiostane, methylepitiostanol is an orally active variant of epitiostanol.[6][7] Due to its C17α methyl group, the drug is considered to have a high potential for hepatotoxicity.[8]
