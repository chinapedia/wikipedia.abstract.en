ELSIE FROST was a 14-year-old girl who was killed in an underpass beneath a railway line near to Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, in October 1965. Despite a massive manhunt and national coverage, there have been no successful convictions of anyone responsible for her death. In 2015, after pressure from Frost's family, West Yorkshire Police re-opened the case, and in March 2018 the primary suspect died.
