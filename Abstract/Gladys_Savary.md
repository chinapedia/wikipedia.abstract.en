Gladys Becker Slaughter, Madame Savary (2 Jun 1893-14 Sep 1985), was an American woman of Manila who labored long and hard to help the starving, neglected, abused, and threatened "internees" at Santo Tomas Internment Camp, supplying them with food everyday and performing various other services, such as laundry, communication and monetary assistance, to help ease their hardship. At the same time, she also worked hard to help her servants and friends outside of Santo Tomas [1] survive the Japanese occupation of the Philippines and the 1945 Battle of Manila. Gladys was not incarcerated by the Japanese because, being married to a Frenchman, she was regarded as a citizen of France which by that time had a puppet government aligned with Japan's ally Germany. Gladys also sent help to a POW camp. Several of her activities could have resulted in torture and execution had she been caught. She maintained a diary throughout the Japanese occupation, and made this the basis of her book _Outside the Walls_.
