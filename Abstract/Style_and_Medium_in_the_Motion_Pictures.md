_STYLE AND MEDIUM IN THE MOTION PICTURES_ is a 1936 essay by the art historian Erwin Panofsky. In the essay, Panofsky "seeks to describe the visual symptoms endemic" to the medium of film.[1] Originally given as an informal talk in 1934 to a group of Princeton University students in the process of founding the film archive of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the essay was subsequently published in revised and expanded form in 1936,[2] 1937,[3] and 1947,[4] and has been widely anthologized ever since. The essay was collected with "What Is Baroque?" and "The Ideological Antecedents of the Rolls-Royce Radiator" in the 1995 collection Three Essays on Style.
