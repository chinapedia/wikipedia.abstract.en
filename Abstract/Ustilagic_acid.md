USTILAGIC ACID is an organic compound with the formula C₃₆H₆₄O₁₈.[1] The acid is a cellobiose lipid produced by the corn smut fungus _Ustilago maydis_ under conditions of nitrogen starvation.[2] The acid was discovered in 1950 and was proved to be an amphipathic glycolipid with surface active properties.[3][4] The name comes from Latin _ustus_ which means _burnt_ and refers to the scorched appearance of the smut fungi.
