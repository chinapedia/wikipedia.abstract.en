SMALLFILMS is a British television producution company that made animated TV programmes for children from 1959 until the 1980s.[1] In 2014 the company began operating again, producing a new series of its most famous show, _The Clangers_.[2] It was originally a partnership between Oliver Postgate (writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (modelmaker and illustrator). Several very popular series of short films were made using stop-motion animation, including _Clangers_, _Noggin the Nog_ and _Ivor the Engine_. Another Smallfilms production, _Bagpuss_, came top of a BBC poll to find the favourite British children's programme of the 20th century.[3]
