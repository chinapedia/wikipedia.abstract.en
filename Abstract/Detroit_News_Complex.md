The DETROIT NEWS COMPLEX consists of two buildings: a historic office building at 615 West Lafayette Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan, and an associated parking structure, located across the street at 901 West Lafayette. The two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.[1] The main building held the offices of _The Detroit News_ until 2013, and was also the site of the first commercial radio broadcast (on WWJ) in the United States.
