_KÄRGERÄS – RETURN FROM OBLIVION_ is the tenth studio album by Czech black/heavy metal band Root. Originally announced on 28 September 2016,[1] it was eventually released on 25 November through Agonia Records, and is their first studio album in 5 years since _Heritage of Satan_. As the title implies, it is a concept album that serves as a sequel to their previous 1996 release, _Kärgeräs_.[2] Two songs off the album, "Life of Demon" and "Moment of Fright", were released in advance as teasers on their record label's official Bandcamp page as well as on YouTube.[3]
