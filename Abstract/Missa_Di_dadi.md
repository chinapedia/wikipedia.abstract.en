The _MISSA DI DADI_, also known as the _DICE MASS_ or _MISSA N'ARAY JE JAMAIS MIEULX_, is a musical setting of the Ordinary of the Mass by Franco-Flemish composer Josquin des Prez, probably dating from around 1480. It uses the chanson _N'aray je jamais mieulx_ by Robert Morton as the source of its cantus firmus, and also contains unique visual and musical references to dice. The latter is thought to be a reference to the popularity of gambling in the court of the Sforza family at Milan, where Josquin wrote it.[1]
