PRE-COLLISIONAL HIMALAYA focuses on the arrangement of the Himalayan rock units before the mountain-building process resulted from the collision between the continents of Asia and India. The collision began in the Cenozoic and it is a type locality of a continental-continental collision.[1] The reconstruction of the initial configuration of the rock units and the relationship between them is highly controversial, and major concerns relate to the arrangements of the different rock units in three dimensions. Several models have been advanced to explain the possible arrangements and petrogenesis of the rock units.
