VAGEATA, also known as VAGEATENSIS,[1] was a Roman-Berber town in the province of Mauretania Caesariensis.[2] It is also known as BAGATENSIS,[3] and epigraphical evidence remains attesting to this etymology,[4][5][6] due to the interchange of 'v' for 'b' is a common phenomenon in Latin and Greek place names.
