The AUSTROASIATIC languages , also known as MONâ€“KHMER ,[1] are a large language family of Mainland Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and southern China. There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages.[2] Of these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer, and Mon have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). In Myanmar, the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State. Santali is recognized as a regional language of India. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.
