In computer science, an ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE, or simply an ARRAY, is a data structure consisting of a collection of _elements_ (values or variables), each identified by at least one _array index_ or _key_. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.[1][2][3] The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.
