GRUPPO DEI SEI (Group of Six) or SEI DI TORINO (Six from Turin) was a group of painters who emerged under the mentorship of Felice Casorati in Turin in the late 1920s. They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian post-impressionism and fauvism, including the work of Amedeo Modigliani, and their anti-fascist ideology â€“ a position that set them apart from other movements like Novecento Italiano and Futurism.
