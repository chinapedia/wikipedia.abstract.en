HCV_genome.png Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitors belong to a class of antiviral drugs called protease inhibitors. They are direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target viral proteins, and their development was a culmination of increased understanding of the viral life cycle.[1][2] However, their mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood.[3] NS5A inhibitors were the focus of much attention when they emerged as a part of the first curative treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in 2014.[4] Favorable characteristics have been introduced through varied structural changes, and structural similarities between NS5A inhibitors that are clinically approved are readily apparent.[5][6] Despite the recent introduction of numerous new antiviral drugs, resistance is still a concern and these inhibitors are therefore always used in combination with other drugs.[7][8]
