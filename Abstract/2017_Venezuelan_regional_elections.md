REGIONAL ELECTIONS were held in Venezuela on 15 October 2017 to elect state governors.[1] The two main participants were the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) opposition coalition and the Great Patriotic Pole (GPP) alliance of the ruling Bolivarian government. The election resulted in a victory for the GPP, which won the majority of governorships. The GPP won 18 out of the 23 governorships, while the MUD won the remaining five. Four Democratic Action governors of five opposition governors elected decided to be sworn in under the Bolivarian government-led National Constituent Assembly despite promises to never recognize the body.[2]
