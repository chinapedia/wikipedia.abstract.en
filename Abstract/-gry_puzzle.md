The _-GRY_ PUZZLE is a popular word puzzle that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters _-gry_ other than _angry_ and _hungry_. Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in _-gry_.[1][2] Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing _gry_ (such as _gryphon_). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.[3][4][5]
