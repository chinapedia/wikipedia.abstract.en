_' Cannabis in Michigan_' is legal for both medical and recreational use. Voters approved a ballot measure in 2008 to make Michigan the 13th state to legalize medical use. Ten years later, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize recreational use when 56% of voters approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act. The first recreational cannabis dispensaries are expected to open in early 2020.
