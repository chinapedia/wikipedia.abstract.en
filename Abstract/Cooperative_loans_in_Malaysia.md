COOPERATIVE LOANS IN MALAYSIA (commonly known in the Malay language as Pinjaman Koperasi) are credit services offered by cooperatives registered under the Cooperative Commission of Malaysia (SKM) to their members who work as civil servants.[1][2] It is part of the shadow banking system in Malaysia.[3] The borrowers are restricted to employees in government departments, statutory bodies, government-linked companies or municipal councils. The Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (CUEPACS) supports these loans because they aid civil servants in overcoming financial problems and reducing borrowing from loan sharks.[4] All matters relating to the administration of these loans are regulated under the Cooperative Society Act of 1993.[5]
