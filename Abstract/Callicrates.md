CALLICRATES (; , _Callicrátēs_) was an ancient Greek architect active in the middle of the fifth century BC. He and Ictinus were architects of the Parthenon (Plutarch, _Pericles_, 13).[1] An inscription identifies him as the architect of "the Temple of Nike" in the Sanctuary of Athena Nike on the Acropolis (IG I³ 35). The temple in question is either the amphiprostyle Temple of Athena Nike now visible on the site[2] or a small-scale predecessor (naiskos) whose remains were found in the later temple's foundations.[3] An inscription identifies Callicrates as one of the architects of the Classical circuit wall of the Acropolis (IG I³ 45), and Plutarch further states (loc. cit.) that he contracted to build the Middle of three amazing walls linking Athens and Piraeus.
