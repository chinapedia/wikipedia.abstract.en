ELISABETH (LIS) JACOBSEN, née RUBIN, (1882–1961) was a Danish philologist, archaeologist and writer. She is remembered first and foremost for her research and publications on the history of the Danish language but she was also an expert runologist who published a comprehensive analysis of all known runic inscriptions in Denmark. From 1911, Jacobsen played a major role in all fields of research related to the Danish language.[1][2]
