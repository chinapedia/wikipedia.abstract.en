NARCOSIS while diving (also known as NITROGEN NARCOSIS, INERT GAS NARCOSIS, RAPTURES OF THE DEEP, MARTINI EFFECT) is a reversible alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth. It is caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure. The Greek word _ναρκωσις_ (narcosis) is derived from _narke_, "temporary decline or loss of senses and movement, numbness", a term used by Homer and Hippocrates. Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation. It can occur during shallow dives, but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than .
