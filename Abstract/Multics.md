MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is an influential early time-sharing operating system which is based on the concept of a single-level memory.[1][2] Virtually all modern operating systems were heavily influenced by Multics – often through Unix, which was created by some of the people who had worked on Multics – either directly (Linux, macOS) or indirectly (Windows NT).
