THE PRINCE OF WALES FLYING SQUIRREL, _Glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons_, is a subspecies of the northern flying squirrel. _Glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons_ is ENDEMIC to Prince of Wales Island in Alaska and has a unique coloration compared to other subspecies of northern flying squirrel. It is whiter on the ventral side, darker on the dorsal side, and the head/neck area tend to be more gray than other subspecies. This subspecies is genetically distinct from the northern flying squirrel from evidence found in mitochondrial DNA and microsatelite data.[1] Adults are usually around 25-37 centimeters in length and 110-230 grams in weight. This subspecies is often considered a keystone species in the Southeastern Alaska area because it consumes and disperses conifer seeds and fungal spores into areas with little vegetation and sites of disturbance.[2] The released fungi spores aid in the absorption of nutrients by plants and speed up regrowth in these areas.[3]
