YANG XIUZHU (; born September 15, 1946[1]) is a former Chinese female politician whose career ended after she was charged with corruption and expelled from the Communist Party of China. Yang served as Deputy Mayor of Wenzhou from 1995 to 1998 and deputy director of Zhejiang Construction Department from 1998 to 2003.[2][3] After being charged with corruption, Yang evaded Chinese authorities and fled overseas in 2003. She had lived in many countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore, France, the Netherlands, Italy and the United States, to avoid punishment. On November 16, 2016, Yang was deported to China and surrendered to Chinese authorities,[4] and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment in October.[5] She was described by several media outlets as "China's most wanted fugitive"[6] and "China's first female corruption giant".[7]
