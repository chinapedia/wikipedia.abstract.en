A_man_whose_face_exemplifies_the_melancholy_temperament._Dra_Wellcome_V0009108ER.jpg MELANCHOLIA (from __[1] "gall bladders"[2] also Latin _lugere_ LUGUBRIOUSNESS to mourn, Latin _morosus_ MOROSENESS of self-will or fastidious habit, and old English _wist WISTFULNESS_ of intent or SATURNINE) is a concept from ancient or pre-modern medicine. Melancholy was one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.[3] In the 19th century, "melancholia" could be physical as well as mental, and melancholic conditions were classified as such by their common cause rather than by their properties.[4]
