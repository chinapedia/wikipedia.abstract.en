This LIST OF INTRODUCED MAMMAL SPECIES includes all the species of mammal introduced to an area without regard to that territory being or not being their native area of occupation or the success of that re-introduction or introduction to the area. This practice has been harmful in many areas, although some introductions are made with the aim of preserving mammal species. Following the name of the mammal, a brief description of where they were introduced is included.
