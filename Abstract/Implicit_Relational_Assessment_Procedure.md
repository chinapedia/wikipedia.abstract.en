THE IMPLICIT RELATIONAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE (IRAP) is a computer-based psychological measure. It was heavily influenced by the implicit-association test,[1] and is one of several tasks referred to as indirect measures of implicit attitudes.[2][3] The IRAP is one of relatively few indirect measures that can includes relational or propositional rather than associative information.[4] The IRAP was conceptualised by Dermot Barnes-Holmes, and originally published in 2006.[5] A meta analysis of clinically-relevant criterion effects suggest that the IRAP has good validity.[6] However, a second meta analysis suggests that it has poor reliability, like many reaction time based measures.[7] Research using the IRAP is often linked to relational frame theory,[8] a functional-analytic theory of language.
