SOUTH TYROLEAN GERMAN (, in the local Upper German (Austro-Bavarian) vernacular also referred to as _Südtiroulerisch_ o_Sîdtiroul(er)isch_) is a dialect spoken in the northern Italian province of South Tyrol. It is generally considered to be a local variant of Southern Bavarian.[1] The difference between Bavarian and South Tyrolean is the heavy influence of Italian (and Ladin) in its lexicon.
