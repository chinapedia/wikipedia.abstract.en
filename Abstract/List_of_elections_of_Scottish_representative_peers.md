This is a LIST OF THE ELECTIONS OF SCOTTISH REPRESENTATIVE PEERS. After the Acts of Union 1707, the peerage of Scotland elected sixteen of their number to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster. General elections were held with each Parliament, and by-elections to fill vacancies in between. The elections ceased after the Peerage Act 1963 granted all peers of Scotland an hereditary seat in the House of Lords.
