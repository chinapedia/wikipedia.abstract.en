'', c. 1504 (Uffizi)]] FRA BARTOLOMEO or BARTOLOMMEO OP (28 March 1472 – 31 October 1517), also known as BARTOLOMMEO DI PAGHOLO, BARTOLOMMEO DI S. MARCO, and his original name BACCIO DELLA PORTA, was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects. He spent all his career in Florence until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome. He trained with Cosimo Roselli and in the 1490s fell under the influence of Savonarola, which led him to become a Dominican friar in 1500, renouncing painting for several years.
