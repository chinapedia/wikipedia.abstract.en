Since 2015, Qatar has implemented mandatory military conscription with an average of 2000 graduates per year.[1] As of 2010, Qatar's defence expenditures added up to a total of $1.913 billion, about 1.5% of the national GDP, according to the SIPRI.[2] Qatar has recently signed defence pacts with the United States in 2002[3] and 2013[4] and with the United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier, in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. Qatar also hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East and in 2017 inaugurated a military attache office in Washington.[5]
