JACKIE SHARKEY or JACK SHARKEY (born GIOVANNI CERVATI) was an Italian-born American boxer who made a claim to the World Bantamweight Title on August 15, 1919 defeating reigning champion Pete Herman in a fifteen-round, no-decision bout in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His claim to the title was not universally recognized at the time. Jack Sharkey, also known as Little Jackie Sharkey, should not be confused with the heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey.[1]
