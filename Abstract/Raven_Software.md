RAVEN SOFTWARE (or RAVEN ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE, INC.) is an American video game developer based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the _Heretic_ and _Hexen: Beyond Heretic_ games, left to form Human Head Studios.
