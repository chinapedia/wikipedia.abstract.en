INTERDISCIPLINARITY or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e.g., a research project).[1] It draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics etc. It is about creating something by thinking across boundaries. It is related to an _interdiscipline_ or an _interdisciplinary field,_ which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions emerge. Large engineering teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a power station or mobile phone or other project requires the melding of several specialties. However, the term "interdisciplinary" is sometimes confined to academic settings.
