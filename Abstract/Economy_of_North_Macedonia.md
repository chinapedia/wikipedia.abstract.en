The breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 deprived the ECONOMY OF NORTH MACEDONIA, then its poorest republic (only 5% of the total federal output of goods and services), of its key protected markets and large transfer payments from Belgrade. An absence of infrastructure, United Nations sanctions on its largest market the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,[1] and a Greek economic embargo hindered economic growth until 1996.
