Mongolian_Armed_Forces_100711-A-CE583-114.jpg DUAL WIELDING is using two weapons, one in each hand, during combat. It is not a common combat practice. Although historical records of dual wielding in war are limited, there are numerous weapon-based martial arts that involve the use of a pair of weapons. The use of a companion weapon is sometimes employed in European martial arts and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman and _ronin_, was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.
