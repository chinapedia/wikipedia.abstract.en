"THE DREAM SHALL NEVER DIE" was a speech delivered by United States Senator Edward M. Kennedy at the Democratic National Convention on August 12, 1980. In the address, Kennedy defended post-World War II liberalism, advocated for a national healthcare insurance model, criticized retired Hollywood actor and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan, and implicitly rebuked incumbent President Jimmy Carter (to whom he had conceded the Democratic nomination only the night before) for his more moderate political stances. It has been remembered by some as Kennedy's best speech, and one of the most influential orations of the era.
