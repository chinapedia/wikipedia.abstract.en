DILKUSHA BAGH (, literally _The Engaging Garden_ or _The Charming Garden_) is an old Date Orchard in Bhakkar District of Punjab, Pakistan. It is believed to be a Mughal garden built by Humayun or Akbar. However Humayun never visited the area. On his retreat to Iran, he went to another Bakhar in Sindh to seek help from Mahmood Khan, but this route was rejected by Major Henry Raverty as the possible retreat of Humayun.[1]
