Amsicora,_militare_cartaginese.png HAMPSICORA (3rd century BC - Cornus, 215 BC) was a Sardo-Punic[1] political leader and landowner of Sardinia, and the leader of the major anti-Roman revolt ([2]) in the province of 215 BC. Sardinia_215_aC_-_Ampsicora_rivolta.png The sources describe Hampsicora as the richest among the landowners of Sardinia, which at that time appeared to be split into two entities: the Carthaginian-dominated Southern and Western agricultural coastline, including the vast Campidano plain, and the more inland areas that maintained their independence and, while being eventually tolerant of the Carthaginians after many skirmishes, were nonetheless hostile to the Roman conquest. Ever since the late Nuragic era, the Sardinians and Carthaginians had been on good terms with each other, finding a common ground on their resentment against the Romans.[3]
