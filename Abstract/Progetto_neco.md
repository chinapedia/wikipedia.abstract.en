PROGETTO NECO is one of the most important Wireless Community Network in Italy. Founded in 2008 in the small town of Vietri di Potenza, it built a mesh network to stop Digital Divide, which persisted for over 15 years and which is still present in many places in the south of Italy. The network is maintained completely by volunteers and it is self-financed by its supporters. According to the official website, about 200 families have adhered to the project in 2016.
