Isaac Newton's rotating BUCKET ARGUMENT (also known as NEWTON'S BUCKET) was designed to demonstrate that true rotational motion cannot be defined as the relative rotation of the body with respect to the immediately surrounding bodies. It is one of five arguments from the "properties, causes, and effects" of "true motion and rest" that support his contention that, in general, true motion and rest cannot be defined as special instances of motion or rest relative to other bodies, but instead can be defined only by reference to absolute space. Alternatively, these experiments provide an operational definition of what is meant by "absolute rotation", and do not pretend to address the question of "rotation relative to _what_?"[1] General relativity dispenses with absolute space and with physics whose cause is external to the system, with the concept of geodesics of spacetime.[2]
