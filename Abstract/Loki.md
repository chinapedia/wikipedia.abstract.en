Processed_SAM_loki.jpg'') as depicted on a 16th-century Icelandic manuscript (SÁM 66)]] LOKI (, Modern , often Anglicized as ) is a god in Norse mythology. Loki is in some sources the son of Fárbauti and Laufey, and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. By his wife Sigyn, Loki is the father of Narfi and/or Nari. By the stallion Svaðilfari, Loki is the mother—giving birth in the form of a mare—to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of Váli in _Prose Edda_, though this source also refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice, and Váli is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.
