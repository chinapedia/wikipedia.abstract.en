Like most countries and territories in Oceania, telecommunications in the Cook Islands is limited by its isolation and low population,[1] with only one major television broadcasting station and six radio stations. However, most residents have a main line or mobile phone. Its telecommunications are mainly provided by Telecom Cook Islands, who is currently working with O3b Networks, Ltd. for faster Internet connection.
