_MEGALOLAMNA_ is an extinct genus of lamniform shark that belongs to the family Otodontidae. Its name comes from the similarity of its teeth to those of the extant shark genus _Lamna._ It is known from the early Miocene Chilcatay Formation of Peru, Oi and O'oshimojo Formations of Japan, and the Jewett Sand Formation of California and Pungo River Formation, North Carolina in the United States, implying a cosmopolitan distribution. It is considered to be the sister genus of _Otodus_. The study of _Megalolamna_'s taxonomic relationships also demonstrates the possibility that _Otodus_ needs to include the species sometimes assigned to _Carcharocles_ (i.e., the megatoothed lineage, including megalodon) in order to be monophyletic.[1]
