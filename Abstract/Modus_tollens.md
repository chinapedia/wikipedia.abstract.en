In propositional logic, _MODUS TOLLENS_ (; MT; also _MODUS TOLLENDO TOLLENS_ (Latin for "mode that denies by denying")[1] or DENYING THE CONSEQUENT)[2] is a valid argument form and a rule of inference. It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its contrapositive.
