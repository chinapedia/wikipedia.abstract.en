In Greek mythology, the MINOTAUR (,[1] ;[2] , , Etruscan: _Θevrumineś_) is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man[3] or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part man and part bull".[4] He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction[5] designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.
