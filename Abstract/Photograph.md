Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating such images is called photography. The word _photograph_ was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς (_phos_), meaning "light," and γραφή (_graphê_), meaning "drawing, writing," together meaning "drawing with light."[1]
