_ONE NIGHT IN MIAMI_ is the debut play written by Kemp Powers, first performed in 2013. It is a fictional account of a real night, 25 February 1964. It pinpoints a pivotal moment in the lives of four, still nascent, black American icons whose potential, thoughts and actions play out in the 90 minute, one-act play. The scenario presents an audacious challenge - to cast 22 year old, newly crowned world boxing champion Cassius Clay as he transforms into Muhammad Ali, controversial Nation of Islam leader / mentor Malcolm X, influential singer-songwriter and record producer Sam Cooke and star NFL footballer Jim Brown. The men, friends in real life, celebrate Clay's surprise title win over Sonny Liston in a Miami hotel room, watched over by Nation of Islam security.[1]
