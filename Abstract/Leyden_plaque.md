The LEYDEN PLAQUE, sometime called LEIDEN PLATE or LEIDEN PLAQUE, is a jadeite belt plate from the early classic period of the Maya civilization. Although the plate was found on the Caribbean coast of Guatemala, researcher think it was made in Tikal. The plate is now in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands, hence its official name.[1][2][3] It is one of the oldest Maya objects using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.[4]
