An AIR-JET LOOM is a shuttleless loom that uses a jet of air to propel the weft yarn through the warp shed.[1] It is one of two types of fluid-jet looms, the other being a water-jet loom, which was developed previously.[2] Fluid-jet looms can operate at a faster speed than predecessor looms such as rapier looms, but they are not as common.[3] The machinery used in airjet weaving consists of a main nozzle, auxiliary nozzles or relay nozzles, and a profile reed.
