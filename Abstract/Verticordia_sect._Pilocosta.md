_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _PILOCOSTA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes three species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are mostly small, bushy shrubs greyish, needle-like leaves and hairy, rather than feathery flowers. Plants in this section have a flower cup with 10 hairy ribs, fringed sepals and a style which is hairy and has a distinct cap.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Pilocosta_ is from the Latin words _pilus_ meaning "hair"[4] and _costa_ meaning "rib"[5] referring to the hairy ribs on the floral cup.[6]
