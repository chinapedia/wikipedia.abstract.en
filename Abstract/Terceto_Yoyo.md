TERCETO YOYO was a Cuban son trio active during the 1920s. It was formed by Heliodoro "Yoyo" Rodríguez (güiro), Jesús "Chuchú" Arístola (marímbula) and Celedonio Hernández (guitar).[1][2][3] They recorded up to twenty songs for Victor in Havana,[4] enjoying great popularity at the time, although only three of their recordings have survived.[5][6] These are considered the oldest son recordings featuring the marímbula, together with those by the Sexteto Habanero.[7]
