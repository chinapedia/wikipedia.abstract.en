A_farmer_telling_his_family,_a_doctor,_a_vicar_and_a_lawyer_Wellcome_V0011022.jpg A PROFESSION is an occupation founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain.[1][2] The term is a truncation of the term "liberal profession", which is, in turn, an Anglicization of the French term "profession lib√©rale". Originally borrowed by English users in the 19th century, it has been re-borrowed by international users from the late 20th, though the (upper-middle) class overtones of the term do not seem to survive retranslation: "liberal professions" are, according to the European Union's Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) "those practiced on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public".
