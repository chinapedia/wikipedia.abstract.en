Nautic_mile_definition_v2_English.svg Nauticalmilecomparison.svg A NAUTICAL MILE is a unit of measurement used in both air and marine navigation,[1] and for the definition of territorial waters.[2] Historically, it was defined as one minute ( of a degree) of latitude along any line of longitude. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1852 metres. This converts to about 1.15 imperial/US miles. The derived unit of speed is the knot, one nautical mile per hour.
