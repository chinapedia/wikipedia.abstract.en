The TYPE 100 TE-RE was an artillery observation vehicle of the Imperial Japanese Army used to spot and recon for SPGs and stationary artillery. Based on the chassis of the Type 97 Te-Ke tankette, production of the vehicle began in 1940.[1] The Type 100 Te-Re was able to accommodate a crew of six to eight men, while designed to carry observation and radio equipment. A total of 100 to 150 units were produced. They were mainly used in the Second Sino-Japanese War.[2]
