MONOAMINE OXIDASES (MAO) () are a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of monoamines, employing oxygen to clip off their amine group.[1][2] They are found bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria in most cell types of the body. The first such enzyme was discovered in 1928 by Mary Bernheim in the liver and was named tyramine oxidase.[3][4] The MAOs belong to the protein family of flavin-containing amine oxidoreductases.
