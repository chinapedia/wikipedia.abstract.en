Based on the bloodline, his father, Saud Al-Kabeer was married to Abdul Aziz's sister called Nura. Saud Al-Kabeer was a prominent figure in the _majlis_ of internal advisers who were very close to Abdul Aziz who ruled the country until 1953.[1] Prince Turki's execution for murder was announced by Saudi state media on October 18, 2016.[2] He was the first member of the Saudi royal family to be executed since the execution of 19 year old Princess Mishaal bint Fahd bin Mohammed Al Saud in 1977.
