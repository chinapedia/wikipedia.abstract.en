Membury,_Yarty_Farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_161532.jpg Yarty_House_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1252322.jpg NicholasFry_Died1632_MemburyChurch_Devon.jpg).]] FryArms.png YARTY is an historic estate in the parish of Membury in Devon, and was from the 14th century until 1726[1] for many centuries the principal seat of the Fry family.[2] It takes its name from the River Yarty[3] which flows near or through the estate. During the reigns of King Richard II (1377-1399)[4] or King Henry IV (1399-1413)[5] William (or John[6]) Fry inherited the estate by marriage to the sister and heiress of Simon _de Yarty_,[7] who died without progeny. The mansion house was "newly builded and augmented"[8] by Nicholas Fry (d.1632), Sheriff of Devon in 1626, whose mural monument survives in the Yarty Chapel in Membury Church.[9][10]
