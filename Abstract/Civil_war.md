A CIVIL WAR, also known as an INTRASTATE WAR in polemology,[1] is a war between organized groups within the same state or country. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies.[2] The term is a calque of the Latin _bellum civile_ which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.
