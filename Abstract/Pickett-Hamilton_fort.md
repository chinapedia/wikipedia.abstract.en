A PICKETT-HAMILTON FORT is a type of hardened field fortification built in Britain during the invasion crisis of 1940â€“1941. The Pickett-Hamilton fort was designed to be lowered into the ground while it was not in use, as such it would be inconspicuous and would not interfere with the passage of taxiing aircraft or other vehicles. The fort could be raised to about above ground level where it would be a physical impediment to aircraft and vehicles and from where a small crew could fire with rifles or light machine guns.
