Water protectors are primarily members of Indigenous communities in North America and do not consider themselves to be protesters, but performing a sacred duty through non-violent resistance to activities which endanger water.[1] Water protectors reject the term "protester" because of its links to colonialism and other negative connotations.[2] Water is considered sacred by Indigenous peoples as it is necessary for all living things on earth.[3] Their actions are considered a duty to honour ancestors, to current peoples, and future generations.
