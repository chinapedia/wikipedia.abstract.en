The MCCLAINE HOUSE is a historic building located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. This two-story brick structure has historically been a combination residence and commercial building. Sanborn Maps list the commercial space as housing: a barber shop (1886), cigar factory (1902), and swelling (1928).[1] The second floor is four bays wide, while the main floor is three bays. The middle two windows on the top floor each have a small window located above. Across the top of the structure there is a plain cornice that is enhanced by modillion blocks. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[2]
