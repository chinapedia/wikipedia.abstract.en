As one of the world's leading international financial centres, Hong Kong's service-oriented economy is characterized by its low taxation, almost free port trade and well established international financial market.[1] Its currency, called the Hong Kong dollar, is legally issued by three major international commercial banks,[2] and pegged to the US dollar.[3][4] Interest rates are determined by the individual banks in Hong Kong to ensure they are market driven.[5] There is no officially recognised central banking system, although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority functions as a financial regulatory authority.[6][7]
