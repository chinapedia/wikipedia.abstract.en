The ECONOMY OF CYPRUS is classified by the World Bank as a high-income economy,[1] and was included by the International Monetary Fund in its list of advanced economies in 2001.[2] Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflected the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe.
