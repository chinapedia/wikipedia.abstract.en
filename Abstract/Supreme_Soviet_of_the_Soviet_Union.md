The SUPREME SOVIET OF THE SOVIET UNION () was the most authoritative legislative body of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) beginning 1936, and the only one with the power to approve constitutional amendments. (The Congress of Soviets was the supreme legislative body from 1917 to 1936. During 1989â€“1991 a similar, but not identical (elected directly by the people instead of local Soviets) structure (Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR) was the supreme legislative body.) It elected the Presidium, served as the collective head of state of the USSR,[1] and appointed the Council of Ministers, the Supreme Court, and the Procurator General of the USSR.
