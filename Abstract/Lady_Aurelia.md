LADY AURELIA (foaled 27 January 2014) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse. After winning a race on dirt in the United States, she was sent to race on turf in Europe and proved herself as the one of the leading two-year-old fillies of her generation. At Royal Ascot in June she produced a very impressive performance to win the Queen Mary Stakes and then traveled to France to win the Prix Morny. Although she was beaten on her final appearance in the Cheveley Park Stakes she was named Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly for the 2016 season. In 2017 she won the Giant's Causeway Stakes in America before returning to Britain to win the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. She then finished second in the Nunthorpe Stakes before finishing tenth in the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint.
