DANA MICHELLE PLATO (born DANA MICHELLE STRAIN; November 7, 1964 â€“ May 8, 1999) was an American actress known for her role as Kimberly Drummond on the U.S. television sitcom _Diff'rent Strokes_ from 1978 to 1986.[1] After leaving the cast of _Diff'rent Strokes_, Plato attempted to establish herself as a working actress, with mixed success: she worked sporadically in made-for-TV movies and in independent films, and did voice-over work. At the age of 34, after years of struggling with poverty and substance abuse, Plato died from an overdose of prescription drugs.[2][3]
