KELTOS (foaled 25 March 1998) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for his win in the 2002 Lockinge Stakes. After finishing second on his only appearance as a juvenile he won four races in 2001 including the Listed Prix de Pontarme and the Group Three Prix Perth. In the following spring he won the Prix du Muguet and defeated a top class-field in the Lockinge Stakes before being retired to stud. After suffering from low fertility he returned to racing in 2004 and won the Listed Prix Tantieme as well as being placed in several important races. In 2005 he won one minor race from starts and was retired from racing at the end of the season. He has had moderate success in his second spell as a breeding stallion.
