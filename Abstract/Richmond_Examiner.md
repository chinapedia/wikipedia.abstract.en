The _RICHMOND EXAMINER_, a newspaper which was published during the American Civil War under the masthead of _DAILY RICHMOND EXAMINER_, was one of the newspapers published in the Confederate capital of Richmond. Its editors viewed strong executive leadership as a threat to the liberties of its subscription readership. The paper published staunch and increasingly vitriolic opposition to the leadership and policies of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Historians often consult the pages of the _Examiner_ for insights into the growing problems faced by the Davis administration and the South as they faced the increasing prospect of defeat in the Civil War.[1]
