The LAWRENCE BATLEY SENIORS was a senior (over 50s) men's professional golf tournament on the European Senior Tour. It was played from 1992 to 2002 in the Huddersfield area of West Yorkshire, England. From 1995 the tournament was held at Huddersfield Golf Club, north of Huddersfield, while in 1994 it was held at Woodsome Hall Golf Club, south-west of Huddersfield, and in 1992 and 1993 at both venues.[1] The tournament was sponsored by Lawrence Batley who had earlier supported a European Tour event, the Lawrence Batley International, from 1981 to 1987. Batley died in August 2002, soon after the final tournament.
