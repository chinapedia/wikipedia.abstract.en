Peace_symbol.svg (â˜®) was the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament symbol, designed by Gerald Holtom in 1958.[1]]] Nuclear disarmament is the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons. It can also be the end state of a nuclear-weapons-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. The term DENUCLEARIZATION is also used to describe the process leading to complete nuclear disarmament.[2][3]
