SPEED SKATING is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. In the Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just "speed skating", while short-track speed skating is known as "short track".[1] The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as "speed skating" and short track as "short track skating".
