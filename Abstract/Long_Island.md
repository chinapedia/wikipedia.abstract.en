LONG ISLAND is a densely populated island off the East Coast of the United States, beginning at New York Harbor approximately 0.35 miles (0.56Â km) from Manhattan Island and extending eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. The island comprises four counties in the U.S. state of New York. Kings and Queens Counties (the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) and Nassau County share the western third of the island, while Suffolk County occupies the eastern two-thirds. More than half of New York City's residents now live on Long Island, in Brooklyn and Queens.[1] However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (including those in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term _Long Island_ (or _THE ISLAND_) to refer exclusively to Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which are mainly suburban in character, conversely employing the term _the City_ to mean Manhattan alone.[2]
