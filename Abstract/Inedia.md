J._Reynolds,_A_discourse_upon_prodigious_abstinence..._Wellcome_L0022587.jpg INEDIA (Latin for 'fasting') or BREATHARIANISM is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming food, and in some cases water. Breatharians claim that food (and sometimes water) is not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by _prana_, the vital life force in Hinduism. According to Ayurveda, sunlight is one of the main sources of prana, and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms _breatharianism_ or _inedia_ may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a lifestyle in place of a usual diet.
