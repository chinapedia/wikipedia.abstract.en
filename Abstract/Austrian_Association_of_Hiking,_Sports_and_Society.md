The AUSTRIAN ASSOCIATION OF HIKING, SPORTS AND SOCIETY (, abbreviated _OeWSGV_ or _ÖWSGV_) was a name used to camouflage a secret paramilitary army in Austria which operated from 1951 to 1964. It was founded by the head of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB), Franz Olah, to combat communism in Austria. The CIA provided finances and support. The organisation was a part of a network of "stay-behind" organisations left in Europe at the end of World War II as part of the West's Cold War defences.
