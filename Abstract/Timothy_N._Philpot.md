TIMOTHY NEIL PHILPOT (born March 18, 1951) is an American lawyer, author and judge. He has served as a family court circuit judge in Fayette County, Kentucky, since 2004[1] and his present term expires in January 2023. He previously served as a Republican member of the Kentucky Senate from 1993 to 1998[2] and as the president of Christian Business Men's Connection from 1996 to 2003.[3] As a judge, Philpot has been criticized for making controversial statements about LGBT people[4][5] but also defended as not allowing his social views to influence his judicial decisions.[6] Philpot is also an author, his most-recent book being a well-received semi-autobiographical novel drawing on cases he has heard and his experiences as a judge, explored from his socially conservative Methodist perspective.[7][8]
