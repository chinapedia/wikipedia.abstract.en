BRYOZOA (also known as the POLYZOA, ECTOPROCTA or commonly as MOSS ANIMALS)[1] are a phylum of aquatic invertebrate animals. Typically about long, they are filter feeders that sieve food particles out of the water using a retractable lophophore, a "crown" of tentacles lined with cilia. Most marine species live in tropical waters, but a few occur in oceanic trenches, and others are found in polar waters. One class lives only in a variety of freshwater environments, and a few members of a mostly marine class prefer brackish water. Over 4,000Â living species are known. One genus is solitary and the rest are colonial.
