PETER HOLM (b. 14 May 1873 - d. 1 February 1950) was a Danish museum director and curator. Holm is best known for creating The Old Town Museum in Aarhus, Denmark, an open-air 'living' museum on the history of Danish life and architecture with a focus on the changes brought to urban life by the industrialization of the early 20th century and the development of the city through time. Holm worked against established museum organizations to create the first open air museum in Scandinavia and one of the largest open air museums in Europe.[1]
