In mathematics, MODEL THEORY is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is one of the components that form a THEORY. A MODEL of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.
