_ALLOSAURUS_ ([1][2]) is a genus of carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 150Â million years ago during the late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian[3]). The name "_Allosaurus"_ means "different lizard" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its discovery). It is derived from the Greek /_allos_ ("different, other") and /_sauros_ ("lizard / generic reptile"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life.
