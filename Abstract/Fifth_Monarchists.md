Fifth_Monarchy_Aspinwall.jpg.]] The FIFTH MONARCHISTS or FIFTH MONARCHY MEN were an extreme Puritan sect[1] active from 1649 to 1660 during the Interregnum, following the English Civil Wars of the 17th century.[2] They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede the kingdom of Christ. They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.
