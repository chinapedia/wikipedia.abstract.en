_GANGRENE_ is a 1976 book written by Flemish writer and former Assistant Direct Commissioner in the Belgian Congo Jef Geeraerts. Also referred to as _BLACK VENUS_, this is the first of four books belonging to Geeraerts’ _Gangrene_ cycle.[1] The narrator bears the author’s name, and the book is widely considered to be a fictionalized yet largely autobiographical account of Geeraerts’ experiences in the Belgian Congo towards the end of the Belgian colonial era, leading towards the Congo’s independence in 1960.[2]
