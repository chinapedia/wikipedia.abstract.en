TRANSPARENCY SERBIA (TS) was founded in 2002 and granted the status of “national chapter in formation” by the Transparency International (TI) movement. Over the next four years, Transparency Serbia concentrated its efforts on advocating for the adoption and improvement of anti-corruption legislation through the use of promotional campaigns, draft amendments, comparative legal analysis of legislation. Transparency Serbia further worked to raise public awareness of anti-corruption legislation and identify implementation gaps where legislation was not being enforced. The priorities of work in that period were advocating for the adoption of the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance (2004), the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest (2004), full implementation of the Law on Financing of Political Parties (2003) and the Law on Public Procurement (2002), as well as the adoption of the National Anti-corruption Strategy (2005) and the accompanying action plan (2006).
