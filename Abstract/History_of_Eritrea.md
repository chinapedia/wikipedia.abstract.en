"Eritrea" is an ancient name, associated in the past with its Greek form _Erythraia_, Ἐρυθραία, and its derived Latin form _Erythræa_. This name relates to that of the Red Sea, then called the _Erythræan Sea_, from the Greek for "red", ἐρυθρός, _erythros_. The Italians created the colony of Eritrea in the 19th century around Asmara, and named it with its current name. After World War II Eritrea was annexed to Ethiopia. In 1991 the Eritrean People's Liberation Front defeated the Ethiopian "derg" government. Tigray is a region of Ethiopia whose religions (Orthodox Christianity & Islam), food, language and culture are the same as that of the greater part of Eritrea. A lot of people have families on both sides of the border between Eritrea and Tigray. Eritrea officially celebrated its 1st anniversary of independence on May 24, 1991.
