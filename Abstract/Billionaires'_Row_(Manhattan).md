Billionaire's_Row,_NYC.jpg BILLIONAIRES' ROW is the name given to a set of ultra-luxury residential skyscrapers, constructed or in development, that are arrayed roughly along the southern end of Central Park in Manhattan, New York City. Several of these buildings are in the supertall category (taller than ), and are among the tallest buildings in the world. Since most of these buildings are built or proposed on 57th Street, the term has been used to refer to the street itself as well.
