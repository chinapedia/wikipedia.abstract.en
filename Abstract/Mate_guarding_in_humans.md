Theatrical_and_circus_life;_(1893)_(14765927762).jpg HUMAN MATE GUARDING refers to behaviours employed by both males and females with the aim of maintaining reproductive opportunities and sexual access to a mate. It involves discouraging the current mate from abandoning the relationship whilst also warding off intrasexual (same sex) rivals. It has been observed in many nonhuman animals (see sperm competition), as well as humans.[1] Sexual jealousy is one of the main causes of mate guarding behaviour. Both males and females use different strategies to retain a mate and there is evidence that suggests resistance to mate guarding also exists.[2]
