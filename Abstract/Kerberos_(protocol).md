KERBEROS () is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of _tickets_ to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol was named after the character _Kerberos_ (or _Cerberus_) from Greek mythology, the ferocious three-headed guard dog of Hades. Its designers aimed it primarily at a client–server model and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.
