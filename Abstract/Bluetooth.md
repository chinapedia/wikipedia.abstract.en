BLUETOOTH is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific and medical radio bands, from 2.400 to 2.485GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs). It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.
