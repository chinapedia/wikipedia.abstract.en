POINT OF ROCKS is a geologically significant outcropping located along U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) southwest of Baraboo, Wisconsin. The formation is made up of Baraboo Quartzite and is part of the Baraboo Range; it dates from the Precambrian and is roughly 1.7 billion years old. Along with the nearby Van Hise Rock, the formation was instrumental in the University of Wisconsin–Madison's development of the field of geology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
