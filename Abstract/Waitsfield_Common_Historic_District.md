The WAITSFIELD COMMON HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses the original town center settlement of Waitsfield, Vermont, at the junction of Joslin Hill, Common, East, and North Roads. Located about from the town's present main village and center, it was laid out in 1793, and includes the triangular town common, a cemetery, and a number of houses built mainly between 1793 and 1841. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.[1]
