RAJ MONTANA BAND is a famous Swedish pop and rock band that also served as a backing band for Swedish singers Dan Hylander and Py BÃ¤ckman. The name derives from the band's original name, RAY MONTANA AND HIS MOONLIGHT BOYS. The band dissolved in 1985 but was resurrected in 1997 for a series of reunion tours and a compilation album of earlier hits.
