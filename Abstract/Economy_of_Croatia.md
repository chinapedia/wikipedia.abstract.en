The ECONOMY OF CROATIA is a developed high-income service based economy with the tertiary sector accounting for 60% of total gross domestic product (GDP). After the collapse of socialism, Croatia went through a process of transition to a market-based economy in the 1990s, but its economy suffered badly during the Croatian War of Independence. After the war the economy began to improve, before the financial crisis of 2007â€“08 the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.
