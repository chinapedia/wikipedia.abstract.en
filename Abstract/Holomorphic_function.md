Conformal_map.svg _f_ (bottom).]] In mathematics, a HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTION is a complex-valued function of one or more complex variables that is, at every point of its domain, complex differentiable in a neighbourhood of the point. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighbourhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal, locally, to its own Taylor series (_analytic_). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.
