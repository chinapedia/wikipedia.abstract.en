BERNARD WHITEHURST, JR. was shot in the back and killed on December 2, 1975 by Donald Foster, a Montgomery, Alabama police officer who said he thought Whitehurst was the suspect in the robbery of a neighborhood grocery store.[1][2][3] In a subsequent cover-up, police officers planted a gun on him.[4][5] The initial police report said that Whitehurst fired a gun at the officers, and the police returned fire.[6] There was no autopsy and the body was quickly embalmed before the family was contacted;[7] the coroner relied on police reports that Whitehurst was killed by a bullet fired through the chest.[8]
