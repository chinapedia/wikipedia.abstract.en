BasaltUSGOV.jpg MAFIC is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and is thus a portmanteau of MAgnesium and FerrIC.[1] Most mafic minerals are dark in color, and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. Common mafic rocks include basalt, diabase and gabbro. Mafic rocks often also contain calcium-rich varieties of plagioclase feldspar.
