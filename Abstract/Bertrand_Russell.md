BERTRAND ARTHUR WILLIAM RUSSELL, 3RD EARL RUSSELL, [1] (; 18 May 1872 â€“ 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, essayist, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate.[2][3] At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, although he also confessed that his sceptical nature had led him to feel that he had "never been any of these things, in any profound sense."[4] Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.[5]
