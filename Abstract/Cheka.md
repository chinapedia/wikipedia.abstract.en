The ALL-RUSSIAN EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSION (), abbreviated as VCHK (, _Ve-Che-Ka_) and commonly known as CHEKA (from the initialism ChK - ), was the first of a succession of Soviet secret-police organizations. Established on December 5 (Old Style) 1917 by the Sovnarkom,[1] it came under the leadership of Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat-turned-communist.[2][3] By late 1918 hundreds of Cheka committees had sprung up in the RSFSR at the oblast, guberniya, raion, uyezd, and volost levels.
