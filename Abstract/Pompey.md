Gnaeus Pompeius|other members of gens Pompeia|Pompeia (gens)|other uses}} GNAEUS POMPEY MAGNUS (GNAEUS POMPEIUS MAGNUS)[1] (; 29 September 106 BC – 28 September 48 BC),[2] usually known in English as POMPEY or POMPEY THE GREAT,[3] was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's second civil war resulted in Sulla bestowing the cognomen _Magnus_, "the Great", upon him. His Roman adversaries insulted him as _adulescentulus carnifex_, "the teenage butcher", after his Sicilian campaign.[4] He was consul three times (twice with Crassus and once a consul without a partner) and celebrated three triumphs.
