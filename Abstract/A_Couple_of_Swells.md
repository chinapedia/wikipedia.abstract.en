Couple_of_swells_sheet_music_cover.jpg "WE'RE A COUPLE OF SWELLS" is an American comedy duet song performed by Judy Garland and Fred Astaire in the film Easter Parade (1948). It was written by Irving Berlin. Berlin originally wrote the song _Let's Take an Old-Fashioned Walk_ for the scene but the film's producer, Arthur Freed, convinced Berlin to change this for a song that would highlight Garland's comedic talent. Berlin wrote the song in about an hour drawing on his experience as a Tin Pan Alley popular song writer.[1][2][3][4]
