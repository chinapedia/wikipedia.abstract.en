The EL PASO STREETCAR is a streetcar system in El Paso, Texas, that opened for service on NovemberÂ 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars[1] that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974.[2] The system covers [3][4] (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance.[5] As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.[6]
