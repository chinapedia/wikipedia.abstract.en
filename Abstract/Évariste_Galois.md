ÉVARISTE GALOIS (;[1] ; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician and political activist. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory,[2] two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.[3]
