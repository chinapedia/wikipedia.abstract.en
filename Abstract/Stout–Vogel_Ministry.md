The STOUTâ€“VOGEL MINISTRY was the second responsible government to be formed in New Zealand. It formed in August 1884 and governed until October 1887. From the outset, Robert Stout served as Prime Minister as well as Attorney-General whilst Julius Vogel held the post of Minister of Finance. Initially, the ministry lasted only two weeks, with Harry Atkinson managing to pass a vote of no confidence against Stout. However, Atkinson failed to establish his own government, and was unable to supplant Stout and Vogel who remained in power for the next three years.
