NISTERIME ACETATE (USAN) (developmental code name ORF-9326), also known as 2Α-CHLORO-4,5Α-DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE _O_-(_P_-NITROPHENYL)OXIME 17Β-ACETATE or as 2Α-CHLORO-5Α-ANDROSTAN-17Β-OL-3-ONE _O_-(_P_-NITROPHENYL)OXIME 17Β-ACETATE, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that was developed as a postcoital contraceptive but was never marketed.[1][2][3] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C17α acetate ester of nisterime.[4] Unlike antiprogestogens like mifepristone, nisterime acetate does not prevent implantation and instead induces embryo resorption as well as interrupts the post-implantation stage of pregnancy.[5]
