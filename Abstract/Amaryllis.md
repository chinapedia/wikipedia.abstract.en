_AMARYLLIS_ ([1]) is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, _Amaryllis belladonna_, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna.[2] For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names _Amaryllis_ and _Hippeastrum_, one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus _Hippeastrum_, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus _Amaryllis_ are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, _Lilium_. In the Victorian Language of Flowers (see Plant symbolism), amaryllis means "pride".
