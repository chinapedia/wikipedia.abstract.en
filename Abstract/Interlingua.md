INTERLINGUA (; ISO 639 language codes _ia_, _ina_) is an Italic international auxiliary language (IAL), developed between 1937 and 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). It ranks among the top most widely used IALs (along with Esperanto and Ido), and is the most widely used naturalistic IAL:[1] in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages, rather than being centrally planned. Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar[2][3] with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages,[4] making it unusually easy to learn, at least for those whose native languages were sources of Interlingua's vocabulary and grammar.[5] Conversely, it is used as a rapid introduction to many natural languages.[6]
