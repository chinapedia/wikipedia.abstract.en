_CHIONINIA FOGOENSIS_ (English: FOGO SKINK or SANTO ANTÃO SKINK) is a species of skink in the _Scincidae_ family. It is endemic to the island of Santo Antão, Cape Verde.[1] The species was named by Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy in 1874. After revision of the species in 2010 based on molecular evidence, it no longer includes the skinks of São Nicolau (_Chioninia nicolauensis_), nor of the original type locality Fogo (hence the species name _fogoensis_).[2]
