Mongolia, with less than a million inhabitants,[1] was considered a breakaway province of the Republic of China by most nations.[2] Throughout the war with Germany, the country provided the Soviet Union with economic support, such as livestock, raw materials, money, food and military clothing, violating Mongolian neutrality in favor of the Allies.[3] Mongolia was one of two Soviet satellites not generally recognised as sovereign nations at the time, the other being the Tuvan People's Republic, both of which participated in World War II.[4]
