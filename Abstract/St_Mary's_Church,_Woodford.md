St_Mary's_church,_Woodford.jpg ST MARY'S CHURCH, WOODFORD is the ancient parish church for Woodford in east London, on the High Road in what is now South Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge. It is known to have existed by the 12th century.[1] Its rector in the 1520s was John Larke. Its medieval west tower and spire were in dangerously poor repair by 1705 and in 1708 it was replaced with a brick tower[2] The medieval church was substantially rebuilt in brick in the Gothic style in 1816.[3] Population expansion led to the construction of the new churches of St Paul's in 1854 and All Saints in 1874, both within the parish.
