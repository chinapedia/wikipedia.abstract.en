JOSIP BROZ (, ; 7 May 1892 â€“ 4 May 1980), commonly known as TITO (;[1] , ), was a Yugoslav communist revolutionary and statesman, serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980.[2] During World War II, he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe.[3] While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian[4] and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, most Yugoslavs considered him popular and a benevolent dictator.[5]
