The KERGUELEN ISLANDS ( or ;[1] in French commonly __ but officially __, ), also known as the DESOLATION ISLANDS (__ in French), are a group of islands in the Antarctic constituting one of the two exposed parts of the Kerguelen Plateau, a large igneous province mostly submerged by the southern Indian Ocean. They are among the most isolated places on Earth, located northwest of the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands (Australia) and more than from Madagascar, the nearest populated location (excluding the Alfred Faure scientific station in Île de la Possession, about from there, and the non-permanent station located in Île Amsterdam, away). The islands, along with Adélie Land, the Crozet Islands, Amsterdam and Saint Paul Islands, and France's Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean, are part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands and are administered as a separate district.
