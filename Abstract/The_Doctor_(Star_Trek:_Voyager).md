THE DOCTOR, an EMERGENCY MEDICAL HOLOGRAM MARK I (or EMH for short), is a fictional character from the television series _Star Trek: Voyager_, played by actor Robert Picardo. The character also appeared in _Star Trek: First Contact_, as well as the now-closed Star Trek: The Experience amusement exhibition at the Las Vegas Hilton. In the show, he is the "Chief Medical Officer" of the Starfleet spacecraft USS Voyager which has been stranded on the opposite side of the Galaxy as Earth, but the warp drive will take decades to get them back to Earth leading the crew to put Sickbay's temporary program on a permanent assignment. In the style of the _Star Trek_ franchise exploration of artificial intelligence, a simple software program becomes a major character for the television show, which aired on United Paramount Network (UPN) between 1995 and 2001.
