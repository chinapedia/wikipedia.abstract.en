_ROGET'S THESAURUS_ is a widely used English-language thesaurus, created in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget (1779â€“1869), British physician, natural theologian and lexicographer. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852.[1] The original edition had 15,000 words, and each new edition has been larger.[2] Roget was inspired by the Utilitarian teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help "those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to hold out a helping hand".[3] The Karpeles Library Museum houses the original manuscript in its collection.[4]
