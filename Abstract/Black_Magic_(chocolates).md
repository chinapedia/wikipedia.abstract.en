BLACK MAGIC is a British brand of boxed chocolates originally created by Rowntree's in 1933.[1] Sold as an affordable version of an (at that time) otherwise very expensive luxury product, they were marketed as a courtship gift.[2] In the 1970s, the brand was advertised using the slogan "Who knows the secret of the Black Magic box?"[3] The brand is now owned by Nestl√©.
