TOYSTORY was a Holstein bull that has sired an estimated 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries around the world.[1] He was owned by Genex Cooperative Inc and he was housed Shawano, Wisconsin.[2] In 2012 Toystory produced a world record-breaking 2 millionth unit of semen at eleven years of age and was the first Holstein bull in history to achieve this mark.[3] This surpassed the previous world record of 1.7 million units of semen set by a Dutch Bull named Sunny Boy.[4] Over his lifetime Toystory produced 2.4 million units of semen. Toystory died on Thanksgiving day in 2014 at thirteen years of age. "The death of TOYSTORY means the passing of the industry's most prolific sire," stated Keith Heikes, Genex Chief Operating Officer, "This bull was one of a kind for many reasons."[5]
