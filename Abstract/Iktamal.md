IKTAMAL (foaled 18 April 1992) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Owned throughout his racing career by Maktoum Al Maktoum and trained in all but one of his races by Ed Dunlop he was a sprinter who raced almost exclusively over distance of six and seven furlongs. In his first two seasons he showed useful but unremarkable form, winning two minor races and a relatively valuable handicap race as a three-year-old in 1995. In the following year he was highly-tried, running eleven times and emerging as a top-class performer. He was disqualified after finishing first in the Chipchase Stakes but went on to win the Beeswing Stakes before recording his biggest success in the Group One Haydock Park Sprint Cup. In the same year he finished fourth in both the July Cup and the Prix Maurice de Gheest as well as running sixth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in South Africa.
