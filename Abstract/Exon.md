An EXON is any part of a gene that will encode a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term _exon_ refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA. Just as the entire set of genes for a species constitutes the genome, the entire set of exons constitutes the exome.
