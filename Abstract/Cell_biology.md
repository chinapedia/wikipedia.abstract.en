CELL BIOLOGY (also called CYTOLOGY, from the Greek κύτος, _kytos_, "vessel") is a branch of biology that studies the structure and function of the cell, which is the basic unit of life.[1] Cell biology is concerned with the physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, life cycle, chemical composition and interactions of the cell with their environment. This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level as it encompasses prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences; it is also essential for research in bio-medical fields such as cancer, and other diseases. Research in cell biology is closely related to genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology and cytochemistry.[2]
