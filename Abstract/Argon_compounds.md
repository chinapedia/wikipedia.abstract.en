ARGON COMPOUNDS, the chemical compounds that contain the element argon, are rarely encountered due to the inertness of the argon atom. However, compounds of argon have been detected in inert gas matrix isolation, cold gases, and plasmas, and molecular ions containing argon have been made and also detected in space. One solid interstitial compound of argon, Ar₁C₆₀ is stable at room temperature. Ar₁C₆₀ was discovered by CSIRO.
