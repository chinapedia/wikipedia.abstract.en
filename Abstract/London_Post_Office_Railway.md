The POST OFFICE RAILWAY, known as MAIL RAIL since 1987, is a narrow gauge, driverless underground railway in London that was built by the Post Office with assistance from the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, to move mail between sorting offices. Inspired by the Chicago Tunnel Company,[1] it operated from 1927 until 2003.[2][3] A museum within the former railway was opened in September 2017.
