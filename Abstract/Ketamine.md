KETAMINE is a medication mainly used for starting and maintaining anesthesia.[1] It induces a trance-like state while providing pain relief, sedation, and memory loss.[2] Other uses include for chronic pain, sedation in intensive care, and depression.[3][4][5][6] Heart function, breathing, and airway reflexes generally remain functional.[7] Effects typically begin within five minutes when given by injection, and last up to about 25 minutes.[8][9]
