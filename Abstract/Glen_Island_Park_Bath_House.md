Glen_Island_beach_house_jeh.jpg The GLEN ISLAND PARK BATH HOUSE, located in the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York, is a contributing resource in the National Register eligible Glen Island Park. The park was originally purchased by transportation industrialist, John Starin, in 1875 to serve as a summer resort for the wealthy in New York City. By the 1920s, with suburban growth rapidly increasing in Westchester County, the park was purchased by the Westchester County Parks Commission to provide recreational space for almost two million visitors a year in the early 1930s. Glen Island Park is eligible for the National Register of Historic places under Criterion A for its association to recreation and Criterion C for its architecture with its Colonial Revival Style buildings.
