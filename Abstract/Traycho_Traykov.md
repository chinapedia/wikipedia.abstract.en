TRAYCHO DIMITROV TRAYKOV () is a Bulgarian politician. He was a Bulgarian Minister of Economy and Energy from 2009 to 2012. In February 2012 he launched an examination of dams in the south of the country after malfunction complaints.[1] In March 2012 it was reported that he had been dismissed from his position allegedly for delaying work on energy projects; Bulgarian-language daily _Bulgaria Dnes_ alleges that it was due to Belene Nuclear Power Plant specifically, a project which was terminated that month.[2][3] Traykov himself "attributed the dismissal to his firm position in negotiations with Russia and his demands that Russia should cut the construction cost of the Belene plant, reduce gas prices by as much as 15 percent in a new supply contract and increase returns from the South Stream pipeline above 8 percent."[4] He was succeeded by his former deputy, Delyan Dobrev.
