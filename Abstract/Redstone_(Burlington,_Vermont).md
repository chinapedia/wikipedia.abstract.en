REDSTONE is a historic former estate on South Prospect Street in Burlington, Vermont. It was developed in 1889, and includes some of Burlington's finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque, Shingle, and Colonial Revival architecture. Its surviving elements are Redstone Green and some of its surrounding buildings on the campus of the University of Vermont, which acquired the property in 1921, and are part of the university's REDSTONE CAMPUS. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as the REDSTONE HISTORIC DISTRICT.[1]
