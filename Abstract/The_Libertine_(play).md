_THE LIBERTINE_ is a play by Thomas Shadwell published in 1676. It is an adaptation of the original plot of _El burlador de Sevilla_, written by Tirso de Molina, which follows the story of a horrid womanizer who plays with his life and others as he commits sins and "shapeshifts" into a devil-like man. Like most of the adaptations, _The Libertine_ is a story of a mischievous man condemned to pay for the actions of his sins.
