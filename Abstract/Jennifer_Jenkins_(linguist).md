JENNIFER JENKINS, FAcSS (born 1950) is a British linguist and academic. She is Chair Professor of Global Englishes at the University of Southampton. She is a leading figure in the study of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), and is an expert on communication in English between non-native speakers. This is a relatively new field of study and her opinions are sometimes seen as controversial. Her interests include attitudes to the international range of "Englishes", English as a lingua franca in higher education, and the implications of ELF for ways of teaching English as a foreign language. She has published and lectured widely and is a founder editor of the _Journal of English as a Lingua Franca_.
