(; ) is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment.[1] The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled _CANDIDE: OR, ALL FOR THE BEST_ (1759); _CANDIDE: OR, THE OPTIMIST_ (1762); and _CANDIDE: OPTIMISM_ (1947).[2] It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism by his mentor, Professor Pangloss.[3] The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, "we must cultivate our garden", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, "all is for the best" in the "best of all possible worlds".
