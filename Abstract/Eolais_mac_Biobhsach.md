EOLAIS _mac Biobhsach_ (alias '' "knowledge", anglicized "Wallis", "Olis" or "Olus" ) was a chieftain of 10th century Gaelic Ireland. He is noted as the first "full chieftain of Conmaicne RÃ©in". His descendants, "the Muintir Eolais", expanded into the territory of present day south county Leitrim, and parts of west County Longford.
