MERIWEST CREDIT UNION began on May 5, 1961 when a group of IBM employees organized the IBM San Jose Employees Federal Credit Union. In 1975 the official name changed to Pacific IBM Employees Federal Credit Union. In 1999 Pacific IBM became Meriwest Credit Union. Today, membership that was once only available to IBM employees and their families, are now available to anyone who lives or works in the Greater Bay Area of Northern California or in Tucson, Arizona. Today Meriwest Credit Union has over 72,000 members and $1.5 billion in total assets.
