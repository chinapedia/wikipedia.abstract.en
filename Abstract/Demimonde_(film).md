DEMIMONDE () is a 2015 Hungarian drama film directed by Attila Sz치sz.[1] It features the story of Elza M치gn치s (Emilia Turcs치nyi), who was killed in 1914 in the water town of Budapest and is well-known in contemporary Pest night life. The film itself is based on the events that have taken place and some of the characters are real, but the creators did not seek to reconstruct the original events; the film differs from reality on many points.
