A group of three suicide attackers rammed a truck bomb into the wall of the German consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan on 10 November 2016. Six people were killed (as well as two of the bombers) and more than 120 others were injured, while the sole remaining attacker was captured by Afghan security forces.[1][2] The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the bombing was in retaliation for an airstrike in Kunduz that killed 30 civilians the week before.[3]
