The RAAF Townsville Aviation Heritage Centre, TAHC, (formally RAAF Townsville Museum) was first opened in 1983 in a small facility housed within the confines of the Townsville RAAF base. Its original purpose was to provide to the general public a medium for displaying the military aviation heritage of North Queensland through artefacts, photographic displays and memorabilia.[1] Initially, the Museum was under the direction of RAAF Museum Point Cook[2] and was open to the public once a month. The Heritage Centre displays a variety of uniforms, insignia, medical supplies, training materials, weaponry, rations and many models of airplanes. Some unusual artefacts include a pack of study cards schools the student in Survival of Atomic Attack and Silhouette cards teach ship identification from the air. Some unopened medical supplies from the 1940s complete with written instructions are also featured.[3]
