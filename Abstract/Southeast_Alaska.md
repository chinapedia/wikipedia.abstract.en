Alaska_Panhandle.png ferry routes]] SOUTHEAST ALASKA, colloquially referred to as the ALASKA PANHANDLE or ALASKAN PANHANDLE, is the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Alaska, bordered to the east by the northern half of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the Tongass National Forest, the United States' largest national forest. In many places, the international border runs along the crest of the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains (see Alaska boundary dispute). The region is noted for its scenery and mild rainy climate.
