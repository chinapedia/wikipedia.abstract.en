_THE MIDNIGHT SUN_ is the second studio album of Scottish composer and dream pop musician Christopher Duncan, known by his moniker C Duncan. While recorded by Duncan in the same bedroom studio as his previous album, _Architect_ (2015), as well as having the same baroque pop sound, _The Midnight Sun_ has a more polished sound due to Duncan upgrading his studio, contains more electronic music elements, is more consistent stylistically, and has a darker tone and atmosphere inspired by Rod Serling's television _The Twilight Zone_. Released in October 2016 by FatCat Records, it landed at number 28 on the Scottish Albums Chart, was well-received by critics and was a shortlist nominee for the Scottish Album of the Year Award.
