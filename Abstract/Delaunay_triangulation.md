Delaunay_circumcircles_vectorial.svg In mathematics and computational geometry, a DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION (also known as a DELONE TRIANGULATION) for a given set P of discrete points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles. The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.[1]
