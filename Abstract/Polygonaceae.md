The POLYGONACEAE are a family of flowering plants known informally as the knotweed family or smartweedâ€”buckwheat family in the United States. The name is based on the genus _Polygonum_, and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, _Genera Plantarum_.[1] The name may refer to the many swollen nodes the stems of some species have, being derived from Greek, _poly_ meaning 'many' and _gony_ meaning 'knee' or 'joint'. Alternatively, it may have a different derivation, meaning 'many seeds'.[2]
