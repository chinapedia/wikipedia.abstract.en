RUSSELL MOUNTAIN is a summit in Iron County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] Russell Mountain lies just east of Taum Sauk Mountain and Missouri Route CC provides access to the two peaks from combined Missouri routes 21 and 72 to the east. The town of Ironton is about six miles to the northeast. The Tom Sauk Trail traverses the Russell Mountain ridge.[2]
