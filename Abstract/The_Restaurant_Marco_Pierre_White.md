THE RESTAURANT MARCO PIERRE WHITE, also known as THE RESTAURANT, RESTAURANT MARCO PIERRE WHITE and later OAK ROOM MARCO PIERRE WHITE, was a restaurant run by chef proprietor Marco Pierre White. The restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel, London, on 14 September 1993. Following the move, the kitchen staff was more than doubled in number, and White used Pierre Koffman's La Tante Claire as a template to pursue his third star. This was awarded in the 1995 Michelin guide. White then moved the restaurant to the Le MÃ©ridien Piccadilly Hotel, London, in 1997, taking on the listed Oak Room as the main dining room. He sought a further rating of five red fork and spoons[1] in the guide, to gain the highest possible rating for the restaurant. It gained this award in the following guide.
