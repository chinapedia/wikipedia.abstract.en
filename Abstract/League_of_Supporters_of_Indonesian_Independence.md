The LEAGUE OF SUPPORTERS OF INDONESIAN INDEPENDENCE (, literally translated as Supporters of Indonesian Independence Bond; abbreviated as IPKI) was a political party in Indonesia established by former Army head General Abdul Haris Nasution as a vehicle for the Indonesian Army to enter the realm of politics. It was influential in persuading President Sukarno to introduce Guided Democracy in Indonesia and return to the 1945 Constitution.
