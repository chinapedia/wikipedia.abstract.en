A VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT), known in some countries as a GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST), is a type of tax that is assessed incrementally. Like an income tax, it is based on the increase in value of a product or service at each stage of production or distribution. However, a VAT is collected by the end retailer and is usually a flat tax, and is therefore frequently compared to a sales tax.
