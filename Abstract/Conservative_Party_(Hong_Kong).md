CONSERVATIVE PARTY () is a new localist political party in Hong Kong established in 2015 by Alice Lai Yee-man. It advocates for the return of Hong Kong to become a British Overseas Territory.[1] In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, Lai's candidacy for the Hong Kong Island constituency was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) with five other localists on the basis that EAC claimed they do not genuinely uphold the Hong Kong Basic Law which stipulates that Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China.
