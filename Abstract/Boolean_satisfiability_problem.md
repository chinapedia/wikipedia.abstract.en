In computer science, the BOOLEAN SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM (sometimes called PROPOSITIONAL SATISFIABILITY PROBLEM and abbreviated SATISFIABILITY or SAT) is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE. If this is the case, the formula is called _satisfiable_. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is FALSE for all possible variable assignments and the formula is _unsatisfiable_. For example, the formula "_a_ AND NOT _b_" is satisfiable because one can find the values _a_ = TRUE and _b_ = FALSE, which make (_a_ AND NOT _b_) = TRUE. In contrast, "_a_ AND NOT _a_" is unsatisfiable.
