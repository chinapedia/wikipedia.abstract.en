PERSONAL JURISDICTION is a court's jurisdiction over the _parties_ to a lawsuit, as opposed to subject-matter jurisdiction, which is jurisdiction over the _law and facts_ involved in the suit. If a court does not have _personal_ jurisdiction over a party, its rulings or decrees cannot be enforced upon that party, except by comity; i.e., to the extent that the sovereign which has jurisdiction over the party allows the court to enforce them upon that party. A court that has _personal_ jurisdiction has both the authority to rule on the law and facts of a suit and the power to enforce its decision upon a party to the suit. In some cases, territorial jurisdiction may also constrain a court's reach, such as preventing hearing of a case concerning events occurring on foreign territory between two citizens of the home jurisdiction.
