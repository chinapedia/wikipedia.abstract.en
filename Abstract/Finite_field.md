In mathematics, a FINITE FIELD or GALOIS FIELD (so-named in honor of Ã‰variste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are given by the [[integers_mod_n|integers mod for any positive integer . If is a th primitive root of unity in a field , then contains all the roots of unity, which are .
