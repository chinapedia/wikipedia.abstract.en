In linguistics, logic, philosophy, and other fields, an INTENSION is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase, or another symbol.[1] In the case of a word, the word's definition often implies an intension. For instance, the intensions of the word _plant_ include properties including "being composed of cellulose", "alive", and "organism", among others. A _comprehension_ is the collection of all such intensions.
