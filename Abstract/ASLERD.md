ASLERD, the ASSOCIATION FOR SMART LEARNING ECOSYSTEM AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, is an interdisciplinary, democratic, professional association open to institutions and individuals. It was founded in 2015 by academics, researchers and scholars, mostly from European Institutions, with the intention of developing the work previously carried out by the Observatory on Smart City Learning (2012-2015). ASLERD is registered as a not-for-profit organisation under Italian law.
