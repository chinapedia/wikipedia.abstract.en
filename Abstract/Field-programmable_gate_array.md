Altera_StratixIVGX_FPGA.jpg FPGA from Altera]] A FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturinghence the term "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of electronic design automation tools.
