VIC COIN is a purely peer-to-peer version of digital currency that would allow online Settlements to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a Central counter party. Part of the solution lies with the digital signatures, but the main benefits are lost if a central counter party is still required to prevent public viewing. Vic Coin suggest a solution to the public-viewing problem using a peer-to-peer network. The system network time stamps all transactions by hashing Vic Coin into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work to form a record that cannot be changed without doing the proof-of-work all over again. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as master nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network control a majority of CPU power, Vic Coin will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and master nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while Vic Coin were gone.
