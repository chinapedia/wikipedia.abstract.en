SHAhmac.svg In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either KEYED-HASH MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE or HASH-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. It may be used to simultaneously verify both the _data integrity_ and the _authentication_ of a message, as with any MAC. Any cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X, where X is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3). The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.
