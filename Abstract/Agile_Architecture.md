AGILE ARCHITECTURE means how enterprise / system / software architects apply architectural practice in agile software development. A number of commentators have identified a tension between traditional software architecture and agile methods along the axis of adaptation (leaving architectural decisions until the last possible moment) versus anticipation (planning in advance). (Kruchten, 2010 )[1]
