_MY DAD WROTE A PORNO_ is a British podcast hosted by Jamie Morton, James Cooper, and Alice Levine. Each episode features Morton reading a new chapter of an amateur erotic novel, titled _Belinda Blinked_, supposedly written by his father under the pen name Rocky Flintstone. Morton, Cooper, and Levine react to the material and provide running commentary.[1] Cooper and Levine are hearing the chapter for the first time, whereas Morton usually reads the chapter before recording the episode.[2] As of 2019, the series has had over 160 million downloads.[3][4] On May 11, 2019, HBO aired a comedy special of the show which features a "lost chapter" from one of the books. The special was filmed over two nights in front of a live audience at the Roundhouse theatre in London.
