This list shows all local and regional political parties in Denmark, who ran in the latest local elections, as well as local and regional parties established before that. Local and regional parties in Denmark are commonly knowns as LOCAL LISTS, CITIZENS' LISTS or COMMON LISTS (Danish: _lokallister, borgerlister and f√¶lleslister_). Those parties are not required to follow the same formats for political parties as the ordinary parties. Furthermore, the name of the party does not have to be approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Local and regional parties only run for local and regional elections.[1][2]
