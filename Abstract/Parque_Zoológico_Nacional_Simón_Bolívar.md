PARQUE NACIONAL SIMÓN BOLÍVAR (ZOOLÓGICO SIMÓN BOLÍVAR) is an urban park of approximately 14 hectares, located in downtown San José, Costa Rica. It is the oldest botanical garden and zoo in Costa Rica. The name pays homage to Latin American national founder Simón Bolívar. It is administered by a conservation nonprofit foundation called Fundazoo.[1] All animals in the zoo are orphaned, injured or have been disabled and are nursed back to health in hopes of releasing them.[2]
