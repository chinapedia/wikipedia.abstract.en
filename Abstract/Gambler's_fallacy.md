The GAMBLER'S FALLACY, also known as the MONTE CARLO FALLACY or the FALLACY OF THE MATURITY OF CHANCES, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.
