"DOLLHOUSE" is the debut single by American recording artist Melanie Martinez. The song was featured on Martinez's debut EP _Dollhouse_ (2014), where it was released as the EP's lead single on February 9, 2014. "Dollhouse" was later featured on Martinez's debut studio album, _Cry Baby_ (2015). Lyrically, "Dollhouse" is about a dysfunctional family, who, according to Martinez, is "hiding being a perfect plastic facade". Martinez has also stated that "Dollhouse" is a metaphor for how people view celebrities and their seemingly perfect public lives. Dollhouse is also the second song of Cry Baby, and this song is also the first official song Melanie Martinez wrote.
