COSMIC CRISP is an American apple with the variety designation WA 38.[1] Breeding began in 1997 at the Washington State University (WSU) Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee, Washington, overseen by Bruce Barritt. Cosmic Crisp combines the best features of the existing Honeycrisp and Enterprise apples—the texture and juiciness of the Honeycrisp, and the late-ripening behavior and long storage of the Enterprise. In breeding the variety, the focus was not on the appearance, but on durability and shelf life. Cosmic Crisp is characterized mainly by uniformly colored dark red skin, dense firm flesh, and an improved shelf life.[2] The look of the apple's light lenticels against its wine-red skin reminded focus groups of a galaxy against a night sky—thus the name Cosmic Crisp.[3] It is the first widely-grown apple variety developed in Washington.[4]
