The present-day village of Peskovka, located at 51.067676, 44.958480 in the Zhirmovsky District of the Volgograd Oblast, Russia, was formerly a Volga German colony in Russia, named Peskovatka, established in 1767, 90Â km south-west of the regional center of Saratov.[1] While the Russian administration named the colony Peskovatka (after the nearby stream), the German people residing there called their colony Kolb, after the first "Vorsteher" (administrative leader) of the colony, Andreas Kolb, who was from Hessenberg.[2][3]
