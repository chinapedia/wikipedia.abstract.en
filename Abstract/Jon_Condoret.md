JON ANDRE CONDORET (French: Jean André Condoret, September 5, 1934 in Algiers, Algeria - August 8, 2010 in Fearrington Village, North Carolina) was a French American architect who infused North Carolina modernist architecture with European sensibility. Along with the works by Harwell Hamilton Harris, Henry L. Kamphoefner, Eduardo Catalano, George Matsumoto and others, Condoret's designs define the architectural demeanor of a U.S. state that has the forth largest concentration of modernist houses after California, New York and Florida.[1][2] According to his daughter, architect Arielle Schechter, Condoret's architecture brings “the natural world into homes,” embraces “the principles of passive solar design,” and uses “textures and materials in delightfully surprising ways.”[3]
