In mathematics, a function _f_ from a set _X_ to a set _Y_ is SURJECTIVE (or ONTO), or a SURJECTION, if for every element _y_ in the codomain _Y_ of _f_ there is at least one element _x_ in the domain _X_ of _f_ such that _f_(_x_) = _y_. It is not required that _x_ be unique; the function _f_ may map one or more elements of _X_ to the same element of _Y_.
