PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY (from Greek , _psȳkhē_, "breath, life, soul"; , _physis_, "nature, origin"; and , _-logia_) is the branch of psychology that is concerned with the physiological bases of psychological processes.[1] While psychophysiology was a general broad field of research in the 1960s and 1970s, it has now become quite specialized, and has branched into subspecializations such as social psychophysiology, cardiovascular psychophysiology, cognitive psychophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience.
