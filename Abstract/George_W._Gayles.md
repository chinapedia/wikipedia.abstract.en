GEORGE W. GAYLES (June 29, 1844 - March 5, 1924) was a Baptist minister and state legislator in Mississippi. He was in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1872 until 1875 and to the Mississippi Senate from 1878 until 1886. He was a candidate for United States House of Representatives in 1892, but received only 6% of the vote due to the voter suppression laws of that period. He was also a noted Baptist minister and was known as the "Father of the Convention" of African American Baptists in Mississippi.
