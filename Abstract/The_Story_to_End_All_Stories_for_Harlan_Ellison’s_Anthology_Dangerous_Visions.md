"THE STORY TO END ALL STORIES FOR HARLAN ELLISONâ€™S ANTHOLOGY _DANGEROUS VISIONS_" (1968) is a 117-word short story by Philip K. Dick, written as an addendum, or spiritual sequel to "Faith of Our Fathers". It is a simply written account of a decadent, dystopian, post-apocalyptic society, characterised by inter-species sex, infanticide, and cannibalism (the story can be read in its entirety below). The story is symbolic and satirical, reflecting ideas of divinity and the consequences of war, themes which figure large in the author's writing.[1]
