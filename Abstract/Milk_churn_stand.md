Milk_churns_on_stand,_Hollybed_Street_-_geograph.org.uk_-_833701.jpg MILK CHURN STANDs were once a common roadside sight in Britain in areas which carried out dairy farming. They were standard-height platforms on which milk churns would be placed for collection by cart or lorry. Some were simple and made of wood, but the majority were built from stone or concrete blocks. Collection of milk churns from stands ceased in Britain in 1979. Many have survived, some being renovated to memorialise the practice, while others have been dismantled or left to decay.
