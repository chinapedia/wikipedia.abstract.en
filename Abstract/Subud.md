SUBUD (pronounced ) is an international spiritual movement that began in Indonesia in the 1920s, founded by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (1901-1987). The basis of Subud is a spiritual exercise called the _latihan kejiwaan_, which was said by Muhammad Subuh to represent guidance from "the Power of God" or "the Great Life Force". He claimed that Subud was not a new teaching or religion, and recommended that Subud members practice an established religion; he left the choice of religion up to the individual. Some members have converted to Islam; others have found that their faith in and practice of Christianity or Judaism, for example, has deepened after practising the latihan.[1] There are Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.[2]
