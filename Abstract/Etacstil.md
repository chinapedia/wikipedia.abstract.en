ETACSTIL (developmental code names GW-5638, DPC974) is an orally active, nonsteroidal, combined selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that was developed for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.[1][2][3] It was shown to overcome antiestrogen (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant) resistance in breast cancer by altering the shape of the estrogen receptor, thus exhibiting SERD properties.[4][5][6][7][8] Etacstil is a tamoxifen derivative and one of the first drugs to overcome tamoxifen-resistance. It is the predecessor of GW-7604,[9][10][11] of which etacstil is a prodrug (GW-7604 being the 4-hydroxy metabolite of etacstil).[12] This is analogous to the case of tamoxifen being a prodrug of afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen).[13]
