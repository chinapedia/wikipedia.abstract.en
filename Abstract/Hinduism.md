HINDUISM is an Indian religion and _dharma_, or way of life, widely practised in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as _SanƒÅtana Dharma_, "the eternal tradition", or the "eternal way", beyond human history.[1] Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions,[2] with diverse roots and no founder. This "Hindu synthesis" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE, after the end of the Vedic period (1500 to 500 BCE), and flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India.
