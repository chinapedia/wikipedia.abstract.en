In computer science, REAL-TIME COMPUTING (RTC), or REACTIVE COMPUTING describes hardware and software systems subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from event to system response.[1] Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as "deadlines".[2] The correctness of these types of systems depends on their temporal aspects as well as their functional aspects. Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. A system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually _guarantee_ a response within any timeframe, although _typical_ or _expected_ response times may be given.
