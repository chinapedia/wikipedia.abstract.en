_SUDDEN DEATH SYNDROME_ (SDS), a disease in soybean plants, quickly spread across the southern United States in the 1970s, eventually reaching most agricultural areas of the US. SDS is caused by a _Fusarium_ fungi, more specifically the soil borne root pathogen _Fusarium virguliforme,_ formerly known as _Fusarium solani_ f. sp. _glycines_.[1]_._ Losses could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars in US soybean markets alone making it one of the most important diseases found in Soybeans across the US.[2]
