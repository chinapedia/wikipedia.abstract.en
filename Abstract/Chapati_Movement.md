The CHAPATI MOVEMENT involved the unusual distribution of thousands of chapatis, a type of unleavened flatbread, across several Indian villages during 1857. The ultimate origin of the movement is unknown; though British agents suggested the chapatis might contain secret notes, inspections revealed no such messages.[1]
