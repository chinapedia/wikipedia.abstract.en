YEREVAN CHAMPAGNE WINES FACTORY ( (_Yerevani Shampayn Ginineri Gortsaran_)), shortly known as "ARMCHAMPAGNE", is the leading enterprise of Armenia for the production of champagne. The factory was opened in 1939 in Yerevan during the Soviet period. At the beginning, it was formed as a factory for sweet and dry wines. In 1954, the factory's production was extended to include sparkling wines.[1] After the collapse of the Soviet rule, the factory of sparkling wines was privatized in 1995 to become an open joint-stock company.[2]
