The FOUNDERS LIBRARY in Washington, D.C. is the main library at Howard University. The building, named The Founders Library in honor of the 17 men who founded Howard University, serves as the iconic symbol of the University. Designed by architect Albert Irvin Cassell, construction began in 1937 during the presidency of Mordecai Wyatt Johnson. As the second library built for the University, the cornerstone was laid on June 10, 1937, and the building was opened for service on January 3, 1939. Today, the library houses over 1 million volumes, the Channing Pollock Theater Collection, and is the home to the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.
