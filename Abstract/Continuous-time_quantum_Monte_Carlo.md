In computational solid state physics, CONTINUOUS-TIME QUANTUM MONTE CARLO (CT-QMC) is a family of stochastic algorithms for solving the Anderson impurity model at finite temperature.[1][2][3][4][5] These methods first expand the full partition function as a series of Feynman diagrams, employ Wick's theorem to group diagrams into determinants, and finally use Markov chain Monte Carlo to stochastically sum up the resulting series.[6]
