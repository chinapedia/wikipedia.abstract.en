BLISSYMBOLS or BLISSYMBOLICS was conceived as an ideographic writing system called SEMANTOGRAPHY consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language.
