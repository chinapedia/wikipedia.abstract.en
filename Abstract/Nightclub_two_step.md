NIGHTCLUB TWO STEP (NC2S, sometimes DISCO TWO STEP or CALIFORNIA TWO STEP) is a partner dance initially developed by Buddy Schwimmer in the mid-1960s. The dance is also known as "Two Step" and was "one of the most popular forms of contemporary social dance" as a Disco Couples Dance in 1978.[1] It is frequently danced to mid-tempo ballads in time that have a characteristic quick-quick-slow beat. A classic example is the song _Lady In Red_.
