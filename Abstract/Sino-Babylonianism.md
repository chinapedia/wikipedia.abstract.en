Jade Emperor shrines are frequently built on raised platforms, especially in western China.]] SINO-BABYLONIANISM is a scholarly theory that in the third millennium B.C.E. the Babylonian region provided the essential elements of material civilization and language to what is now China. Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1845–1894) first proposed that a massive migration brought the basic elements of early civilization to China, but in this original form the theory was largely discredited. In the early 20th century, Sinocentric arguments, sometimes based on Hua–Yi distinction appealed to Chinese intellectuals who wanted to believe that the Yellow Emperor and other figures were historical, not myths. Others reacted to the extent of denying that there were foreign elements in early China. In the late 20th and early 21st century, scholars have used newly excavated archeological evidence to argue that some particular elements of ancient Chinese civilization were carried from western or central Asia into China and that there are linguistic ties between the two sides of the Asian continent.
