DEIA SCHLOSBERG is an American documentary filmmaker and producer. She is the recipient of two Student Emmys. Her October 2016 arrest while filming an anti-fossil fuel protest in North Dakota led to an open letter to President Barack Obama co-signed by 30 celebrities. The arrest puts Deia Schlosberg at risk of 45 years in prison and there have been claims that this is part of a worrying pattern of attacks on journalistic freedom.[1]
