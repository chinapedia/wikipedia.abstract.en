MIRAI () is a malware that turns networked devices running Linux into remotely controlled "bots" that can be used as part of a botnet in large-scale network attacks. It primarily targets online consumer devices such as IP cameras and home routers.[1] The Mirai botnet was first found in August 2016[2][3] by MalwareMustDie,[4] a whitehat malware research group, and has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including an attack on 20 September 2016[5] on computer security journalist Brian Krebs' web site, an attack on French web host OVH,[6] and the October 2016 Dyn cyberattack.[7][8][9] According to a chat log between Anna-senpai and Robert Coelho, Mirai was named after the 2011 TV anime series _Mirai Nikki_.[10]
