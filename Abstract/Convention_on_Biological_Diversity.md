The CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (CBD), known informally as the BIODIVERSITY CONVENTION, is a multilateral treaty. The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.
