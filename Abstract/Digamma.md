DIGAMMA, WAW, or WAU (uppercase: Ϝ, lowercase: ϝ, numeral: ϛ) is an archaic letter of the Greek alphabet. It originally stood for the sound but it has remained in use principally as a Greek numeral for 6. Whereas it was originally called _waw_ or _wau_, its most common appellation in classical Greek is _digamma_; as a numeral, it was called _episēmon_ during the Byzantine era and is now known as _stigma_ after the Byzantine ligature combining σ-τ as ϛ.
