FRANCES A. CHAMPAGNE is a psychologist and professor known for her research in the fields of molecular neuroscience, maternal behavior, and epigenetics. Her main research interest concerns how genetic and environmental factors interact to regulate maternal behavior, and how natural variations in this behavior can shape the behavioral development of offspring through epigenetic changes in gene expression in a brain region specific manner.[1] She won the NIH Director's New Innovator Award in 2007[2] and the Frank A. Beach Young Investigator Award in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology in 2009.[3] She has been described as the "bee's knees of neuroscience".[4]
