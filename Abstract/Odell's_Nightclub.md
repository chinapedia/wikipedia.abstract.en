ODELL'S NIGHTCLUB, opened by Odell Brock in 1976, was one of the premiere disco clubs in Baltimore until its demise in 1992. Located on East North Avenue, Odell's attracted adults aged 18â€“40[1] from all over the city. Odell's was very popular during its beginning, however its popularity was short lived, and in 1984, Odell Brock sold the club. The club would continue to be bought and sold by multiple other people, such as Philip A. Murray in 1985, and Milton Tillman Jr. in 1989. Only 16 years after its initial opening, Odell's Nightclub was officially shut down in 1992 due to complaints of noise and violence.[2]
