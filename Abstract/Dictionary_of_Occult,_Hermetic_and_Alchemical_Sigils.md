_DICTIONARY OF OCCULT, HERMETIC AND ALCHEMICAL SIGILS_, written by Fred Gettings in 1981, is a massive reference, guide & source book, which examines variations in, developments of, & meanings of sigils & symbols, used by occultists, alchemists, astrologers, hermeticists, magicians & others, over the past millennium.[1][2][3] Contains several thousand sigils from the hermetic, astrological and alchemical tradition. These are classified alphabetically. Gettings also included a useful graphic index which links their graphic form with a related verbal meaning and this would make it much easier to use these sigils meaningfully in ceremonies, etc.
