CASPAR (or KASPAR) ISENMANN () was a Gothic painter from Alsace. As the municipal painter[1] of his hometown Colmar and the creator of a major altarpiece for the prestigious St Martin's Church, he was an important representative of the Upper Rhenish school of painting of the mid-15th century[2] and a probable master of Martin Schongauer.
