DagomeVatican-1Copy.jpgDagomeCambraiCopy.jpg_DAGOME IUDEX_ is one of the earliest historical documents relating to Poland. Although Poland is not mentioned by name, it refers to _Dagome_ and _Ote_ (Mieszko I and his wife, Oda von Haldensleben) and their sons in 991, placing their land (called "Schinesghe") under the protection of the Apostolic See. The document's name derives from its opening words.
