The 2016 DYN CYBERATTACK was a series of distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS attacks) on October 21, 2016, targeting systems operated by Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn. The attack caused major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America.[1][2] The groups Anonymous and New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack, but scant evidence was provided.[3]
