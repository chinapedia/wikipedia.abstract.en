MOQUIN'S BAKERY, also known locally as the BISCUIT FACTORY and the NATIONAL BISCUIT COMPANY, is a historic former industrial facility at 78 Rose Street in Burlington, Vermont. Built in 1915 by a local bakery, it was acquired and enlarged by the National Biscuit Company (now better known as Nabisco), which operated here until 1969. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for its economic and commercial historic significance,[1] and has since then been converted into residences.
