The PEARL STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT of Burlington, Vermont encompasses part of the city's first major east-west transportation arteries, which developed from a fashionable residential area in the early 19th century to its present mixed use. It contains one of the city's highest concentrations of early Federal period architecture, as well as a number of fine Queen Anne and Colonial Revival houses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[1]
