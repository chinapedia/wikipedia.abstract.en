_THIRTEEN SOLDIERS: A PERSONAL HISTORY OF AMERICANS AT WAR_ (styled _13 SOLDIERS_ on the front cover) is a 2014 book by United States Senator John McCain and his frequent collaborator and former staff member Mark Salter. (Unlike their previous books, with this one Salter has a co-equal writing credit rather than a 'with' credit.) Published by Simon & Schuster, it contains a chapter representing one person's story from each of America's thirteen major wars.
