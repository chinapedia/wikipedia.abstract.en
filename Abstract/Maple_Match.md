MAPLE MATCH is a dating website and iOS app started by Joe Goldman in Austin, Texas.[1] The site first launched in May 2016 after Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. The stated goal of the site is to match Americans with Canadian citizens to help the former avoid a Trump presidency.[2] Within a week of the site's launch, about 13,000 people had signed up, a quarter of whom were Canadian, even though the app was unreleased.[3] The company reported that its user base "almost doubled" on the night of November 8 when Trump's victory was announced.[4] Goldman responded to claims that the site was satirical by maintaining that it is completely serious.[5]
