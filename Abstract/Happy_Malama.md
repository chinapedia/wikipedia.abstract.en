HAPPY MALAMA (born 1947) is a former Zambian goalkeeper who played for Roan United and was in goal in Zambia’s first ever World Cup qualifier against Sudan in October 1968. He is often mistaken for Innocent “Mummy” Malama, another goalkeeper who featured for the national team prior to Zambia’s independence. In 1970, Malama moved from Roan to Chibuku Warriors for what was then the record transfer fee in Zambian football.[1]
