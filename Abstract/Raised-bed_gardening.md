Raised bed gardening RAISED-BED GARDENING is a form of gardening in which the soil is enclosed in three-to-four-foot-wide (1.0â€“1.2 m) containment units ("beds"), which are usually made of wood, rock, or concrete and which can be of any length or shape. The soil is raised above the surrounding soil[1] (approximately six inches to waist-high) and may be enriched with compost.[2]
