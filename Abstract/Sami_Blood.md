_SAMI BLOOD_ () is a 2016 Swedish coming-of-age[1] drama film written and directed by Amanda Kernell, as her feature film debut.[2][3] The first 10 minutes of the film (and part of the end) comes directly from the short film _Stoerre Vaerie_ (2015, dir. Amanda Kernell). _Stoerre Vaerie_ is Kernell's first film with Sami themes and it was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Park City, Utah, USA.[4]
