THE JERRY CANS (, _Pai Gaalaqautikkut_) are a band from Iqaluit, Nunavut who combine traditional Inuit throat singing with folk music and country music. Their music is largely written in Inuktitut, the indigenous language of the Inuit people, with lyrics which "reflect the challenges and beauty of life in the Far North".[1] Their 2016 album, _Inuusiq/Life_, was released on Aakuluk Music, Nunavut's first record label, which the band's members established in 2016 "to support Inuit and Indigenous musicians".[2]
