SOCIALISM is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers' self-management, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them.[1] Social ownership can be public, collective or cooperative ownership, or citizen ownership of equity.[2] There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them,[3] with social ownership being the common element shared by its various forms.[4][5][6]
