The V-2 MISSILE LAUNCH SITE, BLIZNA was the site of a World War II German V-2 missile firing range.[1] Today there is a small museum located in the _Park Historyczny Blizna_ (Historical Park) in Blizna, Poland.[2] After the RAF strategic bombing of the V-2 rocket launch site in Peenem√ºnde, Germany, in August 1943, some of the test and launch facilities were relocated to Blizna in November 1943.[3][4] The first of 139 V-2 launches was carried out from the Blizna launch site on 5 November 1943.[5]
