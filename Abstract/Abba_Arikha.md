ABBA ARIKHA (175â€“247) (Talmudic Aramaic: ; born: _Rav Abba bar Aybo_, ), commonly known as RAV (), was a Jewish amora of the 3rd century. He was born and lived in Kafri, Sassanid Babylonia. He established at Sura the systematic study of the rabbinic traditions, which, using the Mishnah as text, led to the compilation of the Talmud. With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia,[1] around the year 220. In the Talmud, he is frequently associated with Samuel of Nehardea, with whom he debated on many major issues.
