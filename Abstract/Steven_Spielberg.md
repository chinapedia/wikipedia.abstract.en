STEVEN ALLAN SPIELBERG (; born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] Spielberg started in Hollywood directing television and several minor theatrical releases. He became a household name as the director of _Jaws_ (1975), which was critically and commercially successful and is considered the first summer blockbuster.[2] His subsequent releases focused typically on science fiction/adventure films such as _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ (1977), _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (1981), _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ (1982), and _Jurassic Park_ (1993), which became archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[3]
