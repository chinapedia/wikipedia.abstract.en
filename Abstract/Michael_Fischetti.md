MICHAEL FISCHETTI (born December 21, 1936) is an American stage actor and film actor. His performance in the theatre play _Hughie_ received strong reviews in New York when it ran on Theater Row, at the South Street Theater in 1982. The New York Times described Mr. Fischetti's performance as "an evocative blend of Bogart (an occasional rasp) and Walter Matthau (a deadpan sense of mirth)."[1] The twin bill of Hughie and Before Breakfast then played in Vienna, Austria.
