The GRAY WHALE (_Eschrichtius robustus_),[1] also known as the GREY WHALE,[2] GRAY BACK WHALE, PACIFIC GRAY WHALE, or CALIFORNIA GRAY WHALE,[3] is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of , a weight of , and lives between 55 and 70 years.[4] The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin.[5] Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted.[6] The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus _ESCHRICHTIUS_, which in turn is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae. This mammal descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared at the beginning of the Oligocene, over 30 million years ago.
