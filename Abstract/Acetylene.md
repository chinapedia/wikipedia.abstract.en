ACETYLENE (systematic name: ETHYNE) is the chemical compound with the formula C₂H₂. It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne.[1] This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block. It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.[2] Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities.[3]
