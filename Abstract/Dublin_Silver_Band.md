The DUBLIN SILVER BAND is a traditional British brass band based out of Dublin, Ohio as one of the four Dublin Community Bands, a 501(c)(3) arts organization. It was created by former Ohio State University Marching Band director Dr. Paul Droste and tuba player Dr. Patrick Herak as the Ohio Brass Band in 2008 as a way for high-level non-professional musicians to preserve the British brass band style of music in central Ohio. The name was changed upon joining the Dublin Community Bands.
