Shakespeare-Testament.jpg, written in secretary hand[1]]] PALAEOGRAPHY (UK) or PALEOGRAPHY (US; ultimately from , _palai√≥s_, "old", and , _graphein_, "to write") is the study of ancient and historical handwriting (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing; not the textual content of documents). Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,[2] and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of scriptoria.[3]
