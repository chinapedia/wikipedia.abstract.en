Italy does not have a unified labor code. Labor legislation is wide ranging, with a number of laws, regulations and statutes which have an important bearing on labor relations. The Constitution of Italy (articles 35-47) contain some declarations of principle, however, in regards to fair pay, the maximum working hours, annual paid vacation, the protection of women and minors on the job, social insurance for old age, illness, invalidity, industrial diseases and accidents, on Freedom of Association, and the right to strike.[1] It is hard to say what changes would have happened had the Italian constitutional referendum, 2016 succeeded. The Workers' Statute of 1970 has been recently modified, and this plays an increasingly important role.
