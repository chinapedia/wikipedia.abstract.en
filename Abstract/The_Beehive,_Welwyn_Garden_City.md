The_Beehive,_Welwyn_Garden_City.jpg THE BEEHIVE is a grade II listed public house in Beehive Lane, Welwyn Garden City, in Hertfordshire. The building dates from around the early seventeenth century.[1] It once served as a village store and later as a Beefeater steak house.[2] The pub closed in mid 2016 after mounting losses. Has been converted to a restaurant with a very small bar area, and the previously popular large garden area fenced off leaving only a small outside seating area. Now called Coopers GrillHouse but seems to be struggling to attract customers.[3]
