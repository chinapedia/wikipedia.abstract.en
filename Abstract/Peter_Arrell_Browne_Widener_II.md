PETER ARRELL BROWNE WIDENER II (June 25, 1895 â€“ April 20, 1948) was a prominent American racehorse owner and breeder. He inherited a fortune from his father, Joseph E. Widener, a founding benefactor of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (and younger son of the extremely wealthy business magnate Peter Arrell Browne Widener). His father was also a major figure in Thoroughbred horse racing, being President of Belmont Park racetrack from 1925 to 1939, and builder of the 1932 Hialeah Park racetrack in Miami, Florida.
