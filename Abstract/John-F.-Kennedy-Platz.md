Tafel_Kennedy.JPG]] JOHN-F.-KENNEDY-PLATZ (John F. Kennedy Square), formerly Rudolph-Wilde-Platz, in the Schöneberg section of Berlin is the square in front of the former city hall of West Berlin (Rathaus Schöneberg). It was here that US President John F. Kennedy gave his famous speech to the Berliners, in which he stated: "_Ich bin ein Berliner_". The square was renamed John-F.-Kennedy-Platz on 25 November 1963, three days after Kennedy's assassination,[1] and a large plaque dedicated to Kennedy was mounted on a column at the entrance to the city hall.
