The GRADUATE NURSE (GN) is a nurse who has completed his or her academic studies but not completed the requirements to become a Registered Nurse (RN). Depending on the country, state, province or similar licensing body, the graduate nurse may be granted provisional nursing licensure. A Graduate nurse has not yet passed the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) to become a Registered Nurse (RN).[1][2]
