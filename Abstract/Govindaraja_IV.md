GOVINDARAJA IV (r. c. 1192 CE ) was an Indian king belonging to the Shakambhari Chahamana dynasty, which ruled the Sapadalaksha country in present-day north-western India. After defeating and killing his father Prithviraja III, while he was still a minor, the Ghurid invaders appointed him as a vassal ruler of the Chahamana kingdom. His uncle Hariraja dethroned him for accepting the Ghurid suzerainty. Subsequently, Govindaraja established a new branch of the Chahamana dynasty at Ranastambhapura (present-day Ranthambore).
