THE BOOK OF MOSIAH ()[1] is one of the books which make up the Book of Mormon. The title refers to Mosiah II, a king of the Nephites at Zarahemla. The book covers the time period between _ca_ 130 BC and 91 BC, except for when the book has a flashback into the Record of Zeniff, which starts at _ca_ 200 BC, according to footnotes. Aside from stating that it was abridged by Mormon, the text says nothing about its authorship. Mosiah is twenty eight chapters long.[2]
