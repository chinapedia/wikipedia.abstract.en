ANARCHO-COMMUNISM (also known as ANARCHIST COMMUNISM,[1] FREE COMMUNISM, LIBERTARIAN COMMUNISM[2][3][4][5][6] and COMMUNIST ANARCHISM)[7][8] is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour and private property (while retaining respect for personal property, along with collectively-owned items, goods and services)[9] in favor of common ownership of the means of production,[10][11] direct democracy, and a horizontal network of workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".[12][13]
