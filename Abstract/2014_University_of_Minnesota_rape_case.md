The 2014 UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA RAPE CASE was widely publicized by the American media as it highlighted the inadequacies of police responses to victims of sexual assault. The victim in the case, 19 year-old Abby Honold, afterwards sought to establish federal funding for appropriate training of officials and first responders. A bill known as the Abby Honold Bill was first introduced to Congress by Senator Amy Klobuchar in 2017. It has not yet been enacted.[1]
