PÈNGCÍ (碰瓷 lit. touching or breaking porcelain) is the practice of crooks placing ostensibly expensive, fragile items (usually porcelain) in places where they may easily be knocked over, allowing them to collect damages when the items are damaged.[1] Recently, pengci has been expanded to include a predominantly Chinese crime where scammers feign injury in traffic accidents in order to extort money from drivers.[2][3]
