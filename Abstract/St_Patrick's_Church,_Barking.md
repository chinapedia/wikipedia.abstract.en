St_Patrick,_Blake_Avenue,_Barking_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1754808.jpg ST PATRICK'S CHURCH is a church on Blake Avenue in the Eastbury district in Barking. It was formed in 1924 as the temporary Church of the Ascension, which was turned into a parish hall in 1940 after being replaced by the permanent brown-brick church, dedicated to Saint Patrick and designed by A. E. Wiseman. A parish was formed for the permanent church in 1939 by splitting an area off from that of St Margaret's.[1] In 1959 Christ Church, Barking, was added to the parish of St Patrick's as a chapel of ease. Christ Church, St Patrick's and St Margaret's formed a single team parish until 1st January 2017.[2] It is now a parish in its own right.
