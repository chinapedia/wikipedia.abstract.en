OLYMPUS MONS (; Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. The volcano has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi or 72,000 ft) as measured by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA).[1] Olympus Mons is about two and a half times Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the largest volcano, the tallest planetary mountain, and the second tallest mountain currently discovered in the Solar System, comparable to Rheasilvia on Vesta. In terms of surface area, Olympus Mons is the second-largest volcano in the solar system, second only to Earth's Tamu Massif.[2] Olympus Mons is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature NIX OLYMPICA (Latin for "Olympic Snow"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.[3]
