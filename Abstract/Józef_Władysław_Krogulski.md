JÓZEF WŁADYSŁAW KROGULSKI (4 September 1815, Tarnów, Poland – 9 January 1842, Warsaw, Poland), was a Polish pianist, conductor, teacher, and composer.[1] He first studied with his father, (1789–1859), and later studied with Józef Elsner and Karol Kurpiński at the Warsaw Conservatory. His half brother had the same name (sometimes Władysław Józef instead) and lived from 1843 to 1934.[2]
