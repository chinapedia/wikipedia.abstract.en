POLISH NOTATION (PN), also known as NORMAL POLISH NOTATION (NPN),[1] ŁUKASIEWICZ NOTATION, WARSAW NOTATION, POLISH PREFIX NOTATION or simply PREFIX NOTATION, is a mathematical notation in which operators _precede_ their operands, in contrast to the more common infix notation, in which operators are placed _between_ operands, as well as reverse Polish notation (RPN), in which operators _follow_ their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz,[2] who invented Polish notation in 1924.[3][4]
