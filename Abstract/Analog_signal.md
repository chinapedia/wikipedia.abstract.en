An ANALOG SIGNAL is any continuous signal for which the time-varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., _analogous_ to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves. It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values.[1][2] The term _analog signal_ usually refers to electrical signals; however, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.
