ALGAE (; singular ALGA ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms that are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular microalgae, such as _Chlorella_ and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50Â m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, _Spirogyra_ and stoneworts.
