The crater is one of a group of five (hence the name, Spanish for _five_) craters that were collectively called the Cinco craters during the Apollo 16 mission. The craters were designated _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_, and the largest (_a_) was officially named _Cinco_ after the mission in 1973 by the IAU.[1][2]
