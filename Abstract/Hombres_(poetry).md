_HOMBRES_ is a collection of erotic poetry by Paul Verlaine written sometime between 1887 and 1891, with the exception of "Dizain ing√©nue" and "Le Sonnet du trou du cul". The collection was originally hand-written and distributed by Verlaine, himself. _Hombres_ includes "The Sonnet to an Asshole" ("Le Sonnet du trou du cul"), an erotic poem co-written by Arthur Rimbaud in 1871.
