Intel_A80386DX-20_CPU_Die_Image.jpg A80386DX-20_1988_Sigma-Sigma_no_S-Spec_no_white_logo.jpg The Intel 80386, also known as I386 or just 386, is a 32-bit microprocessor introduced in 1985.[1] The first versions had 275,000 transistors[2] and were the CPU of many workstations and high-end personal computers of the time. As the original implementation of the 32-bit extension of the 80286 architecture,[3] the 80386 instruction set, programming model, and binary encodings are still the common denominator for all 32-bit x86 processors, which is termed the _i386-architecture_, _x86_, or _IA-32_, depending on context.
