NEVO SYNDROME is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually begins during the later stages of pregnancy.[1] Nevo Syndrome is caused by a NSD1 deletion, which encodes for methyltransferase involved with chromatin regulation. The exact mechanism as to how the chromatin is changed is unknown and still being studied.[2] Nevo Syndrome is an example of one of about twelve overgrowth syndromes known today.[3] Overgrowth syndromes are characterized with children experiencing a significant overgrowth during pregnancy and also excessive postnatal growth.[4] Studies concerning Nevo Syndrome have shown a similar relation to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder.[5] Nevo Syndrome is associated with kyphosis, an abnormal increased forward rounding of the spine,[6] joint laxity, postpartum overgrowth, a highly arched palate, undescended testes in males, low-set ears,[7] increased head circumference,[8] among other symptoms.
