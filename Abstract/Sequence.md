In mathematics, a SEQUENCE is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called _elements_, or _terms_). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the _length_ of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first _n_ natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length _n_). The position of an element in a sequence is its _rank_ or _index_; it is the natural number from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the _n_th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with _n_ as subscript; for example, the _n_th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted _F__(_n_).
