AncientGreekDialects_(Woodard)_en.svg The DORIANS (; , _Dōrieis_, singular , _Dōrieus_) were one of the four major ethnic groups among which the Hellenes (or Greeks) of Classical Greece considered themselves divided (along with the Aeolians, Achaeans, and Ionians).[1] They are almost always referred to as just "the Dorians", as they are called in the earliest literary mention of them in the _Odyssey_,[2] where they already can be found inhabiting the island of Crete.
