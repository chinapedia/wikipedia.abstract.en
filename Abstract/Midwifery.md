MIDWIFERY is the health science and health profession that deals with pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period (including care of the newborn),[1] in addition to the sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives.[2] In many countries, midwifery is a medical profession[3][4][5][6][7] (special for its independent and direct specialized education; should not be confused with the medical specialty, which depends on a previous general training). A professional in midwifery is known as a midwife.
