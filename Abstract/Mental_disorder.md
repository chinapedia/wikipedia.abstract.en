A MENTAL DISORDER, also called a MENTAL ILLNESS[1] or PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning.[2] Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders.[3][4] Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional.
