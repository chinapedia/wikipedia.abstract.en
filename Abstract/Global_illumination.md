GLOBAL ILLUMINATION[1] (shortened as GI), or INDIRECT ILLUMINATION, is a general name for a group of algorithms used in 3D computer graphics that are meant to add more realistic lighting to 3D scenes. Such algorithms take into account not only the light that comes directly from a light source (_direct illumination_), but also subsequent cases in which light rays from the same source are reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether reflective or not (_indirect illumination_).
