DARK SOCIAL MEDIA, DARK SOCIAL, or DARK TRAFFIC, are social shares that do not contain any digital referral information about the source.[1][2] The idea is generally used by web analytics as well as in online advertising. In contrary to the sharing on social networking service like Facebook, which is done publicly, Dark social is done privately through IRC channels, emails, SMS or simply copy-and-paste and other ways of private sharing.[3][4] Not to confuse with deep web, dark social media is not about the content but the traffic of online sharing.[5] These sharing activities will often come up under the name of direct, typed/bookmarked or other similar form in today's web analytic services.[6][7] And in 2014, it is believed that Dark Social consisted of 69% of sharing activities globally, whereas Facebook only holds 23%.[8]
