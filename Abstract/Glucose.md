GLUCOSE (also called DEXTROSE) is a simple sugar with the molecular formula . Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide,[1] a subcategory of carbohydrates. Glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. There it is used to make cellulose in cell walls, which is the most abundant carbohydrate.[2] In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is partially stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as starch and amylopectin and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring form of glucose is -glucose, while {{sm is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is of lesser importance.
