SERIES TWELVE OF _THE APPRENTICE_, a British reality television series, began broadcasting in the UK during 2016, from 6 October to 18 December on BBC One;[1] due to live coverage of the UK EU membership referendum in late Spring of that year, alongside live coverage of Euro 2016 and the 2016 Rio Olympics during Summer, the BBC postponed the series' broadcast until the middle of Autumn to avoid clashing with these major events.[2]
