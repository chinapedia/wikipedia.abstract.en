The UNITED KINGDOM participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017. The British entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine, was selected via the national final _Eurovision: You Decide_, organised by the British broadcaster BBC. Six acts competed in the national final, with the song "Never Give Up on You" performed by Lucie Jones being selected the winner following the combination of a public televote and the votes of a professional jury panel. The song was co-written by the 2013 Eurovision winner Emmelie de Forest who participated as a songwriter for the first time. The United Kingdom finished in 15th place with 111 points, the country's best result since 2011.
