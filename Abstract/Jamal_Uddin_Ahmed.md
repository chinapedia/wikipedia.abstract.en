Air Marshal (retd.) JAMAL UDDIN AHMED is a former Chief of Air Staff, the highest appointment in the Bangladesh Air Force (BAF), and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Biman Bangladesh.[1] He was promoted to Air Marshal by then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the day of his retirement from the BAF in 2001. Three years later, the Khaleda Zia government voided his promotion, declaring it unlawful because there was no such post in the BAF's organizational chart.[2] He appealed the decision to the High Court, which in 2008 restored his rank of air marshal, ruling that he had been stripped of it illegally.[3]
