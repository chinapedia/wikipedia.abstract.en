_RADIO FREE ALBEMUTH_ is a dystopian novel by Philip K. Dick, written in 1976 and published posthumously in 1985. Originally titled _VALISystem A_, it was his first attempt to deal in fiction with his experiences of early 1974. When his publishers at Bantam requested extensive rewrites he canned the project and reworked it into the _VALIS_ trilogy. Arbor House acquired the rights to _Radio Free Albemuth_ in 1985. They then published an edition under the current title (the original was too close to _VALIS_), prepared from the corrected typescript given by Dick to his friend Tim Powers.
