_DEBUNKING ECONOMICS: THE NAKED EMPEROR OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES_ is a book by the economist Steve Keen about the problems with mainstream economics. The book was initially published by Zed Books in 2001, and a revised and updated version was published in 2011.[1] Translated versions were also published in Spanish, French and Chinese.[2] The book is suitable for a general reader, and uses words and figures rather than equations to make its points, but is aimed at those with at least some basic knowledge of economics.
