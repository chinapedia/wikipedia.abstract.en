ISOTROPY is uniformity in all orientations; it is derived from the Greek _isos_ (ἴσος, "equal") and _tropos_ (τρόπος, "way"). Precise definitions depend on the subject area. Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix _an_, hence _anisotropy_. _Anisotropy_ is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction. Isotropic radiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented.
