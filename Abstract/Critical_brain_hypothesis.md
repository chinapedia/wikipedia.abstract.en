In neuroscience, the CRITICAL BRAIN HYPOTHESIS states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.[1][2][3][4] Experimental recordings from large groups of neurons have shown bursts of activity, so-called neuronal avalanches, with sizes that follow a power law distribution. These results, and subsequent replication on a number of settings, led to the hypothesis that the collective dynamics of large neuronal networks in the brain operates close to the critical point of a phase transition.[5] According to this hypothesis, the activity of the brain would be continuously transitioning between two phases, one in which activity will rapidly reduce and die, and another where activity will build up and amplify over time.[6] In criticality, the brain capacity for information processing is enhanced,[7][8][9][10] so subcritical, critical and slightly supercritical branching process of thoughts could describe how human and animal minds function.[11]
