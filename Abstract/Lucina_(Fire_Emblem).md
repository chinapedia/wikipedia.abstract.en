is a fictional character and one of the protagonists from Intelligent Systems's 2012 role-playing video game _Fire Emblem Awakening_, part of their overarching _Fire Emblem_ series of video games. Her popularity later led to her inclusion in several other video games, including Intelligent System's 2015 title _Code Name: S.T.E.A.M._, Nintendo's crossover fighting game _Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS_ and _Wii U_, Capcom's _Monster Hunter Frontier G_, and Bandai Namco's crossover RPG _Project X Zone 2_. Lucina would again appear in future _Fire Emblem_ titles as well, including _Fire Emblem Fates_, _Fire Emblem Heroes_, and _Fire Emblem Warriors_, though in more of a supporting role rather than a protagonist with the latter titles.
