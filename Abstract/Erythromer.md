ERYTHROMER is a red blood substitute in development funded by the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Defense.[1] Similar to other HBOCs, the product is stable for several months even when freeze-dried, and can be reconstituted from its lyophilized state in emergency situations. This opens up the possibility of eventual stockpiling of ErythoMer making it easier to supply blood in large amounts to those who need it.[2].
