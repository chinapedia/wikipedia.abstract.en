CYBER POWWOW is an Indigenous-determined online gallery with digital artworks and a library of texts. Conceived in 1996, it was live online from 1997 to 2004 in four main iterations. _Cyber PowWow_ was part webspace and part chatroom, and all artwork displayed on the website was created specifically for _Cyber PowWow_. The website was hosted in Time Warner's _The Palace_, a popular and influential chat room of the late 1990s and early 2000s.[1]
