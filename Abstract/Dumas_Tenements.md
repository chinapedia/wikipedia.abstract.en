The DUMAS TENEMENTS are a pair of four-unit apartment buildings, set back-to-back at 114 West Allen and 114 West Canal Streets in Winooski, Vermont. Built about 1907 by a French Canadian immigrant, they are among the only buildings of their type to survive the city's urban redevelopment efforts of the late 20th century. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[1]
