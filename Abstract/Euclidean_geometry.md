Sanzio_01_Euclid.jpg's _The School of Athens_ featuring a Greek mathematician – perhaps representing Euclid or Archimedes – using a compass to draw a geometric construction.]] EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY is a mathematical system attributed to Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the _Elements_. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,[1] Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system.[2] The _Elements_ begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the _Elements_ states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.[3]
