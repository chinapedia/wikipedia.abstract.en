Spencer Stone, a-then United States Air Force senior airman, was STABBED on October 8, 2015, in downtown Sacramento, California. Stone was stabbed by a 28-year-old California man, James Tran. The event received considerable attention in the U.S., in part because Stone had helped stop a gunman on a Paris-bound train traveling from Amsterdam via Brussels two months earlier in August 2015.
