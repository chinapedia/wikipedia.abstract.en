DORON BRAUNSHTEIN (born May 2, 1976), better known by his pseudonym APOLLO BRAUN, is an Israeli-born musician, author, and former owner of two boutique shops in the Lower East Side of New York City, both named Apollo Braun.[1] The provocative, politically charged slogans of his self-designed T-shirts brought his boutiques public attention on numerous occasions before the eventual closing of his second boutique in 2009. He released his debut album in 2001 and has since released many more.[2] His song "Party in My Pants" appeared in the film _Religulous_.[3] In 2015, Apollo appeared on the Israeli TV show HaKokhav HaBa (English: The Next Star), where he sang two original songs.[4] Braunshtein's music consists primarily of spoken word, and often references or sexualizes celebrities, politicians, and religious figures. He began writing books in 1999 and has since published 7 books in English, and 5 more in his native language Hebrew.[5] The content of his writing includes philosophical essays, plays, poems, and frequently concerns sexuality (Braun is himself openly biseuxal).
