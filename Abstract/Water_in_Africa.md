Overall, Africa has about 9% of the world's fresh water resources and 11% of the world's population.[1][2] However, there is very significant inter-and intra-annual variability of all climate and water resources characteristics, so while some regions have sufficient water,[3] Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous water-related challenges that constrain economic growth and threaten the livelihoods of its people.[4] African agriculture is mostly based on rain-fed farming, and less than 10% of cultivated land in the continent is irrigated.[5][6] The impact of climate change and variability is thus very pronounced.[7] The main source of electricity is hydropower, which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy.[8] Continuing investment in the last decade has increased the amount of power generated.[9]
