DOMINGO ROMEO JAIME was one of the pioneers of Cuban Scouting. The first troops of Boy Scouts in Cuba met under the sponsorship of the American Legion, the _Mother's Club del Vedado_ and the electric generating plant of the _Compañía Cubana de Electricidad_. Angel Loustalot, the son of Jules Loustalot, was commissioner for other pioneers of the Scout Movement, Enrique Quintana, Dr. Moisés Boudé, Domingo Romeo Jaime and Oscar Poey Bonachea.[1]
