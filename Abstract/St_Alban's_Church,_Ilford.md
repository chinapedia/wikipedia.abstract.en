St_Alban,_Albert_Road,_Great_Ilford,_Essex_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1744047.jpg ST ALBAN'S CHURCH, ILFORD is a Church of England church and parish in Ilford, part of the London Borough of Redbridge. It began as a temporary building, replaced by a permanent Neo-Gothic redbrick one on Albert Road built between 1900 and 1906. Both of these were chapels of ease to St Clement's Church, Ilford until the formation of a separate parish of St Alban's in 1958[1] It is now a Forward in Faith parish[2] [3]
