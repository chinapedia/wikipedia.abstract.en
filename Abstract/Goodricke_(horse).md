GOODRICKE (foaled 12 April 2002) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. A specialist sprinter who excelled over six and seven furlongs and recorded his biggest win in the 2005 William Hill Sprint Cup. He showed some promise as a two-year-old, winning two minor races, but missed the second half of the year after running poorly in the Coventry Stakes. In the following year he competed in handicaps and minor stakes before emerging as a top class performer with a second place in the Prix Maurice de Gheest followed by his win in the Spring Cup. He remained in training as a four-year-old but ran only twice and failed to recover his best form. He was retired to stud but has had very little success as a breeding stallion.
