Schrodingers_cat.svg source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor (e.g. Geiger counter) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is _simultaneously_ alive _and_ dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat _either_ alive _or_ dead, not both alive _and_ dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.]]
