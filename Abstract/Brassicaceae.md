BRASSICACEAE () or CRUCIFERAE ()[1] is a medium-sized and economically important family of flowering plants commonly known as the MUSTARDS, the CRUCIFERS, or the CABBAGE FAMILY. Most are herbaceous plants, some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without stipules or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).
