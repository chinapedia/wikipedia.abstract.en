LEXICOLOGY is the part of linguistics that studies words. This may include their nature and function as symbols,[1] their meaning, the relationship of their meaning to epistemology in general, and the rules of their composition from smaller elements (morphemes such as the English _-ed_ marker for past or _un-_ for negation; and phonemes as basic sound units). Lexicology also involves relations between words, which may involve semantics (for example, _love_ vs. _affection_), derivation (for example, _fathom_ vs. _unfathomably_), use and sociolinguistic distinctions (for example, _flesh_ vs. _meat_), and any other issues involved in analyzing the whole lexicon of a language.
