The 2016 EUROPEAN KORFBALL CHAMPIONSHIP was held in the Netherlands from October 22 to October 30, with 10 national teams in competition. As the European Korfball Championship was split into an A-Championship and a B-Championship as of 2018, this tournament was used to decide which teams would participate at which level, with the top 8 teams qualifying for the A-Championship, while the teams in positions 9 and 10 relegated to the B-Championship. Netherlands won the tournament for a sixth consecutive time, maintaining its 100% win record.
