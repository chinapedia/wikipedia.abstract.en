CANNABIS IN SLOVAKIA is illegal. Possession or use of small amounts of cannabis (or only 1 joint) is punishable by up to eight years in prison.[1][2] In April 2012, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported that Robert Fico, the incoming Slovak prime minister, might push for partial legalisation of cannabis possession, and has argued for the legalisation of possession of up to three doses of cannabis for personal use.[3]
