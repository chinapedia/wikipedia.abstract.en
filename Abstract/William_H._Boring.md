WILLIAM HARRISON BORING (February 26, 1841 â€“ December 1, 1932)[1] was an American Union soldier who fought in the American Civil War, and who was a member of the distinguished battalion in the 33rd Illinois Infantry Regiment that helped lead the fall of Vicksburg in 1863. Boring would later come to be known as a pioneer after settling the town of Boring, Oregon in 1874, which took its namesake after him.[2]
