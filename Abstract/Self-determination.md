The right of a people to SELF-DETERMINATION is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a _jus cogens_ rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms.[1][2] It states that people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference.[3]
