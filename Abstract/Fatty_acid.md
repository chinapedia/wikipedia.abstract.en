rasyslami.jpg fatty acids have perfectly straight chain structure. Unsaturated ones are typically bent, unless they have a trans configuration.]] In chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, a FATTY ACID is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain, which is either saturated or unsaturated. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from 4 to 28.[1] Fatty acids are usually not found in organisms, but instead as three main classes of esters: triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. In any of these forms, fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals and they are important structural components for cells.
