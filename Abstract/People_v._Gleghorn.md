_PEOPLE V. GLEGHORN_, California Court of Appeal, 193 Cal. App. 3d 196, 238 Cal. Rptr. 82 (1987), is a legal case illustrative of when a defendant forfeits his right to self-defense, because his own uncharged culpable acts set in motion the conditions in which self-defense would be needed; he caused the condition of his own defense.[1][2] This principle put forth by the court as to the underlying murder case was generalized to other kinds of cases.[3][4]
