Lamium_purpureum_Closeup.jpg'', showing the bilaterally symmetrical flower]] Melissa_officinalis01.jpg The LAMIACEAE ([1]) or LABIATAE are a family of flowering plants commonly known as the MINT or DEADNETTLE or SAGE family. Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities, but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as _Coleus_. Others are grown for seed, such as _Salvia hispanica_ (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as _Plectranthus edulis_, _Plectranthus esculentus_, _Plectranthus rotundifolius_, and _Stachys affinis_ (Chinese artichoke).
