The increase in pollution of the Mississippi River has greatly affected the species that live in the water, as well as those who rely on the river for food and recreational purposes. One of the main types of pollution is an excess of nitrate (NO₃^(−)) caused by chemical wastes from power plants and agricultural runoffs. The watershed covers about 40% of the lower 48 states, with 7 of the 10 top agricultural producing states being within this watershed.[1]
