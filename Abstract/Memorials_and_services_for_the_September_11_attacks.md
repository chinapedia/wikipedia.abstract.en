Wtc-2004-memorial.jpg'' memorial]] The first memorials to the victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of webmasters posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[1] Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.
