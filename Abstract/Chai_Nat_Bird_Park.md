CHAI NAT BIRD PARK is a large bird sanctuary in Chai Nat Province, Thailand. It contains over 100 bird species living in simulated surroundings which match the natural habitat of the birds. Also, it has more than 60 cages of birds. The birds can be observed both in their simulated environment and in the cages. The two highlights of the park are the vast bird cage which is the largest aviary in Asia, and a freshwater fish aquarium.[1]
