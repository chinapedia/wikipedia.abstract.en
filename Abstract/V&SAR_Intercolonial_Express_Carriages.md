V&SAR INTERCOLONIAL EXPRESS CARRIAGES were carriages on a new train called the _Intercolonial Express_ running on Victorian Railways and South Australian Railways in 1887.[1] The track of two railwys met on Wednesday 19 January 1887. The Victorian Railways' Western Line to Dimboola,[2] and the South Australian Railways' Wolseley line, met at Serviceton. Since both sides shared the brhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=V%26SAR_Intercolonial_Express_Carriages&action=edit&section=0&summary=/*%20top%20*/%20oad gauge of 5'3", an agreement was made between the two railways allowing a pool of carriages, classed O, to be specifically allocated to interstate trains linking the capitals of Melbourne and Adelaide. The operating and maintenance cost of the new train would be funded by both railways, roughly 60% paid for by the Victorian Railways and 40% by the South Australian Railways.
