Anchor_of_the_Utile.jpg TROMELIN ISLAND (; , ) is a low, flat, island in the Indian Ocean about north of RÃ©union, and about east of Madagascar. Tromelin is administered as part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, a French overseas territory; however, Mauritius claims sovereignty over the island, on grounds of its absence in the listing of the 8th article of the French version of the 1814 Paris Treaty. France and Mauritius have been negotiating for years in regard to the possible establishment of a condominium over the island.[1]
