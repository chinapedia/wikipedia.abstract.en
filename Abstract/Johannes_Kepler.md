JOHANNES KEPLER (;[1] ;[2][3] December 27, 1571 â€“ November 15, 1630) was a German astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer. He is a key figure in the 17th-century scientific revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, and his books _Astronomia nova_, _Harmonices Mundi_, and _Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae_. These works also provided one of the foundations for Newton's theory of universal gravitation.
