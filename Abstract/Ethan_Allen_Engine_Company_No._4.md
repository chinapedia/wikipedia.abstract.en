The ETHAN ALLEN ENGINE COMPANY NO. 4 is a historic former fire and police station at 135 Church Street in Burlington, Vermont. Built in 1887 for a private fire company, it is a fine local example of 19th-century commercial architecture. It served the city as a fire and police station until the 1960s, and is now used as a commercial space. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is a contributing property to the City Hall Park Historic District.[1]
