GIBER Å is a long stream in central peninsular Denmark in Aarhus Municipality.[1] Giber Å and surroundings is a protected Natura 2000 site. It is located in the Marselisborg Forests approximately 4 miles south of the city of Aarhus. Giber Å begins in Testrup Bog (Danish: Testrup Mose) south of the suburb Tranbjerg and runs through Mårslet before passing Vilhelmsborg Manor and ending in the Kattegat by _Moesgård Beach_. The streams _Ballebæk_, _Morsebæk_, _Hovedgrøften_ and _Kapelbæk_ are tributaries to Giber Å and the stream is in addition fed by the water treatment plants in the area. Giber Å has since the Middle Ages marked the border between Beder and Mårslet Parishes and today the stream forms the northern border of the local municipal administrative area "Beder-Malling-Ajstrup".[2]
