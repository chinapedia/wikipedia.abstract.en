CENESTHOPATHY (from [1], formed from the Ancient Greek κοινός () „common“, αἴσθησῐς () „feeling“, „perception“ + πᾰ́θος () „feeling, suffering, condition“), also known as COENESTHESIOPATHY[2], is a rare psychiatric term used to refer to the feeling of being ill and this feeling is not localized to one region of the body.[3] Most notably, cenesthopathies are characterized by aberrant and strange bodily sensations (for example, a feeling of wires or coils being present within the oral region; tightening, burning, pressure, tickling etc. occurring in various parts of the body, and so on).[4]
