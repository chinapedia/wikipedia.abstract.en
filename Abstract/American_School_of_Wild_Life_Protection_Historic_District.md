The purpose of the school was to promote resource conservation values among the public. It grew out legislation in 1918 that established state parks in Iowa. The school also promoted the idea of establishing a national park in the Upper Mississippi River Valley, and after that did not come about, the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.[2] The school continued in existence until 1941.
