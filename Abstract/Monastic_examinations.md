Monk_examinations,_Bago,_Myanmar.jpg MONASTIC EXAMINATIONS comprise the annual examination system used in Myanmar (Burma) to rank and qualify members of the Buddhist sangha, or community of Buddhist monks. While the institution of monastic examinations first began during pre-colonial era,[1] modern-day examinations are conducted by the Ministry of Religious Affairs's Department of Religious Affairs.[2]
