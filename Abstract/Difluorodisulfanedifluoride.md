1,1,1,2-TETRAFLUORODISULFANE, also known as 1,2-DIFLUORODISULFANE 1,1-DIFLUORIDE or just DIFLUORODISULFANEDIFLUORIDE (FSSFâ‚ƒ) is an unstable molecular compound of fluorine and sulfur. The molecule has a pair of sulfur atoms, with one fluorine atom on one sulfur, and three fluorine atoms on the other. It has the uncommon property that all the bond lengths are different.[1] The bond strength is not correlated with bond length but is inversely correlated with the force constant (Badger's rule).[2] The molecule can be considered as sulfur tetrafluoride in which a sulfur atom is inserted into a S-F bond.[3]
