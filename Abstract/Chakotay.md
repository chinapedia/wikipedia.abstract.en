CHAKOTAY is a fictional character who appears in each of the seven seasons of the American science fiction television series _Star Trek: Voyager_. Portrayed by Robert Beltran, he is First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS _Voyager_. The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series. He is the first Native American main character in the _Star Trek_ franchise. This was a deliberate move by the producers of the series, who sought to provide an inspiration as with Uhura in _Star Trek: The Original Series_ for African Americans. To develop the character, the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater. Despite first being named as a Sioux, and later a Hopi, Chakotay was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series, something that was later resolved in the episode "Tattoo".
