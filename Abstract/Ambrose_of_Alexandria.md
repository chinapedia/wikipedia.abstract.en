AMBROSE OF ALEXANDRIA (before 212 â€“ c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212. At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,[1] and was ordained deacon.[2][3] He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries () on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,[4] he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.[5]
