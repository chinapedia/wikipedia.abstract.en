The HOUGHTON HOUSE is a historic house at 86 South Main Street in the city of St. Albans, Vermont. Built about 1800, with an interior dating to 1829-30, it is a fine and little-altered local example of transitional Georgian-Federal styling, and is one of the city's oldest surviving buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[1] It presently houses a funeral home.
