ROBERT WESLEY CRISWELL (1850 â€“ August 3, 1905) was an American humorist, journalist, and newspaper editor. He was known for his popular essays and books under the pen name GRANDFATHER LICKSHINGLE. After working at newspapers in Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, he joined the _New York World_, and later became editor of the _New Yorker_ newspaper. In 1905 he was arrested for criminal libel after publishing an article allegedly impugning Alice Roosevelt, daughter of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. While awaiting trial for libel, and also under suspicion of defrauding subscribers, he was struck by a New York City subway train in an apparent suicide.[1]
