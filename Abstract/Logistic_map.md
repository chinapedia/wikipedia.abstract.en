The LOGISTIC MAP is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations.[1] The map was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May,[2] in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation first created by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst.[3] Mathematically, the logistic map is written where is a number between zero and one that represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population. The values of interest for the parameter (sometimes also denoted ) are those in the interval . This nonlinear difference equation is intended to capture two effects:
