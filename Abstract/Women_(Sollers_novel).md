_WOMEN_ () is a 1983 novel by French novelist Philippe Sollers. First published in English translation in 1990, _Women_ marked Sollers' move to a more accessible form of fiction writing after a series of difficult experimental texts. The novel was a best-seller in France and attracted attention as a _roman Ã  clef_ that contained recognizable portraits of significant French intellectual figures, such as Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and Sollers himself.
