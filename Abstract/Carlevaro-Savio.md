CARLEVARO-SAVIO was a manufacturer of aerial ropeways originally based in Turin, Italy, well known for their early gondola lifts. Their design was known for its lattice towers as well as its futuristic gondola cabins. When they went bankrupt, they were bought by Agudio. The first mountains where Carlevaro built gondolas was at Sugarbush, Mt. Snow, Killington, Wildcat, Crested Butte, Beech Mountain, Cherokee and Silver Springs Amusement Park. The early gondola cabins were made of metal, and the later models were fiberglass. These Gondolas were also sometimes branded as the Telecar.[1] The two-seater Carlevaro-Savio gondola car was nicknamed the "Noon Balloon." [2]
