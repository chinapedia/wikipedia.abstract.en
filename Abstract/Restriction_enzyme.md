A RESTRICTION ENZYME, RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASE, or '' RESTRICTASE '' is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as restriction sites.[1][2][3] Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.
