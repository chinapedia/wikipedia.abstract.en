of an algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers _a_ and _b_ in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the _number_ _b_ in location B is greater than or equal to the _number_ _a_ in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number _b_ − _a_ replaces the old _b_). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]] 's diagram from "note G", the first published computer algorithm.]]
