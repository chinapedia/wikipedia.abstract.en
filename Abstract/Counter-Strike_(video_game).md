_COUNTER-STRIKE_ (also known as _HALF-LIFE: COUNTER-STRIKE_) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a _Half-Life_ modification by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. _Counter-Strike_ was released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the _Counter-Strike_ series. Several remakes and ports of _Counter-Strike_ have been released on the Xbox console (by Microsoft Game Studios), as well as OS X and Linux. It is commonly referred to as _COUNTER-STRIKE 1.6_ to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major software update the game received.
