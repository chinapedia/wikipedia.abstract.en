ROME (Latin and ) is the capital city and a special _comune_ of Italy (named _Comune di Roma Capitale_). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With 2,872,800 residents in ,[1] it is also the country's most populated _comune_. It is the fourth most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[2] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[3] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.[4][5]
