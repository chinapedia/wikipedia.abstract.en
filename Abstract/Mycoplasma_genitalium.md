_MYCOPLASMA GENITALIUM'' (_MG'',[1] commonly known as MGEN), is a sexually transmitted,[2] small and pathogenic bacterium that lives on the skin cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans.[3] Mgen is becoming increasingly common.[4][5] Resistance to multiple antibiotics is occurring,[6] including azithromycin which until recently was the most reliable line treatment. The bacteria was first isolated from urogenital tract of humans in 1981,[7] and was eventually identified as a new species of _Mycoplasma_ in 1983.[8] It can cause negative health effects in men and women. It also increases the risk factor for HIV spread[9] with higher occurrences in homosexual men and those previously treated with the azithromycin antibiotics.[10][11]
