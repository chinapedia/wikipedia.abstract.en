A PHOBIA is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation.[1] The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months.[2] The affected person goes to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, to a degree greater than the actual danger posed.[3] If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person experiences significant distress.[4] With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur.[5] Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks.[6] Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.[7]
