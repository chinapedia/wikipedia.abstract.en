TESTOSTERONE (T) is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone.[1] It is used to treat male hypogonadism and certain types of breast cancer.[2] It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping.[3] It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.[4] Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth.[5]
