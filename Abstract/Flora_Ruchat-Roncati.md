Ritratto_Flora_Ruchat-Roncati.jpg FLORA RUCHAT-RONCATI (1937–2012) was a Swiss architect and professor. She was from Ticino, but spent time in Zürich and worked at ETH Zurich. She was co-winner, with her assistant Renato Salvi, of a competition to design the Transjurane highway in 1988.[1] The highway joins the Swiss and French road networks through the Jura mountains and involves many tunnels. Eleven of the tunnels are over a kilometre long.
