DIEGO ARMANDO MARADONA (, born 30 October 1960) is an Argentine retired professional footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time. He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.[1][2] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature (), which gave him a low center of gravity allowing him to maneuver better than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "_El Pibe de Oro_" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[3]
