METHANDRIOL DIACETATE, or METHYLANDROSTENEDIOL DIACETATE, also known as 17Α-METHYLANDROST-5-ENE-3,17Β-DIOL 3,17Β-DIACETATE, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 5-androstenediol that was never marketed.[1] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C3,17β diacetate ester of methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol) – and acts as a prodrug of methandriol in the body.[2]
