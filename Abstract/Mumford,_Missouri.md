MUMFORD is an unincorporated community in Greene County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The community was located at the junction of Jones Branch and Pierson Creek about 1.3 miles east of the current U.S. 65 bypass of east Springfield. The old St. Louis - San Francisco Railroad (currently the BNSF Railroad) passes just southwest of the location. The old Mt. Pisgah School was located just to the north.[2]
