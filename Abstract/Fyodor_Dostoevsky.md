FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOEVSKY (;[1] ; 11 November 18219 February 1881[2]), sometimes transliterated DOSTOYEVSKY, was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist, journalist and philosopher. Dostoevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed works include _Crime and Punishment_ (1866), _The Idiot_ (1869), _Demons_ (1872) and _The Brothers Karamazov_ (1880). Dostoevsky's oeuvre consists of 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest psychologists in world literature.[3] His 1864 novella _Notes from Underground_ is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature.
