The _LIBRO DE LAS ESTAMPAS_ ("Book of the Pictures") or _TESTAMENTOS DE LOS REYES DE LEÓN_ ("Donations of the Kings of León") is a late twelfth-century cartulary codex of León Cathedral. It contains copies of donations from seven kings—Ordoño II, Ordoño III, Ramiro III, Vermudo II, Alfonso V, Fernando I and Alfonso VI—and one countess, Sancha Muñiz. Each copy is preceded by an illustration of the donor. All but Ordoño II are shown bearing the original charter (a scroll with a large seal). These lavish depictions in the Romanesque style served an authenticating function.[1][2][3][4]
