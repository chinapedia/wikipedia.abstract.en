RENÉ DESCARTES (; ;[1][2][3] ; Latinized: RENATUS CARTESIUS; adjectival form: _Cartesian_[4] ()[5]; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–1649) of his life in the Dutch Republic after serving for a while in the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the Dutch Golden Age,[6] Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy.
