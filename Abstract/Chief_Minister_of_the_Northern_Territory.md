The CHIEF MINISTER OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY is the head of government of the Northern Territory. The office is the equivalent of a State Premier. When the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as MAJORITY LEADER. This title was used in the first parliament (1974â€“1977) and the first eighteen months of the second. When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister.
