The HONDA 500 TWINS are a series of straight-twin motorcycles made by Honda since 2013. They are the CB500F standard/naked bike, the CBR500R sport bike, and the CB500X adventure touring bike. Their introduction coincided with new European licensing regulations establishing a mid-range class of motorcycles of limited power.[1] The new 500 twins are similar to the earlier CB500 parallel-twins discontinued in 2003, but with new engines, frames, and other parts. They are made in Thailand, where Honda had previously only made smaller displacement motorcycles.[2]
