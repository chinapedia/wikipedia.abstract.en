_BAD SAMARITANS_ is a book about economy written by Ha-Joon Chang, a South Korean institutional economist specialising in development economics. The book criticizes economic mainstream and neo-liberalism. Chang mentioned developed countries require developing countries to change and open their markets. Rich and powerful governments and institutions are actually being 'Bad Samaritans': their intentions are worthy but their simplistic free-market ideology and poor understanding of history leads them to inflict policy errors on others.[1]
