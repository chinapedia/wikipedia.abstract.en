The American industrial rock band Marilyn Manson and its eponymous vocalist have received numerous awards and accolades. Formed in 1989 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida by Manson and the band's original guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, their highly visualized concerts quickly gained them a reputation in the South Florida area. The _Miami New Times_ named Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids – the earliest incarnation of the band – the 'Best Local Heavy Metal Band' in 1992. The following year, the band – who, by now, had shortened their name to Marilyn Manson – won two awards at the second annual South Florida Slammies. They would go on to win a further seven Slammies over the next three years, making them the second-most decorated band in the awards' history.
