Lydia_circa_50_AD_-_English_legend.jpg GORDUS or GORDOS (),[1] also known as JULIA GORDUS or IULIA GORDOS, and possibly also known as POROTTA,[2][3] was an ancient Greek city located in eastern Lydia (modern western Turkey). It was a strategically important town founded by the Seleucid Kings. The Julio-Claudian emperors of the Roman Empire renamed the city Julia Gordos in the 1st century and the city minted its own coins.[4][5][6]
