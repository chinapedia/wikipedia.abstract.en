The JB-3 TIAMAT was subsonic air-to-air missile program that began in January 1944 for the U.S. Army Air Force under project MX-570. Prime contractor was Hughes Aircraft Company Electronics Division which developed the Tiamat with the assistance of the NACA.[1][2][3][4] Testing continued into 1946, but the project was cancelled due to ongoing problems in a period of limited development funding as well as the appearance of more promising missile designs.
