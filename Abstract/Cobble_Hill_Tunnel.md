The COBBLE HILL TUNNEL (also known as the ATLANTIC AVENUE TUNNEL) is an abandoned Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) tunnel beneath Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, New York City, running through the neighborhoods of Downtown Brooklyn and Cobble Hill. When open, it ran for about between Columbia Street and Boerum Place.[1] It is the oldest railway tunnel beneath a city street in North America that was fully devoted to rail.[2][3]
