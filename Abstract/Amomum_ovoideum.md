_AMOMUM OVOIDEUM_ is a widespread shade-demanding rhizomatous herb of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is perennial, producing leafy stems up to 3.0 m tall from a subterranean, long, and much-branched rhizome. The plant bears fruits up to 2Â cm long, covered by slender, soft, red spines. When dried, the fruit produces cardamom seedpods similar to other cardamom spice plants.
