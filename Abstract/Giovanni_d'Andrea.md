Bologna_museum,_arca_di_giovanni_di_andrea_(m._1348)_02.JPG GIOVANNI D'ANDREA or JOHANNES ANDREÆ (1270  1275 – 1348) was an Italian expert in canon law, the most renowned and successful canonist of the later Middle Ages. His contemporaries referred to him as _iuris canonici fons et tuba_ ("the fount and trumpet of canon law"). Most important among his works were extensive commentaries on all of the official collections of papal decretals, papal judgments in the form of letters to delegated judges that were at the core of canon law.
