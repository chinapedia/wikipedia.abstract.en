PAUL THE APOSTLE (; ; ; c. 5 – c. 64 or 67),[1][2][3] commonly known as SAINT PAUL and also known by his Jewish name SAUL OF TARSUS (; ),[4][5] was an apostle (although not one of the Twelve Apostles) who taught the gospel of Christ to the first-century world.[6] Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age[7][8] and in the mid-30s to the mid-50s AD he founded several churches in Asia Minor and Europe. He took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences.
