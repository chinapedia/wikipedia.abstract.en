The CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB (CCC) is Europe's largest association of hackers[1] with registered members.[2] It is incorporated as an _eingetragener Verein_ in Germany, with local chapters (called _Erfa-Kreise|de|Erfahrungsaustauschgruppe}}_) in various cities in Germany and other German-speaking countries. Since 1985 and again since 2012 some chapters in Switzerland are organised in the independent sister association (CCC-CH) instead.
