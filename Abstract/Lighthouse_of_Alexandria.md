The LIGHTHOUSE OF ALEXANDRIA, sometimes called the PHAROS OF ALEXANDRIA (; Ancient Greek: ὁ Φάρος τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας, contemporary Koine ), was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (280–247 BC),[1] which has been estimated to be in overall height.[2] One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world.
