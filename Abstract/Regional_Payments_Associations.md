REGIONAL PAYMENTS ASSOCIATIONS _(familiarly RPAs)_ are independently run, American not-for-profit trade associations that provide electronic payments-related education and operational support to payments professionals. Each association is a direct member of NACHA - The Electronic Payments Association and is certified to provide continuing education in payments, particularly in Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions. RPA membership allows payments professionals to earn the Accredited ACH Professional (AAP) designation.
