The ST. PETER'S CHURCH[1] ( ) is a religious building belonging to the Catholic Church which is next to a monastery in Tiberias,[2] a town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, in the Lower Galilee, in northern District of Israel.[3][4] The church is named after St. Peter one of the apostles of Jesus, because it is near where Catholics believe that St. Peter was a fisherman in Galilee.
