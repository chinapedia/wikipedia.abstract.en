HANS-JOACHIM SCHOEPS (January 30, 1909 Berlin - July 8, 1980 Erlangen) was a German-Jewish historian of religion and religious philosophy. He was professor of religions and religious history at the University of Erlangen.[1] Prior to World War II, Schoeps was leader of the German Vanguard (Der deutsche Vortrupp), the German-Jewish followers of Hitler, also referred to as "Nazi Jews". Schoeps went into exile in Falun/Sweden at the end of 1938 (seven weeks after the Kristallnacht), just before the persecutions began in earnest. There his two sons were born. His parents were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp June 4, 1942. His father (* 1864) died there six months later; his mother (* 1886) was gased in Auschwitz.
