GILLES DELEUZE (; ; 18 January 1925 – 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of _Capitalism and Schizophrenia_: _Anti-Oedipus_ (1972) and _A Thousand Plateaus_ (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise _Difference and Repetition_ (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.[1] A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the "greatest philosophers".[2] Although he once characterized himself as a “pure metaphysician”,[3] his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across philosophy and art, including literary theory, post-structuralism and postmodernism.[4]
