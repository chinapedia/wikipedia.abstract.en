POPE CLEMENT VII (; ) (26 May 1478 – 25 September 1534), born GIULIO DI GIULIANO DE' MEDICI, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 19 November 1523 to his death on 25 September 1534.[1] “The most unfortunate of the Popes,” Clement VII’s reign was marked by a rapid succession of political, military, and religious struggles — many long in the making — which had far-reaching consequences for Christianity and world politics.[2]
