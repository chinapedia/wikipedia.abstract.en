In mathematics, particularly in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, a CHARACTERISTIC SUBGROUP is a subgroup that is mapped to itself by every automorphism of the parent group.[1][2] Because every conjugation map is an inner automorphism, every characteristic subgroup is normal; though the converse is not guaranteed. Examples of characteristic subgroups include the commutator subgroup and the center of a group.
