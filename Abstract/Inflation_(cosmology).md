In physical cosmology, COSMIC INFLATION, COSMOLOGICAL INFLATION, or just INFLATION, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10^(−36) seconds after the conjectured Big Bang singularity to some time between 10^(−33) and 10^(−32) seconds after the singularity. Following the inflationary period, the universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate.[1]
