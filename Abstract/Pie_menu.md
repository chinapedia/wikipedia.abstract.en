EasyGestures_PieMenu.png In user interface design, a PIE MENU (also known as a RADIAL MENU) is a circular context menu where selection depends on direction. It is a graphical control element. A pie menu is made of several "pie slices" around an inactive center and works best with stylus input, and well with a mouse. Pie slices are drawn with a hole in the middle for an easy way to exit the menu.
