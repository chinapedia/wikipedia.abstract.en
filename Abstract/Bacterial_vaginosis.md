BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by excessive growth of bacteria.[1][2] Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish.[3] The discharge is usually white or gray in color.[4] Burning with urination may occur.[5] Itching is uncommon.[6][7] Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.[8] Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.[9][10] It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.[11][12]
