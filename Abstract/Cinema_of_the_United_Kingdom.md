The UNITED KINGDOM has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film production reached an all-time high in 1936,[1] the "golden age" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean,[2] Michael Powell, (with Emeric Pressburger)[3] and Carol Reed[4] produced their most critically acclaimed works. Many British actors have achieved worldwide fame and critical success, such as Maggie Smith, Roger Moore, Michael Caine,[5] Sean Connery,[6] Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet[7]. Some of the films with the largest ever box office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the third and fourth highest-grossing film franchises (_Harry Potter_ and _James Bond_).[8]
