CATHERINE LUCILLE MOORE (January 24, 1911 â€“ April 4, 1987) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer, who first came to prominence in the 1930s writing as C. L. MOORE. She was among the first women to write in the science fiction and fantasy genres, though earlier woman writers in these genres include Clare Winger Harris, Greye La Spina, and Francis Stevens, amongst others. Nevertheless, Moore's work paved the way for many other female speculative fiction writers.
