_HYMN TO THE NILE_ is a tune that was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.[1] Because the ancient Egyptians had relied on this miracle river, Egypt was the “Gift of the Nile.”[2] Occurring at about 450 BCE, Herodotus—a Greek historian—called Egypt the “Gift of the Nile” because ancient Egyptian civilization depended on the resources from the river so they could continue living in that vicinity.[3] Beyond the Nile River is the Sahara Desert, and since it almost impossible to grow food in the desert, very few people lived far from the river itself. People that were settled close to the banks of the Nile shared the same language and also worshipped similar gods.[4]
