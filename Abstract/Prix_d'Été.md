PRIX D'ÉTÉ is a race for four-year-old Standardbred pacers at Hippodrome 3R in Trois-Rivières, Québec. It was run for the first time in 1966 as the _Prix d'Automne_ (Autumn Classic) at the now defunct Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal. Run over a distance of one mile on a 5/8 mile oval track, the race was open to pacers age four and older. A $50,000 purse made it the richest harness race at that time in Canadian history. In 1967 the race was renamed the _L'Amble du Centenaire_ (Centennial Pace) in honor of Canada's 100 birthday and made open to pacers age three and older. In 1968 it became the Prix d'Été and in 1971 was modified to a stake race for three-year-old pacers.[1] Retrieved August 2, 2016.
