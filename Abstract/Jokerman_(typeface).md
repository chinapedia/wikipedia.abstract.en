JOKERMAN is a decorative typeface created in 1995 by British designer Andrew K. Smith.[1] It employs dots, spirals and straight lines that can be either attached or placed near each letter or integrated into the character to create negative space. It is described by Microsoft as having "fanciful internal and external elements".[2]
