NIFLHEIM or NIFLHEIMR ("World of Mist",[1] literally "Home of Mist") is one of the Nine Worlds and is a location in Norse mythology which sometimes overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel. The name _Niflheimr_ only appears in two extant sources: _Gylfaginning_ and the much-debated _Hrafnagaldr Óðins_.
