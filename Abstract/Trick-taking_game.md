The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in PLAIN-TRICK GAMES such as Whist, Contract bridge, Spades, Napoleon, Euchre, Rowboat, Clubs and Spoil Five, or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in POINT-TRICK GAMES such as Pinochle, the Tarot family, Mariage, Rook, All Fours, Manille, Briscola, and most evasion games like Hearts.[1] The domino game Texas 42 is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game. TRICK-AND-DRAW GAMES are trick-taking games in which the players can fill up their hands after each trick. In most variants, players are free to play any card into a trick in the first phase of the game, but must _follow suit_ as soon as the stock is depleted. TRICK-AVOIDANCE GAMES like Reversis or Polignac are those in which the aim is to is avoid taking some or all tricks.
