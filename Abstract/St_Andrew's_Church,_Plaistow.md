StAndrewsChurchPlaistow.jpg ST ANDREW'S CHURCH was a Church of England church on Barking Road in Plaistow, east London.[1] It began as a small mission built in 1860 on Whitwell Road by St Mary's Church, Plaistow. A permanent church designed by James Brooks opened in 1870 on a site just south of the northern outfall sewer embankment and a separate parish assigned to it the following year. A large central crossing tower with a pyramidal spire was planned but only completed as far as the ridge of the nave roof.
