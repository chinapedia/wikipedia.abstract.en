Calico_Sample.JPG shown against a centimetre scale.]] CALICO (; in British usage since 1505)[1] is a plain-woven textile made from unbleached and often not fully processed cotton. It may contain unseparated husk parts, for example. The fabric is far less fine than muslin, but less coarse and thick than canvas or denim, but it is still very cheap owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance.
