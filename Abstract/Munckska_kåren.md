_MUNCKSKA KÅREN_ (literally "the Munck corps", formally _Stockholms luftförsvars frivilliga beredskapsförening_) was a Swedish secret paramilitary group founded by the retired lieutenant general Bror Munck in 1927.[1] While nominally apolitical, it was founded to protect the Swedish state against "domestic enemies", implying not fascists or nazis, but solely left-wing radicals.[2] At its height it had about 2,000 members.[3]
