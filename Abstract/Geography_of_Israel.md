The GEOGRAPHY OF ISRAEL is very diverse, with desert conditions in the south, and snow-capped mountains in the north. Israel is located at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea in Western Asia.[1] It is bounded to the north by Lebanon, the northeast by Syria, the east by Jordan and the West Bank, and to the southwest by Egypt.[2] To the west of Israel is the Mediterranean Sea, which makes up the majority of Israel's coastline,[3] and the Gaza Strip. Israel has a small coastline on the Red Sea in the south.
