DR JULIE GUYOT-DIANGONE is an adjunct faculty member and professorial lecturer at the American University's School of International Service, and an Assistant Professor at the Howard University School of Social Work, in Washington, D.C., USA. Her research explores the role of social identity in supporting the reintegration of young people into mainstream society post-trauma, such as child refugees and the child soldiers of Sierra Leone.[1] Her field of practice is Displaced Populations, which is frequently associated with Immigrants and Refugees. Dr. Guyot-Diangone extends this definition to include all who live along society's margin, including sex workers, street children, and single mothers managing without supports. She recently presented on Resilience as part of a three-person panel at the annual Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) conference, using Freedom Summer to illustrate how the meaning one places on traumatic experiences inform care for the elderly. She is the daughter of the American Civil Rights Leader Lawrence Guyot.[2]
