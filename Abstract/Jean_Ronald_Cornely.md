Jean_Ronald_Cornely.jpg Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, JEAN RONALD CORNELY grew up at the corner of Capois and Audain (now Avenue Jean Paul II) streets with his four brothers and two sisters. He learned the value of hard work at a young age and applied this perseverance and team spirit to the many sporting activities he was involved in, including athletics such as volleyball and football. He completed his classical studies at the Petit Séminaire Collège Saint-Martial and the Georges Marc Institute, where he was among the best in his class. His academic excellence, combined with his leadership capabilities, enabled him to easily enter the Faculty of Medicine and Port-au-Prince Pharmacy where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine.
