CORNISH (__) is a revived language that became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century.[1][2] It is a member of the Brittonic Southwestern branch of the Celtic languages of the Indo-European language family, that was native to Cornwall in south-west England. A revival began in the early 20th century. Some have expressed the opinion that the language is an important part of Cornish identity, culture and heritage.[3][4] Cornish is currently a recognised minority language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[5] It has a growing number of second language speakers.[6] A few parents are inspired to create new first language speakers, by teaching their children the language from birth.[7][8][9][10]
