The ADELAIDE REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEER RIFLES was formed in 1860 after the formation of a number of volunteer rifle companies in 1859. These companies were raised for the same reasons and in the same fashion as the Volunteer Force in Great Britain, but with a South Australian twist. The initial Act upon which formation of the Regiment was based was Act No. 2 of 1854, entitled "An Act to organize and establish a Volunteer Military Force in South Australia".
