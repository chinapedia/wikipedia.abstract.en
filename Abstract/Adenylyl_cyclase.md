ADENYLYL CYCLASE (, also commonly known as ADENYL CYCLASE and ADENYLATE CYCLASE, abbreviated AC) is an enzyme with key regulatory roles in essentially all cells.[1] It is the most polyphyletic known enzyme: six distinct classes have been described, all catalyzing the same reaction but representing unrelated gene families with no known sequence or structural homology.[2] The best known class of adenylyl cyclases is class III or AC-III (Roman numerals are used for classes). AC-III occurs widely in eukaryotes and has important roles in many human tissues.[3]
