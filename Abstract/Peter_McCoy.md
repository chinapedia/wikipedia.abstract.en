PETER F. MCCOY (born 1888 - died 1958) was an American attorney based in New York City.[1] Practicing law in New York at 342 Madison Avenue, McCoy started his legal career with Eaton, Lewis & Rowe before becoming an assistant United States Attorney in 1921. As an assistant United States Attorney General, McCoy was successful at prosecuting high-profile brokers for mail fraud and bucket shops in the early 1920s, with the _New York Times_ proclaiming him a "foe of stock frauds." He also prosecuted people for violating the Food and Drug Acts, selling narcotics, and counterfeiting.[2]
