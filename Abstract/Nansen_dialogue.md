NANSEN DIALOGUE is the name of a project initially created at the Nansen Academy in Lillehammer in 1995, as a counter-reaction to the fact that when Lillehammer was hosting the 1994 Winter Olympics there was a war in process in the former Winter Olympics City of Sarajevo. The former head master of the Nansen Academy, Inge Eidsv√•g, visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994, and this visit triggered the idea of the Nansen Dialogue Project.
