The CARAT (CT) (not to be confused with the unit of purity of gold alloys), is a unit of mass equal to 200Â mg (0.2 g; 0.007055 oz) and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls.[1] The current definition, sometimes known as the METRIC CARAT, was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures,[2] and soon afterwards in many countries around the world. The carat is divisible into one hundred _points_ of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.
