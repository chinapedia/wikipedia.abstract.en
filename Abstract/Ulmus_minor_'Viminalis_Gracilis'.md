The FIELD ELM cultivar _ULMUS MINOR_ 'VIMINALIS GRACILIS' [:'slender'] is a form of _U. minor_ 'Viminalis'. Cultivars listed as _Ulmus gracilis_ Hort. by Kirchner (1864),[1] and as _U. scabra viminalis gracilis_ Hort. by Dieck (1885),[2] were considered by Green to be forms of Melville's _U._ Ã— _viminalis_.[3] A 1929 herbarium specimen held at the Hortus Botanicus Leiden is labelled _U. campestris_ var. _viminalis_ f. _gracilis_, implying a cultivar that differed from the 'type' tree.[4]
