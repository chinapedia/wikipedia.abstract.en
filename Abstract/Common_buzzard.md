The COMMON BUZZARD (_Buteo buteo_) is a medium-to-large bird of prey which has a large range. A member of the genus _Buteo_, it is a member of the family Accipitridae. The species lives in most of Europe and extends its range into Asia, mainly western Russia.[1] Over much of its range, it is a year-round resident. However, buzzards from the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere as well as those that breed in the eastern part of their range typically migrate south for the northern winter, many culminating their journey as far as South Africa.[2] The common buzzard is an opportunistic predator that can take a wide variety of prey, but it feeds mostly on small mammals, especially rodents such as voles. It typically hunts from a perch.[3] Like most accipitrid birds of prey, it builds a nest, typically in trees in this species, and is a devoted parent to a relatively small brood of young.[4] The common buzzard appears to be the most common diurnal raptor in Europe, as estimates of its total global population run well into the millions.[5][6]
