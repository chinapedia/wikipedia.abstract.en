The CROSSED HANDS gesture is a hand signal that denotes Albania in International Sign.[1] Known as DUART E KRYQÃ‹ZUARA (crossed hands) in Albanian, it is sometimes referred to as the "eagle gesture" and is a symbol used by ethnic Albanians in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and other regions of the world where Albanians live. It is meant to visually illustrate the double-headed eagle, the main image on the Albanian flag.[2] The symbolism of the double-headed eagle among Albanians encapsulates their ethnicity and flag, viewing it as a symbol that represents ethnic-Albanian people across the globe.[3]
