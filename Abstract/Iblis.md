After he refused, he was cast out of heaven. For many classical scholars, he was an angel,[2][3][4] but regarded as a jinn in most contemporary scholarship.[5] Due to his fall from God's grace, he is often compared to Satan in Christian traditions. In Islamic tradition, Iblis is often identified with _Al-Shaitan_ ("the Devil"). However, while _Shaitan_ is used exclusively for an evil force, Iblis himself holds a more ambivalent role in Islamic traditions.[6]
