ENVIRONMENTAL SKEPTICISM is the belief that claims by environmentalists, and the environmental scientists who support them, are false or exaggerated.[1] The term is also applied to those who are critical of environmentalism in general. It can additionally be defined as doubt about the authenticity or severity of environmental degradation. Environmental skepticism is closely linked with anti-environmentalism and climate change denial.
