GENE SCOTT KEYES (born October 24, 1941) is a former Assistant Professor of World Politics, a sometime peace activist, noted cartographer, and promoter of the international second language Esperanto. He achieved considerable attention for his peace activism when his mother, Charlotte E. Keyes wrote an article for McCall's, _Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came_ (October 1966). The title phrase, based on a quote from a Carl Sandburg poem, became part of the anti-Vietnam-War lexicon.[1][2] The slogan also went on to become the basis of the film Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came. His cartography work has won two awards.
