PAUL WILLIAMS "TOMMY" THOMPSON (19 December 1906 in Alliance, Nebraska â€“ 9 February 1996 in Daytona Beach, Florida) was an American Colonel in the United States Army during World War II. He also was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross which was awarded for having distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy in circumstances which do not justify the award of the Medal of Honor.
