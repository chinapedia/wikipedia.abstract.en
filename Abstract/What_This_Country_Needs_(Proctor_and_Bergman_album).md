_WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS_ is the second comedy album by the duo Proctor and Bergman of the Firesign Theatre. It was originally released in September 1975 on Columbia Records, and was among the Firesign Theatre's last Columbia albums, along with _In the Next World, You're on Your Own_ and _Forward Into The Past_. It was recorded from a live performance at The Bottom Line which contained material adapted or re-used from their 1973 studio album _TV or Not TV_, plus a few new sketches.
