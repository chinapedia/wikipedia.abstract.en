GOOSE ISLAND is a small, uninhabited rocky island (technically an islet) off of the coast of Connecticut, in Long Island Sound. It belongs to the town of Guilford. It is near Falkner Island, North Rocks, Falkner Island Reef, Stony Island, and Three Quarters Rock. Goose Island has eroded to the point that it is 0.5 acre and virtually underwater at high tide, although it was once about 4 acres in size.[1] The strait between the two islands is between 16 and 8 feet deep.[2][3] The coastline is defined prominently by two small bays that connect during high tide.
