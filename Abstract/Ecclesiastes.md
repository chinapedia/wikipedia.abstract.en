'''Ecclesiastes ''' (; , _qōheleṯ_, Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής, _Ekklēsiastēs_) is one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, where it is classified as one of the _Ketuvim_ (or "Writings"). Originally written c. 450–200 BCE, it is also among the canonical Wisdom Books in the Old Testament of most denominations of Christianity. The title _Ecclesiastes_ is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew KOHELET, the pseudonym used by the author of the book.
