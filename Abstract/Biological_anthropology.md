BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, also known as PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, is a scientific discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings, their extinct hominin ancestors, and related non-human primates, particularly from an evolutionary perspective.[1] It is a subfield of anthropology that provides a biological perspective to the systematic study of human beings.
