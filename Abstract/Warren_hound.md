WARREN HOUND refers to the group of Mediterranean rabbit-hunting dogs. In Spanish, this kind of breeds are called _podencos_ and in Portuguese, _podengos_. Generally speaking, a warren hound has erect ears, a smooth (or in some cases, wire) coat, a slender body, and a whip-like tail. However, there are some exceptions: for instance, the Cretan Hound has usually rose-ears and a curly or curved tail, while the Barrocal Algarvio is long-haired, and the Podenco Paternero and some Campaneros have a robust, almost Mastiff-like body. Unlike hounds or sighthounds which rely on just one sense, warren hounds tend to work with three senses: smell, sight and hearing.
