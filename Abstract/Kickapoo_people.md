The KICKAPOO PEOPLE (Kickapoo: _KIIKAAPOA_ or _KIIKAAPOI_) are an Algonquian-speaking Native American and Indigenous Mexican tribe. _Anishinaabeg_ say the name "Kickapoo" (_Giiwigaabaw_ in the Anishinaabe language and its Kickapoo cognate _Kiwikapawa_) means "Stands here and there," which may have referred to the tribe's migratory patterns. The name can also mean "wanderer". This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a folk etymology.
