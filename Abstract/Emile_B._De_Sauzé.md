ÉMILE BIALS DE SAUZÉ (Tours, December 7, 1878 – July 10, 1964) was a French born naturalized-American language educator who developed the Cleveland Plan for teaching foreign languages. He is credited with originating the conversational method where students hear a teacher speak a word, then write it, then speak it. This method replaced the older method of simply memorizing words and grammar.[1]
