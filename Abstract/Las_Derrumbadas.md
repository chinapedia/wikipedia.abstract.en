LAS DERRUMBADAS (from Spanish, meaning 'the collapsed ones' or 'the ones that suffered a stonefall') is a rhyolitic twin dome volcano[1] in the Mexican state of Puebla. Often overlooked for its proximity to some of the country's most famous mountains —including Cofre de Perote, Sierra Negra and colossal Pico de Orizaba— its two summits are nevertheless within the top 30 of the country's highest mountain peaks.
