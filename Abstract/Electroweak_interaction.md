In particle physics, the ELECTROWEAK INTERACTION is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction. Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force. Above the unification energy, on the order of 246 GeV ,[1] they would merge into a single ELECTROWEAK FORCE. Thus, if the universe is hot enough (approximately 10¹⁵ K, a temperature not exceeded since shortly after the Big Bang), then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force. During the quark epoch, the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force.
