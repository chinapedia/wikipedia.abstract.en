OLD PAHANG KINGDOM (Malay: _Kerajaan Pahang Tua_[1]) was a historical polity centred in the Pahang region in the east coast of Malay Peninsula. The polity appeared in foreign records from as early as the 5th century[2] and at its height, covered much of modern state of Pahang and the entire southerly part of the peninsula.[3] Throughout its pre-Melakan history, Pahang was established as a mueang[4] or naksat[5] of some major regional Malayic mandalas including Langkasuka,[6] Srivijaya[7] and Ligor.[8] Around the middle of the 15th century, it was brought into the orbit of Melaka Sultanate and subsequently established as a vassal Muslim Sultanate in 1470, following the coronation of the grandson of the former Maharaja as the first Sultan of Pahang.[9]
