A CENTAUR (; , _k√©ntauros_, ), or occasionally HIPPOCENTAUR, is a mythological creature from Greek mythology with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse.[1][2] Centaurs are thought of in many Greek myths as being as wild as untamed horses, and were said to have inhabited the region of Magnesia and Mount Pelion in Thessaly, the Foloi oak forest in Elis, and the Malean peninsula in southern Laconia. Centaurs are subsequently featured in Roman mythology, and were familiar figures in the medieval bestiary. They remain a staple of modern fantastic literature.
