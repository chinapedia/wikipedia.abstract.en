_JUST ONCE_ is an extended play by American singer-songwriter Tom Krell, known by his stage name as How to Dress Well. It was released on July 12, 2011, by the label Yours Truly, and is dedicated to Krell's friend Ryan Douglas Hitchon, who died in August 2010. The extended play consists of three string quartet-driven chamber renditions of songs from How to Dress Well's debut album _Love Remains_ (2010), as well as another track, "Suicide Dream 3". _Just Once_ was written by Krell, and recorded and mixed by Nic Atamaniuk. It garnered generally positive reviews from music journalists upon its July 2011 distribution, some of the major praises and criticisms going towards its departure from the reverb-and-distortion-heavy sound of _Love Remains_ for a cleaner sound.
