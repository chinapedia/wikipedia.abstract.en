The 2001 REBELLION OF THE MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT MISUARI FACTION against the Philippine government during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was led by Nur Misuari, the founder of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). It began on 19 November 2001 when members of a faction of the MNLF loyal to Misuari attacked a Philippine Army headquarters in Jolo, Sulu in the Philippines. The attack was meant to disrupt the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao elections scheduled for 26 November of that year, which eventually replaced Misuari as governor.[1]
