ANDREW FEKETE (Hungarian: [ˈfɛkɛtɛ]; 1 May 1954 – 31 March 1986) was a British-Hungarian artist, diarist, and poet. Although initially trained as an architect, he produced over 100 works of art, influenced by movements as diverse as Cubism, Abstract Expressionism and Symbolism.[1] A practising Jungian alchemist, Fekete believed his art was a form of self-therapy for the mental illness with which he struggled his entire life. Alongside his visual art, Fekete kept extensive illustrated diaries which included numerous poems, essays and novellas, dealing with subjects ranging from art history and mythology to theosophy and mysticism.
