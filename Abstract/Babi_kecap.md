_BABI KECAP_ is an Indonesian braised pork with sweet soy sauce (_kecap manis_).[1][2] It is one of Chinese Indonesian classics, due to its simplicity which lend to its popularity among Chinese Indonesians households, and also popular among non-Muslim Indonesians, such as Balinese, Batak and Minahasan. It is also popular in the Netherlands as _BABI KETJAP_, owing to shared colonial ties with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the dish might also be served within an opulent _rijsttafel_ banquet.[3]
