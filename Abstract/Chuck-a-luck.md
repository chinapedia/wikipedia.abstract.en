111-SC-32513_-_NARA_-_55224182-cropped.jpg CHUCK-A-LUCK, also known as BIRDCAGE, is a game of chance played with three dice. It is derived from grand hazard and both can be considered a variant of sic bo, which is a popular casino game, although chuck-a-luck is more of a carnival game than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for charity.
