PRINCE is a block cipher targeting low latency, unrolled hardware implementations. It is based on the so-called FX construction.[1] Its most notable feature is the "alpha reflection": the decryption is the encryption with a related key which is very cheap to compute. Unlike most other "lightweight" ciphers, it has a small number of rounds and the layers constituting a round have low logic depth. As a result, fully unrolled implementation are able to reach much higher frequencies than AES or PRESENT. According to the authors, for the same time constraints and technologies, PRINCE uses 6-7 times less area than PRESENT-80 and 14-15 times less area than AES-128.[2]
