The ROOM-TEMPERATURE DENSIFICATION METHOD was developed for Li₂MoO₄ ceramics and is based on the water-solubility of Li₂MoO₄. It can be used for the fabrication of Li₂MoO₄ ceramics instead of conventional thermal sintering. The method utilizes a small amount of aqueous phase formed by moistening the Li₂MoO₄ powder. The densification occurs during sample pressing as the solution incorporates the pores between the powder particles and recrystallizes. The contact points of the particles provide a high pressure zone, where solubility is increased, whereas the pores act as a suitable place for the precipitation of the solution. Any residual water is removed by post-processing typically at 120 °C. The method is suitable also for Li₂MoO₄ composite ceramics with up to 30 volume-% of filler material, enabling the optimization of the dielectric properties.[1]
