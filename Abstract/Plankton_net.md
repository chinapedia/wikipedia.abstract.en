The_upper_part_of_plankton_net.jpg A PLANKTON NET is equipment used for collecting samples of plankton in standing bodies of water. It consists of a towing line and bridles, nylon mesh net, and a cod end. Plankton nets are considered one of the oldest, simplest and inexpensive methods of sampling plankton .[1] The plankton net can be used for both vertical and horizontal sampling.[2] It allows researchers to analyse plankton both quantitatively (cell density, cell colony or biomass) and qualitatively (e.g. Chlorophyll-a as a primary production of phytoplankton) in water samples from the environment.
