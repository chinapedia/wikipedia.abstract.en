MONITEAU CREEK is a stream in Cooper, Moniteau and Cole counties in central Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of the Missouri River. The stream headwaters are in western Moniteau County just west of Tipton. The stream flows north into Cooper County then turns east and flows through the southeastern part of the county and re-enters Moniteau County. The stream continues meandering east passing under Missouri Route 87 south of Jamestown and enters the Missouri River floodplain in the Marion Bottoms Conservation Area between Sandy Hook to the north and Marion to the south. The confluence with the Missouri River floodplain lies in the northern tip of Cole County.[2]
