The PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light hits a material. Electrons emitted in this manner can be called _photoelectrons_. This phenomenon is commonly studied in electronic physics, as well as in fields of chemistry, such as quantum chemistry and electrochemistry. During the years 1886-1902, Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of photoelectric emission in detail. Hallwachs connected a zinc plate to an electroscope. He allowed ultraviolet light to fall on zinc plate and observed that the zinc plate became uncharged if initially negatively charged, positively charged if initially uncharged, and more positively charged if initially positively charged. From these observations he concluded that some negatively charged particles were emitted by the zinc plate when exposed to ultraviolet light. A few years later, Lenard observed that when ultraviolet radiations are allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing two electrodes, a current flows in the circuit. As soon as ultraviolet radiations are stopped, the current also stops. This initiated the concept of photoelectric emission.
