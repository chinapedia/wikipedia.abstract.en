The TECHNOLOGY IN _STAR TREK_ has borrowed freely from the scientific world to provide storylines. Episodes are replete with references to tachyon beams, baryon sweeps, quantum fluctuations and event horizons. Many of the technologies created for the _Star Trek_ universe were done so out of simple financial necessityâ€”the transporter was created because the limited budget of the original series in the 1960s did not allow expensive shots of spaceships landing on planets.[1]
