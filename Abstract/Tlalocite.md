TLALOCITE is a rare and complex tellurate mineral with the formula Cu₁₀Zn₆(TeO₄)₂(TeO₃)(OH)₂₅Cl · 27 H₂O. It has a Mohs hardness of 1, and a cyan color. It was named after Tlaloc, the Aztec god of rain, in allusion to the high amount of water contained within the crystal structure.[1][2] It is not to be confused with quetzalcoatlite, which often looks similar in color and habit.
