Holstein_friesian_or_friesian_cow.jpgPOLLED HOLSTEINS are cattle born without horns but only occur in a small portion of Holstein cattle. The Holstein breed can go through selective breeding to produce polled calves. Polled is a natural trait for Holsteins but have not been bred for specifically. That is why a very small percentage of Holsteins are naturally polled.[1] Bulls and cows can both carry the polled trait and pass it on to the progeny.[2] Previous testing for polledness were not completely accurate because it was not looking for the gene directly until later discovered.[3] Polled, also known as ‘hornless’ can result in the growth of scurs which are small loose horn growths that do not develop.[4]
