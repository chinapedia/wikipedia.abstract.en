It was first planted in 1928 by Associate Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, and replaced several times in the 1930s. Blooming in late spring at the end of the academic year, it became closely associated with examination time at the university. It has formed the background to many events, and the original tree was on the City of Sydney's Significant Tree Register. On 28 October 2016, the old tree died after 88 years and fell over. On 20 July 2017, the University announced the replacement of the jacaranda with a genetically identical clone, and a native Illawarra flame tree in the opposite corner[1].
