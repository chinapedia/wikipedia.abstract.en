ARIANISM is a nontrinitarian[1] Christological doctrine[2][3][4] which asserts the belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was begotten by God the Father at a point in time,[5] a creature distinct from the Father and is therefore subordinate to him, but the Son is also God (i.e. God the Son).[6][7] Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius[8][9] (c. AD 256–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria of Egypt. The term "Arian" is derived from the name Arius; and like "Christian", it was not a self-chosen designation but bestowed by hostile opponents—and never accepted by those on whom it had been imposed.[10] The nature of Arius's teaching and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by Homoousian Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is based on the belief that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten within time by God the Father.[11][12]
