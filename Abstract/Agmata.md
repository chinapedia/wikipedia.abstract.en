AGMATA is a proposed extinct phylum of animals with a calcareous conical shell, previously thought to be cephalopods or annelid worms. The phylum's name comes from the Greek word for "fragments", referring to the fine fragments and grains that partially fill these shells.[1] It was proposed by Ellis L. Yochelson in 1977 to house the agglutinating Early Cambrian fossils _Salterella_ and _Volborthella_, with the Middle Cambrian _Ellisell yochelsoni_ later included.[2]
