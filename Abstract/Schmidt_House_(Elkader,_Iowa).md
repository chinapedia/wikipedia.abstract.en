The SCHMIDT HOUSE, also known as the BANDOW APARTMENTS, is a historic building located in Elkader, Iowa, United States. The two-story brick structure was built in 1867 by Wolfgang and John Blasius Schmidt, who were immigrants from Bavaria.[1] They built their brewery next to the house, no longer extant, and it remained in operation until 1884 when prohibition passed in Iowa. The duplex is a vernacular form of the Federal style. At one time it had a common kitchen and dining room, with a summer kitchen, no longer extant, in the rear. The building was converted into apartments in the late 19th- or early 20th-century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[2]
