The SCOTTISH DEERHOUND, or simply the DEERHOUND, is a large breed of hound (a sighthound), once bred to hunt the Red Deer by coursing. In outward appearance, the Scottish Deerhound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned with a rough-coat. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish Wolfhound and was a contributor to that breed when it was created at the end of the 19th century.
