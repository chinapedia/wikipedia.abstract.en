Wanstead_United_Reformed_Church_-_August_2018.jpg WANSTEAD UNITED REFORMED CHURCH is a United Reformed Church place of worship in Wanstead, east London. It originated in 1867 as a Congregational church in Wanstead, housed in the former Church of England building of ST LUKE'S CHURCH, EUSTON ROAD, which was completed in 1861 by John Johnson and soon afterwards demolished for the building of the original St Pancras Station and re-erected piece by piece in Wanstead).[1] (The Anglican church's dedication transferred to the new Anglican church of St Luke's Church, Oseney Crescent.)
