MULTISCALE GREEN'S FUNCTION (MSGF) is a generalized and extended version of the classical Green's function (GF) technique[1] for solving mathematical equations. The main application of the MSGF technique is in modeling of nanomaterials.[2] These materials are very small â€“ of the size of few nanometers. Mathematical modeling of nanomaterials requires special techniques and is now recognized to be an independent branch of science.[3] A mathematical model is needed to calculate the displacements of atoms in a crystal in response to an applied static or time dependent force in order to study the mechanical and physical properties of nanomaterials. One specific requirement of a model for nanomaterials is that the model needs to be multiscale and provide seamless linking of different length scales.[4]
