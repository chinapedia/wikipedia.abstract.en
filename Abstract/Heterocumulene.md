A HETEROCUMULENE is a molecule or ion containing a chain of at least three double bonds between consecutive atoms, in which one or more atoms in the doubly bonded chain is a heteroatom. Such species are analogous to a cumulene in which the chain of doubly bonded atoms contains only carbon, except that at least one carbon is replaced by a heteroatom.[1] Some authors relax the definition to include species with chains of only two double bonds between consecutive atoms,[2] also known as _heteroallenes_.
