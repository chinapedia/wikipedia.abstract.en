A HISTOGRAM is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (CORAL ) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1] It differs from a bar graph, in the sense that a bar graph relates two variables, but a histogram relates only one. To construct a histogram, the first step is to "bin" (or "bucket") the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are often (but are not required to be) of equal size.[2]
