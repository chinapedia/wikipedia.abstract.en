_EMOIA IMPAR_, also known as the DARK-BELLIED COPPER-STRIPED SKINK, or the AZURE-TAILED SKINK (not to be mistaken with _Emoia cyanura_, also known as the azure-tailed skink), is a species of skink that is widespread in the Pacific, especially Polynesia and Micronesia. While common throughout its range, it is threatened by habitat loss, invasive species, and sea level rise due to global warming.[1] It was also formerly a naturalized species in the Hawaiian Islands, most likely introduced by the Polynesians, but is now locally extinct there, possibly as a result of the invasive big-headed ant.[2]
