PROCLUS LYCAEUS (; 8 February 412 – 17 April 485 AD), called THE SUCCESSOR (Greek , _Próklos ho Diádokhos_), was a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher, one of the last major classical philosophers (see Damascius). He set forth one of the most elaborate and fully developed systems of Neoplatonism. He stands near the end of the classical development of philosophy, and was very influential on Western medieval philosophy (Greek and Latin).[1]
