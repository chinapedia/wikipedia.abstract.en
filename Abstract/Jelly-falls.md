Pyrosoma_atlanticum.JPG JELLY-FALLS are marine carbon cycling events whereby gelatinous zooplankton sink to the seafloor and enhance carbon and nitrogen fluxes via rapidly sinking particulate organic matter.[1] These events provide nutrition to benthic megafauna and bacteria.[2][3] Jelly-falls have been implicated as a major “gelatinous pathway” for the sequestration of labile biogenic carbon through the biological pump.[4]
