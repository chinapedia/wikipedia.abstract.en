São_Paulo_Zoo_2018_046.jpg CACARECO (1954-1962) was a female black rhinoceros exhibited in Brazilian zoos. She is known for receiving many votes in the 1958 São Paulo city council elections as a form of protest vote. Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but she eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism).[1] The term "voto Cacareco" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.[2]
