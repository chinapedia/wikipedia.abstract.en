, also known as in the _Kojiki_, and or in the _Nihon Shoki_ was the tenth Emperor of Japan.[1][2] While Sujin is the first emperor that historians state might have actually existed, he is still referred to as a "legendary emperor" due to a lack of information available. Both the _Kojiki_, and the _Nihon Shoki_ (collectively known as the _Kiki_) record events that took place during Sujin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he set up a new shrine outside of the Imperial palace to enshrine Amaterasu. He is also credited with initiating the worship of Ōmononushi (equated with the deity of Mount Miwa), and expanding his empire by sending generals to four regions of Japan in what became known as the legend of _Shidō shogun_.
