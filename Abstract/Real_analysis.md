Fourier series are an important tool in real analysis.]] In mathematics, REAL ANALYSIS is the branch of mathematical analysis that studies the behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real-valued functions.[1] Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability.
