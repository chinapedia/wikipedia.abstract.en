The Republic of Kazakhstan is a successor state of the former Soviet Union. According to the IMF, Kazakhstan maintains a good balance of payments ratio and looks relatively stable economically[1]. Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF has the obligation to "exercise surveillance" over its policy members. This means that they look after the economic, financial, and exchange rate policies of its members, including Kazakhstan and meet approximately once a year[2] with Kazakh government and national bank officials.
