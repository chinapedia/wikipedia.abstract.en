STEPHEN PORT (born 22 February 1975)[1][2] is a British convicted serial rapist and serial killer. He is responsible for murdering at least four men and for committing multiple rapes. Port received a life sentence with a whole life order on 25 November 2016, meaning he will not become eligible for parole and is unlikely to ever be released from prison.[3] Police announced they are now investigating at least 58 deaths connected to the use of _gamma_-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in response to the Port case.[4]
