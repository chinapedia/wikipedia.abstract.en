An ELECTRIC CURRENT is the rate of flow of electric charge past a point[1][2] or region.[3] An electric current is said to exist when there is a net flow of electric charge through a region.[4] In electric circuits this charge is often carried by electrons moving through a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionized gas (plasma).[5]
