A CATHODE is the electrode from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device. This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic _CCD_ for _Cathode Current Departs_. A conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic _cathode current departs_ also means that electrons flow _into_ the device's cathode from the external circuit.
