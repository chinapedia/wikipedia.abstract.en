Velaslavasay_Panorama_Marquee.jpg The VELASLAVASAY PANORAMA is an exhibition hall, theatre and gardens in Los Angeles, California, featuring the only painted, 360-degree panorama created in the United States since the nineteenth century.[1][2] The Velaslavasay Panorama was originally established by artist Sara Velas in 2000 at the Tswuun-Tswuun Rotunda on Hollywood Boulevard. The museum's name combines Velasâ€™ last name with her mother's maiden name, Asay.[3] In 2004, its original venue threatened with demolition, the panorama moved to its present location at the Union Theatre in Historical West Adams.[4]
