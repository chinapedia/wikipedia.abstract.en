The JERICHO CENTER HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses much of the central village of Jericho, Vermont. Centered on the town green at the meeting point of Brown's Trace, Varney Road, and Bolger Hill Road, the center (not to be confused with the incorporated village of Jericho) is a well-preserved Vermont country village developed mainly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]
