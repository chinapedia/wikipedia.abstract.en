LA TALLERA used to be David Alfaro Siqueiros' workshop, and in recent years it has become one of the most important art spaces in Mexico.[1] Â It is located in the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos. In the artist's own words: "the space was born of an idea that Diego Rivera and I had since 1920, that is, the creation of a real workshop for Mural Painting; here the different techniques, materials, paintings, perspectives and geometric aspects will be rehearsed".[2]
