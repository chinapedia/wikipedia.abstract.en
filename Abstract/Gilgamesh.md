GILGAMESH was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, a major hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology, and the protagonist of the _Epic of Gilgamesh_, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late second millennium BC. He likely ruled between 2800 and 2500 BC and was posthumously deified. He became a major figure in Sumerian legends during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 â€“ 2004 BC). Tales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems. The earliest of these is probably _Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld_, in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess Inanna and drives away the creatures infesting her _huluppu_ tree. She gives him two unknown objects called a _mikku_ and a _pikku_, which he loses. After Enkidu's death, his shade tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the Underworld. The poem _Gilgamesh and Agga_ describes Gilgamesh's revolt against his overlord King Agga. Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh's defeat of the ogre Huwawa and the Bull of Heaven and a fifth, poorly preserved one apparently describes his death and funeral.
