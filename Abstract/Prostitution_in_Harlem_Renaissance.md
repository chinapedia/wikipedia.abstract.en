Young black women of the HARLEM RENAISSANCE lived with uncertainty of their rights and their roles in so. A time in which women began to question their sexuality in fear of facing the scrutiny. The women of Harlem women began questioning their equal rights and freedom of sexual expression. One occupation that flourished among many of them was prostitution. In the early 1900s the city of New York thrived with prostitution. Amidst the artistic spectrum of the Harlem Renaissance, the occupation of prostitution created and underlying tension for African American women and their right to solicit their bodies for profit. Preceding World War One, American ideology of sexuality restrained by religion and denial. Sex was a private matter and was deemed taboo outside of procreation.[1] Idealized notions of the sexual union, however, made non-procreative sex lustful and demeaning. This way of thinking immediately pushes prostitution into the spectrum of being a sinful act and portraying the act in a demeaning manner.
