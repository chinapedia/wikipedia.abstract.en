The_Masonic_Lodge_on_George_Street,_Edinburgh.jpg Villas_by_A_H_Crawford,_Primrose_Bank_Road,_Edinburgh.jpg ALEXANDER HUNTER CRAWFORD (1865-1945) was a Scottish architect and businessman. Closely associated with his father's firm of Crawford's Biscuits he designed many biscuit factories, and became owner of the company in 1931. Many of his villas are now listed buildings.[1] His masterpiece (although somewhat "old-fashioned" for its date) is probably the huge Masonic Lodge on George Street in Edinburgh.
