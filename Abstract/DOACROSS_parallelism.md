DOACROSS PARALLELISM is a parallelization technique used to perform Loop-level parallelism by utilizing synchronisation primitives between statements in a loop. This technique is used when a loop cannot be fully parallelized by DOALL parallelism due to data dependencies between loop iterations, typically loop-carried dependencies. The sections of the loop which contain loop-carried dependence are synchronized, while treating each section as a parallel task on its own. Therefore, DOACROSS parallelism can be used to complement DOALL parallelism to reduce loop execution times.
