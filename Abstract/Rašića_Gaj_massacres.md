The RAŠIĆA GAJ MASSACRES were massacres of Serbs committed by the Muslim Ustaše forces at the beginning of the World War II in Rašića Gaj, Vlasenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina (contemporary Independent State of Croatia) in June and July 1941. The estimations of the number of Serbs killed in Rašića Gaj vary between at least 70 and 200. It was one of the most shocking early World War II war crimes for Serbs in Eastern Bosnia and the testimonies about the cruel slaughter of Serbs in Rašića Gaj spread among the population of the region, causing fear and anger among the Serbs.[1]
