In probability theory, the EXPECTED VALUE of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the SAME EXPERIMENT it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided d i e is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up is 3.5 as the number of rolls approaches infinity (see for details). In other words, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the EXPECTATION, MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATION, EV, AVERAGE, MEAN VALUE, MEAN, or FIRST MOMENT.
