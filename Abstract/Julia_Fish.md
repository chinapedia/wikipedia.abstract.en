JULIA FISH (born 1950) is an American artist whose paintings have a deceptive simplicity.[1] She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size.[2] By means of close observation of everyday subjects—leaves of a tree seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture— she makes, as one critic says, "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities."[3] She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, is not so much temporal as durational. Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, "a parallel system to a lived experience."[4] The paintings lack spatial orientation and, as a critic says, can "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term."[5][6] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the _Chicago Tribune_, said "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character."[7]
