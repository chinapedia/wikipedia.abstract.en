JACK HILLMER (1918â€“2007) was an American architect based in San Francisco, California. An exponent of what Lewis Mumford called the "Bay Region style,"[1] Hillmer is known for his meticulously hand-crafted modernist homes built from redwood. Jack Hillmer's most notable projects include the Ludekens house on Belvedere island, the Munger house in Napa, and the Cagliostro house in Berkeley. Architectural writer Alan Hess called Jack Hillmer "one of the most original architects produced by California."[2]
