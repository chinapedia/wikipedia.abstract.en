THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, commonly referred to as OHIO STATE or OSU, is a large public research university in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and the ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862,[1] the university was originally known as the OHIO AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE (MECH). The college began with a focus on training students in various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but it developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then-Governor (later, President) Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to "THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY".[2] It has since grown into the third-largest university campus in the United States.[3] Along with its main campus in Columbus, Ohio State also operates regional campuses in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, Newark, and Wooster.
