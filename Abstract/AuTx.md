AUTX is a terpolyaramide fibre that was developed during 2005 to 2012 by Alchemie Group. It is based on Russian aramid fibres. AuTx-FR is a fire resistant fibre with high thermal stability and high LOI and strength at elevated temperatures, with minimal thermal degradation. The process of forming AuTx-FR fibres allows the LOI to be varied between 40-70 with a trade-off for lesser strength the higher the LOI number is.
