In mathematics and computer science, CURRYING is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from _X_ and one from _Y_, and produces outputs in _Z,_ by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from _X_ and produces as outputs _functions_ from _Y_ to _Z._ Currying is related to, but not the same as, partial application.
