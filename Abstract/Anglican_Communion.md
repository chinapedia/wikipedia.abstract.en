The ANGLICAN COMMUNION is the third largest Christian communion. Founded in 1867 in London, England, the communion currently has 85 million members[1] within the Church of England and other national and regional churches in full communion.[2] The traditional origins of Anglican doctrines are summarised in the Thirty-nine Articles (1571). The Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) in England acts as a focus of unity, recognised as _primus inter pares_ ("first among equals"), but does not exercise authority in Anglican provinces outside of the Church of England.
