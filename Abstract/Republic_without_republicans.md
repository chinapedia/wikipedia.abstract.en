Simplicissimus_Republik.jpg'' cartoon commonly associated with the concept of a 'republic without republicans'.]] The term REPUBLIC WITHOUT REPUBLICANS refers to a situation in which a state is a republic, yet there is little or no supporting republicanism to be found amongst the population and/or the political elite. In such a situation, most people would actually prefer to found a new monarchy or restore an abolished dynasty, or – in a broader sense – oppose democracy.
