BabyPoster2.jpg'' (1938) is a screwball comedy from the genre's classic period.]] Clip_from_My_Man_Godfrey.ogg'']] SCREWBALL COMEDY is a subgenre of the romantic comedy genre that became popular during the Great Depression, originating in the early 1930s and thriving until the early 1940s. It is widely known for satirizing the traditional love story. Many secondary characteristics of this genre are similar to film noir, but it distinguishes itself for being characterized by a female that dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged.[1] The two engage in a humorous battle of the sexes, which was a new theme for Hollywood and audiences at the time.[2] What sets the screwball comedy apart from the generic romantic comedy is that "screwball comedy puts its emphasis on a funny spoofing of love, while the more traditional romantic ultimately accents love."[3] Other elements of the screwball comedy include fast-paced, overlapping repartee, farcical situations, escapist themes, physical battle of the sexes, disguise and masquerade, and plot lines involving courtship and marriage.[4] Screwball comedies often depict social classes in conflict, as in _It Happened One Night_ (1934) and _My Man Godfrey_ (1936).[5] Some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies.
