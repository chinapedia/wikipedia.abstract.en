The_witches_Sabbath,_by_Luis_Ricardo_Falero.jpg In Wicca and Paganism/Neo-paganism, the term _SKYCLAD_ is used to refer to ritual nudity. Some Wiccan groups, or Traditions, perform some or all of their rituals skyclad. Whilst nudity and the practice of witchcraft have long been associated in the visual arts, this contemporary ritual nudity is typically attributed to either the influence of Gerald Gardner or to a passage from _Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches_, and as such is mainly attributed to the Gardnerian and Aradian covens.
