DISTRESS TOLERANCE is an emerging construct in psychology that has been conceptualized in several different ways. Broadly, however, it refers to an individuals' "perceived capacity to withstand negative emotional and/or other aversive states (e.g. physical discomfort), and the behavioral act of withstanding distressing internal states elicited by some type of stressor."[1] Some definitions of distress tolerance have also specified that the endurance of these negative events occur in contexts in which methods to escape the distressor exist.[2]
