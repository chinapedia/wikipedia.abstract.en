Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Imperial_Fritillaries_in_a_Copper_Vase_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg _IMPERIAL FRITILLARIES IN A COPPER VASE_ is an oil painting on canvas created by the post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh in Paris, 1887. The painting is now part of the collection of the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, France. This work was made at a time of the life of Van Gogh when he first encountered influences from Impressionists and became aware of light and color, implementing it in his paintings. This painting presages some of his most famous subsequent works, and stands out from other still lifes because of the implementation of mixed techniques and complementary colors.
