The JOHN N. AND MARY MCQUILKEN HOUSE, also known as the EMELIA J. SCHLEESER HOUSE and the JOAN E. SCHREIBER HOUSE, is a historic building located in La Porte City, Iowa, United States. McQuilken was a meat and poultry merchant, and then an insurance salesman. He and his wife Mary had no children. Built from 1900 to 1901, the house's architect and builder are unknown.[1] It features Colonial Revival influences in its complex gambrel roof system and inset porch. Around 1960 the second floor was converted into an apartment. A renovation in the mid-1980s returned the house as much as possible to its original form. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.[2]
