COHERENT ACCELERATOR PROCESSOR INTERFACE (CAPI), is a high-speed processor expansion bus standard, initially designed to be layered on top of PCI Express, for directly connecting CPUs to external accelerators like GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or fast storage.[1][2] It offers low latency, high speed, direct memory access connectivity between devices of different instruction set architectures.
