_PIERRE DE WIESSANT_ is a bronze sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, part of his sculptural group _The Burghers of Calais_. This sculpture represents one of the six burghers who, according to Jean Froissart[1] surrendered themselves in 1347, at the beginning of the Hundred Years' War (1337â€“1453), in order to save the inhabitants of the French city of Calais from the English laying siege to the city.[2]
