The HALOGENS ([1][2][3]) are a group in the periodic table consisting of five chemically related elements: Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I), and Astatine (At). The artificially created element 117 (Tennessine, Ts) may also be a halogen. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as GROUP 17. The symbol X is often used generically to refer to any halogen.
