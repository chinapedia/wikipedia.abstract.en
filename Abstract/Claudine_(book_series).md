The _CLAUDINE_ series consists of four early novels by the French author Colette, published 1900–1904.[1] Written in diary form, they describe the growth to maturity of a young girl, Claudine. Aged fifteen at the beginning of the first book, _Claudine à l'école_, the series describes her education and experiences as she grows up.[2] All the books are written in first-person with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator. The last in the series, _Claudine s'en va_, introduces a new narrator, Annie.[3]
