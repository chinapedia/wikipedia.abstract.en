ḤUMAYD IBN ḤURAYTH IBN BAḤDAL AL-KALBĪ (fl. 683–693) was a senior Umayyad commander and a chieftain of the Banu Kalb tribe. He was head of the _shurṭa_ (security forces) under caliphs Marwan I and Abd al-Malik, and may have served in the same capacity under their predecessor Caliph Yazid I. He commanded the Kalbi-dominated _shurṭa_ in the Battle of Khazir in 686, and a year later joined the rebellion of the Umayyad prince Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As against Abd al-Malik. After the revolt's failure, Humayd reconciled with the latter. In the years following the battles of Marj Rahit (684) and Khazir, Humayd led the Kalb in numerous tit-for-tat raids and battles with enemy Qaysi tribes, including the Banu 'Amir, Banu Sulaym and Fazara.
