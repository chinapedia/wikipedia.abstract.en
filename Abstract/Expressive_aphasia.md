EXPRESSIVE APHASIA, also known as BROCA'S APHASIA, is a type of aphasia characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual,[1] or written), although comprehension generally remains intact.[2] A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words, but leaves out function words that have only grammatical significance and not real-world meaning, such as prepositions and articles.[3] This is known as "telegraphic speech". The person's intended message may still be understood but his or her sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances.[4][5] Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.[6][7]
