The ISO 22715 STANDARD provides guidelines for manufacturers in the best practices for cosmetic packaging and labelling of all cosmetic products. This standard applies to products that fall under the category of cosmetics that are sold or given away as free samples. ISO 22715 was initially published in April 2006.[1][2]
