Spirale_Ulam_150.jpg of the integers is a central point of study in number theory and can be visualised with this Ulam spiral variant. Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems like this, in spite of their apparent complexity.]] NUMBER THEORY (or ARITHMETIC or HIGHER ARITHMETIC in older usage) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).
