FERDINAND DE SAUSSURE (;[1] ; 26 November 1857 â€“ 22 February 1913) was a Swiss linguist and semiotician. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century.[2][3] He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics[4][5][6][7] and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.[8]
