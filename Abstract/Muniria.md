_MUNIRIA_ is a genus of four species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae and is endemic to the Northern Territory in Australia. Plants in this genus are woolly shrubs with five petals joined to form a tube-shaped flower with four stamens of unequal lengths. These species are similar to those in the genus _Pityrodia_ except that the branches are distinctly 4-angled in cross section and the fruit has calluses or ridges.
