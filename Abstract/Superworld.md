_SUPERWORLD_ is a superhero-themed role-playing game published by Chaosium in 1983. Written by _Basic Role-Playing_ and _RuneQuest_ author Steve Perrin, _Superworld_ began as one third of the _Worlds of Wonder_ product, which also included a generic fantasy setting, "Magic World", and a generic science fiction setting, "Future World", all using the same core _Basic Role-Playing_ rules. Only _Superworld_ became a game in its own right.
