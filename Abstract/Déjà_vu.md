_DÉJÀ VU_ ([1][2] is the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before.[3][4][5][6] The phrase translates literally as "already seen". Although some interpret déjà vu in a paranormal context[7], mainstream scientific approaches reject the explanation of _déjà vu_ as "precognition" or "prophecy". Rather, they explain it as an anomaly of memory, since despite the strong sense of recollection, the time, place, and practical context of the "previous" experience are uncertain or believed to be impossible.[8][9][10] Two types of _déjà vu_ are recognized: the pathological _déjà vu_ usually associated with epilepsy or that which, when unusually prolonged or frequent, or associated with other symptoms such as hallucinations, may be an indicator of neurological or psychiatric illness,[11] and the non-pathological type characteristic of healthy people, about two-thirds of whom have had _déjà vu_ experiences.[12][13][14][15][16]People who travel more or watch more movies are more likely to experience _déjà vu_ than others. [17] Furthermore, people also tend to experience _déjà vu_ more in fragile conditions or under high pressure, and research shows that the experience of _déjà vu_ also decreases with age.[18]
