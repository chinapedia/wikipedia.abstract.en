_ZAMA_ is a 1956 novel by Argentine writer Antonio di Benedetto. Existential in nature, the plot centers around the eponymous Don Diego de Zama, a minor official of the colonial Spanish Empire stationed in remote Paraguay during the late 18th century and his attempts to receive a long-awaited promotion and transfer to Buenos Aires in the face of personal and professional stagnation. Di Benedetto drew heavily from Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky. These existential themes of inward and outward stasis because of circumstance drive the novel's narrative as being constantly in motion yet never changing. Together with two of his other novels, _El silenciero_ (1964) and _Los suicidas_ (1969), _Zama_ has been published as part of Benedetto's informal _La trilog√≠a de la espera_ (The Trilogy of Expectation). The novel is considered by various critics to be a major work of Argentine literature.
