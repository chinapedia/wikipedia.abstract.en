VICTOR DESPEIGNES (14 February 1866 – 30 July 1937 )[1][2] was a pioneer in radiation oncology. He was possibly the first person to use X-rays to treat cancer, which he did in July 1896 for a patient with stomach cancer.[3][4] He was also the first physician to publish a paper on radiation therapy, in 1896, dealing with that case.[5][6] This attempt was less than a year after the publication of the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen.[7]
