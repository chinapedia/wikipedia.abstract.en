HUDDIE WILLIAM LEDBETTER (; January 20, 1888  – December 6, 1949)[1] better known as stage name LEAD BELLY was an American folk and blues singer, musician and songwriter notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced. Though many releases credit him as "LEADBELLY", he himself wrote it as "Lead Belly", which is also the spelling on his tombstone[2][3] and the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation.[4]
