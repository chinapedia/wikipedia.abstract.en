The FLUGELHORN (—also spelled FLUEGELHORN, FLUGEL HORN, or FLÜGELHORN—from German meaning _wing horn_ or _flank horn_, ) is a brass instrument that is usually pitched in B but occasionally found in C.[1] It resembles a trumpet, and the tube has the same length but a wider, conical bore.[2] A type of valved bugle,[3] the flugelhorn was developed in Germany from a traditional English valveless bugle, with the first version sold by Heinrich Stölzel in Berlin in 1828.[4] The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone family) with the inspiration for his B soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modeled.[5][6]
