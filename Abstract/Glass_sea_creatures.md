Sea_Creatures_in_Glass.jpg The GLASS SEA CREATURES (alternately called the BLASCHKA SEA CREATURES, GLASS MARINE INVERTEBRATES, and BLASCHKA INVERTEBRATE MODELS) are works of glass artists Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka. The artistic predecessors of the Glass Flowers, the sea creatures were the output of the Blaschkas' successful mail-order business of supplying museums and private collectors around the world with sets of glass models of marine invertebrates.
