The HUNDRED FOWLS PROBLEM is a problem first discussed in the fifth century CE Chinese mathematics text _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ (The Mathematical Classic of Zhang Qiujian), a book of mathematical problems written by Zhang Qiujian. It is one of the best known examples of indeterminate problems in the early history of mathematics.[1] The problem appears as the final problem in _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ (Problem 38 in Chapter 3). However, the problem and its variants have appeared in the medieval mathematical literature of India, Europe and the Arab world.[2]
