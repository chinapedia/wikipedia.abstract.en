In digital printing, a PAGE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE (PDL) is a computer language that describes the appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output bitmap. An overlapping term is PRINTER CONTROL LANGUAGE, which includes Hewlett-Packard's Printer Command Language (PCL). PostScript is one of the most noted page description languages. The markup language adaptation of the PDL is the page description markup language.
