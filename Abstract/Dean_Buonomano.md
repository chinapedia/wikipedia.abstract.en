DEAN V. BUONOMANO (born 1965) is an American neuroscientist, psychologist and author.[1] He is a professor at UCLA whose research focuses on neurocomputation and how the brain tells time. Buonomano has been described as one of the “first neuroscientists to begin to ask how the human brain encodes time” and has been published in various scientific journals.[2] He is the author of two books, _Brain Bugs: How the Brain's Flaws Shape our Lives_[3] and _Your Brain is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time_.[4] Buonomano’s first book _Brain Bugs_ examines the human brain’s functional strengths and weaknesses, ultimately attributing some of the brain’s ‘bugs’ (or flaws) to evolution.
