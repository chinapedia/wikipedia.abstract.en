Vocal_folds-201611.jpg Vocal_folds-speaking_201611.jpg The term PHONATION has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of phonetics. Among some phoneticians, _phonation_ is the process by which the vocal folds produce certain sounds through quasi-periodic vibration. This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general. Phoneticians in other subfields, such as linguistic phonetics, call this process _voicing_, and use the term _phonation_ to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example. Voiceless and supra-glottal phonations are included under this definition.
