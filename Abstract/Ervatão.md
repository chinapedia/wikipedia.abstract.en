ERVATÃO or PORTO DE ERVATÃO is a beach on the southeast coast of the island of Boa Vista in Cape Verde. At its eastern end is the headland _Ponta de Ervatão_. Ervatão is part of the Turtle Nature Reserve (Portuguese: _Reserva Natural Tartaruga_).[1] The area of Ervatão receives 70% of all turtles nesting on Boa Vista. In July 2009, 8,000 turtle nests were counted.[2]
