ARABIC NUMERALS, also called HINDU–ARABIC NUMERALS,[1][2] are the ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The term often implies a decimal number written using these digits, which is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world today. However the term can mean the digits themselves, such as in the statement "octal numbers are written using Arabic numerals."
