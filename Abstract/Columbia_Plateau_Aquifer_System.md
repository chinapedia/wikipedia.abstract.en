The COLUMBIA PLATEAU AQUIFER SYSTEM is a series of layered aquifers across ~44,000 mi² of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The aquifer system is on the Columbia Plateau, contained within the Cascades, Rocky Mountains, Okanogan Highlands, and the Blue Mountains.[1] These aquifers are bounded on the bottom by a layer of Miocene basaltic rock that can be up to 15,000 ft thick.Whitehead, R.L.
