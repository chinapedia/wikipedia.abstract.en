Incomplete_Ultimate_Tic-Tac-Toe_Board.png ULTIMATE TIC-TAC-TOE (also known as SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE, STRATEGIC TIC-TAC-TOE, META TIC-TAC-TOE, or TIC-TAC-TIC-TAC-TOE-TOE[1]) is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid.[2][3] Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board. Compared to traditional tic-tac-toe, strategy in this game is conceptually more difficult, and has proven more challenging for computers.[4]
