_OPERATION SAMURRA_ was an operation by the Iraqi Air Force during the Gulf War to decisively engage USAF F-15Cs utilizing MiG-25 jets, and break the "wall" of F-15s that the Coalition had established along Iraq's border with Iran. It demonstrated the last true offensive operation of the Iraqi Air Force before grounding their air assets in an attempt to preserve them for future use. Through careful planning and coordination, two MiG-25 jets successfully caught two American F-15 fighters off guard and engaged them in a dogfight. After several minutes of aerial maneuvering, and several fired missiles, the Iraqi jets returned to Tammuz Air Force Base undamaged, and the F-15s returned to Saudi Arabia, albeit with one damaged.
