_BOOK OF MERCY_ is a poetry book by Canadian author, poet and singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, published by McLelland and Stewart, and repackaged in March 2010. Its original publication was in 1984. _Book of Mercy_ is considered a companion volume to Cohen's poetry collection, _Book of Longing_ (published in 2006).[1] The book is often referred to as a book of contemporary psalms. The poems are numbered rather than titled. _Book of Mercy_ contains fifty poems. The topics are often spiritual or religious in nature.
