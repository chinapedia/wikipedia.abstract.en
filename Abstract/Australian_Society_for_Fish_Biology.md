The AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY FOR FISH BIOLOGY (ASFB) is a professional organisation of fish and fisheries researchers. Founded in 1971, the society describes itself as a "professional, independent, non-profit, non-commercial and non-aligned organisation."[1] The Australian Society for Fish Biology holds annual conferences for its members, sometimes in partnership with related organisations such as the Oceania Chondrichthyan Society[2] and the Australian Society for Limnology.[3] Former presidents of the society include Hamar Midgley (1977-79), Gerry Allen (1979-81), Julian Pepperell (1991-93) and Bronwyn Gillanders (2012-13).[4]
