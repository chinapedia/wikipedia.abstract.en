NO TRUE SCOTSMAN, or APPEAL TO PURITY, is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an _ad hoc_ fashion to exclude the counterexample.[1][2] Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule ("no Scotsman would do such a thing"; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group).[3]
