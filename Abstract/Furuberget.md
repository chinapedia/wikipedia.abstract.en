FURUBERGET is an independent record label founded in 2013 and based in Oslo, Norway.[1] The label was created by musicians André Lersveen and Ole Torstein Hovig. The company name comes from the name of the forest in Hedmark where Lersveen grew up, Furuberget Nature Reserve. In addition to their digital releases, Furuberget operates an online store through bandcamp for its vinyl releases.[2] Furuberget has signed many artists including The Hallway and previously Ludvig Moon with Spellemannprisen winners as members. Vidar Norheim, former member of Liverpool band Wave Machines, is also signed to Furuberget with his solo EP. Uno Møller, formerly of pop band Team Me, released _Lizards_ under Furuberget in February and his album will come under the label later in the month. [3]
