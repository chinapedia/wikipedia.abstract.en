UZANA OF TOUNGOO (, ) was king of Toungoo from 1435 to 1436. After the death of his father in-law Thinkhaya III in 1435, he succeeded the throne of the petty state of Toungoo (Taungoo), which had been in revolt of Ava since 1426. But his accession was contested by his brother-in-law Saw Oo, who sought assistance from King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Less than a year into his reign, he was overthrown by Ran who came up with an army to Toungoo.[1][2]
