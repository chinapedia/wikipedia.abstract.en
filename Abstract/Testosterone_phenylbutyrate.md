TESTOSTERONE PHENYLBUTYRATE, also known as TESTOSTERONE PHENYLBUTANOATE, TESTOSTERONE 17Β-PHENYLBUTYRATE, and ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-PHENYLBUTYRATE, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β phenylbutyrate (phenylbutanoate) ester of testosterone – which was never marketed.[1] It is a prodrug of testosterone and, when administered via intramuscular injection, is associated with a long-lasting depot effect and extended duration of action.
