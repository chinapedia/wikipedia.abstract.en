The CONSTITUTION OF CANADA is the supreme law in Canada.[1] It outlines Canada's system of government and the civil and human rights of those who are citizens of Canada and non-citizens in Canada.[2] Furthermore, its contents are in fact an amalgamation of various codified acts, treaties between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples (both historical and modern), uncodified traditions and conventions. Canada is one of the oldest constitutional democracies in the world.[3]
