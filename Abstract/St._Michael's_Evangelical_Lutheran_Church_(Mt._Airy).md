ST. MICHAEL'S EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH is a historic church building in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia, just north of the Germantown neighborhood. The congregation was founded sometime before 1728 and three successive church buildings have occupied the same location since that time. The church was closed in 2016.[1][2]
