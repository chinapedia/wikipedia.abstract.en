_PARABURKHOLDERIA_ is a genus of Proteobacteria that are gram negative, slightly curved rods that are motile by means of flagella. Unlike _Burkholderia_ species, _Paraburkholderia_ members are not commonly associated with human infection. _Paraburkholderia_ members form a monophyletic clade within the Burkholderiaceae family, which is what prompted their distinction as a genus independent from _Burkholderia_ species, in combination with the finding of robust conserved signature indels which are unique to _Paraburkholderia_ species, and are lacking in members of the genus _Burkholderia_.[1] These CSIs distinguish the genus from all other bacteria. Additionally, the CSIs that were found to be shared by _Burkholderia_ species are absent in _Paraburkholderia_, providing evidence of separate lineages.[2]
