Cameroon_Nigeria_border_coast.jpg-Cameroon border region on the coast from a 1963 map, with Bakassi peninsula in the middle]] Un-bakassi.png BAKASSI is a peninsula on the Gulf of Guinea. It lies between the Cross River estuary, near the city of Calabar in the west of the Bight of Biafra, and the Rio del Ray estuary on the east. It is governed by Cameroon, following the transfer of sovereignty from neighbouring Nigeria as a result of a judgment by the International Court of Justice.[1] On 22 November 2007, the Nigerian Senate rejected the transfer, since the Greentree Agreement ceding the area to Cameroon was contrary to Section 12(1) of the 1999 Constitution.[2] Regardless, the territory was transferred to Cameroon on 14 August 2008.[3]
