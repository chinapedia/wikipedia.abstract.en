The _ABC CHINESE–ENGLISH DICTIONARY_ or _ABC DICTIONARY_ (1996), compiled under the chief editorship of John DeFrancis, is the first Chinese dictionary to collate entries in single-sort alphabetical order of pinyin romanization, and a landmark in the history of Chinese lexicography. It was also the first publication in the University of Hawai'i Press's "ABC" (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series of Chinese dictionaries. They republished the _ABC Chinese–English Dictionary_ in a pocket edition (1999) and desktop reference edition (2000), as well as the expanded _ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary_ (2003) and dual _ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary_ (2010). Furthermore, the _ABC Dictionary_ databases have been developed into computer applications such as Wenlin Software for learning Chinese (1997).
