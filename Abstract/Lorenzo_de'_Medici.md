LORENZO DE' MEDICI (, 1 January 1449 â€“ 8 April 1492)[1] was an Italian statesman, _de facto_ ruler of the Florentine Republic and the most powerful and enthusiastic patron of Renaissance culture in Italy.[2][3][4] Also known as LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT (_Lorenzo il Magnifico_ ) by contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. As a patron, he is best known for his sponsorship of artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. He held the balance of power within the Italic League, an alliance of states that stabilized political conditions on the Italian peninsula for decades, and his life coincided with the mature phase of the Italian Renaissance and the Golden Age of Florence.[5] The Peace of Lodi of 1454 that he helped maintain among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence.
