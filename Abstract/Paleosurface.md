In geology and geomorphology a PALEOSURFACE is a surface made by erosion of considerable antiquity. Paleosurfaces might be flat or uneven in some cases having considerable relief. Flat and large paleosurfaces —that is planation surfaces— have higher potential to be preserved than small and irregular surfaces and are thus the most studied kind of paleosurfaces.[1] Irregular paleosurfaces, albeit usually smaller than flat ones, occurs across the globe,[2] one example being the Sudetes etchsurfaces.[3] In the case of peneplains it is argued that they become paleosurfaces once they re detached from the base level they grade to.[4][5]
