The CAPITULARIES OF CHARLES THE BALD represent a series of acts implemented by King Charles to decide and promulgate laws governing public affairs. Capitularies were used extensively by the Merovingian and Carolingian rulers (see the Capitularies of Charlemagne) to provide guidance to counts and their subordinate officers in the far-flung reaches of the empire.
