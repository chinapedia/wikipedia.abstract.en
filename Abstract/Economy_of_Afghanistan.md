The ECONOMY OF AFGHANISTAN has had significant improvement in the last decade due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and remittances from Afghan expatriates. The assistance that came from expatriates and outside investors saw this increase when there was more political reliability after the fall of the Taliban regime.[1] The nation's GDP stands at about $70 billion with an exchange rate of $20 billion (2017), and the GDP per capita is about $2,000.[2] It imports over $6 billion worth of goods but exports nearly $1 billion only, mainly fruits and nuts.[3][4]
