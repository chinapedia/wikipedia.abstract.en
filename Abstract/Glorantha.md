GLORANTHA is a fantasy world created by Greg Stafford. It was first introduced in the board game _White Bear and Red Moon_ (1975) by Chaosium, and thereafter in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including _RuneQuest_ and _HeroQuest_, as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game _King of Dragon Pass_. The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade, its Howardian ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and (unusual among early American fantasy role-playing games) its relative lack of Tolkienesque influence.
