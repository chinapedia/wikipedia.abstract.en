BLAKE TYLER NEWTON (October 21, 1889 - April 30, 1977) was a Virginia lawyer, educator and Democratic member of the Senate of Virginia from Hague, Virginia. During the state's Massive Resistance crisis, Newton opposed public school closings, so that when his term expired, he was replaced on the State Board of Education by State Senator Garland Gray, who helped lead the Byrd Organization's opposition to racial desegregation of public schools after the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Education.[1]
