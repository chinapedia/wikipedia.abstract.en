ZHANG QIUJIAN SUANJING (THE MATHEMATICAL CLASSIC OF ZHANG QIUJIAN) is the only known work of the fifth century Chinese mathematician, Zhang Qiujian. It is one of ten mathematical books known collectively as _Suanjing shishu_ (The Ten Computational Canons). In 656 CE, when mathematics was included in the imperial examinations, these ten outstanding works were selected as textbooks. _Jiuzhang suanshu_ (The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art) and _Sunzi Suanjing_ (The Mathematical Classic of Sunzi) are two of these texts that precede _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_. All three works share a large number of common topics. In _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ one can find the continuation of the development of mathematics from the earlier two classics.[1] Internal evidences suggest that book was compiled sometime between 466 and 485 CE.
