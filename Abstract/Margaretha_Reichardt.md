MARGARETHA REICHARDT (6 March 1907 â€“ 25 May 1984), also known as GRETE REICHARDT, was a textile artist, weaver, and graphic designer from Erfurt, Germany.[1] She was one of the most important designers to emerge from the Bauhaus design school's weaving workshop in Dessau, Germany.[2] She spent most of her adult life running her own independent weaving workshop in Erfurt, which was under Nazi rule and then later part of communist East Germany.
