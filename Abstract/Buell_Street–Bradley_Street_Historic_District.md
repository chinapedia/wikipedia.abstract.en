The BUELL STREETâ€“BRADLEY STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a small residential area just to the east of downtown Burlington, Vermont. Roughly bounded by Pearl, South Willard, and College Streets, and Orchard Terrace, the area was developed between about 1890 and 1910, representing one of the last significant neighborhoods built up near the downtown area. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[1]
