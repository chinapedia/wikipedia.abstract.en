Order DESMOTHORACIDA, the DESMOTHORACIDS, are a group of heliozoan protists, usually sessile and found in freshwater environments. The adult is a spherical cell around 10-20 Î¼m in diameter surrounded by a perforated organic lorica, or shell, with many radial pseudopods projecting through the holes to capture food. These are supported by small bundles of microtubules that arise near a point on the nuclear membrane. Unlike other heliozoans, the microtubules are not in any regular geometric array, there does not appear to be a microtubule organizing center, and there is no distinction between the outer and inner cytoplasm.
