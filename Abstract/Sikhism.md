SIKHISM (, ; ), or SIKHI (__, , from _Sikh_, meaning a "disciple", "seeker," or "learner"), is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] It is one of the youngest of the major world religions and the world's fifth largest organized religion, as well as being the world's ninth-largest overall religion.[8] The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, divine unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life.[9][10][11] In the early 21st century, there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them living in Punjab, according to the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.[12]
