On Earth, interactions between the five parts of the climate system produce our daily weather and long-term averages of weather are called "CLIMATE". [1][2] Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents.
