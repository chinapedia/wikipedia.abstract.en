ANTIDEPRESSANTS are drugs used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and of other conditions, including some anxiety disorders, some chronic pain conditions (off-label use), and to help manage some addictions.[1] Common side-effects of antidepressants include dry mouth, weight gain, dizziness, headaches, and sexual dysfunction[2][3][4][5][6]. Most types of antidepressants are typically safe to take, but may cause increased thoughts of suicide when taken by children, adolescents, and young adults.[7] A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant which resembles recurrent depression.[8][9] Debate in the medical community centers around whether or not the observed results in patients can be attributed to the placebo effect.[10]
