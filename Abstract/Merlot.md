MERLOT is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name _Merlot_ is thought to be a diminutive of _merle_, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and "fleshiness", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.[1]
