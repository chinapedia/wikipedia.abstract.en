SIR JOHN FALSTAFF is a fictional character who is mentioned in four plays by William Shakespeare and appears on stage in three of them. His significance as a fully developed character in Shakespeare is primarily formed in the plays _Henry IV, Part 1_ and _Part 2_, where he is a companion to Prince Hal, the future King Henry V. A notable eulogy for Falstaff is presented in Act II, Scene III of _Henry V_, where Falstaff does not appear as a character on stage, as enacted by Mistress Quickly in terms that some scholars have ascribed to Plato's description of the death of Socrates after drinking hemlock. By comparison, in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, Falstaff is presented by Shakespeare as the buffoonish suitor of two married women.
