German disc jockey Robin Schulz has released three studio albums, 13 singles and one promotional single. Schulz achieved his worldwide breakthrough with his remix of Mr Probz's "Waves" (2014), which reached the top ten of the charts in over ten countries, while further peaking within the top ten in various other. It was also certified—among others—Platinum in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While the disc jockey's follow-up recording, "Prayer in C" (2014), was met with similar commercial acclaim, two fellow singles from his debut studio album _Prayer_ (2015) were released, including a collaboration with Jasmine Thompson.
