The CHILDREN'S RAILWAY SAKHALIN (Russian: Южно-Сахалинская детская железная дорога) is a narrow gauge miniature railway in the Russian city Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in Sakhalin Oblast. The 2.0 km circular track with a 200 m long branch into the depot was opened on 6 June 1954 as one of the many pioneer railways in the USSR. It is still in use.
