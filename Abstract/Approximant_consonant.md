APPROXIMANTS are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough[1] nor with enough articulatory precision[2] to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence. This class is composed of sounds like (as in _rest_) and semivowels like and (as in _yes_ and _west_, respectively), as well as lateral approximants like (as in _less_).
