NORMA MILLAY ELLIS (1894 - May 14, 1986) was an American singer and actress, and sister of the famous poet and playwright Edna St. Vincent Millay.[1] Born in Rockland, Maine to Cora Lounella Buzelle and Henry Tolman Millay, Ellis was one of three sisters who were all, due to their parentsâ€™ divorce, largely brought up by their mother.[2] Having been a writer of poetry herself, Cora Millay ensured the presence of art and music in the Millay household, which became a vital part of the upbringing of Ellis and her two sisters.[3] Ellis would go on to perform with the Provincetown Players and appear on Broadway. She married painter and actor Charles Ellis.[4]
