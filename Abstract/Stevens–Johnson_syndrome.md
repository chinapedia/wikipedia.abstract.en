STEVENSâ€“JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS) is a type of severe skin reaction.[1] Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), it forms a spectrum of disease, with SJS being less severe.[2][3] Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms.[4] A few days later the skin begins to blister and peel forming painful raw areas.[5] Mucous membranes, such as the mouth, are also typically involved.[6] Complications include dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure.[7]
