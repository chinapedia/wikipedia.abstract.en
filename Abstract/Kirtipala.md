KIRTI-PALA (IAST: Kīrtipāla, r. c. 1160-1182 CE), also known as Kitu in vernacular legends, was an Indian king belonging to the Chahamana dynasty of Javalipura (modern Jalore). A member of the Naddula Chahamana family, he carved out a principality for himself with Jalore at its capital. He ruled parts of southern Rajasthan as a feudatory of the Chaulukyas, and participated in their successful battle against Muhammad of Ghor in 1178 CE. He also fought with other Chaulukya feudatories, including Asala of Kiratakupa (modern Kiradu) and the Guhila chief Samantasimha.
