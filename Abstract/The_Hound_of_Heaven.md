"THE HOUND OF HEAVEN" is a 182-line poem written by English poet Francis Thompson (1859â€“1907). The poem became famous and was the source of much of Thompson's posthumous reputation. The poem was first published in Thompson's first volume of poems in 1893.[1] It was included in the _Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse_ (1917). Thompson's work was praised by G. K. Chesterton, and it was also an influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, who presented a paper on Thompson in 1914.[2]
