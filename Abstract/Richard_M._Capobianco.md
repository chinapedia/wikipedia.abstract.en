RICHARD M. CAPOBIANCO is an American philosophy professor and one of the leading commentators on the thought of the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger. His two books, _Engaging Heidegger_ and _Heidegger's Way of Being_,[1] have led the way to a renewed appreciation of Heidegger's core concern with Being as temporal radiant emergence or manifestation. He has also brought Heidegger into closer proximity with American authors such as Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Muir, and E. E. Cummings, and with English poets such as William Wordsworth and Gerard Manley Hopkins.
