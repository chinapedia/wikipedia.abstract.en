In engineering and science, DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as length, mass, time, and electric charge) and units of measure (such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. The conversion of units from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the FACTOR-LABEL METHOD, also known as the UNIT-FACTOR METHOD, is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra.[1][2][3]
