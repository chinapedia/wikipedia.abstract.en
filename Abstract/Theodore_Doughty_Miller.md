THEODORE DOUGHTY MILLER (September 19, 1835 â€“ March 1, 1897) was a Baptist preacher from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the late 19th century. Before the US Civil War (1861-1865), he was a part of abolitionist society in Philadelphia, and after the war he played a leading role in the Baptist Church. In 1881 he was called "the best colored preacher ever located in Philadelphia".[1]
