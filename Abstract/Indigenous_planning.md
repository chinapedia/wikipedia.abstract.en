INDIGENOUS PLANNING (or INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY PLANNING) is an ideological approach to the field of regional planning where planning done by Indigenous peoples for Indigenous communities.[1] Practitioners integrate traditional knowledge or cultural knowledge into the process of planning. Indigenous planning recognizes that "all human communities plan"[2] and that Indigenous communities have been carrying out their own community planning processes for thousands of years.[3] While the broader context of urban planning, and social planning includes the need to work cooperatively with indigenous persons and organizations, the process in doing so is dependent on social, political and cultural forces.
