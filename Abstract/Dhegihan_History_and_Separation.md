THE DHEGIHAN (DEGIHAN) MIGRATION HISTORY AND SEPARATION is the narrative of the long journey on foot by the North American Indians in the ancient Hoga tribe. During the migration from present-day Illinois/Kentucky and as far as Nebraska, they gradually split up in five groups. Each became an independent and historic tribe. They are the Omaha, Ponca, Kaw or Kansa, Osage and Quapaw.
