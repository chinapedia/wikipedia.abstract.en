Water_jacket_test_diagram.jpg Old_diving_cylinders.JPG Transportable pressure vessels for high-pressure gases are routinely inspected and tested as part of the manufacturing process. They are generally marked as evidence of passing the tests, either individually or as part of a batch (some tests are destructive), and certified as meeting the standard of manufacture by the authorised testing agency, making them legal for import and sale. When a cylinder is manufactured, its specification, including _manufacturer_, _working pressure_, _test pressure_, _date of manufacture_, _capacity_ and _weight_ are stamped on the cylinder.[1]
