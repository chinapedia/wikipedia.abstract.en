"THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM AT THE BOTTOM: AN INVITATION TO ENTER A NEW FIELD OF PHYSICS" was a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at the annual American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959.[1] Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atoms as a more powerful form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time. Although versions of the talk were reprinted in a few popular magazines it went largely unnoticed and did not inspire the conceptual beginnings of the field. Beginning in the 1980s, however, nanotechnology advocates cited it to establish the scientific credibility of their work.
