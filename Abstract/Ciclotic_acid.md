CICLOTIC ACID, or CYCLOTIC ACID, systematic name 4-METHYLBICYCLO[2.2.2]OCT-2-ENE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID, is a bicyclic carboxylic acid.[1] The salts and esters of ciclotic acid are known as CICLOTATES (CYCLOTATES). An example is nandrolone cyclotate, a long-acting ester prodrug of the anabolic-androgenic steroid nandrolone.[2][3][4]
