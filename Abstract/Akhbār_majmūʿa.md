The _AKHBĀR MAJMŪʿA FĪ FATḤ AL-ANDALUS_ ("Collection of Anecdotes on the Conquest of al-Andalus") is an anonymous history of al-Andalus compiled in the second decade of the 11th century and only preserved in a single manuscript, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Parts of it date to the 8th and 9th centuries,[1] and it is the earliest Arabic history of al-Andalus, covering the period from the Arab conquest (711) until the reign of the Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III (929–61).[2] The _Akhbār majmūʿa_ is sometimes called the "Anonymous of Paris", after the home of its manuscript, or the "Anonymous of Córdoba", after its presumed place of origin.[3]
