The FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT is a law passed by the 114th United States Congress and signed into law by US President Barack Obama in 2016. Administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates the introduction of new or already existing chemicals, the Act amends and updates the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that went into force in 1976.
