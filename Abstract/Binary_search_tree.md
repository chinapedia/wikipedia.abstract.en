In computer science, BINARY SEARCH TREES (BST), sometimes called ORDERED or SORTED BINARY TREES, are a particular type of container: a data structure that stores "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its _key_ (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).
