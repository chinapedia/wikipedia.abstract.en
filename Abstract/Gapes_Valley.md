GAPES VALLEY is a valley in the Canterbury Region in the South Island of New Zealand. It is about west of Geraldine and located on the Geraldine Fairlie Highway. The valley is nestled between the Waitohi Hill and the Rocky Ridges[1] and is described as being long with the flat land of exceptional quality.[2] Today Gapes Valley consists of a sparse grouping of houses, the hall and a recently established brewery.
