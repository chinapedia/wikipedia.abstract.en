FRANK VINCENT ZAPPA (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician, composer, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.[1] In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and _musique concrète_ works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.[2] Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.[3][4]
