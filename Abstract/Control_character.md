In computing and telecommunication, a CONTROL CHARACTER or NON-PRINTING CHARACTER (NPC) is a code point (a number) in a character set, that does not represent a written symbol. They are used as in-band signaling to cause effects other than the addition of a symbol to the text. All other characters are mainly PRINTING, PRINTABLE, or GRAPHIC CHARACTERS, except perhaps for the "space" character (see ASCII printable characters).
