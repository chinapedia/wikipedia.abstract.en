The ORDER OF SAINT GEORGE (; ) is an Austrian chivalric order founded by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III and Pope Paul II in 1469.[1] Established as a military order to advocate the Christian faith, its original implicite goal was to combat the Ottoman incursions into the Inner Austrian lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola. The order resided at Millstatt Abbey and in Wiener Neustadt, until in 1598 its properties were handed over to the Jesuit college in Graz.
