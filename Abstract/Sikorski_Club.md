SIKORSKI CLUB, also known as the SIKORSKI POLISH CLUB, is a historic Polish club in Glasgow, Scotland.[1] It was founded as the Polish Social and Educational Society in 1954.[2] The building, known as Sikorski House, was donated by Sir Patrick Dollan.[3] It was named in honor of Władysław Sikorski, who served as the Prime Minister of Poland from 1939 to 1943.[4] In 2016, its existence was jeopardized by a lack of funding for a mandatory renovation of its building.[5]
