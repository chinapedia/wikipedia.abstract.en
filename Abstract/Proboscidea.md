The PROBOSCIDEA (from the Greek and the Latin _proboscis_) are a taxonomic order of afrotherian mammals containing one living family (Elephantidae) and several extinct families. This order, first described by J. Illiger in 1811, encompasses the trunked mammals.[1] In addition to their enormous size, later proboscideans are distinguished by tusks and long, muscular trunks; these features were less developed or absent in the smaller early proboscideans. Beginning in the mid-Miocene, most members of this order were very large animals. The largest land mammal today is the African elephant weighing up to 10.4 tonnes with a shoulder height of up to . The largest land mammal of all time may have also been a proboscidean: _Palaeoloxodon namadicus_, which may have weighed up to with a shoulder height up to , surpassing several sauropod dinosaurs (in height).[2]
