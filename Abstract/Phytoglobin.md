Overlaping_figure.tif PHYTOGLOBINS are globular plant (algae and land plant) proteins classified into the globin superfamily, which contain a heme, _i_._e_. protoporphyrin IX-Fe, prosthetic group. Phytoglobins were discovered in 1939 by Kubo after spectroscopic and chemical analysis of the red pigment of soybean root nodules.[1] A few decades after Kubo's report the crystallization of a lupin phytoglobin (known as leghemoglobin) by Vainshtein and collaborator revealed that the tertiary structure of this protein and that of the sperm whale myoglobin was remarkably similar, thus indicating that the phytoglobin discovered by Kubo did indeed correspond to a globin.[2]
