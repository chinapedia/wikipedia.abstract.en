A_selection_of_instruments_used_for_monitoring_volcanoes.jpg A MULTI-COMPONENT GAS ANALYZER SYSTEM (MULTI-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes.[1] A Multi-GAS package includes an infrared spectrometer for CO₂, two electrochemical sensors for SO₂ and H₂S, and pressure–temperature–humidity sensors, all in a weatherproof box weighing approximately 3 kg,[2] as well as radio transmitters to transmit data to remote locations. The instrument package is portable, and its operation and data analysis are simple enough to be conducted by non-specialists.[3]
