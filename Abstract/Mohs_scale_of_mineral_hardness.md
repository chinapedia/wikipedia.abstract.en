Mohssche-haerteskala_hg.jpg The MOHS SCALE OF MINERAL HARDNESS () is a qualitative ordinal scale characterizing scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material. Created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs, it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science, some of which are more quantitative.[1] The method of comparing hardness by observing which minerals can scratch others is of great antiquity, having been mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise _On Stones_, , followed by Pliny the Elder in his _Naturalis Historia_, .[2][3][4] While greatly facilitating the identification of minerals in the field, the Mohs scale does not show how well hard materials perform in an industrial setting.[5]
