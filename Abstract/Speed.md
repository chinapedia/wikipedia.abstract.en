In everyday use and in kinematics, the SPEED of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position); it is thus a scalar quantity.[1] The AVERAGE SPEED of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval;[2] the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.
