A BURNS SUPPER is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns (25 January 175921 July 1796), the author of many Scots poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally known as ROBERT BURNS DAY (or ROBBIE BURNS DAY[1] or RABBIE BURNS DAY) but more commonly known as BURNS NIGHT (). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year.
