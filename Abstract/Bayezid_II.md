BAYEZID II (3 December 1447 – 26 May 1512) (Ottoman Turkish: بايزيد ثانى _Bāyezīd-i s̱ānī_, Turkish: _II. Bayezid_ or _II. Beyazıt_) was the eldest son and successor of Mehmed II, ruling as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512. During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a Safavid rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, Selim I. He is most notable for evacuating Sephardi Jews from Spain after the proclamation of the Alhambra Decree and resettling them throughout the Ottoman Empire.
