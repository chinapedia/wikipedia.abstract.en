_MANGALURU SAMACHARA_ or _MANGALOORU SAMACHARA_ which literally means _"THE NEWS OF MANGALORE"_ is the first newspaper published in Kannada. It was produced by a German, Rev. Hermann Friedrich MÃ¶gling of the Basel Mission beginning in 1843. The paper was printed using stone slabs, which exist to this day in the Basel Mission Printing Press in Balmatta, Mangalore. It was a very difficult task to publish a newspaper at that time because there was no simple way of communicating news and other written words to the general public.[1][2]
