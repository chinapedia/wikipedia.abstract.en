ROUX DE MARCILLY, sometimes spelled Marsilly[1] (born in Nîmes around 1623; died in Paris on 22 June 1669), is said to be the head and coordinator of a plot against King of France Louis XIV in 1668. In a socio-political context of persecution of Huguenots and famine, the plot was on a European scale. The conspiracy aimed at overturning Louis XIV’s government and change into republics provinces like Provence, Dauphiné, and Languedoc, with the military support of Switzerland, Spain[2] and United Netherlands.
