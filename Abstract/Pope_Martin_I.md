POPE MARTIN I (; between 590 and 600 â€“ 16 September 655) reigned from 21 July 649 to his death in 655.[1] He succeeded Pope Theodore I on 5 July 649. He was the only pope during the Eastern Roman domination of the papacy whose election was not approved by a mandate from Constantinople. Martin I was exiled by Emperor Constans II and died at Cherson. He is considered a saint and martyr by the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Orthodox church he is known as ST. MARTIN THE CONFESSOR, THE POPE OF ROME.[2][3][4]
