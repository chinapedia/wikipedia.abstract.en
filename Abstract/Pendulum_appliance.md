PENDULUM is an orthodontic appliance, developed by James J. Hilgers in 1992,[1] that use forces to distalize the upper 1st molars to create space for eruption of impacted teeth or allowing correction of Class 2 malocclusion. This appliance is a fixed type of distalizing appliance that does not depend on the compliance of each patient to work. Hilgers published an article in _Journal of Clinical Orthodontics_ in 1992 describing the appliance.[2]
