The VEX ROBOTICS COMPETITION is a robotics competition for elementary through university students. It is a subset of VEX Robotics, which is in turn a subset of Innovation First International. The VEX Robotics World Championship, run by the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation[1] in April 2018 was named the largest robotics competition in the world by Guinness World Records.[2]
