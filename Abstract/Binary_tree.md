In computer science, a BINARY TREE is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the __ and the __. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (_L_, _S_, _R_), where _L_ and _R_ are binary trees or the empty set and _S_ is a singleton set.[1] Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.[2]
