The Cisco EXTENSION MOBILITY feature, sometimes referred to as hoteling, allows a user to temporarily configure another IP telephone as his own. The user therefore has to log into that IP telephone with a username and PIN. Once logged in, the phone has the users profile information, including their extension number (the reason for calling it ‘extension mobility’), dial permissions and other feature settings (e.g. call forwards).
