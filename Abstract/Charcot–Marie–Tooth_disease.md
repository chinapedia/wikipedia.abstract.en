CHARCOT–MARIE–TOOTH DISEASE (CMT) is one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, a group of varied inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body. Currently incurable, this disease is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder, and affects about one in 2,500 people.[1][2] CMT was previously classified as a subtype of muscular dystrophy.[3]
