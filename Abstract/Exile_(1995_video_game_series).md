_EXILE_ is a series of role-playing video games created by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software.[1] They were released as shareware titles for Macintosh and Windows systems. _Exile III_ was also ported to Linux by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the _Avernum_ series. Common to all games in the _Exile_ series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of Exile I and II had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with Exile III's graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.
