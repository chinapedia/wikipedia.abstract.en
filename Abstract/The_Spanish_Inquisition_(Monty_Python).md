"THE SPANISH INQUISITION" is a series of sketches in _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, Series 2 Episode 2, first broadcast 22 September 1970, parodying the real-life Spanish Inquisition. This episode is itself entitled "The Spanish Inquisition". The sketches are notable for their principal catchphrase, "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!", which has become a frequently-used quote.[1][2][3][4] The end of the sketch uses music from the composition Devil's Galop by Charles Williams. Rewritten audio versions of the sketches were included on _Another Monty Python Record_ in 1971.
