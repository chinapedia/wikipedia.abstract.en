Snowboard_with_Strap-In_Bindings_and_Stomp_Pad.png Snowboard_animation.gif Lahaie-JIB.jpg Towin.jpg SNOWBOARDS are boards where both feet are secured to the same board, which are wider than skis, with the ability to glide on snow.[1] Snowboards widths are between 6 and 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters.[2] Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user. In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. Users of such equipment may be referred to as _snowboarder_s. _Commercial snowboards_ generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder, who generally rides in an upright position.[3] These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure, entertainment, and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding.
