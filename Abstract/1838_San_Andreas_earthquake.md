The 1838 SAN ANDREAS EARTHQUAKE is believed to be a rupture along the northern part of the San Andreas Fault in June 1838.[1][2] It affected approximately 100Â km (62 miles) of the fault, from the San Francisco Peninsula to the Santa Cruz Mountains.[3] It was a strong earthquake, with an estimated moment magnitude of 6.8 to 7.2,[4] making it one of the largest known earthquakes in California. The region was lightly populated at the time, although structural damage was reported in San Francisco, Oakland, and Monterey.[5][6][7] It is unknown whether there were fatalities. Based on geological sampling, the fault created approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) of slip.[8]
