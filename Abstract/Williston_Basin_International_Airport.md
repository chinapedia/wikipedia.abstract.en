WILLISTON BASIN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is an airport under construction near Williston, a city in the U.S. state of North Dakota. It is located roughly northwest of the city. Williston Basin Airport will have two runways and a terminal building. It is being built to replace Sloulin Field International Airport, which currently serves Williston and has experienced difficulty dealing with the increase in air traffic to Williston amid the North Dakota oil boom. The project is expected to be completed by late 2019.
