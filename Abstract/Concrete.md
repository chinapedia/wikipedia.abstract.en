In contrast to modern concrete structures, the concrete used in Roman buildings was usually covered with brick or stone.]] CONCRETE, usually PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE (for its visual resemblance to Portland stone),[2][3] is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over timeâ€”most frequently in the past a lime-based cement binder, such as lime putty, but sometimes with other hydraulic cements, such as a calcium aluminate cement or Portland Cement. It is distinguished from other, non-cementitious types of concrete all binding some form of aggregate together, including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces, and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder.
