Close_up_of_hand_shearer.jpg BLADE SHEARING or HAND SHEARING is the style of shearing sheep and other animals with fibrous coats (alpaca, llama, goats etc.) with a set of specialized scissors. It is practiced in many parts of the world as both an occupation and a sport. Commercial blade shearers shear on average 140 sheep in an 8-hour working day, but some will shear over 200 sheep in a day.[1]
