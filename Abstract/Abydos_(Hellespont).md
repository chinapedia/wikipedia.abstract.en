Abydos}} ABYDOS (, ) was an ancient city and bishopric in Mysia. It was located at the Nara Burnu promontory on the Asian coast of the Hellespont, opposite the ancient city of Sestos, and near the city of Ã‡anakkale in Turkey. Abydos was founded in c. 670 at the most narrow point in the straits,[1] and thus was one of the main crossing points between Europe and Asia, until its replacement by the crossing between Lampsacus and Kallipolis in the 13th century,[2] and the abandonment of Abydos in the early 14th century.[3]
