_ATOMIC, LIVING IN DREAD AND PROMISE_ is a documentary film about nuclear history directed by Mark Cousins. It uses only archive footage to explore life and death in the atomic age. The band Mogwai created the original soundtrack. The film, with a live performance by Mogwai, closed the Edinburgh International Festival in 2016. It was then shown on BBC Storyville to mark 70 years since the bombing of Hiroshima.[1] The soundtrack was subsequently reworked by Mogwai into a studio album, _Atomic_.
