_MOONIE_ is a pejorative term sometimes used to refer to members of the Unification movement, also known as the Unification Church. It is derived from the name of the movement's founder Sun Myung Moon,[1] and was first used in 1974 by the American media.[2] Members have used the word "Moonie", including: Moon himself,[3] President of the Unification Theological Seminary David Kim,[4] and Moon's aide and president of The Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea Bo Hi Pak.[5] In the 1980s and 1990s, the Unification Church of the United States undertook an extensive public relations campaign against the use of the word by the news media.[6] Journalistic authorities, including _The New York Times_ and Reuters, now discourage its use in news reporting.[7][8] In other contexts, it is still sometimes used and not always considered pejorative.[9][10]
