THE PARADOX was a South Baltimore dance club that opened in 1991 and closed in 2017. It was originally a home to house music, but later on got more of a hip hop feel.[1] The club closed in the summer of 2016. The club was founded by Wayne Davis. He first started out DJing in 1976 at Odell's, another popular night club in Baltimore, until 1988. This is when he opened his own club call Fantasy that resided in a simple three story house. The Paradox started similarly in just an open building with a concrete floor. The building wasn't as important as the energy that it was filled with.[2]
