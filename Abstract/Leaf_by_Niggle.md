"LEAF BY NIGGLE" is a short story written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1938â€“39[1] and first published in the _Dublin Review_ in January 1945. It can be found, most notably, in Tolkien's book titled _Tree and Leaf_, and in other places (including the collections _The Tolkien Reader_, _Poems & Stories_, _A Tolkien Miscellany_, and _Tales from the Perilous Realm_). This is notable because the book, consisting of a seminal essay called "On Fairy-Stories" and "Leaf by Niggle", offers the underlying philosophy (Creation and Sub-Creation, see below) of much of Tolkien's fantastical writings.
