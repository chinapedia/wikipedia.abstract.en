HOLLAND is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name _Holland_ is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries,[1] and sometimes employed by the Dutch themselves.[2] However, some in the Netherlands, particularly those from regions outside Holland, may find it undesirable[3] or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country.
