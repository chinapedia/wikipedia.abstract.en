A hat-trick in cricket is when a bowler takes three wickets on consecutive deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. It is a relatively rare event in Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket with only 7 occurrences in almost 800 matches.[1] The first Twenty20 hat-trick was taken by Brett Lee of Australia, playing against Bangladesh in Cape Town on September 2007.[2] Rashid Khan is the only bowler to take four wickets in four balls in T20 cricket, he achieved this feat against Ireland in February 2019.
