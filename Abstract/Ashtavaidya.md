An ASHTAVAIDYA is a practitioner of the Ayurveda system of medicine belonging to a certain select group of families in the Indian state of Kerala. Among the Ayurvedic healers of Kerala, the Ashtavaidyas are the Brahmin scholar physicians who are masters of the eight branches of Ayurveda mentioned in classical texts. It was this expertise in the eight branches (_ashtanga_s in sanskrit) that earned them the epithet of ashtavaidya. These branches are dealt with in detail in the treatise AshtƒÅnga Hridayam one of the primary texts of Ayurveda. The eight branches of Ayurveda are _Kaya_ (general medicine mainly dealing with digestive disorders), _Bala_ (pediatrics including obstetrics), _Graha_ (psychological disorders due to possession by evil spirits), _Urdhvanga_ (diseases of the head (eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth)), _Shalya_ (surgery and treatment for external injuries), _Damshtra_ (toxicology (treatment for poisoning, snake and insect bites), _Jara_ (geriatrics and rejuvenation) and _Vrisha_ (aphrodisiacs and treatment for sterility).[1][2][3]
