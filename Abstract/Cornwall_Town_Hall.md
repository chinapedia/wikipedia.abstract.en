The CORNWALL TOWN HALL is located at 2629 Vermont Route 30 in Cornwall, Vermont. Built in 1880 and enlarged in 1905 to also house the local Grange chapter, it is one of the rural community's few examples of Italianate architecture, and has served as a community meeting point since its construction. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[1]
