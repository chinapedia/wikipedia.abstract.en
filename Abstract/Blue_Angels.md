The BLUE ANGELS is the United States Navy's flight demonstration squadron which was initially formed in 1946,[1] making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French Patrouille de France formed in 1931. The Blue Angels' McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets (numbered 1â€“6) are currently flown by five Navy demonstration pilots and one Marine Corps demonstration pilot.
