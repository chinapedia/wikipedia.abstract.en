The SAXIFRAGALES are an order of flowering plants.[1] Their closest relatives are a large eudicot group known as the rosids by the definition of rosids given in the APG II classification system.[2] Some authors define the rosids more widely, including Saxifragales as their most basal group.[3] Saxifragales is one of the eight groups that compose the core eudicots. The others are Gunnerales, Dilleniaceae, Rosids, Santalales, Berberidopsidales, Caryophyllales, and Asterids.[4]
