The FOOD AND AGRICULTURE POLICY DECISION ANALYSIS (FAPDA) initiative, led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation's Agricultural Development Economics Division, aims at promoting evidence-based decision making.[1] FAPDA collects and disseminates information on food and agriculture policy decisions through a freely accessible web-based tool.[2] It has been gathering information since 2008 from more than 80 countries. Between 2008 and 2016, more than 9000 policy decisions have been gathered on this web-based tool, which allows for policy trend identification and the analysis. At the country level, FAPDA focuses on developing information on policy trends and stability indicators for more transparent and effective policy-making.
