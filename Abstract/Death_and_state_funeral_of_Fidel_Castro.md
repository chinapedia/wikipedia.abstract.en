The former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro died of natural causes at 22:29 (CST) in the evening of 25 November 2016. His brother, the then-President and current First Secretary Ra√∫l Castro, made an announcement about his death on state television.[1] Most foreign government officials, most notably in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia, praised Castro for improving healthcare and education for Cuba's rural poor, opposing international racism, and standing up to US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere while others, especially in the US, Europe, and Canada were more critical of his legacy, saying he was an evil tyrant who drove the Cuban economy to the ground and quelled all opposition to his rule. Some officials gave more neutral condolences while others issued statements about positive binational relations with Cuba (South Africa, Namibia, and Angola praised Castro for ending apartheid in South Africa and freeing Namibia in order to reinforce Mandela's common cause with Castro in fighting racism). Castro's body was cremated and his ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December 2016, and hundreds of thousands of Cubans commemorated the event.
