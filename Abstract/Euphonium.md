The EUPHONIUM is a medium-sized, conical-bore, tenor-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word _euphōnos_,[1] meaning "well-sounding" or "sweet-voiced" ( _eu_ means "well" or "good" and _phōnē_ means "sound", hence "of good sound"). The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have piston valves, though some models with rotary valves do exist.
