JULIA A. AMES (October 14, 1861 - December 12, 1891) was an American journalist, editor and temperance reformer. She served as associate editor of the Woman's Temperance Publishing Association's _Union Signal_. Ames died in 1891 at the age of 30. The year after her death, the journalist and spiritualist W. T. Stead published automatic writing which was said to have been sent by Ames to her friend. Stead also created "Julie's Bureau" to allow others to communicate with the dead.
