CANNABIS IN LEBANON is illegal. However, large amounts are grown within the country, and personal use as long as not in public is not a major issue.[1] Legalization efforts are underway, though formal action has not yet been taken [2]. The Parliament speaker stated, "The Lebanese Parliament is preparing to study and adopt the legislation necessary to legislate the cultivation of cannabis and its manufacture for medical uses in the manner of many European countries and some US states."[3] This announcement comes after the release of a five-year study by McKinsey & Company to boost economic development. With the world's third highest debt, proponents for legalization argue that fostering the marijuana industry could help to reform the country's economy [4] Some growers that oppose the reform, such as Abu Jafaar of the Bekka Valley (Lebanon's most well known growing area), fear that government intervention will take revenue away from them and into the hands of politicians.
