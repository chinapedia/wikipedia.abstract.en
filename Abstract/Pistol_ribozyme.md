The PISTOL RIBOZYME is an RNA structure that catalyzes its own cleavage at a specific site. In other words, it is a self-cleaving ribozyme. The pistol ribozyme was discovered through comparative genomic analysis.[1] Subsequent biochemical analysis determined further biochemical characteristics of the ribozyme.[2] This understanding was further advanced by an atomic-resolution crystal structure of a pistol ribozyme[3]
