In natural theology and philosophy, a COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT is an argument in which the existence of a unique being, generally seen as some kind of god, is deduced or inferred from facts or alleged facts concerning causation, change, motion, contingency, or finitude in respect of the universe as a whole or processes within it.[1][2] It is traditionally known as an ARGUMENT FROM UNIVERSAL CAUSATION, an ARGUMENT FROM FIRST CAUSE, or the CAUSAL ARGUMENT, and is more precisely a COSMO_GONIC_AL ARGUMENT (about the _origin_). Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from _in causa_ (causality), _in esse_ (essentiality), and _in fieri_ (becoming).
