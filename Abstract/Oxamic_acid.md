OXAMIC ACID is the organic compound with the formula H₂NC(O)CO₂H. It is a white, water-soluble solid. It is the monoamide of oxalic acid.[1] Oxamic acid inhibits Lactate dehydrogenase A.[2] The active site of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is closed off once oxamic acid attaches to the LDH-NADH complex, effectively inhibiting it.[3]
