PETTATHULAL, also known as PETTA KETTU, is a historic ritualistic dance held annually on 27th Dhanu at Erumely in the district of Kottayam in Kerala. It is performed during the Mandalam - Makaravilakku period (November, December and January) in the presence of thousands of devotees which depicts the joyfulness of people by the slaying of Mahishi by Lord Ayyappa.[1][2] Two groups actively participates in the thullal, one from Ambalappuzha and other from Aalangadu. Ambalappuzha group starts their journey to Erumely on 22nd of Dhanu and a couple of days before the thullal. They visits the Manimala Bhagavathy temple on 25th Dhanu and performs an _Aazhi pooja._[3] Before the thullal of Ambalappuzha group, a _Krishna parunth_ (sacred eagle) flies round in the sky. It is believed that lord Vishnu himself arrives from Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna temple on his mount Garuda to witness the thullal.[4][5]
