CHEUNG MING-MAN (; born 2 September 1956) is a Hong Kong singer and occasional actor, best known for many patriotic songs he sang in the 1980s, all in Mandarin (which he didn't speak well). He became the first Hong Kong singer to sing at the CCTV New Year's Gala, China's most-watched TV event, when he performed his song "My Chinese Heart" at the 1984 event. The song made him an instant superstar nationally.
