_VAMPALUS_ is a genus of cetotheriid mysticete from Miocene (Tortonian) marine deposits in the Russian Caucasus.[1] The type species, _V. sayasanicus_, is based on PIN 5341/1, a complete skeleton. The cetotheriid _Eucetotherium helmersonii_ was mistakenly assigned to _Vampalus_ by Tarasenko and Lopatin, who were unaware that Kellogg (1931) fixed _"Cetotherium" helmersonii_ as the _Eucetotherium_ type species.
