CANNABIS IN ESTONIA is illegal, but possession of up to 7.5Â grams is considered an amount for personal use, and is punished with a fine. Large amounts and distribution are criminal offences and punishable with a custodial sentence of up to 5 years.[1] In 2018, the then recently merged municipality of Kanepi in southern Estonia adopted the cannabis leaf as the symbol on its flag and coat of arms.[2] _Kanep_ is the Estonian word for cannabis. Hemp was historically used as a product in shipbuilding. It was traded from the eastern Baltic within the Hanseatic League and in the sixteenth century directly to the Netherlands for this purpose.[3]
