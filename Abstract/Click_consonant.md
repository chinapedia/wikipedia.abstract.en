CLICK CONSONANTS, or clicks, are speech sounds that occur as consonants in many languages of Southern Africa and in three languages of East Africa. Examples familiar to English-speakers are the _Tut-tut_ (British spelling) or _Tsk! Tsk!_ (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the _tchick!_ used to spur on a horse, and the _clip-clop!_ sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.
