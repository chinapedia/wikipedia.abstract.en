TUXIS ISLAND,[1] sometimes uncommonly spelled TUNXIS, is a small, uninhabited island about off the shore of Madison in New Haven County, Connecticut in the United States.[2] Tuxis Island is about in area, and covered mostly in trees. The island's elevation is above sea level.[3] Tuxis Island was formed by glaciers, a fact that is evident by the many glacial potholes and small boulders on the south of the island. The island itself is made mostly of granite, like most of the other islands nearby, although there is some sand. Two other islands, Gull Rock and Round Rock, are relatively close to Tuxis, as is Madison Reef to the south, and several unnamed rocks and islets. These landforms are sometimes associated with the Thimble Islands.
