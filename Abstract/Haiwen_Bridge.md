HAIWEN BRIDGE ()[1] (named PUQIAN BRIDGE while under construction) is a cable-stayed bridge located east of Haikou City, Hainan, China.[2][3] It crosses the mouth of Dongzhai Harbor and was built to provide quicker access between Haikou and Wenchang, a large, administrative division of Hainan province. (The area of Wenchang contains the city of Wenchang further south.) The bridge reduced travel time from Haikou to Wenchang City from 90 minutes down to around 20 minutes.[4]
