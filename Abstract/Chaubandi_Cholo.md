CHAUBANDI CHOLO is a traditional woman's blouse of Nepali culture.[1] The blouse is typically wrapped and can have an open or closed neck. It is often worn with a _sārī_-like wrapped skirt.[2][3] A chaubandi cholo is often cotton in a red or white geometric print, however different color and use can distinguish different Nepali cultures.[4]
