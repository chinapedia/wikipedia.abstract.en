The national CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP OF MEXICO has been organized annually since 1973 by FENAMAC (), the Mexican chess federation. Known since 1997 as the NATIONAL ABSOLUTE CHAMPIONSHIP (_Campeonato Nacional Absoluto_) and previously as the NATIONAL CLOSED CHAMPIONSHIP (_Campeonato Nacional Cerrado_), it was initially organized as a round-robin tournament. However, several editions in the 1990s were organized as a series of elimination matches, and the championship is currently run as a Swiss-system tournament.[1] In some years it serves as a qualifying stage for the FIDE World Chess Championship and is designated as sub-Zonal tournament 2.3.1 in such cases.[2] A different tournament is the Mexican Open Championship (_Campeonato Nacional Abierto_), which is not limited to Mexican nationals and has been held annually since 1954.[3]
