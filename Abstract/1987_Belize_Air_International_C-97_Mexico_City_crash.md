The 1987 MEXICO CITY AIR DISASTER occurred on 30 July 1987, when a Belize Air International Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter, bound for Fort Lauderdaleâ€“Hollywood International Airport crashed onto the Mexico - Toluca highway during the late afternoon rush hour. A total of 49 people, including 44 on the ground, were killed in the crash.[1][2][3] At least 20 people were injured, with reports that the number could be much higher. The accident was caused due to cargo shift in the compartment, causing a shift in the center of gravity. A short circuit also caused the landing gear to extend, leading to the aircraft's rapid increase in drag. The crash was the second deadliest aircraft accident involving a Boeing C-97G Stratofreighter.[4]
