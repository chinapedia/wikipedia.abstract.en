TALKING SHIT is a term and type of trash-talk that refers to various types of derogatory language[1] aimed at an individual or any type of entity, such as a group or organisation. Talking shit can be used as a tactic in fighting or brawling, used to draw attention to the matter among onlookers.[2] This is a term that has been coined more recently and is used in reference when someone talks negatively or spreads false ideas about another person, concept, organisation, or entity. The same term can also be used to describe something spoken which is not true, uninteresting or irrelevant. It may be a contraction of Talking Bullshit.
