Blodbadstavlan.jpg The STOCKHOLM BLOODBATH (Swedish: STOCKHOLMS BLODBAD, Danish: DET STOCKHOLMSKE BLODBAD) was a trial that led to a series of executions in Stockholm between 7 and 9 November 1520. The events were initiated directly after the coronation of Christian II (who after the bloodbath became known in Sweden as _Kristian Tyrann_, 'Christian the Tyrant')[1]) as the new king of Sweden, after the guests on the crowning party were invited to a meeting at the castle. Archbishop Gustav Trolle demanding economic compensation for things such as the demolition of Almarest√§ket's fortress led to the question whether the former Swedish regent Sten Sture the Younger and his supporters had been guilty of heresy. Supported by canon law, nearly 100 persons[2] were executed in the days following the meeting. Among the executed, there were many people from the aristocracy that had been supporting the _Sture Party_ in the previous years.
