COMMON DESCENT describes how, in evolutionary biology, a group of organisms share a most recent common ancestor. There is massive[1] evidence of common descent of all life on Earth from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).[2][3] In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the LUCA by comparing the genomes of the three domains of life, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.[4]
