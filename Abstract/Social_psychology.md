SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence of others.[1] In this definition, _scientific_ refers to the empirical investigation using the scientific method. The terms _thoughts_, _feelings_ and _behavior_ refer to psychological variables that can be measured in humans. The statement that others' presence may be _imagined_ or _implied_ suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television, looking at reality shows, music videos and movies they can be influenced to follow the behaviour in the visual setting or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and social situations.
