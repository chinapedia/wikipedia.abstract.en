'''Chihuahua ''' or CHEWAWA, by the Apache also known as KLA-ESH or TŁÁ'Í'EZ ("To push something under something else with your foot") (about 1822/1825 – 25 July 1901) was chief of the Chokonen local group of the Tsokanende Band of Chiricahua Apache who carried out several raids on settlers in Arizona in the 1870s and 1880s. His elder brother Ulzana (ca. 1821 - 1909), who would later became known as leader of a very famous raid through New Mexico and Arizona in 1885, was his war chief (segundo).
