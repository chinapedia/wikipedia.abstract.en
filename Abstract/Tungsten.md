TUNGSTEN, or WOLFRAM,[1][2] is a chemical element with the symbol W and atomic number 74. The name _tungsten_ comes from the former Swedish name for the tungstate mineral _scheelite_, _tung sten_ or "heavy stone".[3] Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively combined with other elements in chemical compounds rather than alone. It was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite.
