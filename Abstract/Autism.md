AUTISM is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[1] Parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child's life.[2][3] These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace before worsening.[4]
