The BETAB-500 () or the BETAB-500 CONCRETE-PIERCING BOMB is a Soviet and Russian bomb designed to penetrate and destroy reinforced concrete structures and to damage runways. During the Syrian civil war, the Russian military has used it repeatedly. In 2016, apparently the first use of this bomb in an urban environment occurred in the Eastern part of the city of Aleppo.[1]
