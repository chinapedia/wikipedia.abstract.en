GAY ALLIANCE OF STUDENTS V. MATTHEWS, 544 F.2d 162 (1976) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit case in which a student at Virginia Commonwealth University sued Alfred T. Matthews, Dean of Student Life and Wyndham B. Blanton, Jr., member of Board of Visitors for recognition and access to university resources as a student organization. Upon application, VCU rejected a group of students' request to practice as an official student group at the university on the basis of the groups advocacy for gay rights and liberation. Two years after the rejection, the 4th District ruled for VCU to reverse their decision and grant the Gay Alliance of Students (GAS) the same rights as registered student organizations at the university are granted.
