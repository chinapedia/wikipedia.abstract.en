PASSOVER or PESACH (;[1] Hebrew: __/ _Peḏaḥ_) is a major Jewish holiday and one of the most widely celebrated Jewish holidays. Together with Shavuot and Sukkot, Passover was one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (_Shalosh Regalim_) during which the entire population of the kingdom of Judah made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem.[2] Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, but only men participate in public worship.[3][4]
