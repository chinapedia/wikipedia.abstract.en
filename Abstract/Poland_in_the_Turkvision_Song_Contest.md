The participation of POLAND IN THE TURKVISION SONG CONTEST was expected to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Turkvision Song Contest 2016. The national broadcaster responsible for the selection process of Poland's participants has yet to be known. Poland had selected Olga Shimanskaya with her song "Masal gibi bu d√ºnya", as their debut entry. However, the 2016 contest was subsequently cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings. Poland confirmed on 28 February 2017 that they will make their debut at the Turkvision Song Contest 2017, with the same representative they had selected for the 2016 edition.
