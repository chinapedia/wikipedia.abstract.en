The UK REGISTER OF LEARNING PROVIDERS (UKRLP) is a website that collects and disseminates information about schools in the United Kingdom. Registration with the site allows a school to share and update its information with organisations such as the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Higher Education Statistics Agency, and the Skills Funding Agency. Information on the site can also be accessed by members of the public.[1] The registry was created on 1 August 2005, and lists over 30,000 learning providers. Registration is free.[2]
