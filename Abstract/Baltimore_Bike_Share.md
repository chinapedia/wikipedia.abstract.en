BALTIMORE BIKE SHARE (also referred to as BMORE BIKESHARE) was a bicycle sharing system that serves the city of Baltimore, Maryland. The system had more than 50 stations, all owned by the Baltimore City government, and operated in a public-private partnership with Bewegen Technologies and Corps Logistics.[1] Launched in 2016, Baltimore Bike Share had the largest electrical-assisted cycling (Pedelec) fleet in North America.[2][3]
