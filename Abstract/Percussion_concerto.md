A PERCUSSION CONCERTO is a type of musical composition for a percussion soloist and a large ensemble, such as a concert band or orchestra. Two notable figures in the genre are the percussionists Colin Currie and Evelyn Glennie, who have separately commissioned and premiered numerous entrees to the repertoire.[1][2] Two common subsets of the percussion concerto are the timpani concerto and the marimba concerto.
