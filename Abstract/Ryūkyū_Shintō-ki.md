Ryukyu_Shintoki_by_Taichu_(Taichu-an_Kyoto).jpg)[1][2]]] or _An account of the ways of the gods in Ryūkyū_ is a five-volume treatise of c. 1605/6 by the Jōdo-sect Japanese priest (1552–1639), who lived in Naha from 1603 to 1606. Unlike most Okinawan literature, it predates the Satsuma invasion of 1609. A woodblock print edition was published in Kyoto in 1648.[3][4][5]
