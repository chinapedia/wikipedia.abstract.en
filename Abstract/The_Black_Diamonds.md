THE BLACK DIAMONDS were an Australian garage rock and band from Lithgow, New South Wales, who were active under different names from 1959 to 1971. They became one of the most popular groups in their region of New South Wales and signed with Festival Records, where they recorded two singles. They have particularly become regarded for the song "I Want, Need, Love You" which appeared on the B-side of their first single. It featured a desperate vocal over a pounding rhythm section, along with Alan Oloman's fast guitar breaks, and became a regional hit. The band toured with several top name acts such as the Easybeats. In 1967, their second single became a hit in the Sydney area. In 1968 the group changed their name to TYMEPIECE and evolved into a more eclectic and progressive act, releasing a version of the Tokens' "Lion Sleeps Tonight" and an album, _Sweet Release_, in 1971. They broke up later that year.
