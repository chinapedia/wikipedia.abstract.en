Persian_Scholar_pavilion_in_Viena_UN_(Rhazes&Khayyam).jpg PERSIAN SCHOLARS PAVILION (Persian: چهارطاقی دانشمندان ایرانی) is a monument donated by Iran (Persia) to the United Nations Office at Vienna. The monument architecture is a combination of Islamic architecture and Persian Achaemenid architecture,[1] although the latter clearly predominates in the decorative features, with Persian columns and other features from Persepolis and other remains from the Achaemenid dynasty. The Chahartaq pavilion form runs through the architecture of Persia from pre-Islamic times to the present.
