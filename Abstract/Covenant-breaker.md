COVENANT-BREAKER is a term used by Bahá'ís to refer to a person who has been excommunicated from the Bahá'í community for the act of COVENANT-BREAKING, roughly defined as active opposition to the Bahá'í Faith from a current member. According to Bahá'í law, only the head of the religion, currently the Universal House of Justice, has the authority to declare a person a covenant-breaker.
