WEST INDIES B was a first-class cricket team that participated in the West Indian domestic competition from the 2000–01 season to the 2003–04 season. It was selected by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) from players who had been unable to secure a contract with one of the six existing regional teams, and was restricted to players under the age of 23 (with a few exceptions). West Indies B had little on-field success during its time in the competition (although a number of future internationals spent time in its squad), and the team was disbanded prior to the 2004–05 season after a wider reorganisation of domestic cricket in the region.
