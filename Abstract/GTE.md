GTE CORPORATION, formerly GENERAL TELEPHONE & ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (1955â€“1982),[1] was the largest independent telephone company in the United States during the days of the Bell System. The company operated from 1926, with roots tracing further back than that, until 2000, when it was acquired by Bell Atlantic; the combined company took the name Verizon.
