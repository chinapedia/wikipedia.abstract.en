GROK is a neologism coined by American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel _Stranger in a Strange Land_. While the _Oxford English Dictionary_ summarizes the meaning of _grok_ as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment",[1] Heinlein's concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that "the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term".[2] The concept of _grok_ garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities as diverse as polyamory (in particular the Church of All Worlds) and computer science.
