3Α-ETIOCHOLANEDIOL, or simply ETIOCHOLANEDIOL, also known as 3Α,5Β-ANDROSTANEDIOL or as ETIOCHOLANE-3Α,17Β-DIOL, is a naturally occurring etiocholane (5β-androstane) steroid and an endogenous metabolite of testosterone. It is formed from 5β-dihydrotestosterone (after 5β-reduction of testosterone) and is further transformed into etiocholanolone.[1]
