Azerbaijan joined the IMF on October 18, 1992[1] with the IMF opening its office in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in the same year.[2] Azerbaijan pays 0.08% of the quotas received by the IMF and holds 0.11% of the total voting power.[3] Since Azerbaijan's induction into the organization, the IMF has implemented several programs in Azerbaijan that foster economic growth and poverty reduction.[4] Between 1995 and 2005, the IMF loaned Azerbaijan $577.3 million in order to provide support for the country's economic reform programs; Azerbaijan was able to fully repay these loans.[5]
