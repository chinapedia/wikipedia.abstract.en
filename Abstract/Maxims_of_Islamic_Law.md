The MAXIMS OF ISLAMIC LAW were established after representatives of all schools of thought regarding Muslim Jurisprudence came together to reach a consensus.[1] Maxims refer to a body of abstract rules that were produced after a detailed study of the fiqh. Theyâ€™re theoretical guidelines corresponding to different areas of fiqh, which may be dealing with anything from evidence to matrimonial law.[2] The fiqh is Islamic jurisprudence,through the human interpretation of Islamic law.
