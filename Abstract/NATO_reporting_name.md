NATO REPORTING NAMES are code names for military equipment from Russia, China, and historically, the Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union and other nations of the Warsaw Pact). They provide unambiguous and easily understood English words in a uniform manner in place of the original designations, which either may have been unknown to the Western world at the time or easily confused codes.[1] For example, the Russian bomber jet Tupolev Tu-160 is simply called "Blackjack".
