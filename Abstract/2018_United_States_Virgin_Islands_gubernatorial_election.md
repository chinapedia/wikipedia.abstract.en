The 2018 U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 6, 2018 to select the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands who are chosen on the same ticket. The election was held concurrently with the 2018 United States midterm elections. As no candidate ticket received a majority of the General Election vote, the top two vote-getters proceeded to a runoff 14 days later on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. Democrat Albert Bryan Jr. and his running mate, Sen. Tregenza Roach, won the runoff election.[1]
