The_new_international_encyclopaedia_(1905)_(14595131440).jpg 6-inch_gun_on_model_1900_pedestal_mount.gif The 5-INCH GUN M1897 (127Â mm) and its variant the M1900 were coastal artillery pieces installed to defend major American seaports between 1897 and 1920. For most of their history they were operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. They were installed on balanced pillar (a form of disappearing carriage) or pedestal (aka barbette) mountings; generally the M1897 was on the balanced pillar mounting and the M1900 was on the pedestal mounting.[1] All of these weapons were scrapped within a few years after World War I.
