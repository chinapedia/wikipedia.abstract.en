QT (pronounced "cute"[1][2][3]) is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed. Qt is currently being developed by The Qt Company, a publicly listed company, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and organizations working to advance Qt.[4][5][6] Qt is available under both commercial licenses[7] and open source[8] GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses.[9][10]
