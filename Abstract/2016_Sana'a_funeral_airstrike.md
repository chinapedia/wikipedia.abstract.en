The OCTOBER 2016 SANA'A FUNERAL AIRSTRIKE took place on the afternoon of 8 October 2016 when 155 people were killed and at least 525 more wounded when two airstrikes, about three to eight minutes apart, hit the packed Al Kubra hall in Sana'a, Yemen during a funeral. The attack was the deadliest single bombing in the then-two year long Yemeni civil war.[1] The funeral was being held for the father of former interior minister Jalal al-Rowaishan. Sana'a mayor Abdel Qader Hilal was reportedly among those killed.[2][3] The Saudi-led coalition initially denied responsibility but then took responsibility and put the blame on information given by the Yemeni government.[4][5]
