_THE LIMITS OF STATE ACTION_ (original German title _Ideen zu einem Versuch die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen_) is a philosophical treatise by Wilhelm von Humboldt, which is a major work of the German Enlightenment. Though written in the early 1790s, it was not published in its entirety until 1852, long after von Humboldt's death in 1835. It was a significant source for the ideas that John Stuart Mill popularized in his 1859 book _On Liberty_, and is discussed favorably by Mill in the third chapter of that work, "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being."[1] Mill had access to an 1854 English translation under the title _The Sphere and Duties of Government_.
