NICHE: A GENETICS SURVIVAL GAME is a indie simulation video game developed and published by Stray Fawn Studio, and was released on Steam Early Access for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Linux-based systems on September 15, 2016 after a successful Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign. Its main aim is to breed certain traits or genes into a group of canine or feline creatures to make the pack genetically perfect. The game is highly reminiscent of real life, as natural selection is key to carry on the pack with the perfect genes.
