HAJIME SAKAKI (August 28, 1856 â€“ February 6, 1897) was a Japanese physician and the first professor of psychiatry in that country. Though he was a proponent of biological psychiatry, Sakaki ran a Tokyo insane asylum and he made early attempts to introduce work therapy for confined psychiatric patients. Using field work and his study of patients in the asylum, Sakaki created a classification and diagnosis system for psychiatric disorders.
