Villa_at_Convent_of_the_Good_Shepherd.jpg The CONVENT OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD was a reformatory for girls in East Finchley, London. The order moved to East End house in 1864, and in 1873 the building became a reformatory for former female prisoners. The convent was largely destroyed in a fire in 1972 and the grounds were redeveloped into Bishop Douglas School in 1963 and the Thomas More Estate in 1980.[1]
