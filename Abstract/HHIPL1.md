HHIP-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (HHIPL1), also known as HHIP2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the _HHIPL1_ gene on chromosome 14.[1] It is not significantly expressed in many tissues and cell types,[2] though HHIPL1 mRNA has been detected in trabecular bone cells.[3] Little is known about the precise biological function of HHIPL1, but the protein has been linked to adenomas.[4] The _HHIPL1_ gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.[5]
