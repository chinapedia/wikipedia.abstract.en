PURWOTO GANDASUBRATA was the eighth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia. Alongside the Ministry of Justice officials in the Sixth Development Cabinet, Gandasubrata was a part of a general return of civilian officials to the judiciary of Indonesia in the early 1990s after a period of former military officials dominating the branch from the late 1970s.[1] Gandasubrata had initially served as the chief of the district court of Semarang, as well as the chairman of the regional branch of the Indonesian Judges Association.[2]
