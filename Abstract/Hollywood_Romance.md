"HOLLYWOOD ROMANCE" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and David Jordan.[1][2] It was released as a single on Polydor Records on 20 October 1978 in a picture sleeve,[3][4] almost six years to the day after the release of their last hit collaboration "Getting a Drag",[5] and it was play-listed on BBC Radio 1.[6] The record label for this single was unusual in that it was printed in silver instead of the usual Polydor red label.[7] In Japan, it was released in February 1979 in the same picture sleeve cover with the title in Japanese added, plus the lyrics were included on the back cover.[8] The song name checks a number of classic era Hollywood movies such as _King Kong_, _Last Tango in Paris_, _The African Queen_, _Citizen Kane_ and _Tarzan_, as well as the popular song "Begin the Beguine", written by Cole Porter that Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell danced to in the musical film _Broadway Melody of 1940_.[9] "Hollywood Romance" was influenced by de Paul's move to California in the late 1970s to be with the actor James Coburn. The B-side to the "Hollywood Romance" single was a blues song that de Paul co-wrote with Coburn, entitled "Losin' The Blues For You".[10][11] Polydor hosted a launch party in London to celebrate the release of "Hollywood Romance" in a Hollywood style setting complete with Busby Berkeley film clips.[12] The single garnered good reviews with UK music weekly, _Record Mirror_ writing "De Paul is set for a comeback ...with this real eye opener".[13] It was playlisted by BBC radio 1 and also was played on Singapore's FM radio station.[14]
