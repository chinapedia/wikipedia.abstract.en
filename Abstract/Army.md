An ARMY (from Latin _arma_ "arms, weapons" via Old French _arm√©e_, "armed" [feminine]) or LAND FORCE is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. In certain states, the term army refers to the entire armed forces (e.g., People's Liberation Army). Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army.
