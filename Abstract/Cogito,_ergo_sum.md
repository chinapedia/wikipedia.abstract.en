is a Latin philosophical proposition by René Descartes usually translated into English as "I THINK, THEREFORE I AM". The phrase originally appeared in French as , ''' in his _Discourse on the Method_, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.[1] It appeared in Latin in his later _Principles of Philosophy_. As Descartes explained, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt...." A fuller version, articulated by Antoine Léonard Thomas, aptly captures Descartes's intent: ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am"). The concept is also sometimes known as THE COGITO.[2]
