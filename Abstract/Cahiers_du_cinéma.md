_CAHIERS DU CINÉMA_ (, _Notebooks on Cinema_) is a French film magazine founded in 1951 by André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca.[1][2] It developed from the earlier magazine _Revue du Cinéma_ (_Review of the Cinema_ established in 1928) involving members of two Paris film clubs—_Objectif 49_ (_Objective 49_) (Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, and Alexandre Astruc, among others) and _Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin_ (_Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter_).
