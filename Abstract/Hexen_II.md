_HEXEN II_ is a dark fantasy first-person shooter (FPS) video game developed by Raven Software from 1996 to 1997, then published by id Software and distributed by Activision. It was the third game in the _Hexen_/_Heretic_ series, and the last in the Serpent Riders trilogy. It was later made available on Steam on August 3, 2007.[1] Using a modified _Quake_ engine, it featured single-player and multiplayer game modes, as well as four character classes to choose from, each with different abilities. These included the "offensive" Paladin, the "defensive" Crusader, the spell-casting Necromancer, and the stealthy Assassin.
