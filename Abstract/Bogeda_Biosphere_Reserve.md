The BOGEDA BIOSPHERE RESERVE is located in the eastern region of the Tianshan Mountains in China's Xinjiang Province. Local residents named the area the Sangong River Valley after one of the largest rivers in this region, which originates from Bogeda Peak. Altogether, five major landscapes are distributed throughout the northern and southern areas of the biosphere reserve: ice-snow belts (5,445–3,100 meters above sea level), alpine and sub-alpine meadow belts (3,100–2,500 meters asl), forest belts (2,500–1,600 meters asl), steppe belts (1,700–900 meters asl) and sand desert dunes (460–3,300 meters asl). The topography consists of a middle mountain belt, low mountain erosion hills and alluvial areas. Tianchi Lake is the only natural lake in the region and lies adjacent to the Sangong River.
