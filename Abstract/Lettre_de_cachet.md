Lettre_de_cachet_(1703).jpg), opening _De par le roy_ ("In the name of the King...")]] _LETTRES DE CACHET_ (, lit. "letters of the sign/signet") were letters signed by the king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed with the royal seal, or _cachet_. They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be appealed.
