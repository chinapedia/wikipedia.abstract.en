Conjugation.svg A PILUS (Latin for 'hair'; plural: _pili_) is a hair-like appendage found on the surface of many bacteria and archaea.[1] The terms _pilus_ and _fimbria_ (Latin for 'fringe'; plural: _fimbriae_) can be used interchangeably, although some researchers reserve the term _pilus_ for the appendage required for bacterial conjugation. All pili in the latter sense are primarily composed of pilin proteins, which are oligomeric.
