_THOR BATTERING THE MIDGARD SERPENT_ is a 1790 painting by the Swiss artist Henry Fuseli. It depicts one of the most popular myths in Germanic mythology, Thor's fishing trip, which was known to Fuseli through P. H. Mallet's 1755 book _Introduction à l'histoire du Dannemarc_, translated to English by Thomas Percy in 1770 as _Northern Antiquities_.[1] The nude and muscular Thor stands in Hymir's boat with the Jörmungandr on his fish hook.
