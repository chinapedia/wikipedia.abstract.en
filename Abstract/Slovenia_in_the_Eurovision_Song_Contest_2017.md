SLOVENIA participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 with the song "On My Way" written by Omar Naber. The song was performed by Omar Naber, who had previously represented Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005 where he failed to qualify to the final with the song "Stop". Slovenian broadcaster Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija) organised the national selection _EMA 2017_ in order to select the Slovenian entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine. After a two-week-long competition consisting of two semi-finals, and a final, "On My Way" performed by Omar Naber emerged as the winner after achieving the highest score following the combination of votes from a regional jury vote from six regions in Slovenia and a public vote.
