The GDNA () was the signals intelligence agency of the Wehrmacht, before and during World War II. It was the successor to the former cipher bureau known as INSPECTORATE 7/VI in operation between 1940 and 1942, when it was further reorganised into the HEADQUARTERS FOR SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE () (abbr. LNA) between 1942 and 1944, until it was finally reorganised in October 1944 into the GdNA.[1][2] The agency was also known at the OKH/Gend Na, GendNa or Inspectorate 7 or more commonly OKH/GDNA. _Inspectorate 7/VI_ was also known as IN 7 or IN/7 or IN 7/VI and also OKH/CHI.
