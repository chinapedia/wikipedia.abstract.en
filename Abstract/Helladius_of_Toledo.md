Limosnadesaneladiocategg1.jpg (Cloister of Toledo Cathedral).]] HELLADIUS, ELADIO or ELLADIO OF TOLEDO (died 633, Toledo) was a Christian archbishop. Born into a Visigothic noble family in Spain, he initially held important positions at court but was attracted to the monastic life and took his vows at the Agali monastery. He became its abbot and later archbishop of Toledo. The Roman Martyrology gives his feast as 18 February.[1]
