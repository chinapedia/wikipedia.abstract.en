GERARD DAVID (c. 1460 â€“ 13 August 1523) was an Early Netherlandish painter and manuscript illuminator known for his brilliant use of color. Only a bare outline of his life survives, although some facts are known. He may have been the MEESTER GHERAET VAN BRUGGHE who became a master of the Antwerp guild in 1515. He was very successful in his lifetime and probably ran two workshops, in Antwerp and Bruges.[1] Like many painters of his period, his reputation diminished in the 17th century until he was rediscovered in the 19th century.
