(; ) is the name of a renowned sage in hinduism who is thought to be the author of a number of Sanskrit works. The greatest of these is the Yoga Sutra, which is the source of modern day yoga. There is doubt as to whether the sage Pata√±jali is the author of all the works attributed to him as there are a number of known historical authors of the same name. A great deal of scholarship has been devoted over the last century to the issue of the historicity or identity of this author or these authors.[1]
