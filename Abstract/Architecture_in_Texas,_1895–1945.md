'' ARCHITECTURE IN TEXAS, 1895â€“1945'' is a 1993 book written by Jay C. Henry and published by the University of Texas Press. Kenneth Breisch of the _Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians_ described the book as "a thorough analysis of building styles in the state from 1895 to 1945."[1] It was the first comprehensive study of Texas architecture of that period.[2] The author's thesis, stated on page one of the book, was that this period of architecture represented "a large cross section of America in microcosm".[3] According to Joseph L. Aranha of Texas Tech University the book also serves as a "an encyclopedia of the works of Texas architects" and a "a catalog of significant buildings and architectural styles in Texas".[4]
