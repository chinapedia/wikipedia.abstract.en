The 2017 GREEN BAY PACKERS SEASON was the franchise 's 99th season overall, 97th season in the National Football League, and the 12th under head coach Mike McCarthy. After reaching the NFC Championship Game in the previous season, the Packers failed to improve a 10–6 record from 2016 and were eliminated from postseason contention after Week 15, making this the first time since 2008 that they failed to make the playoffs. After a 4-1 start, the Packers lost starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers to a collarbone injury during the week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, and went on to lose 8 of the 11 remaining games. A loss to the Lions in week 17 secured the Packers’ first losing season since 2008.
