The ESPORTS ARENA is an indoor arena that hosts Esports viewing events, in Santa Ana, California, as well as the name of several affiliated arenas around the world. The original building, specifically intended to host esports tournaments and events, was founded in 2015 and holds a capacity of 1,400. For a monthly membership fee, amateur gamers are able to practice and "mingle" at the location. More Esports Arena venues have since been established worldwide, partially funded by the Chinese sports and video game company partnership ALLIED ESPORTS.
