The BATTLE OF SALAMANCA took place between 9 and 10 March 1858, in Salamanca (near Guanajuato, Mexico), during the War of Reform. Elements of the liberal army, under General Anastasio Parrodi, fought Generals Leandro Valle, Santos Degollado, and Mariano Moret, and conservative elements of the army commanded by General Luis G. Osollo. Osollo's army had some 5,000 men, including Generals Miguel Miram√≥n and Tomas Mejia Francisco Garcia Casanova. The victory corresponded to the conservative side, and was the first major liberal defeat.
