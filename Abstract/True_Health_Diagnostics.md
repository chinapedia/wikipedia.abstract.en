TRUE HEALTH DIAGNOSTICS was founded by Chris Grottenthaler in March 2014 in Frisco, Texas, as a clinical laboratory company to sell medical tests and develop new ones for various chronic conditions; Grottenthaler had formerly worked in private equity. True Health hired several sales representatives who had worked for BlueWave, a contract sales organization.[1] The BlueWave employees included Robert Bradford Johnson, who had founded BlueWave, and Jeffrey Cornwell.[2] True Health was CLIA certified in Texas in August 2014[3] and offered its first tests in October of that year.[4]
