The MOTOROLA 6809 ("_sixty-eight-oh-nine_") is an 8-bit microprocessor CPU with some 16-bit features from Motorola. It was designed by Terry Ritter and Joel Boney and introduced in 1978. It was a major advance over both its predecessor, the Motorola 6800, and the related MOS Technology 6502. Among the systems to use the 6809 are the Dragon home computers, TRS-80 Color Computer, the Vectrex home console, and early 1980s arcade machines including _Defender_, _Robotron: 2084_, _Joust_, and _Gyruss_. More modern systems that utilize a synthesized 6809 core (HDL) are the CoCo3FPGA, Matchbox CoCo, CoCoDEV and Multicomp.
