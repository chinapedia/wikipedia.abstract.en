The POSITRON or ANTIELECTRON is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1Â _e_, a spin of 1/2 (same as electron), and has the same mass as an electron. When a positron collides with an electron, annihilation occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies, it results in the production of two or more gamma ray photons.
