DERRY, officially LONDONDERRY (),[1] is the second-largest city in Northern Ireland[2][3] and the fourth-largest city on the island of Ireland.[4] The name Derry is an anglicisation of the Old Irish name _Daire_ (modern Irish: _Doire_) meaning "oak grove".[5][6] In 1613, the city was granted a Royal Charter by King James I and gained the "London" prefix to reflect the funding of its construction by the London guilds. While the city is more usually known colloquially as Derry,[7][8] Londonderry is also commonly used and remains the legal name.
