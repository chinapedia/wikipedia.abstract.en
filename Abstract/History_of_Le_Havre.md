Le Havre was founded on 8 October 1517 as a new port by royal command of François I partly to replace the historic harbours of Harfleur and Honfleur which had become increasingly impractical due to silting-up. The city was originally named _Franciscopolis_ after the king, and was subsequently renamed LE HAVRE-DE-GRÂCE ("Harbour of Grace") after an existing chapel of _Notre-Dame-de-Grâce_ ("our Lady of Grace"). The name of the American city of Havre de Grace, Maryland, is inspired by this name.
