NICOLAS LÉONARD SADI CARNOT (; 1 June 1796 – 24 August 1832) was a French military scientist and physicist, often described as the "father of thermodynamics". Like Copernicus, he published only one book, the _Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire_ (Paris, 1824), in which he expressed, at the age of 27 years, the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines. In this work he laid the foundations of an entirely new discipline, thermodynamics. Carnot's work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy.
