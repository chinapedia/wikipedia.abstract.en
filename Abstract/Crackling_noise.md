Fire_Ring.jpg CRACKLING NOISE arises when a system is subject to an external force and it responds via events that appear very similar at many different scales. In a classical system there are usually two states, on and off. However, sometimes a state can exist in between. There are three main categories this noise can be sorted into: the first is _popping_ where events at very similar magnitude occur continuously and randomly, e.g. popcorn; the second is _snapping_ where there is little change in the system until a critical threshold is surpassed, at which point the whole system flips from one state to another, i.e. snapping a pencil; the third is _crackling_ which is a combination of popping and snapping, where there are some small and some large events with a relation law predicting their occurrences, referred to as universality.[1] Crackling can be observed in many natural phenomena, e.g. crumpling paper,[2] fire, occurrences of earthquakes and the magnetisation of magnets.
