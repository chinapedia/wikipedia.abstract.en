ANNA MARY HAWTHORN KITSON CLARK, (14 May 1905 â€“ 1 February 2005), married name MARY CHITTY, was an English archaeologist, curator, and independent scholar. She specialised in the archaeology of Romano-British Northern England but was also involved in excavations outside the United Kingdom and the Roman period. Her 1935 work, _A Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire_, "remains one of the starting points for any study of the Romans in the north of England".[1]
