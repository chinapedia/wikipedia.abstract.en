He was very influential[4] and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy.[5] In 1906 he became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature[6] "not only in consideration of his deep learning and critical research, but above all as a tribute to the creative energy, freshness of style, and lyrical force which characterize his poetic masterpieces".[7]
