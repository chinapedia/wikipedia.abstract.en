_CEIBA PENTANDRA_ is a tropical tree of the order Malvales and the family Malvaceae (previously separated in the family Bombacaceae), native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, northern South America, and (as the variety _C. pentandra_ var. _guineensis_) to tropical west Africa. A somewhat smaller variety is found throughout southern Asia and the East Indies. KAPOK is a name used in English speaking countries for both the tree and the cotton-like fluff obtained from its seed pods. In Spanish speaking countries the tree is commonly known as "ceiba". The tree is cultivated for the seed fibre, particularly in south-east Asia, and is also known as the JAVA COTTON, JAVA KAPOK, SILK-COTTON, SAMAUMA, or CEIBA.
