Publisher-_American_Encaustic_Tiling_Co.,_Ltd._(19894608856).jpg Illustration_Page_(19666928325).jpg Encaustic_Tile_MET_DP252087.jpg The AMERICAN ENCAUSTIC TILING COMPANY[1] was founded in Zanesville, Ohio in 1875.[2] Their tiles were intended to compete with the English tiles that were selling in the United States for use in fireplaces and other architectural locations. The first glazed tiles were made in 1880 and embossed tiles were made in 1881. By 1890, they were the largest tile company in the world and the small town of Zanesville nearly tripled in size over a thirty year period as more people found work with the company.[3] The firm closed in 1935 and was then reopened in 1937 as the Shawnee Pottery.[4] [5]
