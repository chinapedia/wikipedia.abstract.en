The TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CREATIVE INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED (CREATIVETT), established by The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago through the Ministry of Trade and Industry in 2013, is a wholly owned State enterprise with the mandate ‘to stimulate and facilitate the business development and export activities of the creative industries in Trinidad and Tobago to generate national wealth.’ CreativeTT is therefore responsible for the strategic and business development of the three (3) niche areas and subsectors under its purview- film, fashion and music. As a result, CreativeTT is known as the parent company of three subsidiary companies for the three subsectors. They are Trinidad and Tobago Music Company Limited (MusicTT), Trinidad and Tobago Film Company Limited (FilmTT) and Trinidad and Tobago Fashion Company Limited (FashionTT).[1]
