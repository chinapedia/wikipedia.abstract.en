KOLKATA CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL, held annually during the month of December in Kolkata on Park Street, Kolkata, is one of the largest dedicated Christmas carnivals in India. The themed lighting starts from St Xavier’s College and ends at Jawaharlal Nehru Road. This has been extended in recent years at both ends - up to the Mullick Bazar crossing on Park Street and up to St Paul’s Cathedral on Cathedral Road, an offshoot of Jawaharlal Nehru Road. Another offshoot of celebrations and lighting has been extended till Vardaan Market on Camac Street. This themed lighting is designed by artisans from the nearby town of Chandannagar.
