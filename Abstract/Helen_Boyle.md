ALICE HELEN ANNE BOYLE (1869 â€“ November 1957)[1] was an Irish-British physician and psychologist.[2] She was Brighton's first female general practitioner, and the first female president of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association (now the Royal College of Psychiatrists). Boyle had a passion for helping women with mental illness in poverty and used this to begin an era of proper treatment for mental disorders.
