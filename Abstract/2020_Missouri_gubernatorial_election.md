The 2020 MISSOURI GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the Governor of Missouri, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican Governor Mike Parson is eligible to run for a full term in office, but has not yet declared whether he will do so.[1] Parson was elected as Lieutenant Governor in 2016, but became Governor on June 1, 2018 after incumbent Eric Greitens resigned under threat of impeachment by the legislature. Greitens was facing allegations regarding campaign finance law violations, and was accused of blackmail stemming from an extramarital affair he had admitted to.
