NEGLIGENCE (Lat. _negligentia_)[1] is a failure to exercise appropriate and or ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.[2] The area of tort law known as _negligence_ involves harm caused by failing to act as a form of _carelessness_ possibly with extenuating circumstances. The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people or property.[3]
