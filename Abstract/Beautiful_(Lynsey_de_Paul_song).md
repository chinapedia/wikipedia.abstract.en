"BEAUTIFUL" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul.[1] It first appeared as the B-side to her 1977 single "You Give Me Those Feelings" on the Polydor record label and reflected her real life philosophy that all forms of life are beautiful, including household flies.[2] This recording was co-produced by de Paul and Jon Kelly.[3] An extended and reworked version of the song with snatches of songs from de Paul's 1979 _Tigers and Fireflies_ album as a reprise that was produced by Rupert Holmes, was featured as the last track on this album.[4] The latter version of the song was finally released on CD on Lynsey's 2013 double CD anthology _Into My Music_[5], whereas the original version has yet to be released on CD.
