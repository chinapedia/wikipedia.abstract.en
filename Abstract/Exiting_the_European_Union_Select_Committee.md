The EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION SELECT COMMITTEE is one of a number of select committees of the British House of Commons, which scrutinises the work of the Department for Exiting the European Union. The Department was launched by Prime Minister Theresa May in July 2016, following the 'Leave' vote in the UK's referendum on membership of the European Union.[1]
