11S GLOBULIN FAMILY is a family of globulin proteins chiefly found in seeds of legumes (legumin-like),[1] along with 7S family, often found in a protein fraction within an protein isolate. They are used as storage of important nutrients for plant growth, and therefore hardy enough to pass through the human digestive system unscathed. One common example of an 11S globulin includes glycinin derived from soy.
