3D sound refers to the way humans experience sound in their everyday lives. In real life, people are always surrounded by sound. Sounds arrive at our ears from every direction and from varying distances. These and other factors contribute to the three-dimensional aural image humans hear. Scientists and engineers who work with 3D sound work to accurately synthesize the complexity of real-world sounds.
