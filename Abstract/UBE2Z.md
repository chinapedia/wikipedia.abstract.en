UBIQUITIN CONJUGATING ENZYME E2 Z (UBE2Z), also known as UBA6-specific E2 enzyme 1 (USE1), is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the _UBE2Z_ gene on chromosome 17.[1][2] It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types.[3] UBE2Z is an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and participates in the second step of protein ubiquitination during proteolysis.[4] A genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed the UBE2Z gene to be associated with chronic kidney disease.[5] The _UBE2Z_ gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.[6]
