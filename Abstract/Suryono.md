SURYONO, also spelled _Soerjono_, was the ninth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia.[1] The reputation of the Supreme Court among legal scholars suffered under his tenure due to Suryono's tendency to reverse seemingly final decisions via what were derisively termed "magic memos,"[2] and he was generally regarded as a candidate who would maintain the Supreme Court's subordination to the executive branch.[3] He overturned an administrative court ruling that had lifted a New Order-era ban on Tempo, a popular political commentary magazine.[4][5]
