A MACROBIOTIC DIET (or MACROBIOTICS) is a pescetarian diet (sometimes vegetarian or vegan) fixed on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism.[1][2] The diet attempts to balance the supposed yin and yang elements of food and cookware.[3][4] Major principles of macrobiotic diets are to reduce animal products, eat locally grown foods that are in season, and consume meals in moderation.[5]
