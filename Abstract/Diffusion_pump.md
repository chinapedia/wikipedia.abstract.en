M6_Diffusion_Pump.jpg DIFFUSION PUMPS use a high speed jet of vapor to direct gas molecules in the pump throat down into the bottom of the pump and out the exhaust. Invented in 1915 by Wolfgang Gaede[1] using mercury vapor, and improved by Irving Langmuir and W. Crawford, they were the first type of high vacuum pumps operating in the regime of free molecular flow, where the movement of the gas molecules can be better understood as diffusion than by conventional fluid dynamics. Gaede used the name _diffusion pump_ since his design was based on the finding that gas cannot diffuse against the vapor stream, but will be carried with it to the exhaust.[2] However, the principle of operation might be more precisely described as GAS-JET PUMP, since diffusion plays a role also in other high vacuum pumps. In modern textbooks, the diffusion pump is categorized as a momentum transfer pump.
