TRS_ballot_papers.svg The TWO-ROUND SYSTEM (also known as the SECOND BALLOT, RUNOFF VOTING or BALLOTAGE) is a voting method used to elect a single winner, where the voter casts a single vote for their chosen candidate. However, if no candidate receives the required number of votes, then those candidates having less than a certain proportion of the votes, or all but the two candidates receiving the most votes, are eliminated, and a second round of voting is held.
