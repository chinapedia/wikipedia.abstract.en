TYPOMETRY in archaeology is the measurement and analysis of artifacts by various methods with metric measurements including length, width, surface area, cutting planes, hafting axis and others.[1] Typometric data is taken along with other criteria including typological, functional, and stylistic criteria, in examination of archaeological finds.[2] The use of computers and mathematics in archaeology, and in particular of automated statistical analysis, have participated in the development of this field.[3] In 1953, Albert Spaulding published the first statistical method for typometry.[4]
