The PARSEC (symbol: PC) is a unit of length used to measure large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System. A parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond,[1] which corresponds to astronomical units. One parsec is equal to about 3.26Â light-years or 31 trillion kilometres () or 19 trillion miles (). The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about from the Sun.[2] Most of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the Sun.
