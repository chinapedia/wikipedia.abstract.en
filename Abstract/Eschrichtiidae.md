ESCHRICHTIIDAE or the GRAY WHALES is a family of baleen whale (suborder Mysticeti) with a single extant species, the gray whale (_Eschrichtius robustus_). The family, however, also includes three described fossil genera: _Archaeschrichtius_ and _Eschrichtioides_ from the Miocene and Pliocene of Italy respectively,[1] and _Gricetoides_ from the Pliocene of North Carolina.[2] The names of the extant genus and the family honours Danish zoologist Daniel Eschricht.[3]
