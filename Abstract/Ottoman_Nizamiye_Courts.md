Beginning in the latter half of the 19th century, the Nizamiye Courts (also written _Nizami_) were a secular court system introduced within the Ottoman Empire during the Tanzimat era.[1][2] This court system was administered under the Ottoman Ministry of Justice.[3] Although secular, the Mecelle (the Ottoman version of codified Sharia) was eventually applied to the courts. This court system drew much influence from French models at the time.[4][5] These courts enabled the further growth of legal pluralism within Ottoman jurisprudence.[6]
