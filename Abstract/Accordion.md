accordionist Dominguinhos|alt=|274x274px]] ACCORDIONS (from 19th-century German _Akkordeon_, from _Akkord_—"musical chord, concord of sounds")[1] are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an _accordionist_. The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family.
