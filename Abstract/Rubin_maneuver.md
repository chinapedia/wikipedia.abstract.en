RUBIN MANEUVER, also known as REVERSE WOODS MANEUVER, is a secondary, rotational maneuver to deliver the baby in case of shoulder dystocia.[1] The first Rubin maneuver is the rotation of anterior shoulder under pubic symphysis by giving suprapubic pressure. As a result, the bisacromial diameter is rotated from anteroposterior to oblique lie. The obstetrician uses the right hand for performing this maneuver if the foetus is facing mother's right side, and vice versa. During first Rubin maneuver, fundal pressure should not be applied because it may cause uterine rupture or further impaction of the shoulder. If the first Rubin maneuver does not disengage the shoulder, second Rubin maneuver is performed.
