He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, _One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_ (1962), in the periodical _Novy Mir_. After this he had to publish in the West, most notably _Cancer Ward_ (1968), _August 1914_ (1971), and _The Gulag Archipelago_ (1973). Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature "for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature".[6] Solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to Stockholm to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter. He was eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1994 after the state's dissolution.
