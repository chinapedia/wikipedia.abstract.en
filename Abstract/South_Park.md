_SOUTH PARK_ is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like _The Simpsons_, _South Park_ uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters. It became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience. Parker and Stone developed the show from _The Spirit of Christmas_, two consecutive animated shorts. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, ultimately leading to _South Park_'s production.
