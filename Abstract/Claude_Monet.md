OSCAR-CLAUDE MONET (; ; 14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926) was a French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting.[1][2] The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting _Impression, soleil levant_ (_Impression, Sunrise_), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.[3]
