The 2017 DETROIT LIONS SEASON was the franchise's 88th season in the National Football League (NFL), their 84th as the Detroit Lions, and their fourth and final under head coach Jim Caldwell. The Lions finished with a 9–7 record, the same record they had in 2016, but unlike the previous year, failed to qualify for the playoffs. After starting the season 3–1, they lost 6 of their next 12 games. They were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention in week 16 following their loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite missing the playoffs, the Lions recorded consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1994–1995. They also won all of their division road games for the first time ever and swept their division rival Green Bay Packers for the first time since 1991. Despite this, Caldwell was dismissed by the Lions after the season, having accumulating a winning record of 36–28 (4-25 against teams that finished with winning records), but no playoff wins, in four seasons.[1] The team also unveiled a new uniform set and logo, which removed the black that had been used a secondary color since 2003, as well an all gray uniform in week 15.
