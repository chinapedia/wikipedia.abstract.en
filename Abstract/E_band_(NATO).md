The NATO E BAND is a designation given to the radio frequencies from 2 000 to 3 000 MHz (equivalent to wavelengths between 15 and 10Â cm) during the cold war period. Since 1992 detailed frequency allocations, allotment and assignments are in line to NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).[1] However, in order to generically identify military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for crises management planning, training, Electronic warfare activities, radar or in military operations, the Nato band system is often used.
