The KARAJARRI are an Indigenous Australian people, who once lived southwest of the Kimberleys in the northern Pilbara, predominantly between the coastal area and the Great Sandy Desert. They now mostly reside at Bidyadanga, south of Broome. To their north lived the Yawuru people, to the east the Mangala, to the northeast the Nyigina, and to their south the Nyangumarta. Further down the coast were the Kariera.
