ABD AL-RAHMAN I, more fully ABD AL-RAHMAN IBN MU'AWIYA IBN HISHAM IBN ABD AL-MALIK IBN MARWAN (731–788)(), was the founder of a Muslim dynasty that ruled the greater part of Iberia for nearly three centuries (including the succeeding Caliphate of Córdoba). Abd al-Rahman was a member of the Umayyad dynasty in Damascus, and his establishment of a government in Iberia represented a break with the Abbasids, who had overthrown the Umayyads in 750.
