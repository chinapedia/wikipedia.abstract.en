The LAKESIDE DEVELOPMENT, or the LAKESIDE HISTORIC DISTRICT, encompasses a historic company-built residential development in southern Burlington, Vermont. Isolated between the Vermont Railway railroad line and Lake Champlain and accessible only via Lakeside Avenue off Pine Street, the area was developed between about 1894 and 1910 by the Queen City Cotton Company, whose mill complex stood just to the east of the railroad line. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[1]
