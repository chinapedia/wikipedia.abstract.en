Circle_radians.gif with the same length as the radius of that circle subtends an _angle_ of 1Â radian. The circumference subtends an angle of 2 radians.]] The RADIAN is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (expansion at ). The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit.[1]
