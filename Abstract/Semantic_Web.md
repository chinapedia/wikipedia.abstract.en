The SEMANTIC WEB is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[1] The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF). According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries".[2] The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content, information applications and systems.
