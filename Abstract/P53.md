TUMOR PROTEIN P53, also known as P53, CELLULAR TUMOR ANTIGEN P53 (UniProt name), PHOSPHOPROTEIN P53, TUMOR SUPPRESSOR P53, ANTIGEN NY-CO-13, or TRANSFORMATION-RELATED PROTEIN 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as _TP53_ (humans) and _Trp53_ (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor.[1] As such, p53 has been described as "the guardian of the genome" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation.[2] Hence _TP53_ is classified as a tumor suppressor gene.[3][4][5][6][7] (_Italics_ are used to denote the _TP53_ gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.)
