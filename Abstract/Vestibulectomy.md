A VESTIBULECTOMY is a gynecological surgical procedure that can be used to treat vulvar pain and specifically in case of vulvodynia and vestibulodynia. Vulvodynia is a chronic pain syndrome. It refers to the severe pain caused in the vulvar area and the causes are usually difficult to diagnose. The symptoms also include burning sensations and feelings of irritation. Buttocks and inner thighs are also affected by vulvodynia. Vestibulodynia is similar to vulvodynia, except that the chronic pain and irritation is present in the vestibule, which is near the entrance of the vagina, while in case of vulvodynia, the pain is localised near the vulva.[1] Vestibulectomy may be partial or complete.[2]
