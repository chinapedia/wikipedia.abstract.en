MARY ANN M'CLINTOCK is best known for her role in the formation of the women's suffrage movement, as well as abolitionism. She was married to Thomas M'Clintock and they were both invested in their Quaker backgrounds, and social reform.[1] Thomas provided for their four daughters and their son by working as a druggist and minister. From the beginning of their marriage in 1820 the lived in Philadelphia until 1836 when they moved to Waterloo, NY.[2][3] By 1833 Marry Ann was very active in the anti-slavery movements in Philadelphia and was one of the founding members of the anti-slavery society. She worked closely with abolitionist Lucretia Mott.[4] Once moved to Waterloo, Mary Ann took a more active role in the women's suffragist movement. Mary Ann had a hand in organizing the Seneca Falls Convention, held in July 1848. She and her daughters Elizabeth and Mary Ann also attended the convention and signed the Declaration of Sentiments.[5][6][7] The base of the convention was to present the Declaration of Sentiments, this document drafted by women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott at the kitchen table of Mary Ann M'Clintock and outlines equal opportunities among men and women.[8][9] The Declaration of Sentiments was modeled after the Declaration of Independence and was the fuel that started the fire that was the suffragist movement which lasted until 1920.[10] However, Mary Ann never got to vote. In 1856 She retired back to Philadelphia and died in 1884 at the age of 84.[11]
