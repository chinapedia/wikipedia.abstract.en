COPYRIGHT is the exclusive and assignable legal right, given to the creator of a literary or artistic work, to reproduce the work, usually for a limited time.[1][2][3][4][5] This right is not absolute but subject to limitations such as fair use. Copyright only protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.[6][7]
