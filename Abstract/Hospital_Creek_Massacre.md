Hospital_Creek,_Gudgenby.tifThe HOSPITAL CREEK MASSACRE refers to a retaliatory mass-slaughter of Indigenous Australians in 1859 in rural New South Wales.[1][2] There are differing accounts of this event, but one alleges that, a white stockman at Walcha Hut (now called Brewarrina), abducted an Aboriginal woman. The stockman was warned by the woman's fellow tribe members to release her. When the stockman refused to release the woman, they were both killed. White settlers retaliated by shooting a large number of Aboriginal men, women and children. Another version claims that the Hospital Creek Massacre refers to the death of 300 Aboriginals in retaliation for having "annoyed" white settlers.[3] Yet another version states that when a stockman went missing, it was assumed that Aboriginals were the culprit, and approximately 400 of them were rounded up and massacred in retaliation.[4]
