The ACHAEANS (; _Akhaio√≠,_ "the Achaeans" or "of Achaea") constitute one of the collective names for the Greeks in Homer's _Iliad_ (used 598 times) and _Odyssey_. The other common names are DANAANS (; _Danaoi_; used 138 times in the _Iliad_) and ARGIVES (; ; used 182 times in the _Iliad_) while PANHELLENES ( _Panhellenes,_ "All of the Greeks") and HELLENES (;[1] _Hellenes_) both appear only once;[2] all of the aforementioned terms were used synonymously to denote a common Greek civilizational identity.[3][4] In the historical period, the ACHAEANS were the inhabitants of the region of Achaea, a region in the north-central part of the Peloponnese. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the Achaean League, which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.
