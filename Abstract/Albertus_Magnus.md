ALBERTUS MAGNUS,[1] (c. 1193 – November 15, 1280), also known as SAINT ALBERT THE GREAT and ALBERT OF COLOGNE, was a German Catholic Dominican friar and bishop. Later canonised as a Catholic saint, he was known during his lifetime as _Doctor universalis_ and _Doctor expertus_ and, late in his life, the sobriquet _Magnus_ was appended to his name.[2] Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the Middle Ages.[3] The Catholic Church distinguishes him as one of the 36 Doctors of the Church.
