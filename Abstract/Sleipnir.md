Odin_rides_to_Hel.jpg Rides to Hel" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]] In Norse mythology, SLEIPNIR (Old Norse "slippy"[1] or "the slipper"[2]) is an eight-legged horse ridden by Odin. Sleipnir is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin's steed, is the child of Loki and Sva√∞ilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel. The _Prose Edda_ contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and details that he is grey in color.
