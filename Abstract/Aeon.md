The word AEON , also spelled EON (in American English), originally meant "life", "vital force" or "being", "generation" or "a period of time", though it tended to be translated as "age" in the sense of "ages", "forever", "timeless" or "for eternity". It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word (_ho aion_), from the archaic (_aiwon_). In Homer it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the Sanskrit word _kalpa_ and Hebrew word _olam_. A cognate Latin word _aevum_ or _aeuum_ (cf. ) for "age" is present in words such as _longevity_ and _mediaeval_.[1]
