In mathematics, a COMBINATION is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter. For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a _k_-COMBINATION of a set _S_ is a subset of _k_ distinct elements of _S_. If the set has _n_ elements, the number of _k_-combinations is equal to the binomial coefficient
