It is used as a symbol, a signalling device, or for decoration. The term _flag_ is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the maritime environment, where semaphore is used). The study of flags is known as "vexillology" from the Latin _vexillum_, meaning "flag" or "banner".
