MARKAB (foaled 4 February 2003) is a British-bred Thoroughbred racehorse. Originally trained in France, he did not race as a juvenile and won one minor race from six attempts as a three-year-old in 2006. He was then sold to race in England where he won three small handicap races in 2008 and the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes in the following year. After being transferred to the stable of Henry Candy he belatedly emerged as a top-class performer at the age of seven in 2010 when he won the Greenlands Stakes in Ireland before recording his biggest win in the Group One Betfred Sprint Cup. He remained in training for two more years, winning the Leisure Stakes in 2012 at the age of nine.
