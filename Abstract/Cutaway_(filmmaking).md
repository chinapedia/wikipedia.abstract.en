In film and video, a CUTAWAY SHOT is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else.[1] It is usually followed by a cut back to the first shot, when the cutaway avoids a jump cut.[2] The cutaway shot does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the editor assemble a longer sequence.[3] For this reason, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location.[4] For example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead.
