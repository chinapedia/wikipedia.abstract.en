DAVID VICTOR DICK (8 March 1924 – 15 February 2001) was a British jockey who competed at the Grand National from 1951–1965, winning the race in 1956 on E.S.B. He was the only jockey ever to win both races of the Lincoln-Grand National Spring Double[1] and he holds the record, nine times, for the number of clear rounds on a notoriously difficult Aintree course. (The Aintree Clear Rounds Award, given for any jockey completing more than five clear rounds, was not instituted until 1986.)[2]
