_BASIC ROLE-PLAYING'' (_BRP'') is a role-playing game system which originated in the _RuneQuest_ fantasy role-playing game. The _BRP_ standalone booklet was first released in 1980 in the boxed set release of the second edition of _RuneQuest_. Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis are credited as the authors. A percentile skill-based system, _BRP_ was used as the basis for most of the games published by Chaosium, including _Call of Cthulhu_, _Stormbringer_, and _Elfquest_.
