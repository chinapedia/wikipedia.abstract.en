RENÉ HÉCTOR ÉMILE CHAZAL was a French colonial administrator. He served as lieutenant governor of Mauritania from 21 November 1929 to 19 June 1931.[1] French soldier and former governor of Mauritania Henri Gaden sharply criticized Chazal's appointment, writing, "Chauzal knows nothing about Mauritania, nor the Moors, nor about any other populations of this type.[2] While governor, Chazal imprisoned spiritual leader Yacouba Sylla, whom he considered a great threat.[3] It is likely that Chazal was dismissed as lieutenant governor due to a pamphlet by Louis Hunkanrin that sharply criticized his approach to slavery.[4]
