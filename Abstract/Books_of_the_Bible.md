Different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books. The Jewish Tanakh (sometimes called the Hebrew Bible) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the _Torah_ ("teaching"); the eight books of the _Nevi'im_ ("prophets"); and the eleven books of _Ketuvim_ ("writings"). It is composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, and its Septuagint is the main textual source for the Christian Greek Old Testament.[1]
