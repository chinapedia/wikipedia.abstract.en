RUTHERFORD is a liquid-propellant rocket engine designed by American-New Zealand aerospace company Rocket Lab[1] and manufactured in California.[2] It uses LOX and RP-1 as its propellants and is the first flight-ready engine to use the electric-pump feed cycle. It is used on the company's own rocket, Electron. The rocket uses a similar engine arrangement to the Falcon 9; a two-stage rocket using a cluster of nine identical engines on the first stage, and one vacuum-optimized version with a longer nozzle on the second stage.[3][4] The sea-level version produces of thrust and has a specific impulse of , while the vacuum optimized-version produces of thrust and has a specific impulse of .[5]
