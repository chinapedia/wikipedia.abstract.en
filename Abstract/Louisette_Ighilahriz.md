LOUISETTE IGHILAHRIZ (born 22 August 1936) is an Algerian writer, former _Conseil de la Nation_ member, and a former member of the _Front de Lib√©ration Nationale_ (FLN) who came to widespread attention in 2000 with her story of captivity by the French in 1957-62, becoming, in the words of the American journalist Adam Shatz, "a catalyst of a debate about the legacy of the French-Algerian war".[1]
