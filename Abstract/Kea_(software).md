KEA is an open-source DHCP server being developed, primarily in C++, by the Internet Systems Consortium, authors of ISC DHCP, also known as DHCPd. Kea and ISC DHCP are both implementations of the Dynamic Host Control Protocol, a set of standards established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Kea software is distributed in source code form, on Github,[1] from various ISC sites, and through a number of operating system packages.[2][3][4][5][6]
