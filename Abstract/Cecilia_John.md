Cecilia_John.png CECILIA ANNIE JOHN (5 November 1877 â€“ 28 May 1955) was an Australian social activist, radical, and peace campaigner. Born in Hobart in 1877 to parents who were immigrants from Wales, she left her parents' home while young and moved to Melbourne to study music. Joining the Collins Street Independent Church, John became interested in social questions and adopted feminist and anti-conscriptionist views that were quite radical for the time. She was a friend of Vida Goldstein and assisted in her attempt to enter Parliament in 1913, and was a member of the anti-conscription Australian Freedom League.[1]
