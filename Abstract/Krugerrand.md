The KRUGERRAND (;[1] ) is a South African coin, first minted on 3 July 1967 to help market South African gold and produced by Rand Refinery and the South African Mint.[2][3] By 1980, the Krugerrand accounted for 90% of the global gold coin market. The name is a compound of _Paul Kruger_, the former South African president depicted on the obverse, and _rand_, the South African unit of currency. During the 1970s and 1980s, some western countries forbade import of the Krugerrand because of its association with the apartheid government of South Africa, most notably the United States, which was the coin's largest market in 1985.[4]
