In mathematics, the CARDINALITY of a set is a measure of the "number of elements of the set". For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.[1] The cardinality of a set is also called its SIZE, when no confusion with other notions of size[2] is possible.
