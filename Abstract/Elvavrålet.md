Flogstaskriket.jpg, Uppsala]] ELVAVRÅLET (Swedish: the eleven roar) is a student tradition where students at universities and colleges at a certain time every evening/night in student residential areas (22:00 or 23:00, on Lappkärrsberget only Tuesdays) open their windows, go out onto balconies or up to the rooftops and scream out their anxiety due to exams and stress.
