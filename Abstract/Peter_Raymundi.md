PETER RAYMUNDI, or Pere-Ramon (1050-?) was the heir of Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona and his first wife, Isabela Trencavel, daughter of Count Sancho of Gascony, known for the murder of his stepmother, Almodis de la Marche in October 1071. Raymundi was apparently concerned about Almodis' influence and worried she was trying to replace him, but was disinherited and exiled for his crime.
