Reinaré_en_España.jpg to Padre Hoyos.]] TRADITIONALISM () is a Spanish political doctrine, formulated in the early 19th century and developed until today. It understands politics as implementing the social reign of Jesus Christ. In practical terms it advocates a loosely organized monarchy combined with strong royal powers, with some checks and balances provided by organicist representation, and with society structured on a corporative basis. Traditionalism is an ultra-reactionary doctrine; it rejects concepts such as democracy, human rights, constitution, universal suffrage, sovereignty of the people, division of powers, religious liberty, freedom of speech, equality of individuals, parliamentarism and so on. The doctrine was adopted as theoretical platform by a socio-political movement named Carlism, though it appeared also in a non-Carlist incarnation. Traditionalism has never exercised major influence among the Spanish governmental strata, yet periodically it was capable of mass mobilization and at times partially filtered into the ruling practice.
