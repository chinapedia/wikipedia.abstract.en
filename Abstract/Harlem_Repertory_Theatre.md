The Harlem Repertory Theatre was founded in 2004 by Keith Lee Grant, who serves as the Artistic Director of the Company. It is a non-profit theatre group which explores diverse and challenging themes such as race, class, and politics. Most of the actors are people of color from the New York area. It was established to fulfill Langston Hughesâ€™ 1938 vision for a professional theatre in Harlem. Its first season in Aaron Davis Hall at the City College campus were the Broadway musicals HAIR, THE WIZ, and a new musical piece called VODU. Subsequent seasons included an eclectic range of musicals, plays and a Shakespeare comedy.
