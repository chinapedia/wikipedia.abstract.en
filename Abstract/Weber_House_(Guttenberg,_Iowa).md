The WEBER HOUSE is a historic building located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. It was built by Dr. Weber, a German immigrant surgeon, sometime before 1858. It is also possible his name was George Wehmer.[1] Subsequently, the house was associated with the Freidlein and Zimmerman families who owned a nearby saw mill and lumber yard. Initially, the 1Â½-story brick structure was in a "T" shape with a full size porch across the front. The house has been added onto on the rear. A two-frame kitchen wing had been added to the north side around 1900, and is no longer extant. There was also a summer kitchen on the property at one time. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[2]
