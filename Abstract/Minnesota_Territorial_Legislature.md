The MINNESOTA TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE was a bicameral legislative body created by the United States Congress in 1849 as the legislative branch of the government of the Territory of Minnesota. The upper chamber, the COUNCIL, and the lower chamber, the HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, first convened on September 3, 1849.[1] The two chambers served as the territory's legislative body until Minnesota was admitted as a state on May 11, 1858, when the Territorial Legislature was replaced by the Minnesota Legislature.
