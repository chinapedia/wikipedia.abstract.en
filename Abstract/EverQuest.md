_EVERQUEST_ is a 3D fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) originally developed by Verant Interactive and 989 Studios for Windows PCs. It was released by Sony Online Entertainment in March 1999 in North America,[1] and by Ubisoft in Europe in April 2000.[2] A dedicated version for macOS was released in June 2003, which operated for ten years before being shut down in November 2013.[3] In June 2000, Verant Interactive was absorbed into Sony Online Entertainment, who took over full development and publishing duties of the title. Later, in February 2015, SOE's parent corporation, Sony Computer Entertainment, sold the studio to investment company Inception Acquisitions and was rebranded as Daybreak Game Company, who develops and publishes _EverQuest_ to this day.
