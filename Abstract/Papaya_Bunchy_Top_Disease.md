PAPAYA BUNCHY TOP DISEASE was first discovered in 1931 in Puerto Rico.[1] Early on, the identity of the pathogen was highly contested due to the inability of isolating it; thus Kochâ€™s postulates could not be fulfilled.[2] Scientists have previously believed that Papaya Bunchy Top Disease was caused by a virus, a mycoplasma-like organism (MLO), or a phytoplasma, but these possible pathogens have since been disproven.[3] Since the identity of the pathogen was unknown, all diagnoses were given solely based on a list of commonly associated symptoms.[4] Through sequencing and microscopy, scientists identified the pathogen to be a part of the genus _Rickettsia_ in 1996.[5] The bacterium is described as being rod-shaped, small, gram-negative, and laticifer-inhibiting. _Rickettsia_ causes diseases in animals, such as typhus and spotted fever,[6] as well as in other plants, such as phony disease of peach and almond leaf scorch.[7] Papaya Bunchy Top is found throughout the American tropics and has been economically important due to its major impact on fruit production.[8] There is little information about the current economic impact.
