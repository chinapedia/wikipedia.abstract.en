_THESE MEMORIES WON'T LAST_ is a 2015 webcomic created by Stu Campbell. The infinite canvas webcomic written in HTML5 tells the story of Campbell's grandfather suffering from Alzheimer's disease. _These Memories Won't Last_ is deliberately created to work with current web browser software and will likely not be readable with future technologies. The webcomic was nominated for an Eisner Award.
