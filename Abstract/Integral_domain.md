In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an INTEGRAL DOMAIN is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.[1][2] Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain, every nonzero element _a_ has the cancellation property, that is, if , an equality _ac_}} implies _c_}}.
