The FREDERICK NATIONAL LABORATORY FOR CANCER RESEARCH (FNLCR) is a United States federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) supported by the National Cancer Institute and managed by the private contractor Leidos Biomedical Research. The institution was originally established under the name FREDERICK CANCER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER in 1972 as a component of President Richard Nixon's War on Cancer initiative. In 2012, the institution received a national laboratory designation and assumed its current name, becoming the only U.S. national laboratory exclusively dedicated to biomedical research. The campus in Frederick, Maryland also houses National Cancer Institute laboratories and administrative organizations, and is colloquially referred to as NCI-FREDERICK.[1][2]
