_BLACK SKIES IN BROAD DAYLIGHT_ is the first full-length album by American punk rock band Living Things. It was released by DreamWorks Records on May 3, 2004 in the UK, and on August 17, 2004 in the US. It was produced by Steve Albini.[1] _CMJ_ described the voice of the band's lead singer, Lillian Berlin, as a "snarling Iggy-inspired baritone" and the album's songs as "scathing socio-political commentaries."[2]
