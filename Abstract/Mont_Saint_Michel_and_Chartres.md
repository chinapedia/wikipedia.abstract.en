_MONT SAINT MICHEL AND CHARTRES_ is a book written by the American historian and scholar Henry Adams (1838–1918). Adams wrote this book, a meditative reflection on medieval culture, well after his historical masterpiece, _The History of the United States of America (1801–1817)_. Whereas the latter is a serious academic work of history, _Mont Saint Michel and Chartres_ is far more whimsical, a playful meditative reflection on medieval culture. It was published privately in 1904, originally intended simply for his nieces; in 1913, it was made more widely available when published with the support of the American Institute of Architects.[1] Despite having a far less serious intent than his earlier historical writings, _Mont Saint Michel and Chartres_ has garnered high praise: for example, Maurice le Briton said, “_Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres_ is undoubtedly Adams's greatest work; though not apparently related to his earlier writings, this inspired work of poetry is the crowning achievement of his severe and somber historical oeuvre.”[2] A few years after Adams published _Mont Saint Michel and Chartres_, he published his most famous work, the _Education of Henry Adams_ in 1907. Raymond Carney has said of this pair of works: “Taken together they may be read as Adams’ spiritual autobiography—two monumental volumes in which he attempts to bring together in a vast synthesis all of his knowledge of politics, economics, psychology, science, philosophy, art, and literature in order to attempt to understand the individual’s place in history and society.” [3]
