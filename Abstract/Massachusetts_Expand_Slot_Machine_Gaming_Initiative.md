The MASSACHUSETTS EXPAND SLOT MACHINE GAMING INITIATIVE was a 2016 Massachusetts ballot measure. Also known as Question 1, it was an indirect initiated state statute question that would allow the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to issue an additional license for another slot machine parlor to exist in the state. The ballot question specified that the additional slots parlor be licensed only on a property within of a racetrack and built on a parcel that is at least in size.[1] The only location in the state where this would have applied was Suffolk Downs in East Boston.[2]
