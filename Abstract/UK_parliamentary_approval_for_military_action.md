There is an emerging constitutional convention in the United Kingdom whereby the House of Commons is provided the opportunity to debate the use of the Armed Forces prior to their deployment, except in the event of an emergency.[1] The power to deploy military forces is currently exercised by ministers under the royal prerogative and does not require parliamentary authorisation. Since 2003, however, successive Governments have informed and consulted the House of Commons about the decision to use force and the progress of military campaigns. Doubts over the existence of the convention were arguably laid to rest in 2013, when a Government motion to deploy military forces in Syria was defeated.
