_ENTEROBACTERIA PHAGE Λ_ (LAMBDA PHAGE, COLIPHAGE Λ, officially _ESCHERICHIA VIRUS LAMBDA_) is a bacterial virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_). It was discovered by Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two _E. coli_ strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was "nibbled and plaqued".[1][2] The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells – instead, they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.[3]
