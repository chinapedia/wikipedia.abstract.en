_DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?_ (retitled _BLADE RUNNER: DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?_ in some later printings) is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in 1968. The novel is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth's life has been greatly damaged by nuclear global war. Most animal species are endangered or extinct from extreme radiation poisoning, so that owning an animal is now a sign of status and empathy, an attitude encouraged towards animals. The book served as the primary basis for the 1982 film _Blade Runner_, and many elements and themes from it were used in its 2017 sequel _Blade Runner 2049_.
