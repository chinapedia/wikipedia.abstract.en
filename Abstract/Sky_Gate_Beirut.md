SKY GATE is a tower built in the heart of the Achrafieh District in Beirut. From its completion in 2014 until late 2016, Sky Gate was the tallest structure in Lebanon.[1] The tower is composed of four superimposed block-like sections that accommodate 42 floors in an unconventional' design.[2] Sky Gate is situated on the peak-point of Achrafieh, offering a 360 degree view of Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Tilal Beirut and the Atomium twin towers surround Sky Gate from both sides. This tower and others like it have been thoroughly criticized for their effect on the city as a whole, particularly in the manner in which they contribute to the loss of local built heritage and a steady increase in inflation [3]
