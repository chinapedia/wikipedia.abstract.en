A MORPHEME is the smallest meaningful unit in a language. A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding. The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology. When a morpheme stands by itself, it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own (e.g. the morpheme _cat_) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea, it is an affix because it has a grammatical function (e.g. the _â€“s_ in _cats_ to indicate that it is plural).[1] Every word comprises one or more morphemes.
