"Bal u starego Joska" (Bal na Gnojnej) is a waltz ballad by the Polish-Russian composer, Fanny Gordon, and lyricists, Julian Krzewiński and Leopold Brodziński. It is a popular Polish song in the _piosenka apaszowska_ or _apache songs_ genre which arose in the Polish underworld of the 1930s. The song was written around 1934 for one of Warsaw's literary cabaret theatres. The theatres were frequented by the Polish intelligentsia.
