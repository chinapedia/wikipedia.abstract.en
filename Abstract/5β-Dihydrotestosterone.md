5Β-DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE (5Β-DHT), also known as 5Β-ANDROSTAN-17Β-OL-3-ONE or as ETIOCHOLAN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, is an etiocholane (5β-androstane) steroid as well as an inactive metabolite of testosterone formed by 5β-reductase in the liver and bone marrow[1][2] and an intermediate in the formation of 3α,5β-androstanediol and 3β,5β-androstanediol (by 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and, from them, respectively, etiocholanolone and epietiocholanolone (by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).[3][4] Unlike its isomer 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT or simply DHT), 5β-DHT either does not bind to or binds only very weakly to the androgen receptor.[5] 5β-DHT is notable among metabolites of testosterone in that, due to the fusion of the A and B rings in the _cis_ orientation, it has an extremely angular molecular shape, and this could be related to its lack of androgenic activity.[6] 5β-DHT, unlike 5α-DHT, is also inactive in terms of neurosteroid activity,[7][8] although its metabolite, etiocholanolone, does possess such activity.[9][10]
