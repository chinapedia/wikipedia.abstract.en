Gerardus_Croese_(1642-1710).png GERARD CROESE (26 April 1642, Amsterdam â€“ 10 May 1710, Dordrecht) was a Dutch Reformed minister and author. He is now remembered as an early historian of the Society of Friends, with his _Historia Quakeriana_ (1695). It is considered sympathetic, in general terms, but neither uncritical nor entirely reliable.[1]
