MMIX (pronounced _em-mix_) is a 64-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture designed by Donald Knuth, with significant contributions by John L. Hennessy (who contributed to the design of the MIPS architecture) and Richard L. Sites (who was an architect of the Alpha architecture). Knuth has said that "MMIX is a computer intended to illustrate machine-level aspects of programming. In my books _The Art of Computer Programming_, it replaces MIX, the 1960s-style machine that formerly played such a roleâ€¦ I strove to design MMIX so that its machine language would be simple, elegant, and easy to learn. At the same time I was careful to include all of the complexities needed to achieve high performance in practice, so that MMIX could in principle be built and even perhaps be competitive with some of the fastest general-purpose computers in the marketplace."[1]
