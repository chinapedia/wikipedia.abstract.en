NATHANIEL BERMAN is the Rahel Varnhagen Professor of International Affairs, Law, and Modern Culture in Brown University's Religious Studies Department. For much of his career, Berman's scholarship focused on the construction of modern internationalism through its relationships to nationalism, colonialism, and religion. In particular, it has examined early 20th century internationalism as one of the sites of the invention of cultural modernism. Berman's work on these issues has been broadly interdisciplinary, drawing on literary criticism, cultural studies, post-colonial theory, and religious studies.[1] More recently, Berman's work has focused more directly on the relationship between religion and legal and political theory. He has also embarked on several major projects in the area of Judaic Studies. For several years, he co-directed Brown's Religion and Internationalism Project, a joint venture between the Cogut Institute and Brown's Religious Studies Department.
