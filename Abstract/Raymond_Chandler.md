RAYMOND THORNTON CHANDLER (July 23, 1888 â€“ March 26, 1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, "Blackmailers Don't Shoot", was published in 1933 in _Black Mask,_ a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, _The Big Sleep_, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but _Playback_ have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.[1]
