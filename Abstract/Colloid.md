Milk.jpg is an emulsified colloid of liquid butterfat globules dispersed within a water-based solution.]] In chemistry, a COLLOID is a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid;[1] the term COLLOIDAL SUSPENSION refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower sense of the word _suspension_ is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension) that arise by phase separation. To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be one that does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.
