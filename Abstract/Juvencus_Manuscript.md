The JUVENCUS MANUSCRIPT (Cambridge, Cambridge University Library, MS Ff. 4.42) is one of the main surviving sources of Old Welsh. Unlike much Old Welsh, which is attested in manuscripts from later periods and in partially updated form, the Welsh material in the Juvencus Manuscript was written in the Old Welsh period itself; the manuscript provides the first attestation of many Welsh words.[1]
