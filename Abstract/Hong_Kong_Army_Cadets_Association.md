Its stated future aims include the opening of one or more non profit making schools in order to promote their ideals.[3] The _Hong Kong Army Cadets Association_ is a development of the _Military Summer Camp For Hong Kong Youth_ () scheme organised by Betty Tung Chiu Hung-ping, the wife of former Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa, and the core of the estimated 2000 strong membership[4] is made up of attendees of the summer camps; the target membership of the Association are children and youths from the age of six upwards.[5] Of the Hong Kong Uniformed Youth Groups, the Association is the only one to use People's Liberation Army military drill,[6] and its uniforms, emblems and structure is based on that of the PLA.
