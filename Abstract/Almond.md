The ALMOND (_Prunus dulcis_, syn. _Prunus amygdalus_) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries[1][2][3] as well as Central Asia,[4] but widely cultivated elsewhere. The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus _Prunus_, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus _Amygdalus_, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed.
