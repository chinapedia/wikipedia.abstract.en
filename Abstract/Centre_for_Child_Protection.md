The CENTRE FOR CHILD PROTECTION (CCP) was launched in Munich in January 2012 by the Institute of Psychology of the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in cooperation with the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the State University Clinic of Ulm. The founding of the CCP was part of a global initiative for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors. After successful completion of the pilot phase at the end of 2014, the CCP relocated its headquarters to Rome in January 2015. The CCP is part of the academic structure of the Pontifical Gregorian University as part of the Institute of Psychology. It closely collaborates with the Faculties of Theology, Canon Law, and Social Sciences. A main task of the institution is the creation of a global e-learning training centre for pastoral professions responding to the sexual abuse of minors, taking into account multilingual and intercultural issues.[1]
