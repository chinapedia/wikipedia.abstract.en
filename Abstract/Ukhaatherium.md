_UKHAATHERIUM_ is a now extinct species of mammal that lived during the upper Cretaceous about 84 to 72 million years ago in today's East Asia. It is known above all from Ukhaa Tolgod, where it alone is occupied by eight individuals, six of them completely. In general, _Ukhaatherium_ weighing about 32 g was quite small and resembled today's insect eaters. In addition, there were still some original skeletal features.
