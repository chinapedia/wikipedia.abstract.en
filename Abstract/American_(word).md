The meaning of the word _AMERICAN_ in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. _American_ is derived from _America_, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America.
