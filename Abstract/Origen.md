ORIGEN OF ALEXANDRIA ( 184 â€“ 253),[1] also known as ORIGEN ADAMANTIUS, was an early Christian scholar, ascetic,[2] and theologian who was born and spent the first half of his career in Alexandria. He was a prolific writer who wrote roughly 2,000 treatises in multiple branches of theology, including textual criticism, biblical exegesis and biblical hermeneutics, homiletics, and spirituality. He was one of the most influential figures in early Christian theology, apologetics, and asceticism.[3] He has been described as "the greatest genius the early church ever produced".
