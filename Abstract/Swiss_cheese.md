SWISS CHEESE is a generic name in North America for several related varieties of cheese, mainly of North American manufacture, which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes". Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind".[1] The terms _Swiss_ or _Baby Swiss_ are also applied to cheeses of this style made outside Switzerland,[2] such as Jarlsberg cheese, which originates in Norway.
