ERYTHROMYCIN is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections.[1] This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis.[2] It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn,[3] as well as to improve delayed stomach emptying.[4] It can be given intravenously and by mouth.[5] An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn.[6]
