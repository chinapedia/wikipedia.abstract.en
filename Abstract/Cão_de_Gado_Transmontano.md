The CÃO DE GADO TRANSMONTANO (;[1] English: TRANSMONTANO MASTIFF or TRANSMONTANO CATTLE DOG) is a rare molosser working giant dog breed, originating in and largely limited to the region of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province, Portugal.[2][3][4] Their primary function is flock and herd protection, and their success is interlinked to the welfare of the flock and the presence of wolves, particularly. Although they are a regional breed, their wolf defense capacity has led to limited experimental importation elsewhere.
