BEAVER CREEK is a stream in western Douglas and eastern Taney counties of Missouri. It is a tributary to the White River of northern Arkansas. The headwaters of Beaver Creek arise in northern Douglas County and extreme southeast Webster County northwest of Ava and southeast of Seymour. The stream flows south and southwest to join the White River southeast of Forsyth and south of Kissee Mills below the Lake Taneycomo powersite dam.[1] The creek was named due to the presence of beaver dams on the creek.[2]
