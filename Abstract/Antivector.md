An ANTIVECTOR is an element of grade in an _n_-dimensional exterior algebra.[1] An antivector is always a blade, and it gets its name from the fact that its components each involve a combination of all except one basis vector, thus being the opposite of a vector whose components each involve exactly one basis vector. Like a vector, an antivector has _n_ components in _n_-dimensional space, and this sometimes leads to an inadequate distinction being made between the two types of entities. However, antivectors transform differently with a change of basis than vectors do, which shows that they are different kinds of quantities.
