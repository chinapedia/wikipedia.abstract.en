_DICHANTHELIUM OLIGOSANTHES_, known as HELLER'S ROSETTE GRASS, FEWANTHER OBSCUREGRASS, and FEW-FLOWERED PANICGRASS,[1] is a frost-tolerant, perennial grass species native to North America. It is found primarily in the contiguous United States with specimens also reported in British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, as well as south of the Rio Grande in northern Mexico.[2][3] _D. oligosanthes_ is most frequently in partially shaded glens within woods, recently cut forests, and grassy banks.[4]
