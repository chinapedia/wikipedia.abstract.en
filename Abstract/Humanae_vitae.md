Paulaudenece1977.jpg signed _Humanae vitae_ on 25 July 1968.]] _HUMANAE VITAE_ (Latin: _Of Human Life_) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI and dated 25 July 1968. The text was issued at a Vatican press conference on 29 July.[1] Subtitled _On the Regulation of Birth_, it re-affirmed the orthodox teaching of the Catholic Church regarding married love, responsible parenthood, and the rejection of artificial contraception. In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, a commission he himself had expanded.[2]
