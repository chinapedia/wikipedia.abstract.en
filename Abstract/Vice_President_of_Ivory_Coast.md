The VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IVORY COAST, officially the Republic of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, is the second-highest executive official in Ivory Coast. The Vice President, together with the President of Ivory Coast, is directly elected by the people through popular vote to serve a five-year term of office. The Vice President is the first person in the presidential line of succession and would ascend to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the President, or an absolute vacancy in the office. President Alassane Ouattara appointed Daniel Kablan Duncan as Vice President in January 2017 after the 2016 Constitution was enacted.[1]
