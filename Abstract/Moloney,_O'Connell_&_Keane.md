MOLONEY, O'CONNELL & KEANE is an early 1980s folk trio of traditional Irish music made up of guitarist and singer-songwriter Robbie O'Connell, banjoist and singer Mick Moloney and piano accordion virtuoso Jimmy Keane. The trio released two critically acclaimed albums: _There Were Roses_ in 1985 (including the first recording of the iconic Irish song "There Were Roses" that was penned by the famous Irish folk singer-songwriter Tommy Sands but recorded first by the trio) and the album _Kilkelly_ in 1987 including O'Connell's signature song "Killkelly".
