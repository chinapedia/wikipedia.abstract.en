VINYLTESTOSTERONE (also known as 17Α-VINYLTESTOSTERONE, 17Α-VINYLANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, and 17Α-HYDROXYPREGNA-4,20-DIEN-3-ONE) is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) that was never marketed.[1][2] However, two 19-nortestosterone derivatives of vinyltestosterone, norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-nortestosterone) and norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ⁵⁽¹⁰⁾-19-nortestosterone), have been marketed.[3] They are used as progestins for female hormonal contraception, rather than as AAS.[4]
