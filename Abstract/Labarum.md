Labarum_of_Constantine_the_Great.svg The LABARUM () was a _vexillum_ (military standard) that displayed the "Chi-Rho" symbol ☧, a christogram formed from the first two Greek letters of the word "Christ" (, or Χριστός) — _Chi_ (χ) and _Rho_ (ρ).[1] It was first used by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Since the vexillum consisted of a flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, it was ideally suited to symbolize the crucifixion of Christ.
