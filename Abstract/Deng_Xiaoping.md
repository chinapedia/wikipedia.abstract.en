DENG XIAOPING (, also ;[1][2][3] courtesy name XIXIAN;[4] 22 August 1904 â€“ 19 February 1997)[5] was a Chinese politician who was the paramount leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 until his retirement in 1992. After Chairman Mao Zedong's death in 1976, Deng led China through far-reaching market-economy reforms. However, he is widely criticised for his authoritarian actions during the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, where he cracked down on dissidents.
