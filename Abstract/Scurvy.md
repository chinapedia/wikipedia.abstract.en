SCURVY is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid).[1] Early symptoms of deficiency include weakness, feeling tired, and sore arms and legs.[2][3] Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, changes to hair, and bleeding from the skin may occur.[4][5] As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.[6]
