The STANFORD SLEEPINESS SCALE (SSS), developed by Dement and colleagues in 1972, is a one-item self-report questionnaire measuring levels of sleepiness throughout the day. The scale, which can be administered in 1â€“2 minutes, is generally used to track overall alertness at each hour of the day.[1] The scale has been validated for adult populations aged 18 and older.[2] The SSS is used in both research and clinical settings to assess the level of intervention or effectiveness of a specific treatment in order to compare a clients progress.[3][4]
