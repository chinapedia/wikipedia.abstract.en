The CANE TOAD (_Rhinella marina_), also known as the GIANT NEOTROPICAL TOAD or MARINE TOAD, is a large, terrestrial true toad native to South and mainland Central America, but which has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean, as well as Northern Australia. It is the world's largest toad. It is a member of the genus _Rhinella_, but was formerly assigned to the genus _Bufo_, which includes many true toad species found throughout Central and South America. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among anurans, of both dead and living matter. Adults average in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of .[1]
