"HI SUMMER" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and recorded by Carl Wayne as a single released on the DJM/Weekend label in 1977.[1][2][3] The B-side of the single is another song composed by de Paul, "My Girl and Me".[4][5][6] Both songs were produced by de Paul. It was used as the theme tune to the popular Saturday night prime time ITV variety programme _Hi Summer_, which also featured Carl Wayne as one of the performers.[7] The song received good reviews, with notable British DJ and music critic James Hamilton[8] writing "Ultra-brite and bouncy TV theme really does get â€˜em jiving" for his weekly disco music feature in _Record Mirror_.[9] That issue of Record Mirror also contained a half page advert for the single.[10]
