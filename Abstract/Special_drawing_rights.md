SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS (ISO 4217 currency code XDR (numeric: 960),[1] also abbreviated SDR) are supplementary foreign-exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[2] The SDR is the unit of account for the IMF, and is not a currency _per se_.[3] SDRs instead represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged.[4] The SDR was created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign-exchange reserve assets, namely gold and the U.S. dollar.[5]
