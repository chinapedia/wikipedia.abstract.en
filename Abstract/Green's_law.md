Propagation_du_tsunami_en_profondeur_variable.gif and wave height with decreasing water depth.]] In fluid dynamics, GREEN'S LAW describes the evolution of non-breaking surface gravity waves propagating in shallow water of gradually varying depth and width. The law is named after George Green. In its simplest form, for wavefronts and depth contours parallel to each other (and the coast), it states:
