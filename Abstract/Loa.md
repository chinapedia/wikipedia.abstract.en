Mami_Wata_poster.png. |thumb]] LOA (, also written LWA as in Haitian Creole) are the spirits of Haitian Vodou and Louisiana Voodoo.[1] They are also referred to as "mystères" and "the invisibles" and are intermediaries between Bondye (from French _Bon Dieu_, meaning "good God")—the Supreme Creator, who is distant from the world—and humanity. Unlike saints or angels, however, they are not simply prayed to, they are served. They are each distinct beings with their own personal likes and dislikes, distinct sacred rhythms, songs, dances, ritual symbols, and special modes of service. Contrary to popular belief, the loa are not deities in and of themselves; they are intermediaries for, and dependent on, a distant Bondye.[2]
