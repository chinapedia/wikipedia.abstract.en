PEDER JENSEN LODEHAT (died 19 October 1416) was a Danish bishop and a significant political figure during the reign of queen Margrete I. Lodehat was originally from a minor noble family on Zealand but made a career in the Catholic Church as bishop of a total of 3 dioceses. He served on the Danish Riksr√•d and had a role in getting Margrethe I appointed queen. Lodehat also had a central role in the creation of the Kalmar Union and may have authored the founding documents. The surname Lodehat stems from a type of hat, _Lodehat_, featured on the family coat of arms but although the family has become known under this name they likely didn't use it in their own time.[1][2]
