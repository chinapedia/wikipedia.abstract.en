LEWIS RICHARD WATSON, 3RD BARON SONDES (24 May 1792 â€“ 14 March 1836), styled HON. LEWIS WATSON until 1806, was an English peer. His legal struggle with his former tutor over the occupation of the rectory of Kettering led to the case of _Fletcher_ v. _Lord Sondes_, in which the House of Lords declared that bonds of special resignation were simoniacal. After extensive litigation, he succeeded in instituting his younger brother in the rectory.
