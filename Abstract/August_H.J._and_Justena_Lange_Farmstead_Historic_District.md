The AUGUST H.J. AND JUSTENA LANGE FARMSTEAD HISTORIC DISTRICT is an agricultural historic district located northeast of La Porte City, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1] At the time of its nomination it consisted of 16 resources, which included seven contributing buildings, two contributing structures, one contributing objects, three non-contributing buildings, and three non-contributing structures.[2] The farmstead was developed from 1887, when the Lange's took possession of the property, and 1916 when they moved into La Porte City. They had a general farming operation here that was augmented by August's specialized skill as a blacksmith. The farmstead was organized spatially with the domestic buildings on the west side of Spring Creek Road and the farming operation on the east side.
