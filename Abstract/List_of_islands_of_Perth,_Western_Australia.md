Perth, Western Australia hosts a variety of unique and biologically diverse habitats found nowhere else on Earth.[1] Many of these habitats include islands. Islands provide habitat and safe refuge for endangered native fauna as they are free of invasive species and the pressures of human development. Coastal islands of this region heavily feature limestone as their base structure, while the inland islands are predominantly made of serpentine soil.[2]
