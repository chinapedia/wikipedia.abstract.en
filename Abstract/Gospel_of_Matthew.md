The GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW (;[1] also called the GOSPEL OF MATTHEW or simply, MATTHEW) is the first book of the New Testament and one of the three synoptic gospels. It tells how the promised[2] Messiah, Jesus[3], rejected by Israel, is killed, is raised from the dead, and finally sends the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world. Most scholars believe it was composed between AD 80 and 90, with a range of possibility between AD 70 to 110 (a pre-70 date remains a minority view). The anonymous author was probably a male Jew, standing on the margin between traditional and non-traditional Jewish values, and familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture being debated in his time. Writing in a polished Semitic "synagogue Greek", he drew on the Gospel of Mark as a source, and likely used a hypothetical collection of sayings known as the Q source, although the existence of Q has been questioned by some scholars.[4] He also used material unique to his own community, called the M source or "Special Matthew".
