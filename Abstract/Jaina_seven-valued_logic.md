JAINA SEVEN-VALUED LOGIC is system of argumentation developed by Jaina philosophers and thinkers to support and substantiate their theory of pluralism. This argumentation system has seven distinct semantic predicates which may be thought of as seven different truth values. Traditionally, in the Jaina and other Indian literature dealing with topics in Jain philosophy, this system of argumentation is referred to as _Saptabhangivada_ or _Syadvada_. The earliest reference to _Syadvada_ occurs is the writings of Bhadrabahu (c. 433–357 BCE). There is mention of _Syadvada_ in the _Nyayavatara_ of Siddhasens Divakara (about 480–550 CE). Samantabhadra (about 600 CE) gave a full exposition of the seven parts of _Syadvada_ or _Saptabhanginyaya_ in his _Aptamimamsa_. The _Syadvadamanjari_ of Mallisena (1292 CE) is a separate treatise on the same theory. There are, of course, still later works and a large number of modern commentaries.[1] The interpretation of Saptabhangivada as a seven-valued logic was attempted by Harvard University philosophy professor George Bosworth Burch (1902–1973) in a paper published in International Philosophical Quarterly in the year 1964.[2] P. C. Mahalanobis, an Indian applied statistician, has given a probabilistic interpretation of the _Saptabhangivada_.[3][4]
