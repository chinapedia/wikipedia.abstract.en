Horseshoe.jpg and nailed into the hoof wall.]] Variety_of_horseshoes,_including_aluminum_racing_plates_and_shoes_used_on_cattle_in_lower_right.jpgs in the lower right]] A HORSESHOE is a fabricated product, normally made of metal, although sometimes made partially or wholly of modern synthetic materials, designed to protect a horse's hoof from wear. Shoes are attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the hooves, usually nailed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human toenail, although much larger and thicker. However, there are also cases where shoes are glued.
