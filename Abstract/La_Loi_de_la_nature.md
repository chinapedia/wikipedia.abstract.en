_LA LOI DE LA NATURE_ is an album that was released by the Cameroonian singer _DYNASTIE LE TIGRE_ on May 30, 2015 worldwide.[1] A deluxe version of the album was released worldwide on May 26, 2016 by Tiger Prod and was marketed & distributed by Hope Music Group.[2] The album is a walk of more than an hour in the heart of African rhythms revisited and modernized by Dynastie and his Dynastie family orchestration. Thereby emerge new musical variations such the Kwatt'nB & the Neo Bikutsi. Alongside these crossbreeding, Dynastie browsed through new genres from elsewhere as Afropop and even R&B.[3]
