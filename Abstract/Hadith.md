ḤADĪTH ([1] or ;[2] , pl. AḤĀDĪTH, , , also "Traditions") in Islam refers to the record of the words, actions, and the silent approval, of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Hadith have been called "the backbone" of Islamic civilization,[3] and within that religion the authority of hadith as a source for religious law and moral guidance ranks second only to that of the Qur'an (which Muslims hold to be the word of Allah revealed to his messenger Muhammad). Scriptural authority for hadith comes from the Quran which enjoins Muslims to emulate Muhammad and obey his judgments (in verses such as 24:54, 33:21). While the number of verses pertaining to law in the Quran is relatively few, hadith give direction on everything from details of religious obligations (such as _Ghusl_ or _Wudu_, ablutions[4] for _salat_ prayer), to the correct forms of salutations[5] and the importance of benevolence to slaves.[6] Thus the "great bulk" of the rules of Sharia (Islamic law) are derived from hadith, rather than the Qur'an.[7]{{#tag:ref|“The full systems of Islamic theology and law are not derived primarily from the Quran. Muhammad’s sunna was a second but far more detailed living scripture, and later Muslim scholars would thus often refer to the Prophet as `The Possessor of Two Revelations`”[8]|group=Note}}
