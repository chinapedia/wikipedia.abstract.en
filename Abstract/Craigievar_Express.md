Craigievar_Express_2016.JPG The CRAIGIEVAR EXPRESS is a steam-powered tricycle built by Andrew 'Postie' Lawson between 1895 and 1897 in Craigievar, Scotland.[1] The vehicle's frame is made from wood, as are its wheels.[2][3] The engine is a single-cylinder model and was purchased second hand from a sawmill.[4] The Express's boiler was obtained through _Exchange and Mart_.[5] The flywheel brake acted on the engine, and following the principles of the horse-carriage braking system (brake shoes attached to a lever) another was applied to the rims of the back wheels.[6]
