URBAN METCALF (1775-c. 1820s) was a clothes salesman and asylum patient who was arrested for allegedly attempting to assassinate King George III. Metcalf went in and out of various asylums for his entire adult life before eventually being permanently committed to York asylum in 1822.[1] Metcalf reportedly believed that he was King, based on a 'delusional genealogy', and repeatedly tried to enter royal palaces.[2]
