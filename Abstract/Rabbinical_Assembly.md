The RABBINICAL ASSEMBLY (RA) is the international association of Conservative rabbis.[1] The RA was founded in 1901 to shape the ideology, programs, and practices of the Conservative movement.[2] It publishes prayerbooks and books of Jewish interest, and oversees the work of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards for the Conservative movement. It organizes conferences and coordinates the Joint Placement Commission of the Conservative movement. Members of the RA serve as rabbis, educators, community workers and military and hospital chaplains around the world.
