APOLLO 8 was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the United States Apollo space program, the first having been Apollo 7 which stayed in Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit, reach the Moon, orbit it, and return.[1][2][3] The three-astronaut crew – Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders – were the first humans to fly to the Moon, to witness and photograph an Earthrise, and to escape the gravity of a celestial body. Apollo 8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center, located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
