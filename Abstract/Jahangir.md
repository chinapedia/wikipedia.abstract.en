NUR-UD-DIN MUHAMMAD SALIM[1] (Persian: ), known by his imperial name JAHANGIR (Persian: ) (August 1569 â€“ 28 October 1627),[2] was the fourth Mughal Emperor, who ruled from 1605 until his death in 1627. His imperial name (in Persian), means 'conqueror of the world', 'world-conqueror' or 'world-seizer' (_Jahan_: world; _gir_: the root of the Persian verb _gereftan_: to seize, to grab). The tale of his relationship with the Mughal courtesan, Anarkali, has been widely adapted into the literature, art and cinema of India.
