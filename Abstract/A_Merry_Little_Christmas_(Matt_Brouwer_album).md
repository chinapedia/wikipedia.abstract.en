_A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS_ is the first Christmas release by Canadian singer-songwriter Matt Brouwer.[1] The seven song collection was released on December 7, 2010, through Universal Music Distribution. The album includes "Angels Sing", an original composition written by Brouwer, as well as a cover of the Goo Goo Dolls hit "Better Days" that charted for Brouwer on the _Billboard_ Christian chart in January 2011. Brouwer's version of the song was added to regular, non-seasonal CCM playlists on Air1 and KLOVE Christian stations throughout the following year.
