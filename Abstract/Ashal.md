ASHAL (foaled 6 March 1986) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was a specialist stayer best known for his upset victory in the 1990 Ascot Gold Cup. After finishing unplaced on his only start as a two-year-old he spent the following year competing in minor races at Redcar Racecourse, winning three times. In 1990 he began his campaign by finishing second to Sadeem at Salisbury Racecourse and then won the Group Three Oleander-Rennen in Germany. At Ascot he coped with the wet conditions better than his opponents and won the Gold Cup by four lengths. He was beaten in his three remaining races although he did finish third in the Jockey Club Cup on his final appearance. He has been described as one of the worst horses to win the Gold Cup.
