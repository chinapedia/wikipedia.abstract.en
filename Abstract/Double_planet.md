Pluto_&_Charon,_Earth_size_comparison.jpg and the Moon (above right) and Pluto–Charon (below right)]] In astronomy, a DOUBLE PLANET (also BINARY PLANET) is a binary system where both objects are of planetary mass. The term is not recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and is therefore not an official classification. At its 2006 General Assembly, the International Astronomical Union considered a proposal that Pluto and Charon be reclassified as a double planet,[1] but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current definition of planet. In promotional materials advertising the SMART-1 mission and pre-dating the IAU planet definition, the European Space Agency once referred to the Earth–Moon system as a double planet.[2]
