In mathematical logic and computer science, the GENERAL RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS (often shortened to RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS) or Μ-RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS are a class of partial functions from natural numbers to natural numbers that are "computable" in an intuitive sense. In computability theory, it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines[1]{{#tag:ref| Proof outline on p.153: λ-definable $\stackrel{triv}{\implies}$ λ-K-definable $\stackrel{160}{\implies}$ Turing computable $\stackrel{161}{\implies}$ μ-recursive $\stackrel{Kleene}{\implies}$[2] λ-definable}}(this is one of the theorems that supports Church–Turing thesis). The μ-recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every μ-recursive function is a primitive recursive function—the most famous example is the Ackermann function.
