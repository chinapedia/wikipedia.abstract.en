The CASA DEL FUNDADOR GONZALO SUÁREZ RENDÓN (English: "House of the Founder Gonzalo Suárez Rendón") is a museum and monument in Tunja, the capital of Boyacá, Colombia. It is situated on the central square of Tunja, named _Plaza Bolívar_, but historically called _Plaza Suárez Rendón_, honouring the city founder Gonzalo Suárez Rendón, who established Tunja for the Spanish Crown on August 6, 1539. The colonial building, declared a monument in 1959 and designated as museum in 1965, is the only remaining house of a city founder in Latin America and started construction in 1540.
