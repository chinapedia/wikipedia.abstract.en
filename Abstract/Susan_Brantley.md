SUSAN L. BRANTLEY (born 1958) is an American geologist and geochemist who is Distinguished Professor of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University.[1] Her research dominantly studies interactions between fluids and minerals at low temperatures, biological reactions in water-rich fluids within soils, and the geochemical processes that convert rock into soil. However, among many other topics she has also published work on carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes, and the environmental impact of shale gas extraction and nuclear waste disposal.[2] During her career, Brantley has published over 200 research papers and book chapters, has been awarded academic prizes and fellowships by many of the world's leading geoscience societies, and has been described as "one of the leading aqueous geochemists of her generation."[3][4]
