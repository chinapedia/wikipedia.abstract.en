The CHURCH OF ST JOHN is a Church of England parish church at Shobdon in the English county of Herefordshire. Of 14th century origins, the church was completely rebuilt between 1749-1752 for John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman, in a Rococo style under the supervision of Bateman's uncle, The Honourable Richard Bateman, a close friend of Horace Walpole, and a member of his _Committee of Taste._ Simon Jenkins, in his book _England's Thousand Best Churches_, considers the interior "a complete masterpiece (of) English Rococo," while Brooks and Pevsner describe it as "the finest 18th century church in Herefordshire." It is a Grade I listed building.
