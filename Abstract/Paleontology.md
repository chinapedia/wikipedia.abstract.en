Joda_paleontologist.jpg]] PALEONTOLOGY, sometimes spelled PALAEONTOLOGY () is the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the Holocene Epoch (roughly 11,700 years before present). It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments (their paleoecology). Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th century BC. The science became established in the 18th century as a result of Georges Cuvier's work on comparative anatomy, and developed rapidly in the 19th century. The term itself originates from Greek παλαιός, _palaios_, "old, ancient", ὄν, _on_ (gen. _ontos_), "being, creature" and λόγος, _logos_, "speech, thought, study".[1]
