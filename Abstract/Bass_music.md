BASS MUSIC (also called UK BASS or POST-DUBSTEP[1][2]) is an umbrella term for club music that emerged in the United Kingdom during the mid-2000s under the influence of diverse genres such as dubstep, UK garage, R&B, wonky, house, and grime.[3] The phrase "bass music" came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on percussive, bass-led rhythm.[4]
