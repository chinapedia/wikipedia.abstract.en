There was, for a considerable period of time, a very lively and extensively practiced tradition of formal DEBATES IN ANCIENT INDIA. These debates were conducted, sometimes with royal patronage, to examine various religious, philosophical, moral and doctrinal issues.[1] The corpus of knowledge on conducting a successful debate was referred to as _vādavidyā_ and several manuals dealing with this discipline had been produced. It was from these debates that the Indian tradition of logic and allied investigations were evolved and developed. The antiquity of this tradition can be traced even to pre-Buddhist period. For example, Brhadaranyaka Upsanisad, a pre-Buddhist text, has references to King Janaka as not only organizing and patronizing debates between the sages and priests but also as participating in such debates.[2] Even women used to participate in these debates. Gargi was a woman scholar who used to participate in the debates in King Janaka's court.
