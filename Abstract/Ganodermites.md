_GANODERMITES_ is an extinct monotypic genus of polypore fungus in the family Ganodermataceae. Its single member, _GANODERMITES LIBYCUS_, is known from a structurally preserved (permineralized) fruit body from the Lower Miocene (near the start of the Neogene) (23.03–15.7 Ma) of Jebel Zelten in North Africa. The fungus is thought to be closely related to the modern genus _Ganoderma_ because of shared characteristics, including distinct growth increments in the fruit body, a stratified hymenium, equidistantly arranged pores, and double-layered spore walls. _G. libycus_ has a trimitic hyphal system, with generative, skeletal, and binding hyphae.[1]
