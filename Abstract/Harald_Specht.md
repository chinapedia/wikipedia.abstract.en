HARALD SPECHT (born 20 December 1951) is a German scientist and author. He published the first German monograph on issues of cold shortening and electrical stimulation,[1][2] but he became mainly known for his books about Jesus of Nazareth and early Christianity[3][4][5] in which he doubts the historicity of Jesus of Nazaret. He also shows the development of Christiantity as a result of religious and political disputes on the basis of ancient pagan sources.[6][7]
