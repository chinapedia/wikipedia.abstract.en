The BERBER LANGUAGES, also known as BERBER or the AMAZIGH LANGUAGES[1] (Berber name: , ; Neo-Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ, Tuareg Tifinagh: ⵜⵎⵣⵗⵜ, , ), are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They comprise a group of closely related languages spoken by the Berbers, who are indigenous to North Africa.[2] The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.[3]
