JOÃO MARIA DE JESUS, born ANASTÁS MARCAF (died ) was an itinerant preacher and healer who was active in southern Brazil around the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century. After his death his devotees conflated his identity with two other monks named João Maria who wandered, preached and cured in the region. There are many places where a small cross or altar marks a place where the monk "João Maria" stopped. There are many who think that João Maria is still working his miracles today.
