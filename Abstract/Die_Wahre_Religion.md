DIE WAHRE RELIGION (DWR, in English "The True Religion") is an Islamist Salafi organisation based in Germany[1] that was founded in 2005 by Palestinian-born German Salafist Ibrahim Abou-Nagie.[2][3] The organization is thought to have had around 500 active members.[4][5][6] Die wahre Religion takes part in Koran distribution campaigns. The declared goal of the campaign under the name _Lies!_ (meaning Read! in German) is to provide a Quran translation to every household in Germany. According to the founder, around 3.5 million copies were distributed by mid-2016.[7][8] The organization was successfully banned in November 2016 by the German government following the its proven recruitment of jihadists to fight in Syria and Iraq for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIS.[9]
