The MUSÉE DES JACOBINS is the town museum in Auch, the capital of the Gers department in France. It is located in the old city between the riverbank and Gers Cathedral. It houses France's second biggest collection of Pre-Columbian art after the quai Branly, with which it has collaborated for many years. The museum garden is a 1600 square metre parc à la française containing plants brought back from the Americas by the Conquistadors.
