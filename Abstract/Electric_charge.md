ELECTRIC CHARGE is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two-types of electric charge: _positive_ and _negative_ (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively). Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as __. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of quantum effects.
