The ARCHITECTURE OF SWITZERLAND was influenced by its location astride major trade routes, along with diverse architectural traditions of the four national languages. Romans and later Italians brought their monumental and vernacular architecture north over the Alps, meeting the Germanic and German styles coming south and French influences coming east. Additionally Swiss mercenary service brought architectural elements from other lands back to Switzerland. All the major styles including Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Modern architecture and Post Modern are well represented throughout the country. The founding of the Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne in La Sarraz, Switzerland and the work of Swiss-born Modern architects such as Le Corbusier helped spread Modern architecture throughout the world.
