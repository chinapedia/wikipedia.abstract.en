Gosudarstvennost2002.jpg monument (unveiled on 8 September 1862) on a postage stamp dedicated to the 1140th anniversary of the Russian statehood in 2002]] The HISTORY OF RUSSIA begins with the histories of the East Slavs, Turkic and the Finno-Ugric peoples.[1][2][3][4] The traditional start-date of specifically Russian history is the establishment of the Rus' state in the north in 862 ruled by Vikings.[5] Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod became the first major cities of the new union of immigrants from Scandinavia with the Slavs and Finno-Ugrians. In 882 Prince Oleg of Novgorod seized Kiev, thereby uniting the northern and southern lands of the Eastern Slavs under one authority. The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Orthodox Slavic culture for the next millennium. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the Mongol invasions in 1237â€“1240 along with the resulting deaths of about half the population of Rus'.
