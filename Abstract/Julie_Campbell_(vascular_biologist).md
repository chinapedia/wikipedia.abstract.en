JULIE HAZEL CAMPBELL (born 2 November 1946) is an Australian vascular biologist; and she was born in Sydney, Australia. Campbell, cell biologist and professorial fellow at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, is recognized as a world leader in the field of smooth muscle biology.[1][2] In the early 1970s, she was the first to discover that smooth muscle cells can exist in a spectrum of phenotypes that control the cell's biology and response to disease stimuli (e.g. in heart diseases). She further determined how these cells could be maintained in the ‘non-disease’ phenotype. This knowledge helped modern scientist's understanding of how atherosclerotic plaques form and provided information on potential strategies for prevention.
