THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH (DISCIPLES OF CHRIST) is a Mainline Protestant Christian denomination in the United States and Canada.[1][2] The denomination started with the Restoration Movement during the Second Great Awakening, first existing as a loose association of churches working towards Christian unity during the 19th century, then slowly forming quasi-denominational structures through missionary societies, regional associations, and an international convention. In 1968, the Disciples of Christ officially adopted a denominational structure at which time a group of churches left to remain nondenominational.
