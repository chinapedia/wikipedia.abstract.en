SEAMUS MCGUIRE is an Irish fiddle player born in County Sligo now residing in County Donegal. In 1966, he won Sligo's prestigious "Fiddler of Dooney" competition.[1] He is a founding member of "Buttons and Bows" (with Manus McGuire, Jackie Daly and Garry O'Briain), as well as "The West Ocean String Quartet" (with Niamh Crowley, Kenneth Rice, and Neil Martin).[2] The quartet reflects his classical training and his love of exploring spaces where classical and traditional musics can meet.
