Mormon-book.jpg as printed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (2009)]] The word MORMON most colloquially denotes an adherent, practitioner, follower, or constituent of Mormonism in restorationist Christianity. _Mormon_ also commonly refers, specifically, to a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which is often colloquially, but imprecisely, referred to as the _Mormon Church_. In addition, the term _Mormon_ may refer to any of the relatively small sects of Mormon fundamentalism, and any branch of the Latter Day Saint movement that recognizes Brigham Young as the successor to founder Joseph Smith. The term _Mormon_ applies to the religion of Mormonism, as well as its culture, texts, and art.
