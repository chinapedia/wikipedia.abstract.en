PELOTON TECHNOLOGY is an automated and connected vehicle technology company established in 2011 and headquartered in Mountain View, California.[1] It is developing a vehicle platooning system that enables pairs of trucks to operate at close following distances with a stated goal of improving safety and fuel efficiency. Peloton Technology was the first company to test a non-research commercial truck platooning system on public roads in the United States. In 2016 it publicly stated it would be the first company to offer a commercial platooning system for use by truck fleets in 2017.[2][3] By mid-2018 that deadline had slipped to "by the end of 2018."[4]
