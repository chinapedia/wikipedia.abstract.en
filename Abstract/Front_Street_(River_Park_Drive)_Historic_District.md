The FRONT STREET (RIVER PARK DRIVE) HISTORIC DISTRICT is a nationally recognized historic district located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and in 2004 its boundaries increased to include buildings that did not front onto River Park Drive. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 75 resources, including 57 contributing buildings, one contributing site, and 17 noncontributing buildings. The boundary increase added 19 resources, including 15 contributing buildings, one contributing site, and 3 noncontributing buildings.[1] The 4Â½ block segment of South River Park Drive, originally called Front Street, that makes up the district is the commercial center of Guttenberg. The buildings line the west side of the street facing a park, a contributing site, and the Mississippi River across the street. The National Fish Hatchery and Aquarium complex (1939-1940), whose buildings contribute to the historic nature of the district, is also located on the east side of the street.
