ST. ALBANS TOWN HALL is the center of government of the town of St. Albans, Vermont. It is located at 579 Lake Road (Vermont Route 36) in the village of St. Albans Bay. It is a Richardsonian Romanesque building, constructed in 1898, two years after the city of St. Albans, the former town center, was politically separated. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.[1]
