Sony-CLIE-PEG-NZ90.jpg The Sony CLIÉ is a series of personal digital assistants running the Palm Operating System developed and marketed by Sony from 2000 to 2005. The devices introduced many new features to the PDA market, such as a jog-wheel interface, high-resolution displays, and Sony technologies like Memory Stick slots and ATRAC3 audio playback. Most models were designed and manufactured in Japan. The name is an acronym for _creativity, lifestyle, innovation, emotion_ though formerly _communication, link, information and entertainment_. It was initially an attempt at a new coinage term, though it means "tool" in the Jèrriais language.
