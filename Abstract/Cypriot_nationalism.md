Flag_of_Cyprus.svg]] CYPRIOT NATIONALISM, also known as CYPRIOTISM, refers to one of the nationalisms of Cyprus. It focuses on the shared identity of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, highlighting their common culture, heritage, traditions, and economic, political, and social rights.[1] Cypriot nationalism, as a form of civic nationalism, supports the peaceful reunification of Cyprus and the end of interference of external powers in its domestic affairs. Some Cypriotists advocate a federal state, while others express a preference for a unitary state instead.[2]
