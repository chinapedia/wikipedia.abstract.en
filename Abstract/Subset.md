In mathematics, a set _A_ is a SUBSET of a set _B_, or equivalently _B_ is a SUPERSET of _A_, if _A_ is "contained" inside _B_, that is, all elements of _A_ are also elements of _B_. _A_ and _B_ may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called INCLUSION or sometimes CONTAINMENT. _A_ is a subset of _B_ may also be expressed as _B_ includes _A_; or _A_ is included in _B_.
