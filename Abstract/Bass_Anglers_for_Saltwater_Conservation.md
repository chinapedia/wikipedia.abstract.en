BASS ANGLERS FOR SALTWATER CONSERVATION, also known as BASS FOR SALT or BASC,[1] is an advocacy group and internet activism tool that was launched by the Yamaha Motor Company [2] and the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society[3] on June 1, 2015.[4] The organization primarily functions as a website, found at BassforSalt.com, and Online community for recreational anglers who want to be involved in fisheries policy.[5] Bass Anglers for Saltwater Conservation provides recreational anglers with pre-written letters and talking points for contacting the United States Congress and other federal and state legislators about issues that affect recreational anglers.[6][7] The group works in partnership with many prominent boating, sport fishing, and conservation organizations such as the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation,[8] the Coastal Conservation Association,[9][10] and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.[11] They also work with industry trade associations such as the National Marine Manufacturers Association[12] and the American Sportfishing Association.[13] On their website, the organization lists access, conservation, economics, and safety as their top issues.[14]
