RODRIGO DÍAZ DE VIVAR ( 10 July 1099) was a Castilian nobleman and military leader in medieval Spain. The Moors called him EL CID (), which meant _the Lord_ (probably from the original Arabic al-sayyid, السَّيِّد), and the Christians, EL CAMPEADOR, which stood for "Outstanding Warrior" or "The one who stands out in the battlefield". He was born in Vivar del Cid, a town near the city of Burgos. After his death, he became Castile's celebrated national hero and the protagonist of the most significant medieval Spanish epic poem, _El Cantar de Mio Cid_.[1]
