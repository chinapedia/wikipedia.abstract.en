The PALMER MODEL 1865 CARBINE is a single-shot bolt action rifle patented in 1863 by E. G. Lamson and Company of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts.[1] 1000 Palmer carbines were delivered to Union forces in the American Civil War one month after the war ended.[2] All rifles (designed to be carbines for cavalry soldiers[3]) were subsequently sold to civilians after the war. The rifle was the first bolt action rifle to be accepted for use by the US Army Ordnance Department.[4]
