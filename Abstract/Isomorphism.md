In mathematics, an ISOMORPHISM (from the Ancient Greek: ἴσος _isos_ "equal", and μορφή _morphe_ "form" or "shape") is a homomorphism or morphism (i.e. a mathematical mapping) that can be reversed by an inverse morphism. Two mathematical objects are ISOMORPHIC if an isomorphism exists between them. An _automorphism_ is an isomorphism whose source and target coincide. The interest of isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects cannot be distinguished by using only the properties used to define morphisms; thus isomorphic objects may be considered the same as long as one considers only these properties and their consequences.
