Ellipse-conic.svg with an inclined plane]] Ellipse-def0.svg Ellipse-var.svg In mathematics, an ELLIPSE is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity _e_, a number ranging from _e =_ 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to _e_ = 1 (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a parabola).
