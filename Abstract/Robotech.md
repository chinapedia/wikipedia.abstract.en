_ROBOTECH_ is a science fiction franchise that began with an 85-episode anime television series produced by Harmony Gold USA in association with Tatsunoko Production and first released in the United States in 1985. It was adapted from three original and unrelated, though visually similar, Japanese anime television series (_The Super Dimension Fortress Macross_, _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_, and _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_) to make a series suitable for syndication.[1] U.N._Spacy_Roundel.svg In the series, _Robotechnology_ refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island.[2] With this technology, Earth developed robotic technologies, such as transformable mecha, to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions.[3]
