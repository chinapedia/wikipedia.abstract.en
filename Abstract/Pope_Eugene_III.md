POPE EUGENE III (; c. 1080 â€“ 8 July 1153), born Bernardo Pignatelli,[1] called BERNARDO DA PISA, was Pope from 15 February 1145 to his death in 1153. He was the first Cistercian to become Pope. In response to the fall of Edessa to the Muslims in 1144, Eugene proclaimed the Second Crusade. The crusade failed to recapture Edessa, which was the first of many failures by the Christians in the crusades to recapture lands won in the First Crusade.
