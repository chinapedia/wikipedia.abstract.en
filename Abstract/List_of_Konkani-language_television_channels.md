This is a LIST OF TELEVISION CHANNELS THAT BROADCAST WHOLLY OR PARTLY IN KONKANI, an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Southern branch of the language family (along with Marathi) and spoken by around 2 million people, mainly in pockets along the west coast of India, especially the area in and around Goa, as well as in districts of Maharashtra to the north Karnataka to the south and east. Due to its relatively small number of speakers (compared with other regional Indian languages whose native speakers number in the tens of millions), there are relatively few monolingual Konkani television stations.
