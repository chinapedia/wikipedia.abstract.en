Lake_Hico.jpg LAKE HICO is a cooling pond reservoir built on 16th section school land in Jackson, Mississippi, in the 1950s. Its primary purpose is to provide water for the adjacent Rex Brown Plant, which generates electricity with steam. Initially, Lake Hico was open to the public for recreation. The lake was closed to the public in the late 1960s, along with the public swimming pools in Jackson, due to racial prejudices preventing peaceful integration of public swimming holes.[1]
