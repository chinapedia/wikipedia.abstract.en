LILLIAN ESTELLE FISHER (born 1 May 1891, Selinsgrove, PA, died 4 May 1988, Moraga CA)[1][2] was one of the first women to earn a doctorate in Latin American history in the U.S. She published important works on Spanish colonial administration; a biography of Manuel Abad y Queipo, reform bishop-elect of Michoacan; and a monograph on the Tupac Amaru rebellion in Peru. As distinguished colonial Latin American historian John J. TePaske put it in 1968, "At least three generations of graduate students have studied the works of Lillian Estelle Fisher."[3] Fisher is included as an example of sexual/gender discrimination in the historical profession.[4]
