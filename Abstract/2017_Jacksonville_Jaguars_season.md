The 2017 JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS SEASON was the franchise's 23rd season in the National Football League and the first under head coach Doug Marrone. Marrone was hired after acting as the team's interim head coach for the final two games of the 2016 season. The team improved on their 3–13 record from 2016 and ended their 10-year playoff drought dating back to 2008 with a week 15 win over the Houston Texans. They also secured their first winning season since 2007 after a 30–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks. On December 24, 2017, they clinched their third division title, and their first AFC South title following a Tennessee Titans loss. They won the wild card game against the Buffalo Bills 10–3, then headed to Pittsburgh, beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 45–42 to advance to the AFC Championship to face the New England Patriots, the first time that they have made the AFC Championship Game since 1999. Despite leading for much of the game, the Jaguars would allow two 4th quarter touchdowns, and ultimately lost to the Patriots 24–20.
