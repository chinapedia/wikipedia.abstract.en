_THE KING V. PEAR_, I Leach 211, 168 Eng. Rep. 208 (1779), is a criminal case involving interpreting possession and intent in "larceny by trick".[1] A horse owner gave Pear custody of a horse by renting it out for a day, after which it was to be returned when Pear returned to town. Pear did not take his journey, sold the horse the same day, prior to the expiration of the rental contract, and had no lodging in town where he was to return to, which was evidence he never intended to return it in the first place.[2]
