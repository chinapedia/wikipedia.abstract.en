It may also be used, with an upper- or lower-case initial, as an adjective relating to Quebec, or to the French culture of Quebec.[9] A resident or native of Quebec is often referred to in English as a Quebecer or Quebecker.[10] In French, _QUÉBÉCOIS_ or _QUÉBÉCOISE_ usually refers to any native or resident of Quebec.[11][12] Its use became more prominent in the 1960s as French Canadians from Quebec increasingly self-identified as Québécois.[13]
