MAZHAR KHAN (1905â€“1950) was an actor-producer-director in Indian Cinema. He was acknowledged for his strong yet natural performances, best exemplified by his role in V. Shantaram's classic _Padosi_ (1941), wherein Mazhar, a Muslim,[1] enacted the role of an upper-caste Hindu.[2] He started his career as a police officer, which he left to study law for a short period. Abandoning his studies he came to Bombay and started his career in cinema with the silent film _Fatal Garland_ opposite the top actress of the time, Ermeline. He became a popular actor, gaining success in several silent films. During his stint in silent films he worked with well-established directors like Bhagwati Mishra, Ezra Mir, Moti P. Bhagnani, R. S. Chowdhary, and M. D. Bhavnani.[3] The magazines of those days, circa 1940s, compared Mazhar to Hollywood actors like Paul Muni, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.[4]
