IONA (ISLANDS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC) is an acronym suggested in 1980 by Sir John Biggs-Davison to refer to a loose linkage of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, similar to the present day British-Irish Council.[1][2] Its intended purpose was as a more politically acceptable alternative to British Isles, which is disliked by many people in Ireland.[3]
