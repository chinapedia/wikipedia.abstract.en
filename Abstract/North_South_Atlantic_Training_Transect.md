The NORTH SOUTH ATLANTIC TRAINING TRANSECT (NoSoAT) is a program that was developed by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), the Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training (SMART), and the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO) in order to further the education and practical training of postgraduate students in climate and marine sciences. Each year, about 30 students are selected through a rigorous application process to join a voyage from Bremerhaven, Germany to Cape Town, South Africa aboard the RV Polarstern. The month-long course is designed to provide students with relevant lectures and projects, as well as provide them with hands-on training for the use of atmospheric and oceanographic equipment and the opportunity to learn about data processing and analysis.[1][2]
