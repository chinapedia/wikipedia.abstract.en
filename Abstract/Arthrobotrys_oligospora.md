_ARTHROBOTRYS OLIGOSPORA_ was discovered in Europe in 1850 by Georg Fresenius.[1][2] 'A. oligospora' is the model organism for interactions between fungi and nematodes.[3] It is the most common nematode capturing fungus,[4][5][6] and most widespread nematode trapping fungus in nature.[7][8] It was the first species of fungi documented to actively capture nematodes.[9][10] The species epithet, _oligospora_, derives from the Greek, ολιγο ('oligo') meaning "few" and σπορά ('spora') meaning "spores".
