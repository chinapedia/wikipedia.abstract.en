The CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE ( _Naos tes Anastaseos_; _Surb Harut'yan tač̣ar_; ; also called the CHURCH OF THE RESURRECTION or CHURCH OF THE _ANASTASIS_ by Orthodox Christians) is a church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.[1] The church contains, according to traditions dating back to at least the fourth century, the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus of Nazareth was crucified,[2] at a place known as Calvary or Golgotha, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is said to have been buried and resurrected.[3] The tomb is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicula. The Status Quo, a 260-year-old understanding between religious communities, applies to the site.[4][5]
