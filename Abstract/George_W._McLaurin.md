George held a master's degree from the University of Kansas and was a retired professor living in Oklahoma City. Before retirement, he taught at a predominantly black college, Langston University.

In the case, Mclaurin was supported by Thurgood Marshall, Amos T. Hall, Roscoe Dunjee, and five other African American students.
