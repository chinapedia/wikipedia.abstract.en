Most Democratic voters supported Hillary Clinton,[1][2] but some traditionally Democratic counties in the Rust Belt voted for Donald Trump. One reason given for Trump winning counties in Eastern Ohio in the Ohio Republican primary, 2016 was Democratic voters opposed to free trade who had voted in the Republican primary.[3] In general CNN exit polls showed Ohio Democratic voters with slightly less support for Clinton than the national average,[4] and Trump receiving higher support among Democratic voters in Ohio than Romney had in 2012.[5]
