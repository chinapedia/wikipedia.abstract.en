Sir_Frances_Drake_Hotel_(6893456916).jpg The KIMPTON SIR FRANCIS DRAKE HOTEL is a 416-room boutique hotel located in San Francisco, California, at the corner of Sutter and Powell Streets adjacent to the cityâ€™s central urban entertainment and shopping district, Union Square. The property was named after the English explorer who, in 1579, narrowly missed discovering San Francisco Bay and instead sailed the _Golden Hind_ into Drakes Bay 28 miles north. Built in 1928 by Midwestern hotel developers Leon W. Huckins and John A. Newcomb for the then princely sum of $5 million, the hotel was run by several major hotel companies before being purchased by an investment partnership led by Bill Kimpton, founder of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, in 1994. Kimpton sold the property in 2005, but still manages the historic hotel.[1][2] In addition to its Union Square location, the Drake is known for its opulent, Renaissance-style interiors, Italian restaurant, Scala's Bistro, and as the location of a 21st story nightclub that has been a city attraction for decades, The Starlight Room.
