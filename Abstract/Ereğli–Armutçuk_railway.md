The EREĞLI–ARMUTÇUK RAILWAY is an abandoned railway in the Zonguldak Province of Turkey. The railway ran from a large coal mine in Armutçuk (present day Kandilli) to the port town of Karadeniz Ereğli and the large Erdemir steel mill. The primary function of the line was to bring coal from the mines to the steel mill, but passenger service also operated to small villages along the line.
