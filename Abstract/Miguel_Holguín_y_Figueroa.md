MIGUEL HOLGUÍN Y FIGUEROA, also written as MIGUEL HOLGUÍN DE FIGUEROA, (1516, Cáceres, Kingdom of Spain - after 1576, Tunja, New Kingdom of Granada) was a Spanish conquistador. He took part in the expeditions of conquest of the Chitarero, Motilon, U'wa and Lache peoples led by Nikolaus Federmann.[1] Holguín y Figueroa later settled in Tunja, where he protested the rapacious activities of Hernán Pérez de Quesada, governor of Bogotá.
