WILLIAM FAIRBROTHER was a Canadian ice hockey player who is credited with inventing the ice hockey net in the 1890s. During the 1880s, Fairbrother played for Beamsville, Ontario's Men's Hockey team.[1] At first, two poles or two rocks served as goals, and an official would watch to see if a puck passed through the goal.[2] However, disputes arose over goals and biased officiating.[3] Then, Fairbrother, who played as a goaltender, got a net from a local fisherman and strung it from the poles.[4] Players were immediately more satisfied with the new system.[5]
