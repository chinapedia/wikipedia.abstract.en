Grand_Guignol_poster_(crop).png _LE THÉÂTRE DU GRAND-GUIGNOL_ (: "The Theatre of the Great Puppet") – known as the GRAND GUIGNOL – was a theatre in the Pigalle district of Paris (at 20 bis, ). From its opening in 1897 until its closing in 1962, it specialised in naturalistic horror shows. Its name is often used as a general term for graphic, amoral horror entertainment, a genre popular from Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre (for instance Shakespeare's _Titus Andronicus_, and Webster's _The Duchess of Malfi_ and _The White Devil_), to today's splatter films.
