The idea of Eress (European Partnership for Railway Energy Settlement System) was presented for the first time in 1999 by Director of Jernbaneverket Bane Energi Johnny Brevik in a Nordic Railway Conference in Tampere Finland. It was a new idea therefore it took 4 years before the first agreement between Jernbaneverket, Banverket and Banedanmark was signed in 2004. Johnny Brevik was the first leader of the Board of Directors (2004-2009).
