Light_wave_harmonic_diagram.svg. The harmonic-analysis chart shows how the different wavelengths interact with red light. At a difference of λ/2 (half wavelength), red is perfectly in sync with its second harmonic in the ultraviolet. All other wavelengths in the visual spectrum have less than a λ/2 difference between them, forming harmonic oscillations in the combined waves. At λ/14, the oscillations cycle every 14th wave, while at λ/8 they will cycle every 8th. The oscillations are most rapid at λ/4, cycling every 4th wave, while at λ/3 they cycle every 7th wave, and at λ/2.5 they cycle every 13th. The lower section shows how the λ/4 harmonic interacts in visible light (green and red), as photographed in an optical flat.]]
