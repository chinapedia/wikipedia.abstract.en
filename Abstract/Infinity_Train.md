_INFINITY TRAIN_ is an American animated miniseries created by former _Regular Show_ writer/storyboard artist Owen Dennis for Cartoon Network.[1] The series follows 12-year-old Tulip and her two-in-one robot companion One-One in their journey through a seemingly infinite train with limitless possibilities traveling through a completely barren wasteland. They are joined by Atticus, an intelligent, talking Corgi and king of a Corgi kingdom in one of the train's cars, as they search for a way to Tulip's home.
