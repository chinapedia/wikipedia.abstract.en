In solid state physics, the LUTTINGER–WARD FUNCTIONAL,[1] proposed by Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger and John Clive Ward in 1960,[2] is a scalar functional of the bare electron-electron interaction and the renormalized many-body Green's function. In terms of Feynman diagrams, the Luttinger–Ward functional is the sum of all closed, bold, two-particle irreducible diagrams, i.e., all diagrams without particles going in or out that do not fall apart if one removes two propagator lines. It is usually written as Φ[G] or Φ[G, U], where G is the Green's function and U is the bare interaction.
