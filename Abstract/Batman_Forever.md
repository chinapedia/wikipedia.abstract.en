The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, Michael Gough, and Pat Hingle. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop Two-Face (Jones) and the Riddler (Carrey) in their villainous scheme to extract confidential information from all the minds in Gotham City and use it to learn Batman's identity and bring the city under their control. In the process, he gains allegiance from a young, orphaned circus acrobat named Dick Grayson (O'Donnell), who becomes his sidekick Robin, and meets and develops feelings for psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian (Kidman), which brings him to the point to decide if he will lead a normal life or if he is destined to fight crime as Batman forever.
