Difference_DNA_RNA-EN.svg (left) and DNA (right).]] NUCLEIC ACIDS are the biopolymers, or small biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life. The term _nucleic acid_ is the overall name for DNA and RNA. They are composed of nucleotides, which are the monomers made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is a compound ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).
