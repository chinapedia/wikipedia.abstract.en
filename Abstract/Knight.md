Codex_Manesse_Hartmann_von_Aue.jpg, from the Codex Manesse]] A KNIGHT is a man granted an honorary title of KNIGHTHOOD by a monarch, bishop or other political or religious leader for service to the monarch or a Christian church, especially in a military capacity.[1][2] Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors.[3] During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter, a bodyguard or a mercenary for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings.[4] The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of _chivalry_, _cavalier_ and related terms. The special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the _furusiyya_ in the Muslim world, and the Greek _hippeis_ (ἱππεῖς) and Roman _eques_ of classical antiquity.[5]
