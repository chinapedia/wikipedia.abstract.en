ALBANIA participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 with the song "World", written by Lindita Halimi, Klodian Qafoku and Gerald Xhari. The song was performed by Lindita Halimi. The Albanian broadcaster Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) organised the 55th edition of the Albanian song competition _Festivali i Këngës_ in order to select the Albanian entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine. The competition consisted of twenty-five entries competing in two semi-finals held on 21 and 22 December 2016, followed by a final on 23 December 2016 where fourteen entries qualified to compete. A twelve-member jury panel and a public televote selected "Botë", performed by Lindita, as the winner. The song was later translated from Albanian to English for the Eurovision Song Contest and was titled "World".
