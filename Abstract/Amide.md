Amide_types.svg An AMIDE ( or or ),[1][2][3] also known as an ACID AMIDE, is a compound with the functional group R_(_n_)E(O)_(_x_)NR′₂ (R and R′ refer to H or organic groups). Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (_n_ = 1, E = C, _x_ = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (_n_ = 2, E = P, _x_ = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, _x_ = 2).[4] The term amide refers both to _classes of compounds_ and to the _functional group_ (R_(_n_)E(O)_(_x_)NR′₂) within those compounds.
