"DANKE" (Thanks) is a German Christian hymn written by Martin Gotthard Schneider in 1961. It was one of the first songs in the genre later called Neues Geistliches Lied (new spiritual song).[1] The song title was disambiguated to its first line, "DANKE FÃœR DIESEN GUTEN MORGEN" (Thanks for this good morning). The song has been included in the hymnal _Evangelisches Gesangbuch_. It has been called the best-known German sacred song.
