The WAITS RIVER SCHOOL is a historic school building on Vermont Route 25 in the Waits River village of Topsham, Vermont. Now a private residence, it was built in 1914 as a combination district school and Grange hall, serving in those roles until 1972 and 1953, respectively. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 for its Colonial Revival architecture and its importance in local educational history.[1]
