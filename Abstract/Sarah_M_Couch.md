SARAH MARIA COUCH (1867-1946) was an America missionary in Japan with the Reformed Church of America. She served in Nagasaki at the Sturges Seminary – a mission school for girls – from 1892 – 1912. When the school closed, Couch stayed in Nagasaki and continued her work as a missionary. Couch retired from formal missionary work in 1937, but continued to live in Nagasaki. In 1941, Couch was arrested and detained in a Tokyo internment camp during World War II. She survived the war and returned to her home in Nagasaki, where she died in 1946.
