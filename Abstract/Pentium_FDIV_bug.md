KL_Intel_Pentium_A80501.jpg The PENTIUM FDIV BUG is a computer bug affecting the floating point unit (FPU) of the early Intel Pentium processors. Because of the bug, the processor might return incorrect binary floating point results when dividing a number. The bug was discovered in 1994 by Professor Thomas R. Nicely at Lynchburg College.[1] Intel attributed the error to missing entries in the lookup table used by the floating-point division circuitry.[2]
