The RED ENSIGN GROUP is a collaboration of United Kingdom shipping registries that include British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies. It takes its name from the Red Ensign ("Red Duster") flag flown by British civil merchant ships. The groupâ€™s stated purpose is to combine resources in order to maintain a reputation for safety and quality across the British fleet. As of 2016 the Red Ensign Group ranked seventh in the world as measured by gross tons (GT).[1] Sir Alan Massey of the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency commented ".. keeping [ships] inside the REG family means that you still have some influence over their quality and performance... We can take administrative measures against members of [it] if we want to so as to ensure that safety is brought up to the necessary standards..."[2] The vessels also receive British Consular assistance and protection.[3]
