DiagrammaChakraKundalini.jpgs, and nadis]] KUNDALINI (Sanskrit: __, , "coiled one"), in Hinduism is a form of divine energy (or _shakti_) supposedly located at the base of the spine (_muladhara_). It was originally an important concept in Śaiva Tantra, where it was seen as a force or power associated with the divine feminine, which when cultivated and awakened through tantric practice, was thought to lead to spiritual liberation. Kuṇḍalinī is associated with Paradevi or Adi Parashakti, the supreme being in Shaktism, as well as with the goddesses Bhairavi and Kubjika.[1][2] The term along with practices associated with it, was adopted into Hatha yoga in the 11th century[3] and other forms of Hinduism as well as modern spirituality and New age thought.
