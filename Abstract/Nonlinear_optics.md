EntryWithCollCode173233downbaxis.png, viewed down b axis, used in second harmonic generation.]] NONLINEAR OPTICS (NLO) is the branch of optics that describes the behaviour of light in _nonlinear media_, that is, media in which the polarization density P responds non-linearly to the electric field E of the light. The non-linearity is typically observed only at very high light intensities (values of atomic electric fields, typically 10‚Å∏ V/m) such as those provided by lasers. Above the Schwinger limit, the vacuum itself is expected to become nonlinear. In nonlinear optics, the superposition principle no longer holds.
