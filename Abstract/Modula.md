The MODULA programming language is a descendant of the Pascal programming language. It was developed in Switzerland in the 1970s by Niklaus Wirth, the same person who designed Pascal. The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a module system, used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name _Modula_. The language is defined in a report by Wirth called _Modula. A language for modular multiprogramming_ published 1976.[1]
