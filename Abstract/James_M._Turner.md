JAMES M. TURNER (November 8, 1928 â€“ July 20, 1981) was an American Republican Party politician who served in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature, serving one term in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1970 to 1972, and in the New Jersey Senate from 1972 until he was forced to resign from office in June 1973, after being convicted for his role leading a conspiracy to place drugs in the home of a Democratic Party political rival. Despite being evicted from his seat, Turner ran a quixotic campaign to be elected to a second term in the Senate.
