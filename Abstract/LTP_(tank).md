The LEGKIJ TANK PROVORNOVA (LTP) is a light tank designed by Lieutenant K. J. Provornov in July 1942. Blueprints for the LTP were discovered in the Main Automotive-Armoured Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation inventions department, but no prototypes have ever been made.[1][2]
