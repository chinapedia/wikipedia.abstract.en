The ESHELBY MECHANICS AWARD FOR YOUNG FACULTY, launched in 2012, is given annually to rapidly emerging junior faculty who exemplify the creative use and development of mechanics.[1] The intent of the award is to promote the field of mechanics, especially among young researchers and commemorate the memory of Professor John Douglas Eshelby. While interdisciplinary work that bridges mechanics with physics, chemistry, biology and other disciplines is encouraged, the ideal awardee will demonstrate clear inspiration from mechanics in his/her research. Awardees receive a $1,500 cash prize and a commemorative plaque. The awardees are formally recognized at the annual Applied Mechanics Division Banquet at the ASME-IMECE meeting.[2]
