The BATTLE OF CELAYA took place on 8 and 9 March 1858 in Celaya (in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico). It was a battle of the Reform War. Fought between elements of the liberal army, under General Anastasio Parrodi, and elements of the conservative army, commanded by General Luis G. Osollo, the victory corresponded to the conservative side, and was the first liberal defeat. In the face of this defeat, the liberal General Parrodi retired to Salamanca, where the next battle was fought.
