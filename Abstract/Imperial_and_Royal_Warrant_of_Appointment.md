Wappen_Kaisertum_Ã–sterreich_1815_(Klein).png An IMPERIAL AND ROYAL WARRANT OF APPOINTMENT during the Austro-Hungarian Empire was issued to vendors who supplied goods or services to the Austrian imperial court in Vienna and/or the Hungarian royal court in Budapest. The warrant was normally an official document, which enabled the supplier to advertise the fact and thus lend itself prestige.
