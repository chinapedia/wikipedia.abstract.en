ZENG XIAN (曾銑; 1499 - 1548) was a military official of the Ming dynasty of China. Serving in various high military positions in the northern provinces, he was tasked with the defence of the frontier against the Mongols. He was most famous for his proposal to retake the Ordos Loop for the Ming and extend the Great Wall of China over the region, which was met with initial enthusiasm from the Jiajing Emperor; however, opponents of the proposal brought upon a quick reversal which resulted in the downfall and execution of Zeng Xian and his principal supporter, the Senior Grand Secretary Xia Yan.
