GREGORY OF NAZIANZUS (, _Grēgorios ho Nazianzēnos_; c. 329[1] – 25 January 390),[2][3] also known as GREGORY THE THEOLOGIAN or GREGORY NAZIANZEN, was a 4th-century Archbishop of Constantinople, and theologian. He is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the patristic age.[4] As a classically trained orator and philosopher he infused Hellenism into the early church, establishing the paradigm of Byzantine theologians and church officials.[5]. Saint Gregory was saint patron of medieval Bosnia before the Catholic conquest when he was replaced by Saint (pope) Gregory.[6]
