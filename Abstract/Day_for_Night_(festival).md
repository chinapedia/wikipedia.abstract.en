DAY FOR NIGHT was an art and music festival in Houston, Texas that "explores the deep connections between light, technology, sound and space".[1] Producer Omar Afra co-conceived the idea of a festival experience that would reintroduce visual art back into the musical experience on a large scale when Kiffer Keegan pitched the idea of including new media installations during preparations for Free Press Summer Festival 2014.[2]
