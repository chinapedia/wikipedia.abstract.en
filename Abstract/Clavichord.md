The CLAVICHORD is a European stringed rectangular keyboard instrument[1] that was used largely in the Late Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras.[2] Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances.[3] The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.[4]
