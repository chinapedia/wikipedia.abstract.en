The MCNEIL HOMESTEAD is a historic ferry-related property off Wings Point Road in Charlotte, Vermont. The complex includes a 19th-century house, former tavern, and barn, all built by members of the McNeil family, the first operators of the Charlotte-Essex Ferry, whose eastern terminus is just south of the property. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[1]
