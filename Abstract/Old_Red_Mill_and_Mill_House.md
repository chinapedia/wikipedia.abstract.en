The OLD RED MILL AND MILL HOUSE are a historic 19th-century mill building and residence on Red Mill Drive in Jericho, Vermont. The mill was built in 1856 and enlarged later in the 19th century, accommodating then state-of-the art grain rollers, and was a prominent local business. The house was built in 1859, and is a good local example of Gothic Revival architecture. The mill is now a museum property of the local JERICHO HISTORICAL SOCIETY. The mill building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972; the listing was expanded to include the house in 1976.[1]
