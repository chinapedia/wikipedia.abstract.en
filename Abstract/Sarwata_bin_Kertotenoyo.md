SARWATA BIN KERTOTENOYO was the tenth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia.[1] Bin Kertotenoyo led an investigation by the Supreme Court into allegations of its own wrongdoing in 1996, during which his panel found no evidence of such wrongdoing. His promotion as Chief Justice thereafter was seen as a victory for the Court's old elite.[2] He was the first Chief Justice of Indonesia to be openly accused of corruption.[3]
