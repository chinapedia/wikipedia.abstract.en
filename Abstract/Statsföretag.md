_STATSFÃ–RETAG_ was a Swedish government holding company and national wealth fund for more than 20 years. The company was created by the Swedish Parliament to centralize and consolidate state ownership of public commercial assets especially within heavy industries such as shipyard, steel and forestry. During the economic crisis of the 1970s in Sweden, several other assets were nationalized and the activities of the company became organized along multiple industrial segments.
