Elizabeth_Eames.png ELIZABETH EAMES (24 June 1918 â€“ 20 September 2008)[1] was a British archaeologist and scholar who specialised in the study of medieval tiles. Her expertise grew out of a job at the British Museum which involved cataloguing and conserving their collection of decorated English medieval floor tiles. She became an authority on this aspect of medieval archaeology and, as well as publishing books and articles, moved on to excavation of further tiles from pavements and kilns, and the study of medieval building techniques. She also taught in a variety of settings.
