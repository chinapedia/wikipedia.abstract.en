The AMISTAD MEMORIAL in New Haven, Connecticut is a bronze sculpture created by Ed Hamilton to recognize the events of the 1839 Amistad Affair.[1][2] The affair was a kidnapping of 53 Africans and their subsequent mutiny aboard _La Amistad_. It led to a historically significant United States Supreme Court case, in which the Amistad captives were ruled to be acting in self-defense, thereby granting them the right to mutiny.
