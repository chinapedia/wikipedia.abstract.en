In programming and hacking culture, a SCRIPT KIDDIE, SKIDDIE,[1] or SKID is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites, such as a web shell. It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities.[2] However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant. The term is considered to be derogatory.
