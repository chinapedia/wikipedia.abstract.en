The PARETO PRINCIPLE (also known as the 80/20 RULE, the LAW OF THE VITAL FEW, or the PRINCIPLE OF FACTOR SPARSITY)[1][2] states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.[3] Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first work, _Cours d'Ã©conomie politique_. Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.
