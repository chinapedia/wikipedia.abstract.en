ASIC5 gene is one of the five paralogous genes that encode proteins that form trimeric ACID-SENSING ION CHANNELS (ASICs) in mammals.[1] Aliases previously used for this gene include ACCN5 and BASIC. The protein encoded by this gene does not appear to be acid responsive. The cDNA coding for this protein was first characterized in 2000.[2] The ASIC genes have splicing variants that encode different proteins that are called isoforms.
