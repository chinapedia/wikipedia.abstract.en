MARARISON, also known as MALALISON by travelers, is a small island beach destination and a barangay in Culasi in the Antique Province, on the island of Panay in the Philippines. The beauty of the island was only seen by media after the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan in the province. Mararison is just behind the world's most popular beach destination, Boracay. Mararison or Malalison means the one who is fond of violating or the one who refuses to follow rules.
