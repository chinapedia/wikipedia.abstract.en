The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος __, "feces" and φαγεῖν __, "to eat". _Coprophagy_ refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the anus.[2]
