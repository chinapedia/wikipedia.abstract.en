Ran_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg, 1901]] In Norse mythology, RÁN is a goddess and a personification of the sea. Rán and her husband Ægir, a jötunn who also personifies the sea, have nine daughters, who personify waves. The goddess is frequently associated with a net, which she uses to capture sea-goers. According to the prose introduction to a poem in the _Poetic Edda_ and in _Völsunga saga_, Rán once loaned her net to the god Loki.
