HISTORICISM is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be hermeneutical because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.[1] The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as empiricism and rationalism, which neglect the role of traditions.
