Christianity is rooted in Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first centuries of the Christian Era. Christianity emphasizes correct belief (or orthodoxy), focusing on the New Covenant as mediated through Jesus Christ,[1] as recorded in the New Testament. Judaism places emphasis on correct conduct (or orthopraxy),[2][3][4] focusing on the Mosaic covenant, as recorded in the Torah and Talmud.
