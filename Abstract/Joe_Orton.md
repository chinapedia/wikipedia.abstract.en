JOHN KINGSLEY ORTON (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967), known under the pen name of JOE ORTON, was an English playwright, author and diarist. His public career—from 1964 until his death in 1967—was short but highly influential.[1][2][3][4][5] During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective _Ortonesque_ refers to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.[6]
