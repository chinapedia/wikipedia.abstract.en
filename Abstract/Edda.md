"EDDA" (; Old Norse _Edda_, plural _Eddur_) is an Old Norse term that has been attributed by modern scholars to the collective of two Medieval Icelandic literary works: what is now known as the _Prose Edda_ and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the _Poetic Edda_. The term historically referred only to the _Prose Edda_, but this since has fallen out of use because of the confusion with the other work. Both works were written down in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the Viking Age. The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition in Iceland and Norse mythology.
