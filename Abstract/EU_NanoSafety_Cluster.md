The EU NANOSAFETY CLUSTER (NSC) is a cluster of European Commission-funded projects in the funding programs FP6 (2002–2006), FP7 (2007–2013), and Horizon 2020 aka H2020 (2014–2020) framework programmes, aimed at harmonizing the research done in these projects.[1] The cluster coordinates work done by the NanoSafety Cluster projects to study and establish the safety of nanomaterials.[2][3] The coordination by the cluster is organized in half-yearly meetings and various working groups. An example of a result of the NanoSafety Cluster's harmonization was the prioritization of which nanomaterials to study.[4] The NSC has become a reference actor for consumers' associations in the field.[5]
