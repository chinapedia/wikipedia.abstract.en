JOHN NORMAN HAYNES (17 October 1934 – 18 October 2005) was an English footballer, best known for his 18 years at Fulham. An inside forward, Haynes is widely regarded as the greatest footballer ever to play for the west London club, particularly noted for his exceptional passing skill and ability to read a game. An accomplished international, he made 56 appearances for his country, including 22 as captain (many of them while playing for Fulham in the Second Division). His passing ability earned him the nickname "the Maestro".[1] Haynes became the first player to be paid £100 a week, immediately following the abolition of the £20 maximum wage in 1961.[2] Pelé was once quoted as calling Haynes the "best passer of the ball I've ever seen".[3]
