is a fighting video game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sixth main entry in the _Marvel vs. Capcom_ series of crossover games. Like previous installments, players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles. _Infinite_ features two-on-two fights, as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles. The series' character assist moves have been removed; instead, the game incorporates a tag-based combo system, which allows players to instantly switch between their two characters to form continuous combos. It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones, which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected.
