The 2018 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ELECTIONS were held on November 6, 2018, with early voting taking place in some states in the weeks preceding that date. Voters chose representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states. Non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories were also elected. These midterm elections took place nearly halfway through the first term of Republican President Donald Trump. On Election Day, Republicans had held a House majority since January 2011.[1]
