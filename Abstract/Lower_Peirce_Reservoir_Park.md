LOWER PEIRCE RESERVOIR PARK is a park located along Old Upper Thomson Road in Singapore and overlooks Lower Peirce Reservoir, Singapore's second oldest reservoir. A mature secondary rainforest lines the bank with numerous rubber trees and oil palms. A 900-metre boardwalk constructed in Nov 1998 provides an outdoor classroom for nature study and recreation in a natural forest environment. Interpretative boards on the flora and fauna in the forest serves as a guide together with bum rest, scenic view and picnic points along the route. The boardwalk was specially routed and built on existing trails to elevate the compaction and soil erosion caused by the overuse of these trails in the forest to ensure the protection floral and fauna on the forest floor.[1]
