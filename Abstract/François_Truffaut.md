FRANÇOIS ROLAND TRUFFAUT (; 6 February 1932 – 21 October 1984) was a French film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film critic. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of the French New Wave.[1] In a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the French film industry, having worked on over 25 films. Truffaut's film _The 400 Blows_ came to be a defining film of the French New Wave movement, and was followed by four sequels, _Antoine et Colette_, _Stolen Kisses_, _Bed and Board_, and _Love on the Run_, between 1958 and 1979.
