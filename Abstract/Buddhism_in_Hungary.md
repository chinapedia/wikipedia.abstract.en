BUDDHISM IN HUNGARY exists since 1951 when Ernő Hetényi founded Buddhist Mission in Germany as a member of the Arya Maitreya Mandala Buddhist order (Mahayana school). However, the first Buddhist community had been founded in the 1890s in Máramarossziget (today Sighetu Marmației, part of Romania). József Hollósy took refuge and he wrote _Buddhista Kátét_ (1893) the first Buddhist catechism in Hungarian. According to this Dharma has been present in Hungary for more than a century. In 1933 Hungarian philologist and Orientalist, author of the first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book Sándor Kőrösi Csoma was recognised as a bodhisattva in Japan. In Hungary József Hollósy is regarded as the second bodhisattva.[1]
