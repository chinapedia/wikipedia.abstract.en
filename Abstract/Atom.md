An ATOM is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of either neutral (un-ionized), or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (, a ten-millionth of a millimeter, or 1/254,000,000 of an inch). They are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects: current atomic models have incorporated quantum mechanics to better explain and predict this behavior.
