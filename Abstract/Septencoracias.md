_SEPTENCORACIAS_ is an extinct genus of bird related to modern rollers and other Coraciiformes such as kingfishers, bee-eaters, motmots, and todies. It contains one species, _SEPTENCORACIAS MORSENSIS_.[1] It was found in the Fur Formation of Denmark, dating back to the Ypresian of the Lower Eocene Epoch, about 54 million years ago. _Septencoracias_ is one of the earliest known members of Coraciiformes, lending insight into the earliest radiation of this group.
