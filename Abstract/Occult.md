The OCCULT (from the Latin word _occultus_ "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden" or "knowledge of the paranormal", as opposed to facts and "knowledge of the measurable", usually referred to as science.[1][2] The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends pure reason and the physical sciences.[3] The terms _esoteric_ and _arcane_ can also be used to describe the occult,[4] in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural.
