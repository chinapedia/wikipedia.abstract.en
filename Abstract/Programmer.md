The term _computer programmer_ can refer to a specialist in one area of computers, or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. The generalist programmers aren't required to have any knowledge of the fields and of the problems that the users want to solve or of the tasks to automate. This is the job of the analysts, people who act as interfaces between the field practitioners and the programmers. When the analysis is done, the analysts create some kind of symbolic description of the system using languages like UML, blueprints that the programmers use to build the computer software. Sometimes, especially when the domain of the problems aren't much complex and the working groups are small, analysis, system design, and coding are carried out by PROGRAMMER ANALYST. On the other hand, _code monkey_ is a derogatory term for a programmer who simply writes code without any involvement in the design or specifications.
