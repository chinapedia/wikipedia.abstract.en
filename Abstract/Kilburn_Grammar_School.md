KILBURN GRAMMAR SCHOOL, in north-west London, was founded in 1897, and ceased to exist in 1967. Its history is detailed in a book by Richard E Brock.[1] It was founded by the Rev. Dr. H G Bonavia Hunt, vicar of St Paul's, Kilburn, at a time when there was no general state provision for secondary education. The new boys' school opened in one room at 1 Willesden Lane in January 1898, then occupied two rooms at the Polytechnic Institute at Priory Park Road, moving again in 1899 to a house at 28 Cavendish Road.
