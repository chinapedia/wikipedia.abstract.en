OLD ENGLISH LITERATURE or ANGLO-SAXON LITERATURE, encompasses literature written in Old English, in Anglo-Saxon England from the 7th century to the decades after the Norman Conquest of 1066. "CÃ¦dmon's Hymn", composed in the 7th century, according to Bede, is often considered the oldest extant poem in English. Poetry written in the mid-12th century represents some of the latest post-Norman examples of Old English;[1] for example, _The Soul's Address to the Body_ (c. 1150-1175) found in Worcester Cathedral Library MS F. 174 contains only one word of possible Latinate origin, while also maintaining a corrupt alliterative meter and Old English grammar and syntax, albeit in a degenerative state (hence, early scholars of Old English termed this late form as "Semi-Saxon").[2][3] The _Peterborough Chronicle_ can also be considered a late-period text, continuing into the 12th century. The strict adherence to the grammatical rules of Old English is largely inconsistent in 12th century work - as is evident in the works cited above - and by the 13th century the grammar and syntax of Old English had almost completely deteriorated, giving way to the much larger Middle English corpus of literature.[4][5][6]
