BHABA PAGLA (; October 17, 1902 - February 26, 1984) was a Bengali lyricist, composer, devotee of Goddess Kali and spiritual master of many dedicated souls.[1] He is held in high esteem in Bengali folk culture. Perhaps his conventional education did not exceed the primary level in school but his creations, mostly lyrics, had been sunk into a deep inner meaning and located in a high thought though common words used for cultural expression. The lyrics also had been composed by him with easy harmony to entertain the mass. Theyarnumerous by number. Hearsay is that he composed more than eighty six thousand songs in his lifetime.
