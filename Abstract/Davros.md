DAVROS is a character from the long-running British science fiction television series _Doctor Who_. He was created by screenwriter Terry Nation, originally for the 1975 serial _Genesis of the Daleks_. Davros is a major enemy of the series' protagonist, the Doctor, and is the creator of the Doctor's deadliest enemies, the Daleks. Davros is a genius who has mastered many areas of science, but also a megalomaniac who believes that through his creations he can become the supreme being and ruler of the Universe. The character has been compared to the infamous dictator Adolf Hitler several times, including by the actor Terry Molloy,[1] while Julian Bleach defined him as a cross between Hitler and the renowned scientist Stephen Hawking.[2]
