ABORTION is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus.[1] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word _abortion_ generally refers to an induced abortion.[2][3] A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a "late termination of pregnancy" or less accurately as a "late term abortion".[4]
