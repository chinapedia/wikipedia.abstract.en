PROSPERO ALPINI (also known as PROSPER ALPINUS, PROSPERO ALPINIO and Latinized as PROSPERUS ALPINUS) (23 November 15536 February 1617), was an Italian physician and botanist from the Republic of Venice. He travelled around Egypt and served as the fourth prefect in charge of the botanical garden of Padua. He wrote several botanical treatises which covered exotic plants of economic and medicinal value. His description of coffee and banana plants are considered the oldest in European literature. The ginger-family genus _Alpinia_ was named in his honour by Carolus Linnaeus.
