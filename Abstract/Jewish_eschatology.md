JEWISH ESCHATOLOGY is the area of Jewish philosophy and theology concerned with events that will happen in the end of days and related concepts. This includes the ingathering of the exiled diaspora, the coming of a Jewish Messiah, afterlife, and the revival of the dead Tzadikim. In Judaism, the end times are usually called the "end of days" (_aḥarit ha-yamim_, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh.
