John_Ray_by_Roubiliac,_British_Museum.jpg, British Museum]] JOHN RAY FRS (29 November 1627 â€“ 17 January 1705) was an English naturalist widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English parson-naturalists.[1] Until 1670, he wrote his name as JOHN WRAY. From then on, he used 'Ray', after "having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him".[2] He published important works on botany, zoology, and natural theology. His classification of plants in his _Historia Plantarum_, was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived, either/or type system , and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of _species_.[3]
