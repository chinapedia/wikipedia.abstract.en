The ECONOMY OF NEW ZEALAND is the 53rd-largest national economy in the world when measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and the 68th-largest in the world when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). New Zealand has one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade â€“ mainly with Australia, the European Union, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Canada. New Zealand's Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia means that the economy aligns closely with that of Australia. A regional and emerging power[1][2], New Zealand has quite a large GDP for its size and population.
