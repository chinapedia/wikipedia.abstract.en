The CONCERTO FOR ENGLISH HORN AND ORCHESTRA is a composition for solo English horn and orchestra by the American composer Ned Rorem. The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic to commemorate the orchestra's sesquicentennial anniversary. It was first performed by the soloist Thomas Stacy and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Kurt Masur at Avery Fisher Hall on January 27, 1994.[1] Rorem dedicated the piece to Thomas Stacy.[2] The work is one of the few prominent contemporary English horn concertos, along with James MacMillan's _The World's Ransoming_.[3][4]
