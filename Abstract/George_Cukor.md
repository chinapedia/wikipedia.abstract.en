GEORGE DEWEY CUKOR (;[1] July 7, 1899 – January 24, 1983) was an American film director.[2] He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations. His career flourished at RKO when David O. Selznick, the studio's Head of Production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including _What Price Hollywood?_ (1932), _A Bill of Divorcement_ (1932), _Our Betters_ (1933), and _Little Women_ (1933). When Selznick moved to MGM in 1933, Cukor followed and directed _Dinner at Eight_ (1933) and _David Copperfield_ (1935) for Selznick and _Romeo and Juliet_ (1936) and _Camille_ (1936) for Irving Thalberg.
