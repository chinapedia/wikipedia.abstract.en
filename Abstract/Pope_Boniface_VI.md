POPE BONIFACE VI (; 806 â€“ April 896) was Pope in April 896. He was a native of Rome.[1] His election came about as a result of riots soon after the death of Pope Formosus. Prior to his reign, he had twice incurred a sentence of deprivation of orders as a subdeacon and as a priest.[2] After a pontificate of fifteen days, he is said by some to have died of the gout,[3] by others to have been forcibly ejected to make way for Stephen VI, the candidate of the Spoletan party.[4]
