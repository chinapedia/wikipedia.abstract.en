The AIMAQ (), also transliterated as _Aimak_ and _Aymaq_, are a collection of Persian-speaking nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.[1] Aimaqs live mostly in the West Central highlands of Afghanistan, immediately to the north of Herat, in Pakistan in the Kyber and Balochistan region and also to a much lesser amount in the Khorasan Province of Iran.[2] They speak a number of subdialects of the Aimaq dialect of Persian, however some southern groups of Taymani and Maleki Aymaqs have adopted the Pashto language.[3]
