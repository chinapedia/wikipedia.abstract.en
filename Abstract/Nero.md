NERO (; Latin: _Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus_; 15 December 37 â€“ 9 June 68 AD) was the last Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.[1][2] He was adopted by his great-uncle Claudius and became Claudius' heir and successor.[3] Like Claudius, Nero became emperor with the consent of the Praetorian Guard. Nero's mother, Agrippina the Younger, was likely implicated in Claudius' death and Nero's nomination as emperor. She dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off. Five years into his reign, he had her murdered.[4]
