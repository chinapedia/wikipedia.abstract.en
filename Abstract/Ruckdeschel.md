RUCKDESCHEL is a surname of German origin.[1][2][3][4] Its literal meaning is backpack or rucksack (compositum of Middle High German _Rucke_ for back (cf. German Rücken) and the diminutive of the German word Tasche (_Täschel/Däschel/Teschel/Deschel_) for bag) and it was used in its area of origin – which closely corresponds to the contemporary Bavarian administrative region of Upper Franconia[5] – to describe a journeyman. Outside of Germany the surname is most often found among German Americans in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States.[6]
