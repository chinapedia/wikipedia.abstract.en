The QUADRIVIUM (plural: quadrivia[1]) is the four subjects, or arts (namely arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), taught after teaching the trivium. The word is Latin, meaning _four ways_, and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to Boethius or Cassiodorus in the 6th century.[2][3] Together, the trivium and the quadrivium comprised the seven liberal arts (based on thinking skills),[4] as distinguished from the practical arts (such as medicine and architecture).

To seek these principles, therefore, would be to seek God.]]
