JAMES GRAHAM BALLARD (15 November 193019 April 2009)[1] was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist who first became associated with the New Wave of science fiction for his post-apocalyptic novels such as _The Wind from Nowhere_ (1961) and _The Drowned World_ (1962). In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or "condensed novels"), such as those collected in the controversial _The Atrocity Exhibition_ (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial _Crash_ (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and _High-Rise_ (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos.
