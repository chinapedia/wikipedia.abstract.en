GREJS RIVER () is an approximately river in Vejle Municipality in Denmark. Its source is Fårup Lake, south of the village of Jelling. It starts by heading east through a tunnel valley, then turns south to run through GREJS VALLEY (), the largest gorge in Denmark, until it reaches the city of Vejle.[1] North of Vejle, it splits into two branches, Omløbsåen ("Bypass River") and Mølleåen ("Mill River"). Omløbsåen runs west around the city centre to meet Vejle River, while Mølleåen flows through the city and empties into Vejle River just south of the city centre.
