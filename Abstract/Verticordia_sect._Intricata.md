_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _INTRICATA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes three species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are usually bushy shrubs, sometimes cauliflower-like, with greyish leaves and fluffy or woolly pink to red, sometimes white flowers. The sepals have intricately branched lobes and hairy appendages and the stamens and staminodes are joined in a ring structure.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Intricata_ is from the Latin word _intricatus_ meaning "entangled" or "complicated"[4] referring to the intricately divided sepals.[5]
