Most transportation in Cape Verde is done by plane. There are regular flights to and from the major islands (Santiago, Sal and SÃ£o Vicente), with less frequent flights to the other islands. Boat transportation is also available, though not widely used nor dependable. In the major cities, public bus transport runs periodically and taxis are common. In smaller towns, there are mostly hiaces and/or taxis.[1]
