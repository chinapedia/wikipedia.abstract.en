Norah_Aiton.jpg NORAH AITON (1903â€“1988) was a British architect who was an early proponent of the modernist style. Around 1930 she and her partner Betty Scott set up the architectural practice of Aiton & Scott. Their best-known work is the office building for the Aiton & Company pipe manufacturing company in Derby. This was remarkable both as a striking early example of modernist industrial architecture and also as a building designed by two of the small number of women working in architecture at that time.
