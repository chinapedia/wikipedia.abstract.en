_THE BLACK ALBUM_ is an unofficial compilation album of solo material by members of the British rock group the Beatles. It was created by the American actor Ethan Hawke, and became widely known as a result of its inclusion in the 2014 film _Boyhood_. Hawke compiled the record to give to his daughter Maya on her 13th birthday in 2011, including personalised liner notes; it was then incorporated into _Boyhood_ in scenes shot later that year, with Hawke's character giving it to his son as a birthday present. The compilation contains 51 tracks from Beatles members following the band's breakup in 1970. Critical reaction to _The Black Album_ was generally positive: _The Desert Sun_ described it as "a great listen", while _USA Today_ called it "quite a compilation". In an analysis for the _New York Daily News_, Jim Farber suggested that the record was "a metaphor for divorce".
