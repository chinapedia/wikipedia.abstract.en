ALBANY PARK THEATER PROJECT, also known as APTP, is a multiethnic youth theater ensemble based in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago. The mission of the theater is to inspire people to envision a more just and beautiful world by dedicating time to art, youth, and social justice.[1] All of APTP's theater is original, devised together by adult theater professionals and youth artists, and is based on the gathered stories and interviews of individuals throughout the city of Chicago and most often in the Albany Park community. Albany Park is the United States' third most diverse neighborhood, is a large port of entry for immigrants from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, and is widely working class and low income.[2][3][4]
