_QUAKE II_ is a first-person shooter video game released in December 1997. It was developed by id Software and published by Activision. It is not a direct sequel to _Quake_; id decided to revert to an existing trademark when the game's fast-paced, tactile feel felt closer to a _Quake_ game than a new franchise.[1] The game is followed by Quake IV.
