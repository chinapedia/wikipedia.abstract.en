The LYNGIADES MASSACRE, which took place on October 3, 1943, was a Nazi German war crime perpetrated by members of the 1st Mountain Division of the _Wehrmacht Heer_ during the Axis occupation of Greece. The village of Lyngiades, near Ioannina in northwestern Greece, was arbitrarily chosen as a target for reprisals by the Wehrmacht due to the killing of a German officer by members of the Greek Resistance. The vast majority of the victims were children, women and elderly.
