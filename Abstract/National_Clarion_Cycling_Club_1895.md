In 2006 a splinter group from National Clarion Cycling Club called National Clarion Cycling Club 1895 North Lancs Union was formed to preserve the history and principles of the Club. In November 2017 National Clarion Cycling Club invited Clarion 1895 to join it as a section. However, in February 2018 it retracted that offer without valid reason.[1]
