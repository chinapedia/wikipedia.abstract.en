The Reception and Orientation Center ("Centres d’accueil et d’orientation - CAO") is a French government program for asylum seekers that provide migrants with information and temporary accommodation. At the CAOs, migrants have access to health care, social and administrative support by qualified agents and associations.[1] The centers are located in "former gendarme barracks, disused hospitals and training-centres, and out-of-season holiday villages".[2] Currently, there are around 450 CAOs.
