_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _MICRANTHA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes three species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section small shrubs with tiny flowers smelling faintly like mice. The floral cup has five ribs on its sides.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia[2][3] The name _Micrantha_ is derived from the Ancient Greek _mikros_ meaning "small"[4] and _anthos_ meaning "flower"[5] in reference to the small flowers of plants in this section.[6]
