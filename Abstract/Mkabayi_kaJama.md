Princess MKABAYI KAJAMA, born c. 1750, was the daughter of Zulu king, Jama kaNdaba. Born a twin, Zulu custom required that one of the two girls be killed at birth to avoid bad luck and the wrath of the ancestors but King Jama acted contrary to tradition and spared both Mkabayi and her sister, Mmama. For this reason, and being of stronger character than her sister, Mkabayi grew up being resented by the Zulu people and was blamed for much of the chiefdom's misfortune.
