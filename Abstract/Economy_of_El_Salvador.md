Compared to other developing countries, El Salvador has experienced relatively low rates of GDP growth. Rates have not risen above the low single digits in nearly two decades â€“ part of broader environment of macroeconomic instability which the integration of the US dollar has done little to improve.[1] One problem that the Salvadoran economy faces is the inequality in the distribution of income. In 2011, El Salvador had a Gini Coefficient of .485,[2] which although similar to that of the United States,[3] leaves 37.8% of the population below the poverty line,[4] due to lower aggregate income. The richest 10% of the population receives approximately 15 times the income of the poorest 40%.[5]
