The IMPROPER SOLICITATION AND GRAFT ACT (colloquially, KIM YOUNG-RAN ACT) is a 2016 anti-corruption law in South Korea. The bill is associated with Kim Young-ran, former head of the Anticorruption and Civil Rights Commission, who proposed it in August 2012, and is often referred to as the KIM YOUNG-RAN ACT (or Law, or Bill).[1] The bill has also been translated as ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY PROHIBITION ACT, though "Improper Solicitation and Graft Act" is the official name.[2][3] The law was passed in 2015 and started being enforced on September 28, 2016.[4]
