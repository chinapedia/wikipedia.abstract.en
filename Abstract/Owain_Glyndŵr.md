OWAIN AB GRUFFYDD, LORD OF GLYNDYFRDWY (c. 1359 – c. 1415), or simply OWAIN GLYNDŴR or GLYN DŴR (, anglicized to OWEN GLENDOWER), was a Welsh rebel who instigated a fierce and long-running yet ultimately unsuccessful war of independence with the aim of ending English rule in Wales during the Late Middle Ages. He was the last native Welshman to hold the title Prince of Wales (_Tywysog Cymru_).
