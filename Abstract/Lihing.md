LIHING is a type of Malaysian rice wine that originated from the state of Sabah. It was made from "pulut", a glutinous rice and is a traditional rice wine for the Kadazan-Dusun people.[1] The rice wine is also referred as HIING (in certain Dusun dialects), KINARUNG, KINOMOL, KINOPI, LINAHAS, SAGANTANG as well TAPAI.[2] They are different from one another, but all are made from rice-based drinks. Lihing is sold widely in Sabah including in some major hotels.
