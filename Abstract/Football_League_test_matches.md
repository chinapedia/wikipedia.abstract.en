FOOTBALL LEAGUE TEST MATCHES were a series of post-season football play-off matches organised by the Football League, to determine the membership of the worst finishers of the First Division and the best of the Second Division. They were first contested at the end of the 1892–93 season, following the inaugural season of the Second Division, and were replaced with automatic promotion and relegation from 1898–99.
