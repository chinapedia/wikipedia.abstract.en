Its exact value is (approximately [1]). It is exact because by international agreement a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 second.[2] According to special relativity, is the maximum speed at which all conventional matter and hence all known forms of information in the universe can travel. Though this speed is most commonly associated with light, it is in fact the speed at which all massless particles and changes of the associated fields travel in vacuum (including electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves). Such particles and waves travel at regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer. In the special and general theories of relativity, interrelates space and time, and also appears in the famous equation of massâ€“energy equivalence .[3]
