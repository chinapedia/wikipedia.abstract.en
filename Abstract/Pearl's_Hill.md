PEARL'S HILL, briefly MOUNT STAMFORD, is a small hill in Singapore. Located in the vicinity of Chinatown, it is one of the few surviving hills in the city area. Pearl's Hill is well known for once being the site of the former multiple notable institutional buildings such as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Seaman's hospital and the Pearl's Hill Prison. The Pearl's Hill Prison is located there because of the close proximity to Sepoy Lines as it was thought to provide protection and security for the prison.
