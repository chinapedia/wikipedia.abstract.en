COMMON BUT DIFFERENTIATED RESPONSIBILITIES (CBDR) was formalized in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, 1992. The CBDR principle is mentioned in UNFCCC article 3 paragraph 1..,[1] and article 4 paragraph 1.[2] It was the first international legal instrument to address climate change and the most comprehensive international attempt to address negative impacts to global environment.[3] CBDR principle acknowledges all states have shared obligation to address environmental destruction but denies equal responsibility of all states with regard to environmental protection.
