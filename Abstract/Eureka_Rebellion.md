The EUREKA REBELLION was a rebellion in 1854, instigated by gold miners in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, who revolted against the colonial authority of the United Kingdom. It culminated in the BATTLE OF THE EUREKA STOCKADE, which was fought between miners and the colonial forces of Australia on 3 December 1854 at Eureka Lead and named for the stockade structure built by miners during the conflict.[1] The rebellion resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people, the majority of whom were rebels.
