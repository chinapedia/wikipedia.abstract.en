"MILLION DOLLAR LOAN" is a song by American indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie. It was released on October 10, 2016 as the first song in the Dave Eggers-headed project _30 Days, 50 Songs_. Like the other songs in the project, the song lyrically takes aim at Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the country's 2016 election. The project aimed to release one song every day from October 10 until Election Day, all of which are, according to its website, "written and recorded by musicians for a Trump-free America."[1] It is the band's first new song since the 2015 album _Kintsugi_.[2]
