The ALI RULE, or AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE MODEL PENAL CODE RULE, is a recommended rule for instructing juries how to find a defendant in a criminal trial is not guilty by reason of insanity.[1] It broadened the M'Naghten rule of whether a defendant was so mentally ill that she is unable to "know" the nature and quality of her criminal act, or know its wrongfulness, to a question of whether she had "substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [her] conduct".[2] It also added a volitional component as to whether defendant was lacking in "substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the law".[3] It arose from the case of ''United States v. Brawner.[4]
