AGRIPPINA THE YOUNGER (Latin: _Julia Agrippina_; 6 November AD 15 â€“ 23 March AD 59), also referred to as AGRIPPINA MINOR ("smaller", often used to mean "younger")[1] was a Roman empress and one of the more prominent women in the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Her father was Germanicus, a popular general and one-time heir apparent to the Roman Empire under Tiberius; and her mother was Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of the first Roman emperor Augustus. She was also the younger sister of Caligula, as well as the niece and fourth wife of Claudius.
