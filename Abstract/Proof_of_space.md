PROOF OF SPACE (POSPACE), also called PROOF-OF-CAPACITY (POC), is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service (such as sending an email) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider. The concept was formulated by Dziembowski _et al._[1] in 2015 and with a different formal definition by Ateniese _et al._ [2] in 2014.
