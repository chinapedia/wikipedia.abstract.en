(derivative short form of GL TRANSMISSION FORMAT) is a file format for 3D scenes and models using the JSON standard. It is an API-neutral runtime asset delivery format developed by the Khronos Group 3D Formats Working Group. It was announced at HTML5DevConf 2016. This format is intended to be an efficient, interoperable format with minimum file size and runtime processing by apps. As such, its creators have described it as the "JPEG of 3D." glTF also defines a common publishing format for 3D content tools and services.
