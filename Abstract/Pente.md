PENTE is a strategy board game for two or more players, created in 1977 by Gary Gabrel, a dishwasher at Hideaway Pizza, in Stillwater, Oklahoma.[1] Customers played Pente at Hideaway Pizza on checkerboard tablecloths while waiting for their orders to arrive. Thirty years later, patrons are still playing Pente at Hideaway Pizza, although now with roll-up Pente boards. Pente is based on the Japanese game NINUKI-RENJU, a variant of renju or gomoku that is played on a Go board of 19x19 intersections with white and black stones. Like _ninuki-renju,_ Pente allows captures, but Pente added a new opening rule. In the nineteenth century, _gomoku_ was introduced to Britain where it was known as "Go Bang." (borrowed from Japanese "goban" 碁盤 meaning "go board")[2]
