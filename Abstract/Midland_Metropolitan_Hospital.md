MIDLAND METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL is a new acute general hospital being built on a site in Grove Lane at Smethwick near Birmingham. The hospital was designed by a team led by HKS and including Edward Williams Architects and Sonnemann Toon Architects. Already behind its original target completion date of October 2018, it was being built by Carillion. However, the company went into liquidation in January 2018, causing the PFI contract to be terminated and delaying the hospital's completion until at least late 2021.
