The BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION (BC) is a library classification system that was created by Henry E. Bliss (1870â€“1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the United States, it was more commonly adopted by British libraries.[1] A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.
