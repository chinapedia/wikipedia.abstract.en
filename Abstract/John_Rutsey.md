JOHN HOWARD RUTSEY (July 23, 1952 â€“ May 11, 2008)[1] was a Canadian drummer best known as a co-founding member of Rush. He performed on the band's debut album but left in 1974, due to musical differences and health problems. He was replaced by Neil Peart. Tape-recorded comments from Rutsey are heard in the 2010 documentary _Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage_, and the DVD release includes two performances with him on drums.
