The elm cultivar _ULMUS_ 'TURKESTANICA' was first described by Regel as _U. turkestanica_ in Dieck, _Hauptcat. Baumschul. Zöschen_ (1883)[1] and in _Gartenflora_ (1884).[2][3] Regel himself later stressed that "_U. turkestanica_ was only a preliminary name given by me; I regard this as a form of _U. suberosa_ [:_U. minor_]".[4] 'Turkestanica' was distributed in Europe as _U. turkestanica_ Regel by the Späth nursery of Berlin, in whose catalogues it was listed separately from _U. pinnato-ramosa_, now _U. pumila_ 'Pinnato-ramosa', and from _U. campestris umbraculifera_,[5] with both of which it was later confused – the former by Elwes and Henry, the latter (as _U._ 'Turkestanica') by Green.[6] The Hesse Nursery of Weener, Germany, sold an _Ulmus turkestanica_ Reg. in the 1930s, but gave _U. pumila arborea_ Litv., another name for 'Pinnato-ramosa', as a synonym.[7]
