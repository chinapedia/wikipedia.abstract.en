POPE VICTOR I (Birth year not known - died 199) was Bishop of Rome and hence a pope, in the late second century (189–199 A.D.). He was of Berber origin.[1][2] The dates of his tenure are uncertain, but one source states he became pope in 189 and gives the year of his death as 199.[3] He was the first bishop of Rome born in the Roman Province of Africa—probably in Leptis Magna (or Tripolitania). He was later considered a saint. His feast day was celebrated on 28 July as "St Victor I, Pope and Martyr".[4]
