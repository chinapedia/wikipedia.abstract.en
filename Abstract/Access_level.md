In computer science and computer programming, ACCESS LEVEL denotes the set of permissions or restrictions provided to a data type. Reducing access level is an effective method for limiting failure modes, debugging time and overall system complexity. It restricts variable modification to only the methods defined within the interface to the class. Thus, it is incorporated into many fundamental software design patterns. In general, a given object cannot be created, read, updated or deleted by any function without having a sufficient access level.
