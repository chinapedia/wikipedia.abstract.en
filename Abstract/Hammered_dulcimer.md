The HAMMERED DULCIMER (also called the HAMMER DULCIMER, DULCIMER, or TYMPANON) is a percussion-stringed instrument which consists of strings typically stretched over a trapezoidal resonant sound board. The hammered dulcimer is set before the musician, who in more traditional styles may sit cross-legged on the floor, or in a more modern style may stand or sit at a wooden support with legs. The player holds a small spoon-shaped mallet hammer in each hand to strike the strings (see Appalachian dulcimer). The Graeco-Roman _dulcimer_ ("sweet song") derives from the Latin _dulcis_ (sweet) and the Greek _melos_ (song). The dulcimer, in which the strings are beaten with small hammers, originated from the psaltery, in which the strings are plucked.[1]
