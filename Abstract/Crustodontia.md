_CRUSTODONTIA_ is a fungal genus of uncertain familial placement in the order Polyporales. The genus was circumscribed in 2005 to contain the crust fungus _CRUSTODONTIA CHRYSOCREAS_.[1] This species was originally described as _Corticium chrysocreas_ by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873. Their description was as follows: "Subiculum bright yellow, thin; hymenium immarginate pallid, or yellow tinged with tawny."[2] _Crustodontia_ has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning it contains only generative hyphae, and these hyphae have clamp connections.[3]
