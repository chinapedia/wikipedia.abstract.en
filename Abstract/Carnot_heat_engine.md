Carnot-engine-1824.png cross section of Carnot's heat engine. In this diagram, _abcd_ is a cylindrical vessel, _cd_ is a movable piston, and _A_ and _B_ are constant–temperature bodies. The vessel may be placed in contact with either body or removed from both (as it is here).[1] ]] A CARNOT HEAT ENGINE[2] is a theoretical engine that operates on the reversible Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857 from which the concept of entropy emerged.
