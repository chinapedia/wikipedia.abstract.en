, represented by a cast at the Pushkin Museum]] The AEGIS ( ;[1] _aigis_), as stated in the _Iliad_, is carried by Athena and Zeus, but its nature is uncertain. It had been interpreted as an animal skin or a shield, sometimes bearing the head of a Gorgon. There may be a connection with a deity named Aex _or Aix_, a daughter of Helios and a nurse of Zeus or alternatively a mistress of Zeus (Hyginus, _Astronomica_ 2. 13). The aegis of Athena is referred to in several places in the _Iliad_. "It produced a sound as from a myriad roaring dragons (_Iliad_, 4.17) and was borne by Athena in battle ... and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal: a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them, and each the worth of a hundred oxen."[2]
