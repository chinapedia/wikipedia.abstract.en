PIERRE-AUGUSTE RENOIR, commonly known as AUGUSTE RENOIR (; ; 25 February 1841 â€“ 3 December 1919), was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau."[1]
