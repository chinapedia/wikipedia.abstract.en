The SORBIAN LANGUAGES (, ) are two closely related, but only partially mutually intelligible, West Slavic languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic minority in the Lusatia region of eastern Germany. They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czechâ€“Slovak.[1] Historically, the languages have also been known as WENDISH (named after the Wends, earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or LUSATIAN. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is wen.
