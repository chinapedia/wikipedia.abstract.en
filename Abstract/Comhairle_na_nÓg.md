COMHAIRLE NA NÓG ("YOUTH COUNCIL" in English) are councils for the youth located in 31 locations in the Republic Of Ireland, which gives the youth in Ireland the opportunity to be involved in the progress of local services and policies. Comhairle na nÓg is for young people aged between 12-17 in secondary level education and allows them to have a voice on the issues, policies and services that affect them in their local areas, since they have no other voting mechanism to have their voice heard.[1]
