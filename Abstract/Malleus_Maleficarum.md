The _MALLEUS MALEFICARUM_,[1] usually translated as the _HAMMER OF WITCHES_,[2] is the best known and the most thorough treatise on witchcraft. It was written by the discredited Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer (under his Latinized name _Henricus Institoris_) and first published in the German city of Speyer in 1487.[3] It endorses extermination of witches and for this purpose develops a detailed legal and theological theory.[4] It was a bestseller, second only to the Bible in terms of sales for almost 200 years. It has been described as the compendium of literature in demonology of the fifteenth century.[5] The top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent with Catholic doctrines of demonology.[6]
