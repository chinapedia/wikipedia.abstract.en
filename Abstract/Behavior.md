BEHAVIOR (American English) or BEHAVIOUR (Commonwealth English)[1] is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment,[2] which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the computed response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.[3]
