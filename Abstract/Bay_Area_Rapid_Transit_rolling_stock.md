The rolling stock of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system's heavy rail component consists of 662 self-propelled electric multiple units, built from three separate orders.[1] To run a typical peak morning commute, BART requires 579 cars. Of those, 535 are scheduled to be in active service; the others are used to build up four spare trains (essential for maintaining on-time service).[2][3] At any one time, the remaining 90 cars are in for repair, maintenance, or some type of planned modification work.[4] All trains on the separate automated guideway transit line are in regular use without spares. Bombardier Transportation is manufacturing a complete replacement of the mainline fleet, due to be delivered in batches by Fall 2021. The first ten cars of this replacement fleet entered service in 2018, with all expected to enter service by 2022. With the withdrawal and retirement of the older fleet, there will be 775 vehicles in total, with long term goals of eventually increasing this to 1,200 cars. Eight light rail diesel multiple units are being used on a recent spur line.
