Filter_vs_ultrafilter.svg ↑{1,4} colored yellow. It is a _filter_, and even a _principal filter_. It is not an _ultrafilter_, as it can be extended to the larger nontrivial filter ↑{1}, by including also the light green elements. Since ↑{1} cannot be extended any further, it is an ultrafilter.]] In mathematics, a FILTER is a special subset of a partially ordered set. Filters appear in order and lattice theory, but can also be found in topology from where they originate. The dual notion of a filter is an ideal.
