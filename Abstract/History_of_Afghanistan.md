The HISTORY OF AFGHANISTAN, (__ __, __ __) as a state began in 1747 with its establishment by Ahmad Shah Durrani. The written recorded history of the land presently constituting Afghanistan can be traced back to around 500 BCE when the area was under the Achaemenid Empire,[1] although evidence indicates that an advanced degree of urbanized culture has existed in the land since between 3000 and 2000 BCE.[2][3][4] Bactria dates back to 2500 BC [5]. The Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up to large parts of Afghanistan in the north.[6] Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army arrived at what is now Afghanistan in 330 BCE after conquering Persia during the Battle of Gaugamela.[7] Since then, many empires have risen from Afghanistan, including the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Hephthalites, Hindu Shahi, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khaljis, Timurids, Mughals, Hotakis and Durranis.[8]
