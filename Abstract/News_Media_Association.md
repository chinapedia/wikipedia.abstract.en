The NEWS MEDIA ASSOCIATION is the voice of national, regional and local news media organisations in the UK and was created in 2014 by a merger between the Newspaper Society and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. The NMA exists to promote the interests of news media publishers to Government, regulatory authorities, industry bodies and other organisations whose work affects the industry.
