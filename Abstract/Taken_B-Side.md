_TAKEN B-SIDE_ is a compilation album by the German rock band Scorpions, released in 2009. It contains songs that were released only as bonus tracks of certain studio albums and includes new recordings, cover versions, live tracks and B-sides of some singles.[1][2] Two of the tracks are not in the rock genre and were not performed by the band. One of them was based on a poem and it involved only the lead vocalist.
