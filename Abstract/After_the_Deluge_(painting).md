_AFTER THE DELUGE_, also known as _THE FORTY-FIRST DAY_, is a Symbolist oil painting by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as _THE SUN_ in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows a scene from the story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in _The Genius of Greek Poetry_ in 1878, _After the Deluge_ took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.
