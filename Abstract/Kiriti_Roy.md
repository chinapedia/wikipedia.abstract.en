KIRITI ROY is an iconic professional and fictional detective of Bengali literature created by noted dermatologist, Dr. Nihar Ranjan Gupta.[1] Standing over 6Â ft tall, stoutly built, stylish, ingenious and rational, KIRITI ROY is known for his sartorial statements. The first story introduces him as follows: "Kiriti Roy is six and a half feet tall, fair and stout. His curled hair is mostly combed back, and the black celluloid spectacles make his clean-shaven face highly attractive." One of the most popular yesteryear detective characters, he is also sophisticated, classy and dignified, in a manner of speaking. He is immaculately suited and booted during his professional duties and wears a dressing gown at home, a silk kimono and tatami grass slippers (at home).
