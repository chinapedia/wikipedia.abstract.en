The SHARAWADJI EFFECT, not to be confused with sharawadgi, is a musical perception or phenomenon regarding timbre and texture described by Claude Shryer as, "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex soundscape whose beauty is inexplicable."[1] It is important to note that sharawadji is not a stimulus, but rather a reaction to a stimulus.[2] Shryer also elaborated on searching for this, "state of awareness," by the means of, "one tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context."[3] The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling thunder: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, "sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning."[4]
