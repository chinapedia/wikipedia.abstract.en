The JAPANESE TELEVISION CARTEL was a cartel formed by the seven largest Japanese T.V. manufacturers. It operated from the 1950s until at least 1974. During that time period it engaged in illegal activities such as dumping, as well as price and output manipulation with the goal of taking control over the Japanese and American T.V. markets. Its operation halted in the aftermath of a series of investigations conducted by the authorities of the two countries.
