SIEBELS' DEPARTMENT STORE-BOYER VALLEY BANK, also known as I.0.0.F. HALL, NICELY BUILDING, WHITMORE'S, and the RENA BARRY BUILDING, is a historic building located in Woodbine, Iowa, United States. Siebels' was one of the largest, longest-lasting and most well-known stores in Woodbine.[1] Adolph Siebels moved here from Minden, Iowa in 1904 and bought a grocery store. He expanded the store's offerings to include clothing, housewares and other items. Siebels expanded the store in 1907 and again in 1908. He sold shares in the store to some of his employees in the 1920s, and the store remained in business under three owners until 1954.
