AMERICAN MEDIA, INC. (AMI), is an American publisher of magazines, supermarket tabloids, and books based in New York City. Originally affiliated with only the _National Enquirer_, the media company's holdings expanded considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. In November 2010, American Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to debts of nearly $1 billion, but has continued to buy and sell magazine brands since then.
