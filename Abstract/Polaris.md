POLARIS (), designated Α URSAE MINORIS (Latinized to Alpha Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, α UMi), commonly the NORTH STAR or POLE STAR, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.
