VAN DEARING PERRINE (1869 - 1955) was a well regarded American Impressionist painter.[1] Perrine moved to New York around 1893, and studied at the National Academy of Design (1894-1897). He founded The Country Sketch Club, which held a number of exhibitions at the Academy in the late 1890s, and the Art Institute of Chicago in 1901.[2] Walter Farndon, Charles Hawthorne, Jonas Lie, and Maurice Stern also exhibited in these shows. Perrine's first solo exhibition was at the Glaenzer Galleries in New York in 1903. He exhibited shortly thereafter at the Forest Park Art Building in the American section of the World's Fair in 1904.[3] He also exhibited at the Durand-Ruel Gallery, the New Gallery, the Armory Show of 1913, and The Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City.
