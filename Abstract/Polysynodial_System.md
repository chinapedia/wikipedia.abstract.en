Iberian_Union_empires.svg The POLYSYNODIAL SYSTEM or POLYSYNODIAL REGIME (_Spanish: RÃ©gimen Polisinodial_) or SYSTEM OF COUNCILS was a political organization of the authoritarian system during rule of the Catholic Monarchs and Habsburg Spain. It was replaced after the promulgation of the Bourbon Reforms in the 18th century, which organized the central administration in a group of collegiate bodies that receive the name of Councils already existing or created _ex novo_.[1] "The Spanish Crown in the sixteenth century governed its wide and diverse kingdoms through a series of councils. Most of these bodies were composed predominantly of lawyers, men trained in academic study of Roman law."[2]
