The CHARLES E. CONRAD MANSION is a historical Victorian era shingle-style Norman mansion located in Kalispell, Montana. It was designed by the noted Spokane, Washington, architect Kirtland Cutter. It was the home of Charles E. Conrad, a late 19th century shipping magnate and early pioneer of Kalispell. In addition to shipping, over the course of his career Conrad was involved in a number of different businesses including real estate, banking, cattle ranching, and mining.[1]
