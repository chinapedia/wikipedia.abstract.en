KALYANASAUGANDHIKAM (The Fragrant Blossom) is a Kathakali play(Aattakatha) written by Kottayam Thampuran (also known as Kottayathu Thampuran) in Malayalam.Based on the Mahabharatha, the play narrates an episode from their life in exile. Bheema goes in search of the flower named Kalyanasaugandhikam to please his wife Panchali, which leads him to cross paths with his brother Hanuman, the fabled monkey from the Ramayana. [1]The four plays of Kottayam Thampuran, namely, Kirmeeravadham, Bakavadham, Kalyanasaugandhikam and Kalakeyavadham, are considered very important in the Kathakali repertoire and are a combination of conventional structure('chitta') with intermittent possibilities for improvisation('manodharma').[2]
