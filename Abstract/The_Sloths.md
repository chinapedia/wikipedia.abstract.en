THE SLOTHS were an American garage rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1964. Although short-lived, the band had a profound presence on the Sunset Strip's live scene, and their lone single, "Makin' Love", while not very commercially successful during its original release, has been heavily praised since its inclusion on the _Back from the Grave_ series. The Sloths, after their re-discovery by music historians, are now considered the "great lost garage band", and surviving band members have been conducting reunion tours since 2012.
