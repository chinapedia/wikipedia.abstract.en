KSW 71 is a rapidly-spinning star in the constellation of Lyra. It is thought to have formed after two stars in a close binary system merged; its rotation has deformed it into a oblate spheroid shape. KSw 71 was discovered, alongside other pumpkin-shaped stars by NASA's Kepler and Swift missions and produces X-rays at more than 100 times the peak levels ever seen from the Sun.[1]
