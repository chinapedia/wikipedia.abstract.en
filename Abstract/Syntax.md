In linguistics, SYNTAX () is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences (SENTENCE STRUCTURE) in a given language, usually including word order. The term _syntax_ is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes.[1] The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages.
