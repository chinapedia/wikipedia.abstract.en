The 2017 DALLAS COWBOYS SEASON was the franchise's 58th season in the National Football League, the ninth playing their home games at AT&T Stadium and the seventh full season under head coach Jason Garrett. It was also the 29th season under owner Jerry Jones. For the first time since 2002, quarterback Tony Romo was not on the opening day roster, as he announced his retirement on April 4, 2017. The Cowboys failed to make the playoffs in consecutive seasons, as they were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention after a Week 16 loss at home to the Seattle Seahawks.
