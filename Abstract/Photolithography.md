PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY, also called OPTICAL LITHOGRAPHY or UV LITHOGRAPHY, is a process used in microfabrication to pattern parts of a thin film or the bulk of a substrate (also called a _wafer_). It uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask (also called an _optical mask_) to a photosensitive (that is, light-sensitive) chemical photoresist on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then either etches the exposure pattern into the material or enables deposition of a new material in the desired pattern upon the material underneath the photoresist. In complex integrated circuits, a CMOS wafer may go through the photolithographic cycle as many as 50 times.
