"SO GOOD TO YOU" is a song that was written by Lynsey de Paul,[1][2] and first released by Zakatek (aka Lenny Zakatek) as the B-side to his 1973 single, "I Gotcha Now", which also penned by de Paul.[3] The single was released in 2 March 1973 and both songs were produced and arranged by de Paul.[4][5] Her own version appeared in October 1973 as the B-side to her award-winning single "Won't Somebody Dance with Me", which was arranged by Christopher Gunning and produced by de Paul.[6][7] In Japan, however, "So Good To You" was released as the A-side of the single release with "Won't Somebody Dance with Me" being relegated to the B-side on its release in 1974.[8] AllMusic lists "So Good to You" as one of De Paul's song highlights.[9] De Paul's version appeared for the first time on CD in 1996 on the album _Greatest Hits_,[10] and in 2000 on the _Best of the 70's_ compilation album,[11] and later as a remastered track on the CD compilation _Sugar & Beyond: Anthology 1972-1974_.[12]
