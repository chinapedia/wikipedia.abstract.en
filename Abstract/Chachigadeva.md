CHACHIGA-DEVA (IAST: CƒÅcigadeva, r. c. 1257-1282 CE) was an Indian king belonging to the Chahamana dynasty, who ruled the area around Javalipura (present-day Jalore in Rajasthan). He maintained the borders of his ancestral kingdom intact, and achieved military successes against some neighbouring princes. He is most notable for issuing the Sundha Hill _prashasti_ inscription, which provides historically valuable information about his ancestors.
