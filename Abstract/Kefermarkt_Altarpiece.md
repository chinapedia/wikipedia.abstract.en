Gotischer_Flügelaltar.JPG The KEFERMARKT ALTARPIECE () is an altarpiece made between 1490 and 1497 by an unidentified artist sometimes referred to as the Master of the Kefermarkt Altarpiece. The altarpiece is considered one of the main works of late Gothic art in the German-speaking part of Europe. The altar is today a popular tourist attraction in Kefermarkt close to Freistadt in Austria. It is considered one of the three great altarpieces from the late 15th century of the German _sprachraum_ together with the Pacher Altarpiece in St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut (Austria) and the Veit Stoss altarpiece in Kraków (Poland). It is the main altarpiece of Church of St. Wolfgang in Kefermarkt.
