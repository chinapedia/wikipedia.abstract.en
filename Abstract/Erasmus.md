DESIDERIUS ERASMUS ROTERODAMUS (; 28 October 1466[1][2] â€“ 12 July 1536), known as ERASMUS or ERASMUS OF ROTTERDAM,[3] was a Dutch Christian humanist who is widely considered to have been the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance.[4] Originally trained as a Catholic priest, Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a pure Latin style. Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet "Prince of the Humanists", and has been called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists".[5] Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament, which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote _On Free Will,_[6] _In Praise of Folly_, _Handbook of a Christian Knight_, _On Civility in Children_, _Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style_, _Julius Exclusus_, and many other works.
