The BRANDT MLE CM60A1, also known as the _Brandt HB 60LP_, _MCB-60 HB_, or simply as the Brandt 60mm LP Gun-Mortar,[1] is a 60mm (2.36 in.) gun-mortar.[2] Unlike conventional infantry mortars, it was not designed to be mounted on a bipod and a baseplate, but rather in the turrets of armoured fighting vehicles.[3] The CM60A1 could be fired at a very low angle of elevation, giving it the dual purpose of direct fire artillery. Its hydraulic recoil mechanism reduces peak loads, allowing it to be mounted in very light armoured cars, such as the Panhard AML-60, or wheeled armoured personnel carriers, like the Panhard M3.[4]
