AUDIO SIGNAL PROCESSING is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signals. Audio signals are electronic representations of sound wavesâ€”longitudinal waves which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions. The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in decibels. As audio signals may be represented in either digital or analog format, processing may occur in either domain. Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on its digital representation.
