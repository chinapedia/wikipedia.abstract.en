__ (singular: __), Latin for wandering bishops or stray bishops, are those persons consecrated, in a "clandestine or irregular way", as Christian bishops outside the structures and canon law of the established churches; those regularly consecrated but later excommunicated, and not in communion with any generally recognized diocese; and those who have in communion with them small groups that appear to exist solely for the bishop's sake.[1][2] David V. Barrett, in the _Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements_, specifies that now __ are "those independent bishops who collect several different lines of transmission of apostolic succession, and who will happily (and sometimes for a fee) consecrate anyone who requests it."[3] Those described as wandering bishops often see the term as pejorative. The general term for "wandering" clerics, as were common in the Middle Ages, is _clerici vagantes_; the general term for those recognising no leader is _acephali_.
