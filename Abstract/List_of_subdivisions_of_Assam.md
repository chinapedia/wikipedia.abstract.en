The administrative entities that are a level below of Districts are named as _Subdivisions_ in Assam. Since India's independence in 1947, the administrative entities of Assam have increased over a period of time. With 54 subdivisions initially, the Government of Assam incorporated 24 more subdivisions[1][2] with 5 new districts[3] on 26 January 2016,[4] increasing the count to 78. Where the subdivisions are the administrative units, the terms, such as _Tehsils_ or _Mandals_ represent revenue collecting units under a district administration, and both are treated as subâ€“districts. Assam has 155 _Tehsils_, and a few fall under multiple districts, specially the districts in BTC and its surrounding.
