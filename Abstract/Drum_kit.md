A DRUM KIT — also called a DRUM SET, TRAP SET (a term using a contraction of the word, "contraption"),[1] or simply DRUMS — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands, and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones – most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[3] In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used.
