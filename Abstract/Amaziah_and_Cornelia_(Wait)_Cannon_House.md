The AMAZIAH AND CORNELIA (WAIT) CANNON HOUSE, also known as CRAB APPLE GROVE, is a historic building located in Mason City, Iowa, United States. New York natives Amaziah and Cornelia Cannon settled here from Wisconsin in 1866 with their three children. They built this 1-story stone house the same year in a grove of crab apple trees. It is one of three stone houses built during the settlement era remaining in Mason City.[1] It was occupied by the Cannons and their descendants until 1963, when the present house on the farmstead was built immediately to the east. This house is currently unoccupied and in a deteriorating condition. It has been used as a workshop intermittently. At the time of its construction it was northwest of town, but the farmstead was incorporated into the city limits in the 1970s.[2] The immediate area has remained rural, however. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[3]
