The SNOW LEOPARD CONSERVANCY INDIA TRUST (SLC-IT) was formed in 2000 as the Indian branch of the Snow Leopard Conservancy. It became an independent Indian organization in 2003. Since its inception, the SLC-IT has worked to protect the highly threatened snow leopard (Uncia uncia), its prey species, and its habitat in India. SLC-IT focuses on promoting community-based solutions to the problems facing the snow leopard throughout its Indian range. The organization pioneered the award-winning Himalayan Homestays Program in 2003. Apart from conservation, the organization also conducts ecological research on the snow leopard, its prey species, which help in guiding the conservation programs.
