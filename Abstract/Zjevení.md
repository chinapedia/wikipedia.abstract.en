_ZJEVEN√ç'' (ENGLISH TITLE: "_REVELATION''") is the debut album by Czech black metal band Root, released in December 1990 through now-defunct record label Zeras.[1] It is noticeably the only full-length album by the band to feature songs with lyrics in the Czech language, and is regarded for shaping the sonority of the early Czech black metal scene of the late 1980s/early to mid-1990s.
