A FLEXIBLE SEATING CLASSROOM is one in which traditional seating charts are replaced with seating arrangements that allow the students to seat where they choose.[1] One of its principal objectives is to reduce the number/duration of sedentary periods of time, which research has identified as a danger to health. The Albemarle County Public School system in Virginia adopted this approach with reported success.
