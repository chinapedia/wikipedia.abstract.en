The CENTIMETRE–GRAM–SECOND SYSTEM OF UNITS (abbreviated CGS or CGS) is a variant of the metric system based on the centimetre as the unit of length, the gram as the unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time. All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism.[1][2][3]
