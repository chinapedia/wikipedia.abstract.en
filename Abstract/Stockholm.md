STOCKHOLM ()[1] is the capital of Sweden and the most populous urban area in the Nordic countries; 965,232 people live in the municipality,[2] approximately 1.6 million in the urban area,[3] and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area.[4] The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake MÃ¤laren flows into the Baltic Sea. Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the county seat of Stockholm County.
