In algebra, a HOMOMORPHISM is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). The word _homomorphism_ comes from the ancient Greek language: _ὁμός (homos)_ meaning "same" and _μορφή (morphe)_ meaning "form" or "shape". However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German _ähnlich_ meaning "similar" to _ὁμός_ meaning "same".[1]
