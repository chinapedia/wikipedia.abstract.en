The CAROLINA PARAKEET (_Conuropsis carolinensis_) or CAROLINA CONURE is an extinct species of small green neotropical parrot with a bright yellow head, reddish orange face and pale beak native to the eastern, midwest and plains states of the United States. It was the only indigenous parrot within its range, as well as one of only two parrots native to the United States (the other being the thick-billed parrot). It was found from southern New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic seaboard to as far west as eastern Colorado. It lived in old-growth forests along rivers and in swamps.[1] It was called _puzzi la n√©e_ ("head of yellow") or _pot pot chee_ by the Seminole and _kelinky_ in Chickasaw.[2] Though formerly prevalent within its range, the bird had become rare by the middle of the 19th century. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was of the _ludovicianus_ subspecies in 1910. The last known specimen perished in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918[3][4] and the species was declared extinct in 1939.
