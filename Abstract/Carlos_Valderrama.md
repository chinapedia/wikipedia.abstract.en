CARLOS ALBERTO VALDERRAMA PALACIO (;[1] born 2 September 1961), also known as _El Pibe_ ("The Kid"),[2] is a Colombian former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. A creative playmaker, his precise passing, technical skills made him one of South America's most recognisable footballers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He won the South American Footballer of the Year award in 1987 and 1993, and in 1999, he was also named one of the top 100 players of the 20th century by World Soccer. In 2004, he was included in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 "greatest living footballers" chosen by Pel√© to celebrate the 100th anniversary of FIFA.[3][4][5][6][7][8]
