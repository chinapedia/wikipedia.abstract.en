Hasselberg_bild.gif Svöklockan_2010.jpg, Stockholm.]] PER HASSELBERG (January 1, 1850 – July 25, 1894) was a Swedish sculptor. He was also known as Petter Hasselberg or Petter Åkesson. Little known outside Sweden, his delicate marble nudes have received critical acclaim. Hasselberg grew up in Blekinge, but moved to Paris as a young man, where he studied under François Jouffroy. His first notable work was a sculpture titled _Snöklockan_. It represents a young girl rising/standing nude (the name is from the plant snowdrop which is rising every spring) Other famous work are the sculpture "Grodan" (a nude young girl playing with a frog).
