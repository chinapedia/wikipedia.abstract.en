ARIZONA BORDER RECON (AZBR) is an American paramilitary militia group in Arizona[1] composed of former military, law enforcement and private security contractors.[2] Tim Foley, its founder, denies that it is a militia. The Arizona Daily Star has reported that "court records show he was intimately involved in militias that formed Operation Mutual Defense to help the Bundy family several years ago during its dispute with the federal government over the use of public land. They continue to detain and hold civilians along the border without any prosecutors bringing charges against them."[3]
