A PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY (legally abbreviated to PLC) is a type of public company under United Kingdom company law, some Commonwealth jurisdictions, and the Republic of Ireland. It is a limited liability company whose shares may be freely sold and traded to the public (although a PLC may also be privately held, often by another PLC), with a minimum share capital of Â£50,000 and usually with the letters PLC after its name.[1] Similar companies in the United States are called _publicly traded companies_. Public limited companies will also have a separate legal identity.
