The ZEBRAFISH (_Danio rerio_) is a freshwater fish belonging to the minnow family (Cyprinidae) of the order Cypriniformes.[1] Native to South Asia, it is a popular aquarium fish, frequently sold under the trade name ZEBRA DANIO[2] (and thus often called a "tropical fish" although both tropical and subtropical). The zebrafish is also an important and widely used vertebrate model organism in scientific research, for example in drug development, in particular pre-clinical development.[3] It is also notable for its regenerative abilities,[4] and has been modified by researchers to produce many transgenic strains.[5][6][7]
