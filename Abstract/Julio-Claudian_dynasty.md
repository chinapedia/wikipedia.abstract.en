The JULIO-CLAUDIAN DYNASTY was the first Roman imperial dynasty, consisting of the first five emperors—Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero[1]—or the family to which they belonged. They ruled the Roman Empire from its formation under Augustus in 27 BC until AD 68, when the last of the line, Nero, committed suicide.[2] The name "Julio-Claudian dynasty" is a historiographical term derived from the two main branches of the imperial family: the _gens Julia_ (Julii Caesares) and _gens Claudia_ (Claudii Nerones).
