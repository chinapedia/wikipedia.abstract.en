Armenia has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have positive and friendly relations with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and the European Union since its independence.[1] It has full membership status in a number of international organizations and observer status, etc. in some others. However, the dispute over the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the recent war over Nagornoâ€“Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey.
