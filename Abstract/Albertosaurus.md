_ALBERTOSAURUS_ (; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70Â million years ago. The type species, _A. sarcophagus_, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian province of Alberta, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing _Gorgosaurus libratus_ as a second species.
