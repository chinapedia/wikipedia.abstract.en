_MERE CHRISTIANITY_ is a theological book by C.Â S. Lewis, adapted from a series of BBC radio talks made between 1941 and 1944,[1] while Lewis was at Oxford during the Second World War.[2] Considered a classic of Christian apologetics, the transcripts of the broadcasts originally appeared in print as three separate pamphlets: _The Case for Christianity_ (_Broadcast Talks_ in the UK) (1942), _Christian Behaviour_ (1943), and _Beyond Personality_ (1944).[3] Lewis was invited to give the talks by James Welch, the BBC Director of Religious Broadcasting, who had read his 1940 book, _The Problem of Pain_.[4]
