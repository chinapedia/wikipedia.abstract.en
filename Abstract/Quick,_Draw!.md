_QUICK, DRAW!_ is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the drawings represent.[1][2][3] The AI learns from each drawing, increasing its ability to guess correctly in the future.[4] The game is similar to Pictionary in that the player only has a limited time to draw (40seconds).[5] The concepts that it guesses can be simple, like 'foot', or more complicated, like 'animal migration'.[6] This game is one of many simple games created by Google that are AI based as part of a project known as 'A.I. Experiments'.
