CAMEROONIAN SPORTS FEDERATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES (FECASH) (French: __) was one of the primary national sports federation for people with disabilities in Cameroon prior to the organization being dissolved in August 2011. It served as the country's National Paralympic Committee for many years. Problems with internal governance arose starting in the early 2000s and continued until the federation closed.
