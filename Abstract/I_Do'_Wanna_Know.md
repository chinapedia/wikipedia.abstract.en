"I DO' WANNA KNOW" is a song written by Kevin Cronin that was the lead single from REO Speedwagon's 1984 album _Wheels Are Turnin'_. It was more of a rocker reminiscent of the songs REO Speedwagon had released in the 1970s than the ballads the band had been successful with in the early 1980s. It had limited success on popular music charts, which was blamed for delaying sales of the album until the release of the follow up single, the ballad "Can't Fight This Feeling." The video to the song was nominated for several awards.
