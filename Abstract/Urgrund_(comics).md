URGRUND is a fictional ancient planet appearing in the Fourth World comic books published by DC Comics. A vast war among its people ended in a cataclysmic conflagration, causing it to break apart to form two new planets:majestic, sun-soaked utopia" New Genesis inhabited by the New Gods ruled by the Highfather and, with its "mammoth fire pits and machinery", ruled by the evil Darkseid and inhabited by his minions and the downtrodden population beneath them, that known as Apokolips.[1][2].The planet is shown as a massive, dark world in an early John Byrne New Gods comic (New Gods Jack Kirby's Fourth World No #1).
