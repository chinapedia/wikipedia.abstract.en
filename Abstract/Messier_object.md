The MESSIER OBJECTS are a set of 110 astronomical objects cataloged by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his _Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles_ ("Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters"). Because Messier was interested in finding only comets, he created a list of non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as _the Messier catalogue._ This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier number.[1] The catalogue includes some astronomical objects that can be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere such as deep-sky objects, a characteristic which makes the Messier objects extremely popular targets for amateur astronomers.[2]
