POPE CLEMENT V (; c. 1264 â€“ 20 April 1314), born RAYMOND BERTRAND DE GOT (also occasionally spelled _de Guoth_ and _de Goth_), was Pope from 5 June 1305 to his death in 1314. He is remembered for suppressing the order of the Knights Templar and allowing the execution of many of its members, and as the Pope who moved the Papacy from Rome to Avignon, ushering in the period known as the Avignon Papacy.[1][2]
