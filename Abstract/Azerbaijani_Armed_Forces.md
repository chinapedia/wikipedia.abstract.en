The ARMED FORCES OF AZERBAIJAN () were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.[1] The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918. However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991â€“92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.
