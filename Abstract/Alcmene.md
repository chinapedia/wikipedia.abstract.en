In Greek mythology, ALCMENE () or ALCMENA (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλκμήνη or Doric: Ἀλκμάνα, Latin: Alcumena means "strong in wrath"[1]) was the wife of Amphitryon by whom she bore two children, Iphicles and Laonome. She is, however, better known as the mother of Heracles whose father was the god Zeus. Alcmene was also called ELECTRYONE (Ἠλεκτρυώνην), a patronymic name as a daughter of Electryon.[2]
