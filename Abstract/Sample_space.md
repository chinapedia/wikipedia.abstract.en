In probability theory, the SAMPLE SPACE (also called SAMPLE DESCRIPTION SPACE[1], EVENT SPACE[2] or POSSIBILITY SPACE[3]) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.[4] A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes are listed as elements in the set. It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels _S_, Î©, or _U_ (for "universal set").
