MARION NAIFEH (born April 11, 1928) is an American author and former educator who, with her husband, the late diplomat George Naifeh, represented the United States in diplomatic missions in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia over nearly three decades. As an author, Naifeh has published two books. Her 2003 publication, _The Last Missionary in China_, was described by noted Harvard University sinologist Ezra Vogel as "a touching, well-written, well-researched account of the life and times of a missionary who died in China in 1951 after 34 years there, by his daughter. Objective, nuanced, broad-gauged"[1] Naifeh's 2016 book, _Foreign Service_, chronicles her family's life in the U.S. diplomatic corps during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.[2]
