The CHURCH OF ST THOMAS THE APOSTLE, KILLINGHALL, is an Anglican parish church in Killinghall, North Yorkshire, England. It was designed in 1879 by William Swinden Barber[1] when the parish of Ripley was split to create the additional parish of Killinghall, and a new building was required to accommodate a growing congregation. It was opened in 1880. Among the early vicars posted in this benefice were two canons, Sydney Robert Elliston[2] and Lindsay Shorland-Ball, and the Venerable Robert Collier, an Irish missionary who served in India and Africa.
