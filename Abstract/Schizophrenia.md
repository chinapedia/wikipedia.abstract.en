SCHIZOPHRENIA is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal behavior, strange speech, and a decreased ability to understand reality.[1] Other symptoms May include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that do not exist, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and lack of motivation.[2][3] People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, or substance-use disorders.[4] Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and, in many cases, never resolve.[5][6]
