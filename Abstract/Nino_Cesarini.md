ANTONIO CESARINI (September 30, 1889 – October 25, 1943), better known by the diminutive name NINO, was a model for several artists, such as the photographer Wilhelm von Plüschow, painters Paul Hoecker and Umberto Brunelleschi and sculptor Francesco Jerace during his youth. In his adulthood he modelled for Vincenzo Gemito, who presented him as a prototype of homoerotic masculine beauty. He was also known for his relationship with baron Jacques d'Adelswärd-Fersen. His life was novelized by the French writer Roger Peyrefitte in his work _The Exile of Capri_ (L'exilé de Capri) in 1959.
