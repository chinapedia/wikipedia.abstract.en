The ELK MOUNTAIN HOTEL, also known as the JOHN S. EVANS HOTEL, MOUNTAIN VIEW HOTEL and GRANDVIEW HOTEL was built in 1905 in Elk Mountain, Wyoming on the bank of the Medicine Bow River. The two-story wood frame building was built next to the 1880 GARDEN SPOT PAVILION, a dance hall that was a social center in an otherwise isolated portion of Wyoming. The hotel was built by John Evans, the owner of the Elk Mountain Saloon, who in 1903 had acquired the Pavilion. Evans catered to the mining trade through the 1930s. By that time better roads allowed tourism to increase, and the hotel provided accommodation to hunters and tourists. Evans sold the property in 1947 to Mark and Lucille Jackson, who remodeled the hotel and the pavilion.[1]
