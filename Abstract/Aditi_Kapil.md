ADITI KAPIL is a playwright of Bulgarian and Indian descent. She grew up in Sweden before moving to Minnesota to attend Macalester College. At Macalester, she intended on becoming a journalist until the college's only journalism professor died. She was taking an acting class at the time, and that introduction to the theater stuck. Kapil graduated with a B.A. in English and Dramatic Arts.[1]
