THE LONDON EDUCATION CLASSIFICATION is a library classification and indexing thesaurus used at the UCL Institute of Education.[1] It was devised by D.J. Foskett and Joy Foskett. It was devised to address deficiencies in general classification schemes in dealing with education.[2] It was originally devised in 1963, and revised in 1974. It is a faceted classification, inspired by the work of S.R. Ranganathan and of the Classification Research Group.
