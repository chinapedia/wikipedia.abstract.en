PETER TANGVALD (born PER TANGVALD, 27 September 1924, died 22 June 1991) was a Norwegian sailor and adventurer. Known as one of the early deep-sea cruising pioneers and for his 1966 book _Sea Gypsy_, he reached notoriety after two of his seven wives had been lost at sea.[1][2][3] He himself drowned, along with his daughter Carmen, when his engineless yacht was wrecked in Bonaire in 1991.[4][5] His son Thomas escaped the accident, but suffered a similar fate when his own yacht was lost at sea years later, in 2014.[6][7]
