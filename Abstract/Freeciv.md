_FREECIV_ is a single- and multiplayer, turn-based strategy game for workstations and personal computers inspired by the proprietary _Sid Meier's Civilization_ series. It is available for most desktop computer operating systems and available in an online browser based version.[1] Released under the GNU General Public License,[2] Freeciv is free and open source software. The game's default settings are closest to _Civilization II_, in both gameplay and graphics, including the units and the isometric grid.
