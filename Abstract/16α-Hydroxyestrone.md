16Α-HYDROXYESTRONE (16Α-OH-E1), or HYDROXYESTRONE, also known as ESTRA-1,3,5(10)-TRIENE-3,16Α-DIOL-17-ONE, is an endogenous steroidal estrogen and a major metabolite of estrone, as well as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of estriol.[1][2] It is a potent estrogen similarly to estrone, and it has been suggested that the ratio of 16α-hydroxyestrone to 2-hydroxyestrone, the latter being much less estrogenic in comparison and even antiestrogenic in the presence of more potent estrogens like estradiol, may be involved in the pathophysiology of breast cancer.[3] Conversely, 16α-hydroxyestrone may help to protect against osteoporosis.[4] In contrast to estradiol, the binding of 16α-hydroxyestrone to the estrogen receptor is, uniquely, covalent and irreversible, and genotoxicity and aberrant hyperproliferations may result.[5] A diacetate ester of 16α-hydroxyestrone, hydroxyestrone diacetate, has been marketed and is used medically as an estrogen in Europe.[6][7]
