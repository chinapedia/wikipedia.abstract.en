The ROYAL AUTOMOBILE CLUB VOLUNTEER FORCE (also known as "RAC Corps of Volunteer Motor Drivers") was a group of civilian members of the Royal Automobile Club, who at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, took their personal cars and joined the British Army in France and Belgium, to act as chauffeurs for senior officers. Following their involvement in the early battles of the war, several of their number were appointed to senior positions in the British military establishment.
