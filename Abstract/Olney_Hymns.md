The _OLNEY HYMNS_ were first published in February 1779 and are the combined work of curate John Newton (1725–1807) and his poet friend, William Cowper (1731–1800). The hymns were written for use in Newton's rural parish, which was made up of relatively poor and uneducated followers. The _Olney Hymns_ are an illustration of the potent ideologies of the Evangelical movement, to which both men belonged, present in many communities in England at the time.
