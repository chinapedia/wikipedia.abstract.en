Koroviev (spelled with an "i" in the Penguin Classics edition) is one of Woland's entourage in Mikhail Bulgakov's novel, _The Master and Margarita._ He presents himself to others as "professor" Woland's "assistant and translator," and is capable of creating any illusion. His appearance is characterized throughout the book by a lengthy build, a jockey's cap, a mustache, and a pince-nez with one cracked lens and the other lens missing. He is alternately depicted wearing a checkered jacket[1] and checkered trousers.[2]
