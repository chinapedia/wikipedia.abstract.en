WILLIAM BOWIE (1926-1994) was a sculpture artist based in New York City from 1954 to 1994. He is best known for his works using welded gold leaf steel nails. As a contemporary of Harry Bertoia, Curtis Jere, and William and Bruce Friedle, Bowie can be considered a founding figure in the mid-century American metal sculpture genre. His effort to find artistic beauty and meaning in powerful arrangements of industrial materials associates him with the mid-century Brutalism movement.
