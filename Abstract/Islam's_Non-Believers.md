ISLAM’S NON-BELIEVERS is a 2016 documentary produced by Fuuse Films, and filmed and directed by Emmy-winning and Bafta-nominated filmmaker Deeyah Khan. The film documents the lives and experiences of ex-Muslims: people who have left Islam to become atheists, and who often face discrimination, harassment, ostracism and violence for leaving Islam, both in the UK and abroad. The documentary was first shown on the ITV’s current affairs series _Exposure_.[1]
