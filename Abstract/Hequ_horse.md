The HEQU HORSE, previously called the NANFAN, is a horse breed native to the northwestern Tibetan plateau. Its ancestry traces to the Tang Dynasty, influenced by the Tibetan Pony, the Ferghana and the Mongolian horse. It was given its present name in 1954, from the Chinese word for its native region on the first loop of the Yellow River.[1] Once common, the Hequ fell victim to Chinese policy and the mechanization of transportation.
