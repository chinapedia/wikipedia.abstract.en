The LILLIPUT EFFECT is a decrease in body size in animal species which have survived a major extinction.[1] There are several hypotheses as to why these patterns appear in the fossil record, some of which are: the survival of small taxa, dwarfing of larger lineages, and the evolutionary miniaturization from larger ancestral stocks.[2] The term was coined in 1993 by Adam Urbanek in his paper concerning the extinction of graptoloids.[3] This size decrease may just be a temporary phenomenon restricted to the survival period of the extinction event.
