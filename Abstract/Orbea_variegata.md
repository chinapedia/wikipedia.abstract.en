_ORBEA VARIEGATA_ is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family Apocynaceae, known as the STAR FLOWER. It is native to the coastal belt of the Western Cape, South Africa, growing actively during the winter rainfall season.[1] Growing to tall by broad, it is a leafless succulent perennial with cactus-like toothed stems, and highly variable, star-shaped, off-white or yellow flowers strongly speckled with maroon, up to in diameter. The flowers may show regular (banded) markings, or irregular ones. They have five pointed or blunt lobes surrounding a central, pentagonal annulus (corona).[2] Each plant may produce up to five blooms. The flowers may have a faint carrion smell to attract potential insect pollinators.[3]
