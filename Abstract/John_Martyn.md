Over a 40-year career, he released 22 studio albums, and received frequent critical acclaim. Martyn began his career at age 17 as a key member of the British folk music scene, drawing inspiration from American blues and English traditional music, and signed with Island Records. By the 1970s he had begun incorporating jazz and rock into his sound on albums such as _Solid Air_ (1973) and _One World_ (1977), as well as experimenting with guitar effects and tape delay machines such as Echoplex.[1] He struggled with substance abuse and domestic problems throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as Phil Collins and Lee "Scratch" Perry. He remained active until his death in 2009. He was described by _The Times_ as "an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between folk, jazz, rock and blues".[2]
