GEOMESSAGING is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.[1] Those regions can be created by using geofences, based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).
