Aerobic_respiration_summary.jpg GLYCOLYSIS (from _glycose_, an older term[1] for glucose + _-lysis_ degradation) is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C₆H₁₂O₆, into pyruvate, CH₃COCOO^(−) + H⁺. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).[2][3] Glycolysis is a sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Most monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, can be converted to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful rather than just utilized as steps in the overall reaction. For example, the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.
