FEJAT SEJDIĆ () (20 January 1941 – 22 August 2017) was a Serbian Romani trumpeter and Balkan brass band leader from Bojnik, in south Serbia. Coming from a family of trumpeters and performing since he was a child, his band was the most successful orchestra at the Guča Trumpet Festival, the largest trumpet festival in the world, while he was named "The master of Guča for all times" and the "King of Trumpet". Though he performed all over the world playing for the world dignitaries and celebrities, and collaborated with musicians like the Gipsy Kings and Goran Bregović, he never learned to read the notes and only played by ear.[1][2]
