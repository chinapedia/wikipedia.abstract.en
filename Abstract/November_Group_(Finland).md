Cawén,_Alvar_-_Members_of_The_November_Group_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg, _Members of the November Group_ (1921) currentlocation: EMMA – Espoo Museum of Modern Art]] NOVEMBER GROUP (Marraskuun ryhmä) was an association of Finnish expressionist artists, gathered around Tyko Sallinen. The group was founded in time when Finland declared its independence from Russia and the members of the November Group were sometimes aggressively nationalistic in outlook, creating a distinctively Finnish form of Expressionism.[1] The November group caused the greatest ever uproar in Finnish art. In the Finnish art community of its age it represented everything that was ugly, incompetent, distorting and primitive. Today the movement is considered one of the most important and influenced movements in Finnish art.[2]
