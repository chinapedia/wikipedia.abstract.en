Alt_Telefon.jpg telephone, c. 1940s]]Tel_01LX.jpg A TELEPHONE (derived from the , _tēle_, "far" and φωνή, _phōnē_, "voice", together meaning "distant voice"), or PHONE, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.
