The DUUMVIRI NAVALES, literally two men who for dealing with naval matters,[1] were two naval officers elected by the people of Rome to repair and equip the Roman fleet.[2] Both Duumvir navales were assigned to one Roman consul, and each controlled 20 ships.[3][4] It has been suggested that they may have been in charge of the ships of the Socii navales rather than those of the Roman fleet.[5] The position was established in 311 BC by the Lex Decia.[6]
