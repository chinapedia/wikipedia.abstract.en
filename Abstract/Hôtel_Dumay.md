The HÔTEL DUMAY, a historic building in Toulouse, France, is a Renaissance _hôtel particulier_ (_palace_) of the 16th century. It has been listed as an official historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture since June 21, 1950.[1] The Dumay hotel retains the name of the man who built it at the end of the 16th century, Antoine Dumay, a renowned physician, notably a doctor of Marguerite de Valois, Henri IV's first wife.[2] It now houses the Museum of Old Toulouse.
