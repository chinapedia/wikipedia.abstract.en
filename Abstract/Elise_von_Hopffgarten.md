ELISE HERMINE VON HOPFFGARTEN, née Hennoch (January 29, 1869 in Altenburg[1]-after 1937[2]) was a German author and founder of the Deutschen Pfadfinderbundes für junge Mädchen. On January 14, 1912, the Deutschen Pfadfinderbundes für junge Mädchen was founded at the instigation of Maximilian Bayer,[3] in which several Scout groups existent since 1908, some of which previously were attached to the Wandervogel, merged. Hopffgarten was elected by the Assembly in the Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus to be the first chairman[4] and held that position until 1922.[5] In this role, she was editor of the club magazine and made numerous lecture tours around Germany, to promote Scouting.[6] By mid-1914, the organization had 6,200 members.[7] In 1915 the organization launched the _Kriegsgarten_ "war gardens", in which children were taught horticulture and were fed.[8]
