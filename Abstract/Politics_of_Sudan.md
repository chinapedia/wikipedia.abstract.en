Officially, the POLITICS OF SUDAN takes place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic consociationalist republic, where the President of Sudan is head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces in a multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in both the government and in the two chambers, the National Assembly (lower) and the Council of States (upper), of the bicameral National Legislature. The judiciary is independent and obtained by the Constitutional Court.[1] However, following a deadly civil war and the still ongoing genocide in Darfur, Sudan was widely recognized as a totalitarian state where all effective political power was held by President Omar al-Bashir and the National Congress Party (NCP).[2][3][4][5] However, al-Bashir and the NCP were ousted in a military coup which occurred on April 11, 2019.[6][7] The government of Sudan is now led by the "Transitional Military Council".[8][9][10][11]
