Hematopoiesis_simple.svg HAEMATOPOIESIS (from Greek αἷμα, "blood" and ποιεῖν "to make"; also HEMATOPOIESIS in American English; sometimes also HAEMOPOIESIS or HEMOPOIESIS) is the formation of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells.[1] In a healthy adult person, approximately 10¹¹–10¹² new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.[2][3]
