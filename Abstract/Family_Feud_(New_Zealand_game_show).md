_FAMILY FEUD_ was a New Zealand game show based on the American show of the same name. It began airing on Three on 15 February 2016. It is hosted by comedian Dai Henwood, and aired Mondays to Fridays at 5:30pm. The set and logo is almost identical to the 2014 Australian version; it is filmed in Epsom. The winning family plays Fast Money for $5,000, and winners of five nights in a row win a brand new car.
