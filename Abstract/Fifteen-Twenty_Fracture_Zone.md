The FIFTEEN-TWENTY or 15°20' FRACTURE ZONE (FTFZ), also known as the CABO VERDE FRACTURE ZONE, is a fracture zone located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the central Atlantic Ocean between 14–16°N. It is the current location of the migrating triple junction marking the boundaries between the North American, South American, and Nubian plates.[1][2] The FTFZ is roughly parallel to the North and South America—Africa spreading direction and has a broad axial valley produced over the last ten million years by the northward-migrating triple junction.[3][4] Offsetting the MAR by some 175 km, the FTFZ is located on one of the slowest portions of the MAR where the full spreading rate is 25 km/Myr.[5]
