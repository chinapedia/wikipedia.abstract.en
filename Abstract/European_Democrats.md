It was a political group in the European Parliament from 1979 until 1992, when it became a subgroup of the European People's Partyâ€“European Democrats (EPP-ED) group. The European Democrats continued to exist as a political group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) until 2014, when it became the European Conservatives Group.
