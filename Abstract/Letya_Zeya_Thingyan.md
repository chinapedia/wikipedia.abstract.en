LETYA ZEYA THINGYAN (, ) was governor of Toungoo (Taungoo) from 1408/09 to 1411/12.[1] Born Khin Nyo, he was a childhood tutor of King Minkhaung I of Ava. His appointment as governor of Toungoo came at the height of the Forty Years' War against the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and he commanded the regional Toungoo army, which consisted of 60 war elephants. In 1411/12, Minkhaung reappointed Letya to Pyinzi because the king was concerned that Letya was getting too old to be governor of a frontier town during the war.[2]
