_SEAFALL_ is a board game designed by Rob Daviau and published in 2016 by Plaid Hat Games.[1] _SeaFall_ is a game of colonial era exploration which uses a legacy format, meaning the board and components change during each game, creating a different game each time and a story with a beginning, middle, and end.[2] The game is played by 3â€“5 players, each of whom takes on the role of a province taking to the seas after a long dark age.[3] Players explore the game board with their ships, revealing islands and other surprises. The game contains 430 entries in a Captain's Booke, a journal which is read in sections when players trigger in-game events called milestones. The story contains about 15 games' worth of content, with each game taking about two hours to play.
