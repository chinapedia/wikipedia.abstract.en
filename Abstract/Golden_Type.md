Kelmscott_Press_-_The_Nature_of_Gothic_by_John_Ruskin_(first_page).jpg.]] The GOLDEN TYPE is a serif font designed by artist William Morris for his fine book printing project, the Kelmscott Press, in 1890. It is an "old-style" serif font, based on type designed by engraver and printer Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470.[1][2][3] It is named for the _Golden Legend_, which was intended to be the first book printed using it.[4] The original design has neither an italic nor a bold weight, as neither of these existed in Jenson's time.
