The CHAMPLAIN SCHOOL is a historic former school building at 809 Pine Street in the South End of Burlington, Vermont. Built in 1909, it is a fine local example of vernacular Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, designed by one of the city's most prominent architects of the period. It was used as a school until the end of 1968, and now houses apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[1]
