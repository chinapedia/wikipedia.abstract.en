Progressive rock is subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Progressive rock, which initially had classical music influences, has come to include other fusions of music styles including jazz fusion, metal and folk rock musics. Progressive rock is an approach that combines elements of diverse styles. Jerry Ewing, editor of _Prog Magazine_, explains that "Prog is not just a sound, it's a mindset." Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci outlines that Progressive rock is defined by its very lack of stylistic boundaries. The advent of the concept album, plus the genre's roots in psychedelia, led albums and performances to be viewed as combined presentations of music, lyrics, and visuals.
