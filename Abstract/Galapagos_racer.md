The GALÁPAGOS RACER (_PSEUDALSOPHIS BISERIALIS_ or _PHILODRYAS BISERIALIS_) is a colubrid snake in the genus _Pseudalsophis_ that is endemic to the Galápagos Islands. It is a mildly venomous constrictor and is considered not aggressive and harmless to humans. The two subspecies are the eastern and western racers, the latter being larger, longer, and darker than the former. The western subspecies specializes in hunting fish, while both subspecies eat small reptiles, eggs, rodents, and bird hatchlings. The Galapagos racer is near threatened due to recently introduced species that feed on snake eggs, including pigs, goats, and cats.[1][2][3] It is one of only three species of snakes on the Galápagos Islands, and it was first described in 1860.[4][5] In November 2016, a video clip from the BBC series _Planet Earth II_ showing a group of Galápagos racers hunting marine iguana hatchlings became a viral trend.[6]
