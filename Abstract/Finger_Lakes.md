The FINGER LAKES are a group of 11 long, narrow, roughly northâ€“south lakes in an area informally called the _Finger Lakes region_ in Central New York, in the United States. This region straddles the northern and transitional edge, known as the _Finger Lakes Uplands and Gorges ecoregion,_ of the Northern Allegheny Plateau and the Ontario Lowlands ecoregion of the Great Lakes Lowlands.[1]
