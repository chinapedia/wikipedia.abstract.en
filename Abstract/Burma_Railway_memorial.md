The memorial was opened in September 2012 by Viscount John Slim following a campaign in the _Camden New Journal_. It was designed by the architect Chris Roche and features a plaque with an image of an emaciated prisoner of war drawn by the artist Ronald Searle who was himself forced to work on the railway.[1][2][3][4][5]
