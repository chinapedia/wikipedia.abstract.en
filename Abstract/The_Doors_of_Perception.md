_THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION_ is a book by Aldous Huxley. Published in 1954, it elaborates on his psychedelic experience under the influence of mescaline in May 1953. The book takes its title from a phrase in William Blake's 1793 poem _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_.[1] Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, ranging from the "purely aesthetic" to "sacramental vision",[2] and reflects on their philosophical and intellectual implications.
