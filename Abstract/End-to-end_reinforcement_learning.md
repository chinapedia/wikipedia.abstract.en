In END-TO-END REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, the end-to-end process, in other words, the entire process from sensors to motors in a robot or agent involves a single, layered or recurrent neural network without modularization, and is trained by reinforcement learning (RL).[1] The approach has been proposed for a long time,[2][3] but was reenergized by the successful results in learning to play Atari video games (2013â€“15)[4][5][6][7] and AlphaGo (2016)[8] by Google DeepMind.
