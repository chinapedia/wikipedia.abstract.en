WILLIAM PULGRAM (born January 21, 1921) is an Austrian-born American architect. Pulgram, a Holocaust survivor, began his career in the late 1940s, drawing concrete details and wall sections as he worked on construction documents at Finch Alexander. As his career progressed, he began to specialize in corporate interiors, as a number of interior designers did. This esteemed group includes Davis Allen, Florence Knoll, Margaret McCurry, and Margo Grant Walsh. Pulgram's philosophy was that interior design is a continuation of the architecture of the space and needs to be carefully designed and contracted for; he was an advocate for architecture firms moving into the area of commercial interiors.[1] In 1963, he created his own firm – Associated Space Design. The focus of his firm was interiors – he was known for his corporate environments including Coca-Cola and Black & Decker.[2] His book, _Designing the Automated Office_, focused on how technology was changing the office environment and how architects should design for that. He worked tirelessly throughout his career to create interior contract documents – which are still used today.
