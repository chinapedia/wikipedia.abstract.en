The SOUTH WILLARD STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses what was once the most fashionable residential area of Burlington, Vermont. Located along South Willard Street between Pearl and Beech Streets, the architecturally heterogeneous area was in the 19th century home to major estates of the city's business leaders, and has since been infilled with a variety of late 19th and early 20th century architecture. The district waslisted on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]
