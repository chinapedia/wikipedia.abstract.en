HEJMDAL is a facility in Aarhus, Denmark owned by The Danish Cancer Society and used to counsel and house cancer patients and their families. The building is situated in the Tr√∏jborg neighborhood on _Peter Sabroe's Gade_ 1. Hejmdal was originally a part of Aarhus Municipal Hospital but has since been renovated. The American architect Frank Gehry worked pro bono on the redesign with the architect company Cubo Architects from Aarhus.[1][2]
