DISPUTE RESOLUTION is the process of resolving disputes between parties. The term _dispute resolution_ is sometimes used interchangeably with _conflict resolution_, although conflicts are generally more deep-rooted and lengthy than disputes.[1] Dispute resolution techniques assist the resolution of antagonisms between parties that can include citizens, corporations, and governments.
