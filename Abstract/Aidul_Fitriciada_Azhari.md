AIDUL FITRICIADA AZHARI is the current chairman of the Judicial Commission of Indonesia.[1][2] Azhari has been referred to as a dark horse due to the fact that he initially hadn't been nominated nor had he volunteered to be the Judicial Commission's chairman. Two other candidates were rejected by the People's Representative Council before his confirmation.[3]
