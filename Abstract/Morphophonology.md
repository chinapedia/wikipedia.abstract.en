MORPHOPHONOLOGY (also MORPHOPHONEMICS or MORPHONOLOGY) is the branch of linguistics that studies the interaction between morphological and phonological or phonetic processes. Its chief focus is the sound changes that take place in morphemes (minimal meaningful units) when they combine to form words.
