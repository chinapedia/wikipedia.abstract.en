'''Al-Shanfarā ''' (considered to have lived and died around the mid-sixth century CE) was a semi-legendary pre-Islamic poet tentatively associated with Ṭāif, and the supposed author of the celebrated poem _Lāmiyyāt ‘al-Arab_.[1] He enjoys a status as a figure of an archetypal outlaw antihero, critiquing the hypocrisies of his society from his position as an outsider.
