ṢAFIYY AL-DAWLA MUḤAMMAD IBN ʿALI IBN JAʾFAR IBN FALĀH was the Fatimid governor of Aleppo between October 1022 and April 1023.[1] He was specifically assigned to govern the city, while the citadel of Aleppo was assigned to a separate governor, the eunuch Yumn al-Dawla Sa'adat.[2] This marked the first time the Fatimids appointed separate rulers for the city and citadel of Aleppo since they gained direct control over the city in October 1016.[3] Safiyy al-Dawla belonged to the Kutama, a militant Berber group that played a major role in the Fatimid military, and he was the grandson of the Fatimid general Ja'far ibn Fallah.[4] He was bestowed with the title _ṣafiyy al-dawla_ (chosen of the State). Safiyy al-Dawla and Yumn al-Dawla were appointed to Aleppo to replace Abu'l-Najm Badr.[5] Nothing is known about their reign and Safiyy al-Dawla was dismissed in April 1023, and succeeded by Sanad al-Dawla Hasan.[6]
