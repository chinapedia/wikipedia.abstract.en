The BROWN BEAR (_Ursus arctos_) is a bear that is found across much of northern Eurasia and North America.Servheen, C., Herrero, S., Peyton, B., Pelletier, K., Moll, K., & Moll, J. (Eds.). (1999). ''Bears: status survey and conservation action plan (Vol. 44) _. Gland: IUCN.[1] In North America, the populations of brown bears are often called grizzly bears. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (_Ursus maritimus''), which is much less variable in size and slightly larger on average.[2][3][4][5][6]
