VILLA LAURI is an early 20th-century Neoclassical townhouse in Birkirkara, Malta.[1] The villa was built as a private family residence. Part of the property is privately owned, while most of it belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. At one point the Franciscan friars named their part of the property as DAR FRATE FRANCESCO and was later renamed a number of times. The building has primarily served as a shelter for the homeless.
