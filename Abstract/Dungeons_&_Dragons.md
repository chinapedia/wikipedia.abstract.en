_DUNGEONS & DRAGONS_ (commonly abbreviated as _D&D_)[1] is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.[2] It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. It was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game _Chainmail_ serving as the initial rule system.[3] _D&D_{{'s}} publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.[4]
