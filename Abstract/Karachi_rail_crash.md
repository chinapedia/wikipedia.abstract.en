The KARACHI RAIL CRASH (also referred to as the LANDHI RAIL DISASTER) was a train accident between the Fareed Express and the Bahauddin Zakaria Express that occurred on 3 November 2016 at 7:18 PST at Landhi station, in Karachi, Pakistan. The Fareed Express (from Lahore to Karachi) was parked at the Landhi station when the Bahauddin Zakaria Express, which was traveling from Multan to Karachi, collided with the Fareed Express from behind, killing 21 people and injuring 65 people. Minister of Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique originally attributed the crash to the engineers of the Bahauddin Zakaria Express for failing to see both yellow and red signals earlier en-route,[1][2] but Senator Saeed Ghani attributed the crash to a green signal being accidentally activated on the track the Bahauddin Zakaria Express was traveling on.[3][4]
