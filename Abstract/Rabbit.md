RABBITS are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika). _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. _Sylvilagus_ includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the 7 types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or BUNNY) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, a companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration.
