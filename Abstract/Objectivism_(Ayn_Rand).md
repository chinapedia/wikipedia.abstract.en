OBJECTIVISM is a philosophical system developed by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably _The Fountainhead_ (1943) and _Atlas Shrugged_ (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books.[1] Leonard Peikoff, a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,[2][3] later gave it a more formal structure. Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".[4] Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.[5]
