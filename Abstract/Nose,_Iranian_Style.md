_NOSE, IRANIAN STYLE_ is a 2005 Iranian documentary film directed by Mehrdad Oskouei. It is about nose jobs (rhinoplasty) in Iran, which statistically has the most of any country.[1] The documentary employs a semi-comedic tone, with the title referencing the earlier film _Divorce, Iranian Style_.[2] _Nose, Iranian Style_ relates the trend to politics, with it and the 2007 documentary _Tehran: 11 pm_ connecting it to the importance of appearance, given the taboo of men and women directly and socially interacting.[3] However, Oskouei said the film was truly a critique of excessive consumerism.[4]
