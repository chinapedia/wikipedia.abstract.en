The AFRICA SAFARI ADVENTURE PARK (previously ÁFRICA MÍA SAFARI) is a private wildlife park of approximately 100 hectares, located in El Salto, south of the city of Liberia, Costa Rica.[1] All animals have an African safari motif with enclosures for animals such as zebras, warthogs and giraffes all of which multiply in the safari.[2] The park also provides zip lines, nature trails through rain forest with a prominent waterfall and a lagoon for kayaking. The vast alluvial plain of the Guanacaste Province and swampy wetlands provide the Safari with an atmosphere that resembles that of certain plains of Africa.
