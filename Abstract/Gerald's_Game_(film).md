_GERALD'S GAME_ is a 2017 American psychological horror thriller drama film directed and edited by Mike Flanagan and written by Jeff Howard and Flanagan. It is based on Stephen King's 1992 novel of the same name, long thought to be unfilmable.[1] The film stars Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood as a married couple staying in an isolated house during a holiday. When the husband dies of a sudden heart attack, his wife, left handcuffed to the bed without the key and with little hope of rescue, must find a way to survive, all while battling her inner demons.
