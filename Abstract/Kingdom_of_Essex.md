The KINGDOM OF THE EAST SAXONS (; ), today referred to as the KINGDOM OF ESSEX , was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.[1] It was founded in the 6th century and covered the territory later occupied by the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex and (for a short while) Kent. Kings of Essex were frequently subservient to foreign overlords. The last king of Essex was Sigered and in 825, he ceded the kingdom to Ecgberht, King of Wessex.
