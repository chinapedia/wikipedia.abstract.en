A WITRACK is a 3-D motion tracking sensor that is capable of monitoring human body movements.[1][2][3][4][5] This sensor is able to serve three main purposes, such functions being the following: turning on/off home appliances, tracking a lethal fall, and improving gaming experience[6]. This new piece of technology, currently in its developing stages, was developed primarily by Fadel Adib and Dina Katabi at MIT. The WiTrack functions through the use of radio signals, which help perform the task of finding a person's current location, the radio signals not been affected at all by walls and other physical obstacles present.[7]
