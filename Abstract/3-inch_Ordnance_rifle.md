The 3-INCH ORDNANCE RIFLE, MODEL 1861 was a wrought iron muzzle-loading rifled cannon that was adopted by the United States Army in 1861 and widely used in field artillery units during the American Civil War. It fired a projectile to a distance of at an elevation of 5Â°. The 3-inch rifle was not as effective in firing canister shot as the heavier 12-pounder Napoleon, but it proved to be highly accurate at longer ranges when firing shell or shrapnel. There was only one reported case of a 3-inch Ordnance rifle bursting in action. This was in stark contrast to the cast iron 10- and 20-pounder Parrott rifles which occasionally burst without warning, inflicting injury on the gun crews. The Confederate States of America lacked the technology to manufacture successful copies of the 3-inch Ordnance rifle. However, the Confederate States Army respected the weapons and employed those captured from Federal forces.
