For over two millennia, texts in CHINESE HERBOLOGY and TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE have recorded medicinal plants that are also HALLUCINOGENS and PSYCHEDELICS. Some are familiar psychoactive plants in Western herbal medicine (e.g., _làngdàng_ 莨菪 "_Hyoscyamus niger_, black henbane"), but several Chinese plants have not been noted as hallucinogens in modern works (e.g., _yúnshí_ 雲實 "_Caesalpinia decapetala_, cat's claw" flowers). Chinese herbals are an important resource for the history of botany, for instance, Zhang Hua's c. 290 _Bowuzhi_ is the earliest record of the psilocybin mushroom _xiàojùn_ 笑菌 (lit. "laughing mushroom", "_Gymnopilus junonius_, laughing gym").
