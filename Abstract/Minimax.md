MINIMAX (sometimes MINMAX, MM[1] or SADDLE POINT[2]) is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for _mini_mizing the possible loss for a worst case (_max_imum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
