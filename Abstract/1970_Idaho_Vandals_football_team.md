The 1970 IDAHO VANDALS FOOTBALL TEAM represented the University of Idaho in the 1970 NCAA University Division football season. The Vandals were led by first-year head coach Don Robbins and were members of the Big Sky Conference, then in the college division of the NCAA. Without a usable stadium on their Moscow campus for a second year, they played their home games at Rogers Field at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington.
