The CAT (_Felis catus_) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the DOMESTIC CAT to distinguish it from wild members of the family.[3] The cat is either a HOUSE CAT or a FARM CAT, which are pets, or a FERAL CAT, which ranges freely and avoids human contact.[4] A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[5]
