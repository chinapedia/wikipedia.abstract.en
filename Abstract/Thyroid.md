The THYROID GLAND, or simply the THYROID, is an endocrine gland in the neck, consisting of two lobes connected by an . It is found at the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes three hormones, namely the two thyroid hormones (thyroxine/T₄ and triiodothyronine/T₃), and calcitonin. The thyroid hormones primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis, but they also have many other effects, including effects on development. Calcitonin plays a role in calcium homeostasis.
