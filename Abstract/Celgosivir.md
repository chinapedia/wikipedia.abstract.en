CELGOSIVIR, in development by Migenix for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is an oral prodrug of the natural product castanospermine that inhibits alpha-glucosidase I, an enzyme that plays a critical role in viral maturation by initiating the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides of viral envelope glycoproteins. Celgosivir is well absorbed _in vitro_ and _in vivo_, and is rapidly converted to castanospermine. Celgosivir has a novel mechanism of action (preventing the glycosylation of viral proteins by the host), and demonstrates broad antiviral activity _in vitro_.[1]
