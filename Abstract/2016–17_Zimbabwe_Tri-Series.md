The 2016â€“17 ZIMBABWE TRI-SERIES was a One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament that was held in Zimbabwe in November 2016.[1][2] It was a tri-nation series between the national representative cricket teams of Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. The Sri Lankan team were originally scheduled to tour Zimbabwe for two Tests, three ODIs and one Twenty20 International (T20I). However, the ODIs and T20I were replaced by this tri-series.[3]
