CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), also known as ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE (IHD),[1] involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart.[2][3][4] It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases.[5] Types include stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death.[6] A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw.[7] Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest.[8] Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present.[9] In many cases, the first sign is a heart attack.[10] Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat.[11]
