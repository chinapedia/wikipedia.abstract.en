Short-run_equilibrium_of_the_firm_under_monopolistic_competition.JPG Long-run_equilibrium_of_the_firm_under_monopolistic_competition.JPG MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION is a type of imperfect competition such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms.[1][2] In the presence of coercive government, monopolistic competition will fall into government-granted monopoly. Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity. Models of monopolistic competition are often used to model industries. Textbook examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities. The "founding father" of the theory of monopolistic competition is Edward Hastings Chamberlin, who wrote a pioneering book on the subject, _Theory of Monopolistic Competition_ (1933).[3] Joan Robinson published a book _The Economics of Imperfect Competition_ with a comparable theme of distinguishing perfect from imperfect competition.
