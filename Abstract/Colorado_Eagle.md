A_9_Photo_Series,_St._Louis_Union_Station,_Note_the_Dates_Carefully_(23960179069).jpg The _COLORADO EAGLE_ was an American streamlined passenger train operated by the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP) in the mid 20th century. It operated between St. Louis, Missouri and Denver, Colorado, using MP trackage from St. Louis to Pueblo, Colorado and traveling on the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad from there to Denver.[1] The train began service on June 21, 1942 and operated until March 1964, when the name as well as on-board amenities were dropped as the MP reduced passenger service across its system.[2] On April 2, 1966, the MP canceled the remaining unnamed trains servicing Denver, ending passenger service along the _Colorado Eagle_'s route west of Kansas City.[3]
