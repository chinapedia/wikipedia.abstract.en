The present structure was built onto and around a log cabin (1797). The structure was built on the highest point in Sparta and used initially as a fort. Beneath the crawlspace of the present house, the original structure of the log foundation is still in place. The Rossiter-Little House was probably built about 1798 when Timothy Wells Rossiter, a Revolutionary War surgeon from Connecticut, bought the northeast corner lot at Broad and Miles Streets or the year after that when he bought the adjoining lot to the east.[1] It is a contributing property of the Sparta Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[2] It is also part of the Historic American Buildings Survey.
