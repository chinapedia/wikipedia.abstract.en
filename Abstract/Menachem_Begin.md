MENACHEM BEGIN ( _Menaḥem Begin_ (); ; _Menakhem Volfovich Begin_; 16 August 1913 – 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. Before the creation of the state of Israel, he was the leader of the Zionist militant group Irgun, the Revisionist breakaway from the larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah. He proclaimed a revolt, on 1 February 1944, against the British mandatory government, which was opposed by the Jewish Agency. As head of the Irgun, he targeted the British in Palestine.[1] Later, the Irgun fought the Arabs during the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine.
