PHILIP GLASS (born January 31, 1937)[1] is an American composer. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the late 20th century.[2][3][4] Glass's work has been described as _minimal music_, having similar qualities to other "minimalist" composers such as La Monte Young, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley.[5] Glass describes himself as a composer of "music with repetitive structures",[6] which he has helped evolve stylistically.[7][8]
