A CONDOM is a sheath-shaped barrier device, used during sexual intercourse to reduce the probability of pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STI).[1] There are both male and female condoms.[2] With proper use—and use at every act of intercourse—women whose partners use male condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate.[3] With typical use the rate of pregnancy is 18% per-year.[4] Their use greatly decreases the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS.[5] They also to a lesser extent protect against genital herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis.[6]
