GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL (,[1][2] ;[3][4][5][6][7] August 27, 1770 – November 14, 1831) was a German philosopher and an important figure of German idealism. He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the continental tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the analytic tradition as well.[8] Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within Western philosophy is universally recognized.
