WAVE BREAKER: THE RESCUE COASTER is a double launch roller coaster currently operating at SeaWorld San Antonio. The roller coaster is designed to emphasize SeaWorld's animal rescue efforts. It is the first jet ski roller coaster in North America and would incorporate cars designed as jet skis used by SeaWorld's rescue team. Most of the track was built over the park's lake.[1]
