_PEOPLE V. MURRAY_, Supreme Court of California, 15 Cal. 159 (1859), is a criminal case that distinguished between preparation and attempt.[1] The court held that when a defendant acts in preparation to commit a crime, in order for these acts to be an attempt, and not mere preparation, the acts must be a final step that would consummate the crime, but for intervention by forces outside the control of the defendant.[2] Murray was charged with attempt to incestuously marry his niece.[3]Murray declared an intention to marry his cousin, then made many numerous preparations to do so, including eloping with his niece, and requesting a witness to go to the magistrate wedding officer to perform the ceremony.[4]
