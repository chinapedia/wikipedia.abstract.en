Decision_Problem.svg In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a DECISION PROBLEM is a problem that can be posed as a yes-no question of the input values. An example of a decision problem is deciding whether a given natural number is prime. Another is the problem "given two numbers _x_ and _y_, does _x_ evenly divide _y_?". The answer is either 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the values of _x_ and _y_. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an algorithm, is called a DECISION PROCEDURE for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem "given two numbers _x_ and _y_, does _x_ evenly divide _y_?" would give the steps for determining whether _x_ evenly divides _y_. One such algorithm is long division. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called _decidable_.
