The POLITICS OF HAITI take place in the framework of a unitary semi-presidential republic, where the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government. The politics of the country are considered historically unstable due to various coup d'Ã©tats, regime changes, military juntas and internal conflicts. After the deposition of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, however, Haitian politics entered a period of relative democratic stability. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Haiti as "hybrid regime" in 2016.[1]
