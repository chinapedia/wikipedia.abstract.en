The DHOLE (_Cuon alpinus_) is a canid native to Central, South, and Southeast Asia. Other English names for the species include ASIAN WILD DOG, ASIATIC WILD DOG,[1] INDIAN WILD DOG,[2] WHISTLING DOG, RED DOG,[3] and MOUNTAIN WOLF.[4] It is genetically close to species within the genus _Canis_,[5] but distinct in several anatomical aspects: its skull is convex rather than concave in profile, it lacks a third lower molar[6] and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four.[7] During the Pleistocene, the dhole ranged throughout Asia, Europe, and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12,000–18,000 years ago.[8]
