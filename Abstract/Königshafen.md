The KÃ–NIGSHAFEN ("king's harbour") is the northernmost bight of the North Frisian island of Sylt in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein and thus also the northernmost bay in Germany. The bay gets its name from its use as a natural harbour and its legal status as part of the of Listland. The harbour was used until at least the 18th century and was later abandoned as it silted up.
