The SINDH MOHAJIR PUNJABI PATHAN MUTTAHIDA MAHAZ ('Sindh Mohajir-Pashtun-Punjab United Front', abbreviated MPPM) was a political party in the Pakistani province Sindh. The party was founded in 1969.[1][2] Nawab Muzaffar Khan was the convenor of MPPM.[3][4] In theory the party sought to serve as a political platform for Muhajirs, Pashtuns and Punjabis in Sindh (i.e. populations that had migrated to Sindh after the birth of Pakistan), but in reality it functioned as a Muhajir political party as the Pashtun and Punjabi presence in the MPPM ranks was very limited.[5][6] The party mobilized Urdu-speaking Muhajirs against the emerging Sindhi nationalist movement.[7][8] It was led by Muhajir bureaucrats and businessmen.[9] The main base of the MPPM was the city of Hyderabad.[10]
