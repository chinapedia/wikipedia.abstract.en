_THE FOURTH DIMENSION IN SOUND_ (subtitled _A MUSICAL EXPERIMENT IN THE ADAPTATION OF INSTRUMENTS TO MODERN ELECTRONICS_) is an album by bandleader and arranger Shorty Rogers recorded in late 1961 and released on the Warner Bros. label.[1][2] The album was produced principally as a stereo test and demonstration record to be used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems.
