FALSE COGNATES are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages, even within the same family. For example, the English word _dog_ and the Mbabaram word _dog_ have exactly the same meaning and very similar pronunciations, but by complete coincidence. Likewise, English _much_ and Spanish _mucho_ which came by their similar meanings via completely different Proto-Indo-European roots. This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related. (For example: Spanish _dependiente_ looks like _dependent_, but means sales assistant or clerk as well.)
