M. HASNA MAZNAVI (born circa 1985) founded The Women’s Mosque of America, the first women-led Muslim house of worship in the United States. Hasna is also a WGA comedy writer/director committed to changing the way Islam & Muslims are represented in mainstream American media.[1] The Women's Mosque of America is her effort to uplift the entire Muslim community by empowering the women within, and to spark the pathway towards a worldwide women-led Islamic Renaissance — one that is shaped by Muslim women’s voices, participation, leadership, and scholarship.[2] Maznavi had a childhood dream[3] to build a mosque before she died as her _sadaqa jariyah_ (ongoing charity), and she was further inspired by reading the Qur'an in English in entirety and her own study of Islamic history which revealed a rich history of female Muslim religious leadership[4] before she decided to establish her dream mosque with rotating women _khateebahs_ (preachers), which sets a precedent for women's leadership in American Islam.
