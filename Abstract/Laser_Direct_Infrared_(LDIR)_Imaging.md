LASER DIRECT INFRARED (LDIR) IMAGING is an infrared microscopy architecture that utilizes a tunable Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) as the IR source.[1] This new reflectance-based architecture eliminates coherence artifacts typically associated with QCLs. It also allows the acquisition of large-area, high-definition IR images as well as high signal-to-noise point spectra. Extending this architecture using Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) allows the acquisition of high fidelity spectra from features less than 10 Î¼m in size.[2]
