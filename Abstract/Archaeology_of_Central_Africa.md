Central-Africa.svg Gabon-26730.jpg Central Africa is generally considered to encompass ten countries (Cameroon, south-Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Angola[1]) which amounts to more than six million square kilometers or roughly the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River. Despite its large size, very little archaeological research has been done in the region.
