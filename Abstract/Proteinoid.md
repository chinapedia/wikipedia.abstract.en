PROTEINOIDS, or THERMAL PROTEINS, are protein-like, often cross-linked molecules formed abiotically from amino acids.[1] Sidney W. Fox initially proposed that they may have been precursors to the first living cells (protocells).[2] The term was also in the 1960s to describe peptides that are shorter than twenty amino acids found in hydrolysed protein,[3] but this term is no longer commonly used.[4]
