Gregor_Mendel.png, the Moravian Augustinian monk who founded the modern science of genetics]] MENDELIAN INHERITANCE is a type of biological inheritance that follows the laws originally proposed by Gregor Mendel in 1865 and 1866 and re-discovered in 1900. These laws were initially controversial. When Mendel's theories were integrated with the Boveriâ€“Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915, they became the core of classical genetics. Ronald Fisher combined these ideas with the theory of natural selection in his 1930 book _The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection_, putting evolution onto a mathematical footing and forming the basis for population genetics within the modern evolutionary synthesis.[1]
