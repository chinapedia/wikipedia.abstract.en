ISIM_3_logical_region.jpg INTEGRATED SCIENCE INSTRUMENT MODULE (ISIM) is a component of the James Webb Space Telescope, a large international infrared space telescope planned for launch in spring 2021.[1] ISIM is the heart of the JWST, and holds the main science payload which includes four science instruments and the fine guidance sensor.[2] ISIM is the spacecraft chassis and instruments that take the light from the main mirror and convert that into the science data that is then sent back to Earth.[3] The other two major sections of the JWST are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) (mirror and their structure) and the Spacecraft Element (SE), which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield.[4] ISIM has a mass of 1.4 metric tons (tonnes) (1.54 US tons).[5] The infrared camera instrument integrated with ISIM passed its thermal tests in early 2016.[6] ISIM underwent intense thermal cold testing in late 2015 to early 2016.[7] NIRcam is extremely important to JWST, because it's not only a sensitive infrared camera, but it is also used to adjust the alignment of the main mirror segments.[8] The tests were very positive because NIRcam showed was very stable through vibration and thermal testing.[9] NIRcam was installed into ISIM in March 2014, and then underwent integration and testing after that, as the telescope is readied for its 2019 launch.[10] ISIM is about 23% of the overall mass of JWST, which equates to an ISIM mass of 1400Â kg (3086 lb).[11]
