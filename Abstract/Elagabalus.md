ELAGABALUS (), also known as HELIOGABALUS (; 204 â€“ 11 March 222), was Roman emperor from 218 to 222. A member of the Severan dynasty, he was Syrian, the second son of Julia Soaemias and Sextus Varius Marcellus. In his early youth he served the god Elagabalus as a priest in Emesa, the hometown of his mother's family. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus.[1] Upon becoming emperor he took the name MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS AUGUSTUS. He was called Elagabalus only after his death.[2]
