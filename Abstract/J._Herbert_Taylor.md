JAMES HERBERT TAYLOR (January 14, 1916 in Corsicana, Texas—December 29, 1998 in Tallahassee, Florida)[1][2] was an American molecular biologist and geneticist known for his research on chromosome structure and reproduction, which helped establish standards for the subsequent field of molecular genetics. He conducted much of this research with his wife, Shirley Taylor.[3] According to a 2006 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory textbook, “Taylor comes as close as anyone to being the father of the field” of studying chromosomes.[4]
