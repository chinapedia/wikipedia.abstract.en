The IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA; ), also known as the PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PROVISIONAL IRA or PROVOS),[1][2][3] was[4][5][6][7] an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland,[8] facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland.[9][10] It was the most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or _Óglaigh na hÉireann_ in Irish,[11] and was broadly referred to as such by others. The IRA was designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland.[12][13]
