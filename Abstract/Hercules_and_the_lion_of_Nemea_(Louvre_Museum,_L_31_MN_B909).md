HERACLES AND THE LION OF NEMEA is a lekythos which is held at the Louvre Museum, with the representation of the first of the labours of Hercules, the slaying of the Nemean lion. It is coming from Athens, dated around 500 - 450Â BCE[1] and it was bought for Louvre Museum at 1870. It was probably created from the shop of a Tanagran artist.[2][3] According to Beazley and Haspels it is attributed to the Diosphos painter.[4]
