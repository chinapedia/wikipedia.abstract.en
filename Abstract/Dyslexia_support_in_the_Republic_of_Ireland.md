In the Republic of Ireland, people with dyslexia, especially school children, can benefit from a range of support techniques including additional one-to-one literacy support from specialist teachers,[1] computer tools with text-to-speech, spelling correction and word prediction; coloured glasses, and many other methods.[2] The techniques chosen for an individual vary according to their particular conditions. People in Northern Ireland are aided by the service available from Dyslexia support in the United Kingdom.
