DIMETHANDROLONE BUCICLATE (developmental code name CDB-4386A), or DIMETHANDROLONE BUCYCLATE, also known as 7Α,11Β-DIMETHYL-19-NORTESTOSTERONE 17Β-BUCICLATE, is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) which was developed by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and has not been marketed at this time.[1][2][3][4][5] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β buciclate (4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate) ester of dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) – and acts as a prodrug of dimethandrolone in the body.[6][7][8][9][10] Dimethandrolone buciclate is or was under investigation as a potential male contraceptive.[11][12][13][14][15]
