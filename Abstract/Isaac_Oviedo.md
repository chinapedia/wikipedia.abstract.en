ISAAC OVIEDO (July 6, 1902 – June 16, 1992) was a Cuban tres player, singer and songwriter. He was the founder and leader of the Septeto Matancero for over 50 years, and the author of many famous _sones_ such as "Engancha carretero". Throughout his long career Oviedo only recorded a handful of sessions, mostly for American record labels. He has been called "one of the greatest Cuban tres players" by other musicians such as Efraín Ríos and Pancho Amat.[1][2] According to the latter, Oviedo was the pioneering and most influential _tresero_ of the _septeto_ format (the major type of son ensemble of the 1920s and '30s).[3] His technical innovations include the _alzapúa_ thumb stroke and the use of the pinky finger.
