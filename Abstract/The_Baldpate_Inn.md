THE BALDPATE INN is a hotel located in Estes Park, Colorado, with a designation on the National Register of Historic Places. EstesParkCO_BaldpateInn.jpg National_Register_of_Historic_Places,_metal_plaque.jpg It was founded in 1917 by Anglo-American brothers Charles Mace (combat and commercial photographer, 1889-1973), and Gordon Mace, and their families.[1] The Inn is known especially two reasons: the hotel was named for the popular mystery novel, play and films _Seven Keys to Baldpate_ by Earl Derr Biggers, and was eventually accepted to be the "true" Baldpate by the author. While the hotel originally gave away keys as curios, today it is known for its collection of more than 20,000 keys, usual, unusual and figurative, that have been offered to the inn by visitors, hotel guests, and dignitaries from all over the world. A_sampling_of_the_keys_hung_from_the_ceiling_in_the_Key_Room_at_The_Baldpate_Inn.jpg Keys are cataloged in a database, supported by a grant from American History Savers and maintained by rotating curators who offer insight into the collections through a lecture series and blog.
