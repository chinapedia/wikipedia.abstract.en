Hypercube networks are a type of network topology used to connect multiple processors with memory modules and accurately route data. Hypercube networks consist of 2^(m) nodes. These nodes form the vertices of squares to create an internetwork connection. A hypercube is basically a multidimensional mesh network with two nodes in each dimension. Due to similarity, such topologies are usually grouped into a k-ary d-dimensional mesh topology family where d represents the number of dimensions and k represents the number of nodes in each dimension.[1] [2] Hypercube-construction-4d.png
