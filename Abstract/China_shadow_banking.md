CHINA'S SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM can be described as credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular Chinese banking system.[1] Shadow banking is fairly common globally; however, in most countries this practice originates from non-banks rather than commercial banks.[2] China's shadow banking system has experienced rapid growth since the global financial crisis.[3]
