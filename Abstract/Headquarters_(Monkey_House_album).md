_HEADQUARTERS_ is the title of a studio album by the music group Monkey House, released in May 2012, on the Alma Records label, which is affiliated with the Universal Music Group. It was mainly recorded at the Drive Shed in Toronto. It was produced and arranged by Don Breithaupt, and the engineer was John 'Beetle' Bailey. Breithaupt is the founder and leader of Monkey House, who have been recording since 1992. Their previous two albums were _Welcome to the Club_ (1992), and _True Winter_ (1998). In 2005, they released _Big Money_, a collection of singles, remasters, and rarities. Stylistically, the _Headquarters_ album shows it to be influenced by the music of Steely Dan, with arranged horns and background vocals throughout. Breithaupt says the tunes are "pop songs with too many chords!"[1] Also, some guitar work comes from guest artists Drew Zingg (who is best known for his work with Boz Scaggs and Steely Dan), as well as from Kim Mitchell and Rik Emmett (founder of the band Triumph). Also making contributions on this album are Steely Dan trumpet player and musical director Michael Leonhart, with Julie Crocheti√®re and David Blamires adding backup vocals.[2] _Headquarters_ has generated increasing attention and multi-genre airplay for Monkey House, with a growing international audience.[3][4]
