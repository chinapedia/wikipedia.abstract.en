Coordinates Newlakesidemap.png DONCASTER LAKESIDE is a recreational area and shopping complex centred on a lake, around 3 km or 2 miles SE of Doncaster town centre, in the area of Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council. In recent years it has been expanded and modernised. Barratt Developments have built two developments in the area - 'Serenity@Lakeside' and 'Belle Vue' - under the David Wilson Homes and Barratt Homes brands, respectively. After completion, the area has settled vegetation, paths, bridges, notice boards and public gatherings.
