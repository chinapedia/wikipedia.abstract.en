_PEOPLE V. BLAND_, 28 Cal. 4th 313 (2002), is a United States criminal case interpreting attempted murder.[1] The defendant fired multiple shots into a car with three people, killing the driver, and injuring the other two.[2] The evidence showed he intended to kill the driver, but did not specifically intend to kill the others.[3] The court wrote "The crime of attempt sanctions what the person intended to do but did not accomplish, not unintended and unaccomplished potential consequences." However, the court found a person could concurrently intend to kill more than just the person targeted, both the target and others in the "kill zone" of the shots, such as when a person sets off a bomb targeting a person who is surrounded by others, who would be guilty of murder of everyone killed by the blast.[4]
