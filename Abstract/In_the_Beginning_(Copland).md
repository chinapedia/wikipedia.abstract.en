_IN THE BEGINNING_ is a 1947 choral work by Aaron Copland to a text from the Book of Genesis chapter 1:1 to 2:7.[1] The 15'-20' minute long work is for mixed four-part chorus a capella and soprano or mezzo-soprano solo. The work is evocative of the Hebrew _davening_ and shows the influence of polytonality with references to jazz and blues. _In the Beginning_ was composed for Harvard University's Symposium on Music Criticism in May 1947. The premiere was performed by the Collegiate Chorale at the Harvard Memorial Church, Cambridge on 2 May of that year, conducted by Robert Shaw.
