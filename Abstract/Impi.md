Zuluchargegutt.jpg IMPI is a Zulu word for any armed body of men. However, in English it is often used to refer to a Zulu regiment, which is called an _ibutho_ in Zulu. Its beginnings lie far back in historic tribal warfare customs, when groups of armed men called _impis_ battled. They were systematised radically by the Zulu king Shaka, who was then only the exiled illegitimate son of king Senzangakhona kaJama, but already showing much prowess as a general in the army of Mthethwa king Dingiswayo in the Ndwandwe–Zulu War of 1817–1819.
