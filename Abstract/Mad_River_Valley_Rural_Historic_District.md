The MAD RIVER VALLEY RURAL HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a large rural landscape in northern Waitsfield and southern Moretown, Vermont. Encompassing some of bottom lands on either side of the Mad River, the area has seen active agricultural use since the late 18th century, and retains a number of mid-19th century farmsteads. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.[1]
