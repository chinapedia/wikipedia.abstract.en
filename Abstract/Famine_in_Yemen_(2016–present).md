Since 2016, a famine has been ongoing in Yemen which started during the Yemeni Civil War.[1] Over 17 million of Yemen's population are at risk;[2][3] over 3.3 million children and pregnant or lactating women suffer from acute malnutrition.[4] Over 100,000 of the affected children are in Al Hudaydah Governorate, with the city of Al Hudaydah worst affected area of the province.[5] According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the famine in Yemen will soon reach "biblical proportions".[6] The famine is being compounded by an outbreak of cholera, which is resulting in 5,000 new cases daily.[7] Devastation of Yemeni infrastructure, health, water and sanitation systems and facilities by Saudi-led coalition air strikes led to the spread of cholera.[8][9][10] UNICEF says that Saudi-led coalition airstrikes are deliberately targeting water systems in Yemen.[11]
