KochFlake.svgs of the Koch curve, where after each iteration, all original line segments are replaced with four, each a self-similar copy that is 1/3 the length of the original. One formalism of the Hausdorff dimension uses this scale factor (3) and the number of self-similar objects (4) to calculate the dimension, D, after the first iteration to be D = (log N)/(log S) = (log 4)/(log 3) â‰ˆ 1.26.[1] That is, while the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, of a line segment is 1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3, for fractals such as this, the object can have a non-integer dimension.]]
