The NEW HAVEN DISTRICT CAMPGROUND, also known as the PLAINVILLE CAMPGROUND, is a historic Methodist camp meeting site on Gladding Avenue in Plainville, Connecticut. Opened in 1865, the campground was used by Connecticut Methodists to partake in the 19th-century trend of religious and recreational camp meetings, and is now a secular community of summer homes. The campground was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1980.[1]
