ST. LUKE'S CHURCH, KENSINGTON, was an Episcopal congregation in Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The parish was founded in 1904 as an outgrowth of the Episcopal Hospital Mission. The church – located at the northeast corner of East Huntington and B Streets at Kensington Avenue – was designed by Allen Evans of Furness & Evans, and completed in 1904.[1] Its parish house, just north of the church, was designed by Furness & Evans, and completed in 1905.[2][3] Description: "The new [parish house] building will cost $35,000, and is to be a two-story building constructed of Holmesburg granite. The first floor will be used for classes—the Sunday School numbers 1,500,—the second floor for the chapel and library, and a gymnasium will be located in the basement."[4]
