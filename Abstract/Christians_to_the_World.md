CHRISTIANS TO THE WORLD () is a Christian-oriented pro-democracy political group established by social worker Hendrick Lui Chi-hang in 2016. It encourages the political activeness of the Christians, holding localist thoughts and advocates for a referendum to decide the prospect of the Hong Kong sovereignty in 2047 to implement genuine autonomy of Hong Kong.[1] In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, Lui ran in the New Territories West and received 812 votes, 0.13 percent of the vote share.
