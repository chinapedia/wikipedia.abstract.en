The Sitka pulp mill was a pulp mill located on the North and West Shores of Sawmill Cove, approximately five miles East of Sitka Alaska.[1] In 1956, the mill site was purchased from Freda and John Van Horn by The Alaska Pulp Corporation. This was the first Japanese investment in the United States Of America since World War II, and the mill operated from 1959 until 1993.[2] The majority of production was used to create rayon fabric, and to supply Japan with logs to rebuild homes and infrastructure after World War II. In the later years of the mill, as the demand for rayon and logs for rebuilding decreased, the primary focus of the mill became the manufacture of paper.[3]
