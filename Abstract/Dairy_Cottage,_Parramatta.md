Dairy_Cottage_circa_1870_3.jpg DAIRY COTTAGE is a building of historical significance, located in Parramatta Park in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta. Built in 1798, it is one of the earliest residences in Australia and the only 18th Century convict-built cottage. Its history encompasses three distinct phases of occupation: first as the residence of a Second Fleet convict who developed the property into a thriving farm, second as a dairy which supplied milk products to the Governor's household and surrounding population, and third as a ranger's cottage.[1] It is heritage-listed.[2]
