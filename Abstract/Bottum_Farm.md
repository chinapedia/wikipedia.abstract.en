The BOTTUM FARM is a historic farm property at 1423 North Street in New Haven, Vermont. With a history dating back to the early 1770s, it is one of the community's oldest farm properties, and is also significant for its association with Justus Sherwood, a major in Vermont's Revolutionary War-era history. The property, which now includes buildings dating from the mid-19th to early-20th centuries, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[1]
