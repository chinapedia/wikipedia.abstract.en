The standard gauge is also called STEPHENSON GAUGE after George Stephenson, INTERNATIONAL GAUGE, UIC GAUGE, UNIFORM GAUGE, NORMAL GAUGE and EUROPEAN GAUGE in the European Union and Russia.[1][2][3][4][5] It is the most widely used railway track gauge across the world, with approximately 55% of the lines in the world using it. All high-speed rail lines use standard gauge except those in Russia, Finland, Portugal and Uzbekistan. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be 1435 mm except in the United States, where it is still defined in U.S. customary units as exactly "four feet eight and one half inches"[6] (0.1 mm larger than the metric standard).
