WOODNEATH is a historic farmhouse located in Kansas City, Missouri that was occupied by the Arnold, Moore and Crouch families between 1855 and the late 1970s. It was named "Woodneath" after the abundant oak, pine and sugar maples on the property, and many of those tree varieties are still present on the property today.[1] The farmhouse and surrounding property are good examples of the agrarian lifestyle common in Clay County, Missouri during this time period. The property is currently adjacent to the Woodneath Farms neighborhood, named for the farmhouse.
