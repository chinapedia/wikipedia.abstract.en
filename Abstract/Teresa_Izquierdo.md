TERESA IZQUIERDO (March 10, 1934 – July 27, 2011) was a noted Peruvian master chef. Affectionately known as "the mother of Peruvian food", she founded the renowned restaurant EL RINCÓN QUE NO CONOCES[1] ("The corner you don´t know"), in a working-class neighbourhood of Lima, receiving acclaim within and outside of the country as one of the chief proponents of traditional coastal _criollo_ cuisine.[2][3] Characteristically humble, she insisted in interviews on being called a cook rather than a chef.[4] A contest for the top soup-kitchen chefs is named after her.[5]
