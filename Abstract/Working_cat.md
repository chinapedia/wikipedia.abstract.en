A WORKING CAT is type of domestic cat that "works" for its upkeep by hunting vermin, such as rodents. They are commonly employed where pest control is needed: in barns, farms, factories, warehouses, stores, churchyards, and private property.[1] A benefit of using a working cat is that they alleviate the need for harmful pesticides.[2] Working cats are often placed in their environment as a part of a working cats program.
