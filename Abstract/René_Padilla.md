C. RENÃ‰ PADILLA (born 1932) is an Ecuadorian evangelical theologian and missiologist known for coining the term _integral mission_ () in the 1970s to articulate Christianity's dual priority in evangelism and social activism. He would popularize this term in Latin American evangelicalism through the Latin American Theological Fellowship and through global evangelicalism through the Lausanne Conference of 1974.
