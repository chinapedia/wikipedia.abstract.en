EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE[1] refers to life occurring outside of Earth which did not originate on Earth. Such hypothetical life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity.[2][3] The Drake equation speculates about the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as exobiology.
