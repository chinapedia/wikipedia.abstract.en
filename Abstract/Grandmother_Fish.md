_GRANDMOTHER FISH: A CHILD'S FIRST BOOK OF EVOLUTION_ was written by Jonathan Tweet. The book explains Charles Darwin's theory of common descent and its target audience is 3â€“5-year-olds. It uses a call-and-response interaction between speaker and listener, where the child is asked to mimic the behavior of various animals from our evolutionary past.[1] The book is illustrated by Karen Lewis with colored artwork. _Grandmother Fish_ takes children and adults through the history of life on our planet and explains how we are connected.
