SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN THE BRITISH ANTARCTIC TERRITORY, which is a sector of Antarctica and is one of the 14 British Overseas Territories, has been legal since 13 October 2016. Between 2 August 2016 and 30 September 2016, a consultation on a draft of a new marriage ordinance was conducted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The new ordinance stated that the laws relating to marriage in England would apply in the territory, thereby allowing same-sex marriage.[1][2][3] The ordinance was proclaimed by Commissioner Peter Hayes on 13 October 2016 and took effect forthwith.[4][5][6]
