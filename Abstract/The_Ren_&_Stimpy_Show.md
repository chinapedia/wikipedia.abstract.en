_THE REN & STIMPY SHOW_, also known as _REN & STIMPY_, is an American animated television series created by John Kricfalusi for Nickelodeon. The series follows the adventures of title characters Ren, an emotionally unstable chihuahua and Stimpy, a good-natured yet dimwitted cat. The show premiered on August 11, 1991, as one of the original three Nicktoons alongside _Rugrats_ and _Doug_. Throughout its run, the show was controversial for its off-color and dark humor, sexual innuendos, adult jokes, and violence. The production's failure to deliver episodes on time and its deteriorating relationship with Nickelodeon executives and Standards and Practices department led to Kricfalusi's departure from the show in 1992. The show ended on December 16, 1995, with a total of five seasons and 52 episodes.
