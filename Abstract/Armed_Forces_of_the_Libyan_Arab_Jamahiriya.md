The ARMED FORCES OF THE LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA consisted of the Libyan Army, Libyan Air Force and the Libyan Navy and other services including the People's Militia. In November 2010, before the Libyan Civil War in 2011, the total number of Libyan personnel was estimated at 76,000[1] though that war wore the military's numbers away. There was no separate defence ministry; all defence activities were centralised under Gaddafi. There was a High Command of the Armed Forces (al-Qiyada al-ulya lil-quwwat al-musallaha).[2] Arms production was limited and manufacturers were state-owned.[3] Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was the last minister of defence of the Gaddafi-era military.
