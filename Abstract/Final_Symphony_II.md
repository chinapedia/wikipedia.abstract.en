_FINAL SYMPHONY II_ is a symphonic concert tour first held at the Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany on August 29, 2015 and performed through 2016. The concert tour features arrangements of video game music selected from the _Final Fantasy_ series, specifically _Final Fantasy V_, _VIII_, _IX_, and _XIII_. It is divided into four acts, one per game, with the newest game, _Final Fantasy XIII_, first, and the oldest, _V_, last; all four arrangements are single-section arrangements, with the _IX_ portion as a piano concerto. The tour is a follow up to _Final Symphony_, a similar tour of orchestral arrangement performances from _Final Fantasy VI_, _VII_, and _X_ beginning in 2013 and continuing to date. The concert is produced and directed by Thomas BÃ¶cker of Merregnon Studios, with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen, along with Roger Wanamo and _Final Fantasy XIII_ composer Masashi Hamauzu. The original works were composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Hamauzu, and an introductory piece was composed by Valtonen. The premiere concert was performed by the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn under conduction from Eckehard Stier, with guest performer Mischa Cheung joining the orchestra on piano.
