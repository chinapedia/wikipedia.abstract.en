PAOLO UCCELLO (, ; 1397 â€“ 10 December 1475), born PAOLO DI DONO, was an Italian painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual perspective in art. In his book _Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects_ Giorgio Vasari wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings. His best known works are the three paintings representing the battle of San Romano, which were wrongly entitled the _Battle of Sant'Egidio of 1416_ for a long period of time.[1]
