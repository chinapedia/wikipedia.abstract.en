AMLAWDD WLEDIG (Middle Welsh and other alternative spellings present in relevant sources include AMLAWD, AMLAWT, ANLAWDD, ANLAWD, AMLODD, AMLWYD, AFLAWDD and ANBLAUD) was a legendary king of sub-Roman Britain. The Welsh title _[G]wledig_, archaically _Gwledic_ or _Guletic_ and latinised _Guleticus_, is defined as follows: "lord, king, prince, ruler; term applied to a number of early British rulers and princes who were prominent in the defence of Britain about the time of the Roman withdrawal; (possibly) commander of the native militia (in a Romano-British province)".[1]
