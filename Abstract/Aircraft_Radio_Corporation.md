AIRCRAFT RADIO CORPORATION (ARC) -- not to be confused with Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) -- was a principal pioneer and major manufacturer of avionics for military and commercial aircraft, and later general aviation (light) aircraft, from the 1920s to the 1950sâ€”subsequently acquired and rebranded by a succession of other companies, each of whom changed the official name, of the enterprise, while _initially_ continuing ARC's primary function, staffing, facilities and product focus.[1]
