PERIODS FOR POLITICIANS (originally PERIODS FOR PENCE) is a campaign launched by the women of Indiana in response to a controversial abortion bill passed by Republican Mike Pence, the fiftieth governor of Indiana, in March 2016. The campaign encourages women to send emails, tweets and phone calls to the governor's office reporting the progression of their menstrual cycles.[1] The group's Facebook page was created March 28 of 2016.
