The "MERE GOOK RULE" (MGR) was a controversial name that some U.S. soldiers in the Vietnam War had for what they claim to have been an unofficial policy in which soldiers would be prosecuted very leniently, if at all, for killing or harming Vietnamese civilians, even if the victims turned out to have no connection to the Viet Cong or to the North Vietnamese Army. The supposed rationale for the MGR was that U.S. soldiers had a very difficult time determining which Vietnamese people were civilians and which were enemies. To the extent that soldiers believed the MGR existed, it effectively gave them permission to err on the side of killing suspected Vietnamese enemies even if there was a very good chance that they were civilians. Some authors have argued that the MGR helped create a climate in which the United States committed many war crimes in Vietnam.[1][2]
