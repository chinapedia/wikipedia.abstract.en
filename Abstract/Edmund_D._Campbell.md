EDMUND DOUGLAS CAMPBELL (March 12, 1899 â€“ December 7, 1995) was a Virginia lawyer and progressive politician in Arlington County, Virginia who opposed the Byrd Organization, particularly its declared Massive Resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and 1955.[1] Campbell and his wife Elizabeth Pfohl Campbell became known for their efforts to improve and desegregate Arlington's public schools, and organized a coalition of parents and citizens from across Virginia (the Save Our Schools Committee) to allow schools which desegregated pursuant to court order to remain open, contrary to the announced policies of Senator Harry F. Byrd and his allies.
