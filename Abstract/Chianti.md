Fiasco_di_chianti_monteriggioni.jpg''.]] A CHIANTI WINE () is any wine produced in the Chianti region, in central Tuscany, Italy. It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a _fiasco_ ("flask"; _pl. fiaschi_). However, the _fiasco_ is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy) created the Chianti recipe of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 15% Malvasia bianca in the middle of the 19th century.[1]
