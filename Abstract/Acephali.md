In church history, the term __ (from Ancient Greek: ἀκέφαλοι _akephaloi_, "headless", singular ἀκέφαλος _akephalos_ from ἀ- _a-_, "without", and κεφαλή _kephalé_, "head") has been applied to several sects that supposedly had no leader. E. Cobham Brewer wrote, in _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_, that acephalites, "properly means men without a head."[1] Jean Cooper wrote, in _Dictionary of Christianity_, that it characterizes "various schismatical Christian bodies".[2] Among them were Nestorians who rejected the Council of Ephesus condemnation of Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople,[3] which deposed Nestorius and declared him a heretic.
