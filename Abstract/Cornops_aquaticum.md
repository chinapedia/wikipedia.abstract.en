_CORNOPS AQUATICUM_ is a semiaquatic species of grasshopper native to the Neotropics, from southern Mexico south to central Argentina and Uruguay.[1] It feeds and breeds exclusively on members of the aquatic plant family Pontederiaceae, especially water hyacinth (_Eichhornia crassipes_), and is being investigated as a possible biological pest control agent for the water hyacinth in countries where that plant is invasive.[2]
