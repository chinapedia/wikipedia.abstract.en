CRISPIN GURHOLT (born January 18, 1965 in Oslo) is a Norwegian artist based in Oslo and Berlin, known for his Live Photo projects since 2000.[1][2] Live Photos are site-specific, live installations, where the artist stages people in carefully directed tableaus. The settings are often trivial and ordinary â€“ a bookshop, a street corner, a hairdresser`s.[3] The models, posing in a frozen photographic moment, are viewed by the audience through a natural or artificial barrier such as a shop window or a sheet of mounted plexiglass. The live performances normally have a duration of two hours.
