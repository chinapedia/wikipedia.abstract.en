In cell biology, an ORGANELLE is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function. Organelles are either separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers (also called membrane-bound organelles) or are spatially distinct functional units without a surrounding lipid bilayer (non-membrane bound organelles).
