ALBANIAâ€“EGYPT RELATIONS refer to current and historical relations between Albania and Egypt. Albania has an embassy in Cairo, and Egypt has an embassy in Tirana.[1][2] The history of diplomatic relations of Albania and Egypt dates back to the early modern history, when Muhammad Ali of Egypt _(Albanian: Mehmet Ali Pasha)_ became governor, and self-declared viceroy of Egypt and Sudan with the Ottomans temporary approval.
