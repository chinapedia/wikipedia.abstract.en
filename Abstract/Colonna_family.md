The COLONNA FAMILY, also known as Sciarrillo or Sciarra, is a papal noble family. It was powerful in medieval and Renaissance Rome, supplying one Pope (Martin V) and many other Church and political leaders. The family is notable for its bitter feud with the Orsini family over influence in Rome, until it was stopped by Papal Bull in 1511. In 1571, the heads of both families married nieces of Pope Sixtus V. Thereafter, historians recorded that _"no peace had been concluded between the princes of Christendom, in which they had not been included by name"_.[1]
