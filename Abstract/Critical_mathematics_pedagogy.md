CRITICAL MATHEMATICS PEDAGOGY is an approach to mathematics education that includes a practical and philosophical commitment to liberation.[1] Approaches that involve critical mathematics pedagogy give special attention to the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of oppression, as they can be understood through mathematics.[2] They also analyze the role that mathematics plays in producing and maintaining potentially oppressive social, political, cultural or economic structures.[3] Finally, critical mathematics pedagogy demands that critique is connected to action promoting more just and equitable social, political or economic reform.[4]
