_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _RECONDITA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes a single species in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are inconspicuous shrubs with linear leaves which are triangular in cross-section, rather scattered flowers and staminodes tapering to a fine point.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Recondita_ is derived from the Latin word _reconditus_ meaning "concealed" or "hidden"[4] referring to the small size and scattered flowers of plants in this section.[5]
