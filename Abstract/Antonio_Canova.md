ANTONIO CANOVA (; 1 November 1757 â€“ 13 October 1822) was an Italian Neoclassical sculptor,[1][2] famous for his marble sculptures. Often regarded as the greatest of the Neoclassical artists,[3] his sculpture was inspired by the Baroque and the classical revival, and has been characterised as having avoided the melodramatics of the former, and the cold artificiality of the latter.[4]
