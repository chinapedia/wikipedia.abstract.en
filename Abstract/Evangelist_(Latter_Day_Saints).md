In the Latter Day Saint movement, an EVANGELIST is an ordained office of the ministry. In some denominations of the movement, an evangelist is referred to as a PATRIARCH. However, the latter term was deprecated by the Community of Christ after the church began ordaining women to the priesthood. Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), have an evangelist position independent of the original "patriarch" office instituted movement founder Joseph Smith.
