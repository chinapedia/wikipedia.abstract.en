A DIACRITIC – also DIACRITICAL MARK, DIACRITICAL POINT, DIACRITICAL SIGN, or ACCENT – is a glyph added to a letter or basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (_diakritikós_, "distinguishing"), from (_diakrī́nō_, "to distinguish"). _Diacritic_ is primarily an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas _diacritical_ is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ), are often called _accents_. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.
