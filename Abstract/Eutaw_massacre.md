The EUTAW RIOT was an episode of white racial violence in Eutaw, Alabama, the county seat of Greene County, on October 25, 1870,[1][2] during the Reconstruction Era in the United States. It was related to an extended period of campaign violence before the fall gubernatorial election, as white Democrats in the state used racial terrorism to suppress black Republican voting. White Klan members attacked a Republican rally of 2,000 black citizens in the courthouse square, killing as many as four and wounding 54.
