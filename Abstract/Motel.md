Bjerka_Motel_B.JPG, Norway]] A MOTEL or MOTOR LODGE is a hotel designed for motorists and usually has a parking area for motor vehicles. Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word _motel_, coined as a portmanteau contraction of "motor hotel", originates from the Milestone Mo-Tel of San Luis Obispo, California (now called the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo), which was built in 1925.[1] The term referred initially to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking. Motels are often individually owned, though motel chains do exist.
