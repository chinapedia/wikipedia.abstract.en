The IRAN–CONTRA AFFAIR (, ), popularized in Iran as the MCFARLANE AFFAIR[1], also referred to as IRANGATE,[2] CONTRAGATE,[3] the IRAN–CONTRA SCANDAL, or simply IRAN–CONTRA, was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration. Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo.[4] The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government (except for the Office of the President and the National Security Council) had been prohibited by Congress.
