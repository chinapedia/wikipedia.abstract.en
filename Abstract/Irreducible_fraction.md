An IRREDUCIBLE FRACTION (or FRACTION IN LOWEST TERMS or REDUCED FRACTION) is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are integers that have no other common divisors than 1 (and -1, when negative numbers are considered).[1] In other words, a fraction ^(a)‚ÅÑ_(b) is irreducible if and only if _a_ and _b_ are coprime, that is, if _a_ and _b_ have a greatest common divisor of 1. In higher mathematics, "IRREDUCIBLE FRACTION" may also refer to rational fractions such that the numerator and the denominator are coprime polynomials.[2] Every positive rational number can be represented as an irreducible fraction in exactly one way.[3]
