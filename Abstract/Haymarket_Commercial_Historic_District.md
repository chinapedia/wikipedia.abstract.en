The HAYMARKET COMMERCIAL HISTORIC DISTRICT is a nationally recognized historic district located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1] At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 28 resources, including 19 contributing buildings, and nine non-contributing buildings.[2] "Haymarket" is the forked-junction of Main and Pearl Streets where the city's scales were located in the 1890s. It is on the south side of the central business district. Council Bluffs was founded in the late 1840s as Kanesville by Mormons. When Brigham Young called all people of the faith outside of Utah to Salt Lake City in 1852, the community ceased to be majority Mormon. It was renamed Council Bluffs in 1853. The buildings here are among the earliest extant commercial buildings in the city.[3]
