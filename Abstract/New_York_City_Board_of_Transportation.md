The NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF TRANSPORTATION or the BOARD OF TRANSPORTATION OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK (NYCBOT or BOT) was a city transit commission and operator in New York City, consisting of three members appointed by the mayor.[1] It was created in 1924 to control city-owned and operated public transportation service within the New York City Transit System. The agency oversaw the construction and operation of the municipal Independent Subway System (IND), which was constructed shortly after the Board was chartered. The BOT later presided over the major transfers of public transit from private control to municipal control that took place in the 1940s, including the unification of the New York City Subway in 1940. In 1953, the Board was dissolved and replaced by the state-operated New York City Transit Authority, now part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).
