Rabbi ADIN STEINSALTZ () or ADIN EVEN YISRAEL () (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic, and spiritual mentor, who has been hailed by _Time_ magazine as a "once-in-a-millennium scholar".[1] He has devoted his life to making the Talmud accessible to all Jews.[2] Originally published in modern Hebrew, with a running commentary to facilitate learning, his _Steinsaltz edition of the Talmud_[3] has also been translated into English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several tractates in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. The first volume of a new English-Hebrew edition, the Koren Talmud Bavli, was released in May, 2012, with thirteen tractates in print by July 2014. New volumes are being released following the Daf Yomi cycle.[4]
