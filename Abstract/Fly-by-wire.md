Airbus-319-cockpit.jpg was the first commercial airliner to feature a full glass cockpit and digital fly-by-wire flight control system. The only analogue instruments were the RMI, brake pressure indicator, standby altimeter and artificial horizon, the latter two being replaced by a digital integrated standby instrument system in later production models.]] FLY-BY-WIRE (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response. It can use mechanical flight control backup systems (Boeing 777) or use fully fly-by-wire controls.[1]
