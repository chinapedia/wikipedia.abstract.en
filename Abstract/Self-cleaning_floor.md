A SELF-CLEANING FLOOR is a floor surface that reduces the amount of chemicals, energy, and human resources associated with cleaning floor surfaces. Such floors are meant for use in hospitals, toilets and other places in which cleanliness is of vital importance.[1] In Europe, most of the leading ceramic tiles and sanitary ware manufacturers have products on the market with self cleaning features.[2]
