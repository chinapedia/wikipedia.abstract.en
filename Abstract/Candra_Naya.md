CANDRA NAYA (Hokkien: SIN MING HUI) is an 18th-century historic building in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was home to the Khouw family of Tamboen, most notably its highest-ranking member: Khouw Kim An, the last _Majoor der Chinezen_ ('Major of the Chinese') of Batavia (in office from 1910 until 1942).[1][2] Although among the grandest colonial residences in the capital and protected by heritage laws, the compound was almost completely demolished by its new owners, the conglomerate Modern Group.[3] The main halls have survived only thanks to vocal protests from heritage conservation groups.[4]
