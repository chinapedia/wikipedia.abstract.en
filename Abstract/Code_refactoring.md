CODE REFACTORING is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the _factoring_—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve _nonfunctional_ attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve source-code maintainability and create a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.
