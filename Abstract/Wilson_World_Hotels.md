The chain was founded in 1984 by Kemmons Wilson, who was also the founder of the successful Holiday Inn hotel chain. The company was also named after the founder. The company's first hotel was opened in 1984 near the entrance of Walt Disney World in Kissimmee, Florida.[1] Through the late 90s and early 2000's the properties were slowly sold off to other hotel companies. The final Wilson World Hotel closed in Dallas, Texas in June 2003.[2]
