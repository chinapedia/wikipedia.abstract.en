The RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT, commonly referred to as the RICO ACT or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the _leaders_ of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they _ordered_ others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.[1]
