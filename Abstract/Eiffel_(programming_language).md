EIFFEL is an object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer (an object-orientation proponent and author of _Object-Oriented Software Construction_) and Eiffel Software. Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development;[1] the first version becoming available in 1986. In 2005, Eiffel became an ISO-standardized language.
