8Β-VE2, or 8Β-VINYLESTRADIOL, also known as 8Β-VINYLESTRA-1,3,5(10)-TRIENE-3Β,17Β-DIOL, is a synthetic estrogen featuring an estradiol core.[1][2] It is a highly potent and selective agonist of the ERβ that is used in scientific research to study the function of the ERβ.[3][4] It has 190-fold higher potency in transactivation assays of the ERβ relative to the ERα and 93- (rat) and 180-fold (human) preference in binding affinity for the ERβ over the ERα.[5]
