Aaron_Judge_spring_training_2015_osceola.jpg In Major League Baseball, the ROOKIE OF THE YEAR AWARD is annually given to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA, which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946.[1] The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' second baseman, won the inaugural award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League. Originally, the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the JACKIE ROBINSON AWARD in July 1987,[2] 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line.
