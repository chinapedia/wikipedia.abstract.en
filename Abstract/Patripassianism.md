In Christian theology, PATRIPASSIANISM (as it is referred to in the Western church) is a version of SABELLIANISM in the Eastern church (and a version of MODALISM, MODALISTIC MONARCHIANISM, or MODAL MONARCHISM). Modalism is the belief that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three different _modes_ or _aspects_ of one monadic God, as perceived by _the believer_, rather than three distinct persons within _the Godhead_ â€“ that there are no real or substantial differences between the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son.[1]
