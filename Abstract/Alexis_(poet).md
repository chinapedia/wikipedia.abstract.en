ALEXIS (; c. 375 â€“ c. 275 BC) was a Greek comic poet of the Middle Comedy period. He was born at Thurii (in present-day Calabria, Italy) in Magna Graecia and taken early to Athens,[1] where he became a citizen, being enrolled in the deme _Oion_ () and the tribe Leontides.[2][3] It is thought he lived to the age of 106 and died on the stage while being crowned. According to the _Suda_, a 10th-century encyclopedia, Alexis was the paternal uncle of the dramatist Menander and wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments now survive, including some 130 preserved titles.
