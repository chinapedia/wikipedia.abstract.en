The SERRA RICARDO FRANCO STATE PARK () is a state park in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. It protects the edge of a plateau on the border with Bolivia in the region of transition from _cerrado_ to Amazon rainforest. The park has been poorly protected and is badly degraded in areas by deforestation and conversion to pasturage. It is threatened by illegal squatters, hunting and burning.
