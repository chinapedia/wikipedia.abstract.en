"MOMENTS IN LOVE" is the third single by Art of Noise and written by Anne Dudley, Trevor Horn, J. J. Jeczalik, Gary Langan, and Paul Morley. Although the original 10-minute version appeared on both the _Into Battle with the Art of Noise_ release in 1983 and the _Who's Afraid of the Art of Noise?_ album in 1984, "Moments In Love" wasn't released globally as a commercial single until 1985, when the song was featured on the "Pumping Iron II: The Women" soundtrack. The version that was used on this soundtrack was "Moments in Love (Beaten)". Reissues followed in 1986 and 1987, in some markets. Copyright dates indicate the edits & remixes were prepared in 1984.
