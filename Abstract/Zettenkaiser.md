The ZETTENKAISER is a high mountain with a summit cross in the Kaiser Mountains (_Kaisergebirge_) in the Northern Limestone Alps in Austria. It rises to the west of the almost 150-metre-higher Scheffauer, from which it is separated by a col. It is one of the more rarely visited summits in the Kaiser. There are great views south to the main chain of the Alps, north to the Zahmer Kaiser and west into the Inn Valley; to the east at the foot of the summit is the rock needle known as the _Kaindlnadel_ and then the mighty Scheffauer.
