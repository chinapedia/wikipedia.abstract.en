The concepts of _moshiach_, messianism, and of a Messianic Age originated in Judaism,[1][2] and in the Hebrew Bible; a _moshiach_ (messiah) is a king or High Priest traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil.[3] Messiahs were not exclusively Jewish: the Book of Isaiah refers to Cyrus the Great, king of the Achaemenid Empire, as a messiah[4] for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple.
