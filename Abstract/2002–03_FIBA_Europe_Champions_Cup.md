The 2002â€“03 FIBA EUROPE CHAMPIONS CUP was the 1st edition of Europe's 4th-tier level transnational competition for men's professional basketball clubs, following the merge of FIBA Korac Cup and FIBA Saporta Cup.[1] In its first season, the competition was considered the 3d tier in the European basketball pyramid, having 64 teams participated in. Greek team Aris won the title, beating Prokom Trefl Sopot in the Final conducted in Alexandreio Melathron in Thessaloniki. The competition which was initially advertised as FIBA's attempt to revive the old FIBA Champions Cup, though it attracted 15 champions from 30 European leagues reflecting to a pan-european level (but also 3 current clubs from second divisions of Italy and Spain and the newly promoted champions of the Israeli and Bosnian second divisions), did not make a huge impact and dropped to the 4th-tier level in the next season as FIBA launched the FIBA EuroChallenge instead.
