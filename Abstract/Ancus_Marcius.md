ANCUS MARCIUS (–617 BC ;[1] reigned 642–617 BC)[2] was the legendary fourth king of Rome. He was the son of Marcius (whose father, also named Marcius, had been a close friend of Numa Pompilius, who may be identified with Numa Marcius),[3] and Pompilia (daughter of Numa Pompilius).[4] According to Festus, Marcius had the surname of _Ancus_ from his crooked arm ('ancus' signifying 'crooked' in Latin). Upon the death of the previous king, Tullus Hostilius, the Roman Senate appointed an interrex, who in turn called a session of the assembly of the people who elected the new king.[5]
