PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the _procedure call_. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
