Munmorah_Sand_Dunes_in_2017.jpg Munmorah Sand Dune site have been in Northern Lake Munmorah for nearly a century now. The eight sand-dunes were formed during a huge sandstorm in 1942, covering vast amounts of bush. In 1942, reports came across the radios stating a sand storm from nearby Birdie Beach would pick up a great amount of sand and would send it flying for a couple of kilometers. Nowadays, all the sand from the storm sits in its location and name today, making one of the biggest sand-dune sights in the Central Coast. These sand-dunes are 74 years old (in 2016) and they have been sitting in an end of town not many people would think to come to.
