CORUNDUM is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide () typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium.[1][2] It is a rock-forming mineral. It is also a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors depending on the presence of transition metal impurities in its crystalline structure.[3] Corundum has two primary gem varieties: ruby and sapphire. Rubies are red due to the presence of chromium, and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present.[4] A rare type of sapphire, padparadscha sapphire, is pink-orange.
