DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg illustrating the effect of depth of field on a tilted object.]] For many cameras, DEPTH OF FIELD (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and the furthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image. The depth of field can be calculated based on focal length, distance to subject, the acceptable circle of confusion size, and aperture. A particular depth of field may be chosen for technical or artistic purposes. Limitations of depth of field can sometimes be overcome with various techniques/equipment.
