AELIA CAPITOLINA (; Latin in full: ) was a Roman colony, built under the emperor Hadrian on the site of Jerusalem, which was in ruins following the siege of 70 AD,[1] leading in part to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 AD. _Aelia Capitolina_ remained the official name of Jerusalem[2] until 638 AD, when the Arabs conquered the city and kept the first part of it as 'إلياء' (Iliyā').[3]
