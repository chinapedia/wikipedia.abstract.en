Quake_epicenters_1963-98.pngs occur mostly along tectonic plate boundaries, and especially on the Pacific Ring of Fire.]] Global_plate_motion_2008-04-17.jpg An EARTHQUAKE (also known as a QUAKE, TREMOR or TEMBLOR) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity, or SEISMIC ACTIVITY, of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word _tremor_ is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
