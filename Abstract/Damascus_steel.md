Watered_pattern_on_sword_blade1.Iran.JPG DAMASCUS STEEL was the forged steel comprising the blades of swords smithed in the Near East from ingots of Wootz steel[1] imported from India and Sri Lanka. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water, or in a "ladder" or "teardrop" pattern. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.[2]
