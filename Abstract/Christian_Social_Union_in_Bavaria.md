The CHRISTIAN SOCIAL UNION IN BAVARIA (, CSU) is a Christian-democratic[1][2] and conservative[3][4][5][6] political party in Germany. The CSU operates only in Bavaria while its larger counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), operates in the other fifteen states of Germany. It differs from the CDU by being somewhat more conservative in social matters. The CSU is considered an effective successor of the Weimar-era Catholic Bavarian People's Party (BVP).[7]
