OKENANE, the diagenetic end product of okenone, is a biomarker for Chromatiaceae, the purple sulfur bacteria.[1] These anoxygenic phototrophs use light for energy and sulfide as their electron donor and sulfur source. Discovery of okenane in marine sediments implies a past euxinic environment, where water columns were anoxic and sulfidic. This is potentially tremendously important for reconstructing past oceanic conditions, but so far okenane has only been identified in one Paleoproterozoic (1.6 billion years old) rock sample from Northern Australia.[2][3]Okenone_and_Okenane.png
