1,2,3,3,3-PENTAFLUOROPROPENE is the unsaturated fluorocarbon with the formula HFC=C(F)CF. This colorless gas is of interest as a precursor to hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which are used as refrigerants in air conditioners. Of the methods reported for its synthesis, one route involves dehydrofluorination of 1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane.[1] The compound exists as a mixture of E- and Z-isomers.
