THOMAS PAINE PLAZA is an open space park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, named in honor of Thomas Paine. It is the location of the city's Municipal Services Building across from Dilworth Park and City Hall.[1] The design, by Sam Durant and Frank Rizzo, consists of a labyrinth of chain linked fences. The park was redesigned and dedicated by Mayor Michael Nutter in a ribbon cutting ceremony on October 2015. [2]
