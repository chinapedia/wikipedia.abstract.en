_POMPATUS_ (or _POMPITUS_) () is an unusual word used by Steve Miller famously in his 1973 hit single "The Joker". The word is probably a corruption or imagined version of the word "puppetuse," an original coinage, written by a fourteen year old Vernon Green, and subsequently released in 1954 as the Doo Wop song "The Letter" performed by him and The Medallions -- a song which also included another original coinage, "pismotality." In other songs, "Enter Maurice" and "The Conversation," Miller adds the word "epismetology" to "pompatus," one in spoken word, the style of "The Letter," in a likely homage to the Doo Wop song. The oddness of the word "pompatus" occasioned some attention and further use, including being used in the title of a movie.[1]
