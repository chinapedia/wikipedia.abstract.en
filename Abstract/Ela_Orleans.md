ELA ORLEANS (born 1971 in Oświęcim,[1] commonly known by its German name of Auschwitz) is a Polish composer, multi-instrumentalist and singer.[2] Orleans uses electronic and acoustic instruments (including synthesisers, guitar, violin, piano) to create a diverse and layered music. She performs as both a musician and DJ (the latter often under the alias Tract). Her work as a songwriter in many instances uses 1950s and 1960s pop as its basis, by way of everything from electronica to _Éthiopiques_ (the CD series of 1960s and 1970s Ethiopian music), from Polish folk to Bernard Herrmann's film scores for Alfred Hitchcock.
