The EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (EFTA) is a regional trade organization and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.[1] The organization operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the European Single Market and are part of the Schengen Area.[2] They are not, however, party to the European Union Customs Union.
