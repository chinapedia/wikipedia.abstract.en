The FIELD ELM cultivar _ULMUS MINOR_ 'MONUMENTALIS', THE TOMB ELM (GRABMAL-RÜSTER),[1] was raised as a sucker of _U. suberosa_ by Sebastian Rinz, the city gardener of Frankfurt, and described as _U. campestris_ var. _monumentalis_ Rinz, 'Pyramid Field Elm', by Kirchner (1864), who said it had only recently been propagated by Rinz and established in the nursery.[2] It was distributed from the 1880s by the Baudriller nursery, Angers,[3] and by the Späth nursery, Berlin, as _U. campestris monumentalis_ Rinz., appearing separately in their catalogues from _U. minor_ 'Sarniensis', the Guernsey or Wheatley Elm,[4][5][6] with which, according to Henry, it was confused on the continent.[7] Krüssmann, for example, gives 'Monumentalis' as a synonym of 'Sarniensis'.[8] 'Sarniensis' is known as _monumentaaliep_ [:monumental elm] in The Netherlands.[9][10] Springer noted that the Dutch _monumentaaliep_ was "not the actual _monumentaaliep_ (_U. glabra_ Mill var. _monumentalis_ Rinz) but _U. glabra_ Mill. _var._ Wheatleyi Sim. Louis", and that it "should be renamed _U. glabra_ Mill. var. _monumentalis_ Hort. (non Rinz)".[11] In England, Smith's of Worcester listed _Ulmus monumentalis_ separately from _Ulmus_ 'Wheatley' in the 1880s.[12]
