DERVIŞ MEHMED ZILLÎ (25 March 1611 – 1682), known as EVLIYA ÇELEBI (), was an Ottoman explorer who travelled through the territory of the Ottoman Empire and neighboring lands over a period of forty years, recording his commentary in a travelogue called the _Seyâhatnâme_ ("Book of Travel").[1] The name Çelebi is an honorific title meaning gentleman (see pre-1934 Turkish naming conventions).
