SIR PIZZA is a United States chain of pizza restaurants. Wendell Swartz opened the original restaurant in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1957 under the name of PIZZA KING. Sir Pizza was incorporated in 1965. In 1966, Robert Swartz, Wendell's brother, expanded Pizza King outside of Indiana under the name of "Sir Pizza".[1] In Indiana, they are franchised under the _Pizza King_ name, one of two chains in Indiana using that name.
