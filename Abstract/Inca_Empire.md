The INCA EMPIRE (, Â "The Four Regions"), also known as the INCAN EMPIRE and the INKA EMPIRE, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.[1] Its political and administrative structure is considered by most scholars to have been the most developed in the Americas before Columbus' arrival.[2] The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in the city of Cusco. The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century. Its last stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.
