BITCHX is a free IRC client[1] and has been considered to be the most popular ircII-based IRC client.[2] The initial implementation, written by "Trench" and "HappyCrappy", was a script for the IrcII chat client.[3] It was converted to a program in its own right by panasync (Colten Edwards). BitchX 1.1 final was released in 2004. It is written in C and is a TUI application utilizing ncurses. GTK+ toolkit support has been dropped. It works on all Unix-like operating systems, and is distributed under a BSD license. It is originally based on ircII-EPIC[4] and eventually it was merged into the EPIC IRC client. It supports IPv6,[5] multiple servers and SSL and a subset of UTF-8 (characters contained in ISO-8859-1) with an unofficial patch.[6]
