_ILLUMINATI: NEW WORLD ORDER_ (_INWO_) is an out-of-print collectible card game (CCG) that was released in 1994[1] by Steve Jackson Games, based on their original boxed game Illuminati, which in turn was inspired by the 1975 book _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea.[2][3] _INWO_ won the Origins Award for _Best Card Game_ in 1997. An OMNI sealed-deck league patterned after the Atlas Games model was also developed.[4]
