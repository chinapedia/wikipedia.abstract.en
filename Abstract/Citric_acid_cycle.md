Citric_acid_cycle_with_aconitate_2.svg The CITRIC ACID CYCLE (CAC) – also known as the'' TCA CYCLE (TRICARBOXYLIC ACID CYCLE) '' or the'' KREBS CYCLE[1][2] ''– is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and carbon dioxide. In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent NADH, that are used in numerous other reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically.[3][4] Even though it is branded as a 'cycle', it is not necessary for metabolites to follow only one specific route; at least three segments of the citric acid cycle have been recognized.[5]
