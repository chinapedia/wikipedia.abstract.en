TROY (, _Troia_ or Τροίας, _Troias_ and , _Ilion_ or , _Ilios_; and ;[1] Hittite: 𒌷𒃾𒇻𒊭 _Wilusa_ or 𒋫𒊒𒄿𒊭 _Truwisa_;[2][3] ) was a city in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, just south of the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida. The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the _Iliad_, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ suggests that the name (_Ilion_) formerly began with a digamma: (_Wilion_); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa.
