A FINITE-STATE MACHINE (FSM) or FINITE-STATE AUTOMATON (FSA, plural: _automata_), FINITE AUTOMATON, or simply a STATE MACHINE, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of _states_ at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a _transition_. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. Finite state machines are of two types â€“ deterministic finite state machines and non-deterministic finite state machines.[1] A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.
