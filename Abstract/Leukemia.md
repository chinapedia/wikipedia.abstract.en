LEUKEMIA, also spelled LEUKAEMIA, is a group of blood cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal blood cells.[1] These blood cells are not fully developed and are called _blasts_ or _leukemia cells_.[2] Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections.[3] These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells.[4] Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.[5]
