CORNELIA CLERMONT CAMERON (1911â€“1994)[1] was an American geologist who researched peat as a soil additive and energy source. She was born in 1911, and was the daughter of two scientist. Her mother, Harriet Clearman Cameron, had a masters in Geology and a Ph.D in Botany. While Cornelia's father was a professor of natural sciences. Cornelia's father passed away in 1918 when she was only seven years old. Cornelia's parents, especially her mother, had a profound impact on her profession, leading her to be one of the first females to have a career in geology. Cornelia's mother, Harriet, continued to do field work with her until she was 103 years old.Dr. Cameron studied at the University of Iowa where she qualified for a doctorate in scientific fields such as geology, botany and zoology. Her interest was taken by geology and her field work took her over 30 countries. In 1945 she wrote "The Earth in Human Affairs" which relates geology with society, and many other papers on the subject. While starting her career in USGS, she worked in the Military Geology Branch. Best known for her advances regarding glacier deposits, Dr. Cameron was able to predict the location of peat deposits. Such predictions are useful in the search for water sources prior to developing agricultural lands. As a specialist in peat, she became a member of the Branch of Eastern Mineral Resources since 1969.[2][3][4]
