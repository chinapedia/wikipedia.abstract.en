SHEA'S HIPPODROME was a historic film and play theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Hippodrome was located in downtown Toronto, at the corner of Queen and Bay, (now Nathan Phillips Square). At its opening in 1914, it was the largest movie palace in Canada, and one of the largest vaudeville theatres in the world.[1] The Hippodrome included 12 opera boxes, a Wurlitzer organ, as well as a full-size orchestra pit. It debuted some of Canada's first non-silent films. It was built by brothers JERRY AND MICHAEL SHEA and situated directly across from Toronto's Old City Hall. The Hippodrome was operated by Famous Players and managed for decades by Ken Bishop. It was demolished in 1957 to make way for Toronto's new City Hall.[2]
