PHARAOH (, ;[1] _P«ùrro_) is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE,[2] although the actual term "Pharaoh" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah, c. 1200 BCE. In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles, the Horus, the Sedge and Bee (_nswt-bjtj_) name, and the Two Ladies (_nbtj_) name. The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added.
