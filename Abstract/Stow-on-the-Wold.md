STOW-ON-THE-WOLD is a market town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, on top of an 800Â ft (244 m) hill, at the junction of major roads through the Cotswolds, including the Fosse Way (A429), which is of Roman origin. The town was founded by Norman lords to take advantage of trade on the converging roads. Fairs have been held by royal charter since 1330 and an annual horse fair is still held on the edge of the town. Today's population is about 2000.
