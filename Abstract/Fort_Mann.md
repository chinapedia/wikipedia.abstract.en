FORT MANN, located on the Santa Fe Trail west of what is now Dodge City, Kansas, was a U.S. Army frontier fort. Early in 1847 Capt. William M. D. McKissack, the assistant quartermaster for the Army in the west, proposed for a government depot to be built halfway between Santa Fe and Fort Leavenworth. In a letter to a superior McKissack wrote, "In crossing the plains there is no means of securing Wagons that become unserviceable for want of repairs; generally the bands, tires, spokes, etc. become loose on account of the dryness of the atmosphere and having no means of repairs; in such cases, the Wagons are abandoned. . . [sic]." McKissack made arrangements for the outpost to be constructed and occupied by teamsters, but no Army troops.[1]
