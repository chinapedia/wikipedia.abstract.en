BUSES are currently the only means of public transport in Hanoi, comprising more than 100 routes operated by the state-owned Transerco and several private companies serving the city centre and towns in greater Hanoi as well as connecting Hanoi with neighbouring provinces. Buses in Hanoi are easily recognisable with their red and yellow colours but buses on a number of routes are also painted green, blue and orange. The earliest bus leaves at 4:30 am while the latest bus leaves at 10:30 pm[1] , with service may be lengthened to 11:30 pm on weekends on a number of routes. Most Hanoi buses are equipped with an audio system to announce the next stop. LED panels are installed at a number of bus stops to display live arrivals information.
