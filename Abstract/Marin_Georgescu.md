Marin_H_Georgescu_-_Refugiatii.jpg Marin_H._Georgescu_-_Lectura.jpg MARIN HARALAMBIE GEORGESCU, sometimes known as MEHAÈ˜GEORGESCU (30 September 1892, Bucharest - 4 August 1932, Bucharest) was a Romanian Post-Impressionist painter; primarily of landscapes and buildings. Some sources give his year of birth as 1886, although this seems too early in light of his school attendance dates.
