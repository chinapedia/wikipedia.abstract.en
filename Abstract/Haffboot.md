Using similar or identical designs for the ship's hull and its cargo hold, the fishing boats were built with wet or dry cargo holds. The flushed cargo hold, often called a _Bünn_ in the Baltic Sea region, is not sealed hermetically from the water, but is filled with surrounding water. Small holes in the outer skin of the boat enable an exchange of water between the _bünn_ and the outside water. The fish that are caught can thus be transported live. In a traditional fishing boat without cooling units, this allowed the time delay between catching the fish and landing them to be extended. Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, _haffboote_ were active on the Neuwarper See and in the lower Oder delta. They were built as shallow-draughted, broad-beamed clinker built vessels at small boatyards in Neuwarp (now Nowe Warpno), Anklam or Ueckermünde.[1]
