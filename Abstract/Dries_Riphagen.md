BERNARDUS ANDRIES "DRIES" RIPHAGEN (7 September 1909 - 13 May 1973) was a Dutch criminal who sent many Jews to Nazi concentration camps by gaining their trust and promising that their priceless belongings would be kept safe until the conclusion of the war, only to betray them to the Nazis. He worked for the SD and helped the SS and teamed up with the Nazis. After World War II, he faked his death and went into hiding. Riphagen put the Jewish belongings in a bank and fled to Argentina, leaving his wife and child. He later returned to Europe to get the priceless jewelry. Riphagen had a bounty on him in 1988, but it was found he had already died years earlier in 1973 in a Swiss private health clinic.
