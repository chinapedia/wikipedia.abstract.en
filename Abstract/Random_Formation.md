The RANDOM FORMATION is a rock unit in Newfoundland dating to the early Cambrian period, dominated by tidal quartz arenites deposited in a near-shore environment, but also incorporating intertidal and open-shelf deposits, including glauconitic and mud-cracked mudstones (now shales), and red channel sandstones.[1][2] It was deposited quickly and is approximately 175 m thick.[3] The BLUE PINION FORMATION was originally recognized as a separate formation, but is now interpreted as an expression of the Random Formation.[4][5]
