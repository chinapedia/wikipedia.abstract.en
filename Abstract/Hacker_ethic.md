HACKER ETHIC is a term for the moral values and philosophy that are common in hacker culture. Practitioners of the hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is beneficial and helpful.[1] Whilst the philosophy originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950sâ€“1960s, the term _hacker ethic_ is attributed to journalist Steven Levy as described in his 1984 book titled _Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution._ The key points within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life. While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts like _Computer Lib/Dream Machines_ (1974) by Ted Nelson, Levy appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy.
