_' Lyman Frank Baum_' (;[1] May 15, 1856 â€“ May 6, 1919) was an American author chiefly famous for his children's books, particularly _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ and its sequels. He wrote 14 novels in the _Oz_ series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first _Oz_ book would become a landmark of 20th-century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (_The Master Key_), wireless telephones (_Tik-Tok of Oz_), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (_Mary Louise in the Country_), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (_Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work_).
