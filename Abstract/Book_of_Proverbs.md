The BOOK OF PROVERBS (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, _Míshlê (Shlomoh)_, "Proverbs (of Solomon)") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the Hebrew Bible and a book of the Christian Old Testament. When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι _Paroimiai_ ("Proverbs"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was _Proverbia_, from which the English name is derived.
