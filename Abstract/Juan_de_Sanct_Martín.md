JUAN DE SANCT MARTÍN, also known as JUAN DE SAN MARTÍN, was a Spanish conquistador. Little is known about De Sanct Martín, apart from a passage in _El Carnero_ (1638) by Juan Rodríguez Freyle and _Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada_, a work of uncertain authorship.[1][2] He took part in the expedition from Santa Marta into the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and founded Cuítiva, Boyacá in 1550.[3] Juan de Sanct Martín headed the left flank of the Spanish troops in the Battle of Tocarema against the Panche on August 20, 1538, while his fellow conquistador Juan de Céspedes commanded the right flank. In this battle, Juan de Sanct Martín killed the _cacique_ of the Panche and was hurt himself.[4] Juan de Sanct Martín had confronted the Panche the year before, when he was sent to the west while De Céspedes went south. Due to the resistance of the bellicose Panche, De Sanct Martín returned to the Spanish camp.[5]
