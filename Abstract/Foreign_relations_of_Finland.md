The FOREIGN RELATIONS OF FINLAND are the responsibility of the president of Finland, who leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government. Implicitly the government is responsible for internal policy and decision making in the European Union. Within the government, preparative discussions are conducted in the government committee of foreign and security policy (_ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta_), which includes the Prime Minister and at least the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence, and at most four other ministers as necessary.[1] The committee meets with the President as necessary. Laws concerning foreign relations are discussed in the parliamentary committee of foreign relations (_ulkoasiainvaliokunta, utrikesutskottet_). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs implements the foreign policy.
