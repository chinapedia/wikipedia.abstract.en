MARGARET B. FULLER BOOS (June 17, 1892 â€“ August 20, 1978) was an influential actor in the study of pegmatite geology. Although she did not begin her career in the study of pegmatite, it became her niche as her career developed. Boos spent a large portion of her life throughout the Colorado Rockies. Through her many years of fieldwork, she was most noted for her ability to map a large proportion of the Front Rage in Colorado with the help of her husband, Charles Maynard Boos.
