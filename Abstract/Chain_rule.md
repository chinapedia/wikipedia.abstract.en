In calculus, the CHAIN RULE is a formula for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions. That is, if _f_ and _g_ are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition (the function which maps _x_ to _f_(_g_(_x_)) ) in terms of the derivatives of _f_ and _g_ and the product of functions as follows:
