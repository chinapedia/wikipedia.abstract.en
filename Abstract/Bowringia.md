_BOWRINGIA_ is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, found in west Africa. It belongs to the subfamily Faboideae. It was named after Sir John Bowring and his son, J. C. Bowring for their botanical work in China.[1] _Bowringia_ was traditionally assigned to the tribe Sophoreae;[2] however, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses reassigned _Bowringia_ to the Baphieae tribe.[3][4][5]
