Emoticon_Smile_Face.svg emoticon]] Kaomoji.png An EMOTICON (, , rarely pronounced ),[1][2][3][4] short for "emotion icon",[5] also known simply as an EMOTE, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood, or as a time-saving method. The first ASCII emoticons, :-) and :-(, were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.[6]
