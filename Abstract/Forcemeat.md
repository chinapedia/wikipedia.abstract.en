Squab_forcemeat.jpg forcemeat, with cepes, anise, combava juice]] FORCEMEAT (derived from the French _farcir_, "to stuff"[1]) is a mixture of ground, lean meat mixed with fat by grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients. The result may either be smooth or coarse, depending on the desired consistency of the final product. Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie, including quenelles, sausages, pâtés, terrines, roulades, and galantines. Forcemeats are usually produced from raw meat, except in the case of a _gratin_. Meats commonly used include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers. Pork fatback is preferred as a fat, as it has a somewhat neutral flavor.[2]Eliza Acton _Modern cookery, in all its branches_ (80 pages)
