CALCULATING FORECAST ATTAINMENT periodically (monthly for example) provides visibility to the overall achievement of the plan and the total business bias. The time period of shipping activity should be compared against the forecast that was set for the time period a specific number of days/months prior which is call Lag. Lag is based on the leadtime from order placement to order delivery. For example, if the leadtime of an order is 3 months, then the forecast snapshot should be Lag 3 months (Lag 3).
