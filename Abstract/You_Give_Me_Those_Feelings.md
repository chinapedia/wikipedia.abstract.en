"YOU GIVE ME THOSE FEELINGS" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul, and produced by de Paul and Jon Kelly. It was released as a single, with the B-side "Beautiful" also composed by de Paul, on Polydor[1] on 12 August 1977,[2] as the follow up to the European hit single "Rock Bottom".[3][4] The German and French releases of the single both had picture sleeves.[5][6] The romantic song[7] makes clever use of vocal overdubbing and has a false ending making the shorter version more radio friendly that the whole song, which clocks in at over four minutes.[8] It is listed as one of the songs of 1977 in their music of the year database.[9] "You Give Me Those Feelings" was recorded by Gracie Rivera,[10] who was based in Hong Kong but originally from the Philippines, as a track on her album, _Grace Anne Rivera_. It was released in 1978 on the EMI record label.[11][12][13]
