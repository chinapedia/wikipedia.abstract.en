NO WAVE was a short-lived avant-garde music and art scene that emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City.[1][2] Reacting against punk rock's recycling of rock and roll clich√©s, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to a variety of non-rock genres, including free jazz and funk, while often reflecting an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview.[3][4][5] In the later years of the scene, it adopted a more playful, danceable aesthetic inspired by disco, early hip hop, and world music sources.
