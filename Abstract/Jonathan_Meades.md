JONATHAN TURNER MEADES (born 21 January 1947)[1] is an English writer and film-maker, primarily on the subjects of place, culture, architecture and food.[2] His work spans journalism, fiction, essays, memoir and over fifty highly idiosyncratic television films,[3][4][5] and has been described as "brainy, scabrous, mischievous,"[6] "iconoclastic"[7] and possessed of "a polymathic breadth of knowledge and truly caustic wit".[8]
