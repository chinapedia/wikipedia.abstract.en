The ADAMIC LANGUAGE is, according to Jewish tradition (as recorded in the _midrashim_) and some Christians, the language spoken by Adam (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address Adam (the divine language), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the second Genesis creation myth ().
