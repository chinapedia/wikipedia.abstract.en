FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM), also known as FEMALE GENITAL CUTTING and FEMALE CIRCUMCISION, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.[1]
