A BLIZZARD is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds of at least and lasting for a prolonged period of timeâ€”typically three hours or more. A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. Blizzards can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres.
