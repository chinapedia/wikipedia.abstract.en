Olber's_Paradox_-_All_Points.gif In astrophysics and physical cosmology, OLBERS' PARADOX, named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758â€“1840), also known as the "DARK NIGHT SKY PARADOX", is the argument that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe. The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model. In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, then any line of sight from Earth must end at the (very bright) surface of a star and hence the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night.[1]
