PETER GERARD KAVANAGH (June 12, 1953 – September 7, 2016) was a Canadian radio producer, television producer, and writer with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and CBC Radio.[1] Kavanagh was the creator of Canada Reads, an annual "battle of the books" competition which was first broadcast on CBC Radio in 2002.[2] Kavanagh first conceived of the idea for what would become Canada Reads after learning of a similar program on public radio in the United States.[3] On the Canada Reads program, five prominent Canadians, known as "advocates," each select a book. CBC Radio listeners then choose the winner.[4] Past winners of the competition have included Michael Ondaatje, Joseph Boyden and Kim Thúy.[5] Kavanagh was a co-producer on the first season of Canada Reads before leaving the show to pursue other CBC projects.[6]
