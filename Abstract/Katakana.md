is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system along with hiragana,[1] kanji and in some cases the Latin script (known as rōmaji). The word _katakana_ means "fragmentary kana", as the katakana characters are derived from components or fragments of more complex kanji. Katakana and hiragana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each syllable (strictly mora) in the Japanese language is represented by one character or _kana_, in each system. Each kana represents either a vowel such as "_a_" (katakana ア); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "_ka_" (katakana カ) or "_n_" (katakana ン), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English _m_, _n_ or _ng_ () or like the nasal vowels of Portuguese.
