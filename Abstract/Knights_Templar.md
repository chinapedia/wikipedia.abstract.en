The POOR FELLOW-SOLDIERS OF CHRIST AND OF THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON (), also known as the ORDER OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR or simply the TEMPLARS, were a Catholic military order recognised in 1139 by the papal bull _Omne datum optimum_. The order was founded in 1119 and was active until 1312 when it was perpetually suppressed by Pope Clement V by the bull _Vox in excelso_.[1]
