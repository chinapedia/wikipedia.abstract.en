THE KITCHEN CINQ were an American garage rock band from Amarillo, Texas active in the 1960s, whose lineup included guitarist and songwriter Jim Parker. They evolved out of THE ILLUSIONS and eventually changed their name to THE Y'ALLS, releasing records under both names, and enjoyed regional success before moving to Los Angeles, where they signed with Lee Hazlewood's LHI label and became the Kitchen Cinq. As the Kitchen Cinq they recorded five singles between 1966 and 1968, as well as the album _Everything but the Kitchen Cinq_, released in 1967. In December 1967, they released a single under the alias A HANDFUL, but returned to their better-known moniker for their final release in 1968. Out of the remnants of the Kitchen Cinq, several of the members evolved into the progressive rock outfit ARMAGEDDON. Jim Parker went on to play in one of the post-Van Morrison lineups of Them as well as several subsequent acts, before moving to Nashville where he collaborated with John Anderson, and became an established country music songwriter and musician. In the early 1980s he played in the backing band for Dave & Sugar.
