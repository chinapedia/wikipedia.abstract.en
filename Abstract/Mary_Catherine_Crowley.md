MARY CATHERINE CROWLEY (pen name, JANET GRANT; November 28, 1856 - May 4 1920) was an American author of poems and novels. She was also an accomplished musician and linguist. Crowley began her literary work in 1877 as a contributor of poems and short stories to _Wide Awake_, _St. Nicholas Magazine_, _Ladies' Home Journal_, and _The Pilot_. In 1892, she went to Europe and on her return, lived for ten years in Detroit, where she was a collaborator on the Memorial History of the city. Crowley was a recognized authority on the early history of that city, and a leader in its bicentennial celebration in 1901, the pageant being founded on descriptions in her book _A Daughter of New France_.
