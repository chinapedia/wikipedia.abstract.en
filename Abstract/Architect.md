An ARCHITECT is a person who plans, designs and reviews the construction of buildings. To _practice architecture_ means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose.[1] Etymologically, _architect_ derives from the Latin _architectus_, which derives from the Greek (_arkhi-_, chief + _tekton_, builder), i.e., CHIEF BUILDER.[2]
