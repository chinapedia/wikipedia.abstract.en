An APPELLATE COURT, commonly called an _APPEALS COURT_, _COURT OF APPEALS_ (American English),[1] _APPEAL COURT_ (British English), _COURT OF SECOND INSTANCE_ or _SECOND INSTANCE COURT_, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.[2] Appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules.[3]
