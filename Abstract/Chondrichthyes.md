CHONDRICHTHYES (; from Greek χονδρ- _chondr-_ 'cartilage', ἰχθύς _ichthys_ 'fish') is a class that contains the CARTILAGINOUS FISHES: they are jawed vertebrates with paired fins, paired nares, scales, a heart with its chambers in series, and skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. The class is divided into two subclasses: Elasmobranchii (sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish) and Holocephali (chimaeras, sometimes called ghost sharks, which are sometimes separated into their own class).
