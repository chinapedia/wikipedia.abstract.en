_MANUFACTURING CONSENT: THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE MASS MEDIA_ is a 1988 book by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky, in which the authors propose that the mass communication media of the U.S. "are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion", by means of the propaganda model of communication.[1] The title derives from the phrase "the manufacture of consent," employed in the book _Public Opinion_ (1922), by Walter Lippmann (1889â€“1974).[2]
