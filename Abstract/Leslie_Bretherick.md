LESLIE BRETHERICK (1926–2003) was a chemist and an “internationally recognized authority on laboratory safety”[1] especially remembered for writing the book which became _Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards_, an indexed guide to published data on dangerous chemical reactions. An obituary said “His contributions have improved the lives of countless millions, and I will aver, have saved the lives of thousands”.[2]
