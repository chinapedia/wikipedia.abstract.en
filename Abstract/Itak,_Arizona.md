ITAK is a populated place situated in Pima County, Arizona.[1] Itak means "point of mountain" in the O'odham language. European settlers had referred to this place as ROCKY POINT at least through the early part of the twentieth century. On September 8, 1939 the Office of Indian Affairs (now Bureau of Indian Affairs) petitioned the USGS to officially recognize the name of the location as Itak, as that was the name preferred by the local residents, and was more historical. On April 10, 1941 the Board on Geographic Names rendered its decision, officially naming the place Itak. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2]
