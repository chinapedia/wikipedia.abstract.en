Lactantius.jpg LUCIUS CAECILIUS FIRMIANUS LACTANTIUS (c. 250 â€“ c. 325) was an early Christian author who became an advisor to the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine I, guiding his religious policy as it developed,[1] and a tutor to his son Crispus. His most important work is the _Institutiones Divinae_ ("The Divine Institutes"), an apologetic treatise intended to establish the reasonableness and truth of Christianity to pagan critics.
