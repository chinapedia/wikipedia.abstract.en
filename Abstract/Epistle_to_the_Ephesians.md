The EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS, also called the LETTER TO THE EPHESIANS and often shortened to EPHESIANS, is the tenth book of the New Testament. Its authorship has traditionally been attributed to Paul the Apostle but starting in 1792, this has been challenged as Deutero-Pauline, that is, written in Paul's name by a later author strongly influenced by Paul's thought, probably "by a loyal disciple to sum up Paul’s teaching and to apply it to a new situation fifteen to twenty-five years after the Apostle’s death.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
