HOOSIER is the official demonym for a resident of the U.S. state of Indiana. The origin of the term remains a matter of debate within the state,[1] but "Hoosier" was in general use by the 1840s,[2] having been popularized by Richmond resident John Finley's 1833 poem "The Hoosier's Nest".[3] Anyone born in Indiana or a resident at the time is considered to be a Hoosier.[4] Indiana adopted the nickname "The Hoosier State" more than 150 years ago.[5]
