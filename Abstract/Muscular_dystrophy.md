MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time.[1] The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin.[2] Many people will eventually become unable to walk.[3] Some types are also associated with problems in other organs.[4]
