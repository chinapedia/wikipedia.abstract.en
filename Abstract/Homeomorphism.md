Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif and a donut (torus) illustrating that they are homeomorphic. But there need not be a continuous deformation for two spaces to be homeomorphic — only a continuous mapping with a continuous inverse function.]] In the mathematical field of topology, a HOMEOMORPHISM, TOPOLOGICAL ISOMORPHISM, or BICONTINUOUS FUNCTION is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called HOMEOMORPHIC, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word _homeomorphism_ comes from the Greek words _ὅμοιος_ (_homoios_) = similar or same and _μορφή_ (_morphē_) = shape, form, introduced to mathematics by Henri Poincaré in 1895.[1][2]
