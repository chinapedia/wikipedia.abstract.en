MORMON MISSIONARY DIARISTS are the Mormon missionaries who kept records in the form of diaries and journals recounting their activities on behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in various parts of the world. Both male and female missionaries kept these diaries and were encouraged to do so by the Church. Many of these documents have been donated to the Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library, and since 2003, a large selection of these have been transcribed and digitized.
