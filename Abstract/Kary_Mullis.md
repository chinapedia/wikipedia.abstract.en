KARY BANKS MULLIS (born December 28, 1944) is a Nobel Prize-winning American biochemist. In recognition of his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, he shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Michael Smith[1] and earned the Japan Prize in the same year. A similar process was first described by Kjell Kleppe and 1968 Nobel laureate Har Gobind Khorana, and allows the amplification of specific DNA sequences.[2][3][4] The invention made by Mullis allowed PCR to become a central technique in biochemistry and molecular biology, described by _The New York Times_ as "highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into the two epochs of before P.C.R. and after P.C.R."[5]
