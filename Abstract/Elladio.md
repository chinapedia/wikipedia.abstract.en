ELLADIO or ELADIO is an Italian given name, also known in its feminine variants of ELLADIA or ELADIA. It also appears in Latin as Helladius,[1][2] in Polish as Heladiusz or Eladiusz and in Spanish as Eladio.[3] These all derive from Ἑλλάδιος _Helladios_,[4], an ethonymic name in Greek attested since late antiquity[5] and meaning 'one from Hellas' (i.e. from Greece; __).[6][7] This is similar to the name "Greca" (see names of Greece and names of the Greeks).
