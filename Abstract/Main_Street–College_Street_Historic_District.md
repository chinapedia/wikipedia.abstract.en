The MAIN STREETâ€“COLLEGE STREET HISTORIC DISTRICT encompasses a historically fashionable residential area of Burlington, Vermont. Principally located along Main and College Streets between South Winooski and South Williams Streets (between downtown and the UVM campus), the area was one of the city's most exclusive residential areas from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, and includes a diversity of high quality architecture from that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]
