MARY I (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558), also known as MARY TUDOR, was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death. She is best known for her aggressive attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. The executions that marked her pursuit of the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England and Ireland led to her denunciation as "BLOODY MARY" by her Protestant opponents.
