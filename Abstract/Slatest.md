SLATEST, also known as THE SLATEST, is a news blog that has been published by Slate since 2009, when it was launched to replace their 12-years-old "Today's Papers" feature.[1] It also replaced Slate's magazine aggregator feature "In Other Magazines".[2] In 2011, the website was redesigned; the effects included making its homepage more closely resemble the Huffington Post and creating a home for Slate's "Trending News Channel" video project.[3] In 2012, it was redesigned again, this time to focus more on the writing and editorial decisions of Josh Voorhees, who was then the blog's editor. This redesign also gave the blog a new slogan: "Your news companion."[4] After this redesign was announced, Voorhees said, “The average Slate writer takes a little bit longer to craft a really definitive or provocative piece. The Slatest will always be that kind of ‘first responder’ for the site."[5]
