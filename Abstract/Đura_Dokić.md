ĐURA DOKIĆ (; 1873–1946) was a Serbian general, notable for being an Axis collaborator during World War II. He served in the Royal Serbian Army during the Balkan Wars and World War I, where he rose in ranks, and was awarded four state orders, including Karađorđe's Star. In the Royal Yugoslav Army (1918–41), he rose to the rank of Army general. He was appointed Minister of Transportation in the Government of National Salvation headed by Milan Nedić on 7 October 1941.[1] He remained in that position for a little over a year. The British captured him, along with other Serbian collaborationists.[2] He was tried and sentenced to death in the 1946 Belgrade Process. His representative at the trial was barrister Dragoljub Joksimović. He was accused of "conspiring to ship slave workers into Germany" according to contemporary American newspapers.[3]
