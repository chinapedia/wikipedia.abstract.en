Blessed GIOVANNI SCHIAVO (8 July 1903 – 27 January 1967) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Congregation of Saint Joseph – otherwise known as the Murialdines.[1] Schiavo entered the Murialdines during World War I in 1917 where the Venerable Eugenio Reffo allowed him to join and he was later ordained to the priesthood in Vicenza in 1927 a decade later. His superiors allowed him to join the missions – to spread the charism of the Murialdines – in Brazil where he served from 1931 until his death several decades after.[2]
