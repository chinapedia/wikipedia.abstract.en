KRC (KENT RECURSIVE CALCULATOR) is a lazy functional language developed by David Turner from November 1979 to October 1981[1] based on SASL, with pattern matching, guards and ZF expressions[2] (now more usually called list comprehensions). Two implementations of KRC were written: David Turner's original one in BCPL running on EMAS, and Simon J. Croft's later one in C under Unix, and KRC was the main language used for teaching functional programming at the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK) from 1982 to 1985.
