_DUNGEON KEEPER_ is a freemium mobile massively multiplayer online strategy video game developed by Mythic Entertainment and released by Electronic Arts in 2014 for iOS and Android. A reboot to the _Dungeon Keeper_ series, players construct and manage a dungeon, recruiting minions to run it, although the gameplay has a tower defence style, featuring frequent raids of others' dungeons and the defence of the player's. Players can participate in tournaments and leagues online.
