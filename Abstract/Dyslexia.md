DYSLEXIA, also known as READING DISORDER, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence.[1][2] Different people are affected to varying degrees.[3] Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.[4][5] Often these difficulties are first noticed at school.[6] When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as ALEXIA.[7] The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn.[8]
