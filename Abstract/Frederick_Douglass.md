FREDERICK DOUGLASS (born FREDERICK AUGUSTUS WASHINGTON BAILEY; [1] – February 20, 1895[2]) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his oratory[3] and incisive antislavery writings. In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.[4][5] Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave.[6]
