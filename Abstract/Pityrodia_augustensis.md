_PITYRODIA AUGUSTENSIS_, commonly known as MOUNT AUGUSTUS FOXGLOVE, is a flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and is endemic to a small area in Western Australia. It is a small, bushy shrub with its branches, leaves and some of its flower parts densely covered with woolly hairs. It is similar to the lovely foxglove (_Dasymalla axillaris_) and the sandplain foxglove (_Dasymalla terminalis_) but has very different leaves from those species.
