The SAN MARCOS HOTEL is located on one of the prime corners of the original 1912 Chandler Townsite, at the northwest corner of San Marcos Place and Commonwealth Avenue and faces east onto San Marcos Plaza, the center of Chandler, Arizona.[1] Operated by InterContinental Hotels Group's Crowne Plaze brand, the hotel is owned by Interwest Capital after having being acquired in 2013.[2] The hotel was conceived by Dr. A.J. Chandler and subsequently named for Fray Marcos de Niza, the first European to enter the Salt River Valley in 1512.[3] The hotel opened with great fanfare in 1913, with Vice President Thomas Marshall in attendance. The hotel promised the most modern in efficient accommodations, such as incandescent light bulbs, telephones in every room, and more than 3 miles of copper wire. When it opened, the San Marcos hotel was the only electrified building in Chandler, Arizona.[4] In 2012, Kansas-based Ottawa University confirmed that it was exploring the potential of purchasing the San Marcos hotel with the intention of converting it into a residential campus.[5]
