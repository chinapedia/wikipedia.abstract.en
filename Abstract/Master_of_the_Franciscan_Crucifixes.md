Master_of_the_Blue_Crucifixes_or_Master_of_the_Franciscan_Crucifixes._St._John_the_Evangelist._c.1272._NGA,_Washington.jpg The MASTER OF THE FRANCISCAN CRUCIFIXES is the notname given to an Italian painter active in the 1260s and 1270s. The notname is based on a painted crucifix now in the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, which was found to be connected stylistically with two painted crucifixes in Bologna and fragments of two paintings in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The artist is presumed to have been Umbrian by origin and training.[1]
