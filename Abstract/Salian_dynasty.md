The SALIAN DYNASTY (; also known as the FRANKISH DYNASTY after the family's Salian Frankish origin and position as dukes of Franconia) was a dynasty in the High Middle Ages. The dynasty provided four German Kings (1024–1125), all of whom went on to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor (1027–1125); as such, the term _Salic dynasty_ is also used to refer to the Holy Roman Empire of the time as a separate term.
