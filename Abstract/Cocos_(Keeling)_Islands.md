The TERRITORY OF COCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS is an Australian external territory in the Indian Ocean, comprising a small archipelago approximately midway between Australia and Sri Lanka and closer to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is part of Southeast Asia and is in the Southern Hemisphere. The territory's dual name (official since the islandsâ€™ incorporation into Australia in 1955) reflects that the islands have historically been known as either the COCOS ISLANDS or the KEELING ISLANDS.
