_Molochov_ in 2010 In Prague, MOLOCHOV is the popular name of the functionalist building completed in 1938 whose long façade faces Letná Park's north side. Il holds its name from Moloch due to the "colossal" dimensions of its façade, 252 m long and 16,5 m high. It is located on Milada Horáková street. The complex is composed of fourteen building units joined by a single façade.[1]
