tanning_woman_in_jeans_on_dock.jpg The BIKINI BRIDGE was an Internet hoax. It originated in the United States[1] on January 5, 2014, created by users of the "/b/" section on the imageboard 4chan as a parody of popular thinspiration memes.[2] It is defined as "when bikini bottoms are suspended between the two hip bones, causing a space between the bikini and the lower abdomen".[3] According to a posting on the website, users intended to spread content across social media regarding bikini bridges, but then similarly disseminating them "throughout parts of the Internet known to be biased on the subject of weight" to deliberately cause offence.[4]
