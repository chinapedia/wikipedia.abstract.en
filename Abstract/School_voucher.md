A SCHOOL VOUCHER, also called an EDUCATION VOUCHER, in a VOUCHER SYSTEM, is a certificate of government funding for a student at a school chosen by the student or the student's parents. The funding is usually for a particular year, term or semester. In some countries, states or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse home schooling expenses. In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.[1]
