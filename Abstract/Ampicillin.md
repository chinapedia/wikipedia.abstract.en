AMPICILLIN is an antibiotic used to prevent and treat a number of bacterial infections, such as respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, salmonellosis, and endocarditis.[1] It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns.[2] It is used by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or intravenously.[3] Like all antibiotics, it is not useful for the treatment of viral infections.
