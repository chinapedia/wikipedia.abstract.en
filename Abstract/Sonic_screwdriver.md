The SONIC SCREWDRIVER is a multifunctional fictional tool[1] in the British science fiction television programme _Doctor Who_ and its spin-offs, used by the Doctor. Like the TARDIS, it has become one of the icons of the programme, and spin-off media such as _The Sarah Jane Adventures_ and _Torchwood_ have replicated its functions in devices such as the sonic lipstick, sonic blaster, sonic probe, and sonic modulator.
