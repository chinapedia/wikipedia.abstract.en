THE MODS were a punk rock band from Toronto during the first wave of late 1970s punk. Formed in 1978 with members Greg Triner (vocals), Scott Marks (guitar), Mark Dixon (bass) and David Quinton Steinberg (drums). The Mods were obviously influenced by The Jam and had a similar look and sound which contrasted with the black leather, T-shirts and tight jeans look of the other Toronto bands of the era.
