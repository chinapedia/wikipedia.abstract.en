The MURRAY GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORE, also known as MURRAY HALL, is a historic building located in Little Sioux, Iowa, United States. A native Scot, Michael Murray operated a general store from this location from 1877, when it was built, to 1916 when he died.[1] The second floor housed the local chapters of the Masons, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Order of the Eastern Star, Grand Army of the Republic, and the Woodmen. By the 1970s the Masons and the Eastern Star were the only two remaining, but they folded in the 1980s. The Harrison County Historic Preservation Commission took possession of the building in the 1990s to preserve it. Since then it has served a community social hall, and served as city hall briefly in 1996 when the old city hall was destroyed in a fire.
