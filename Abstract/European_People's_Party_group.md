The EUROPEAN PEOPLE'S PARTY GROUP (EPP GROUP) is the political group in the European Parliament consisting of deputies (MEPs) from the member parties of the European People's Party (EPP), other unaffiliated national parties and independent deputies.[1][2][3] In this respect, there is a distinction between the European People's Party itself (a European-level party of centre-right national political parties from across Europe) and the EPP Group in the European Parliament, which is not limited to deputies that belong to EPP's member parties. The EPP mostly comprises politicians of Christian democratic, conservative and liberal-conservative orientation.[4][5][6]
