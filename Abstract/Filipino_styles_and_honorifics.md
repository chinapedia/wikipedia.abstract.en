In the Philippine languages, the FILIPINO HONORIFIC STYLES AND TITLES are a complex system of titles and honorifics, which are used extensively during pre-colonial era, mostly the Tagalogs and Visayans borrowed the Malay language systems of honorifics specially the Moro peoples of Mindanao based on the Indianised Sanskritised Indian honorifics system,[1] in addition to the Chinese systems of honorifics in like the Ma-i (Mindoro) and the Pangasinan. Indian influence is evidenced by the titles of historical figures such as Rajah Sulayman, Lakandula and Dayang Kalangitan. Malay titles are still used by the royal houses of Sulu, Maguindanao, Maranao and Iranun on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, but these are retained on a traditional basis as the 1987 Constitution explicitly reaffirms the abolition of royal and noble titles in the republic.[2][3][4][5]
