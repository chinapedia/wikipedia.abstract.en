The VIOLIN SONATA NO. 5 in F major, Opus 24, is a violin sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" (_Frühlingssonate_), and was published in 1801. It was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the C major string quintet and the fourth violin sonata—as well as his later seventh symphony.[1]
