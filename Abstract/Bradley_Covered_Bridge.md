The BRADLEY COVERED BRIDGE is a historic covered bridge, carrying Center Street over Miller Run, a tributary of the Passumpsic River, in Lyndon, Vermont. Built in 1878, it was the last of Vermont's many 19th-century covered bridges to carry a numbered state highway (Vermont Route 122, now rerouted to the north). The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[1]
