The 1945 LOCAL ELECTIONS in Ireland were held on 14 June 1945 to fill all council seats for most counties and county boroughs and municipal towns. The state was still under "the Emergency" of the Second World War. As a cost-saving measure, electoral law was amended to bring forward the date of the local elections a few weeks to coincide with the 1945 presidential election.[1]
