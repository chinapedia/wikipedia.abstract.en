Phonogram}} Edison_and_phonograph_edit1.jpg with his second phonograph, photographed by Levin Corbin Handy in Washington, April 1878]] EdisonPhonograph.jpg Amberola_close-up.jpg The PHONOGRAPH is a device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound. In its later forms, it is also called a GRAMOPHONE (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or, since the 1940s, a RECORD PLAYER. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc, called a "record". To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm which produced sound waves which were coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's ears through stethoscope-type earphones.
