The '''Cyprinidae '''are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called CYPRINIDS, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). Also commonly called the "carp family", or "minnow family", Cyprinidae is the largest and most diverse fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 species of which only 1,270 remain extant, divided into about 370 genera.[1][2]. They range from about 12 mm to the 3-m _Catlocarpio siamensis._[3] These fish are some of the few that do not take care of their eggs. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make up more than two-thirds.[4][5][6] The family name is derived from the Ancient Greek _kyprînos_ (κυπρῖνος, "carp").
