A CLASS ACTION, also known as a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS SUIT, or REPRESENTATIVE ACTION is a type of lawsuit where one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by a member of that group. The class action originated in the United States and is still predominantly a U.S. phenomenon, but Canada, as well as several European countries with civil law have made changes in recent years to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers.
