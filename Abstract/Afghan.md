AFGHAN (also referred to as AFGHANISTANI[1]) (Pashto/; see: _etymology_) refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country.[2][3] Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, AFGHAN is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan[4][5]—Pashtuns, and a large number of Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others.[6] According to the _Encyclopædia Iranica_, the word Afghan (afḡān) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation.[7] According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law.[8] The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aimaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qizilbash, Gurjar, Brahui, and members of other tribes.[9]
