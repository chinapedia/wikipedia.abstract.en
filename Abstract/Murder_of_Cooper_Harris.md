COOPER HARRIS was a 22-month-old toddler who died of hyperthermia on June 18, 2014, in Vinings, Georgia, after being left strapped in the rear-facing car seat of his father's SUV. Though he has maintained that the death was a tragic accident, Harris' father Justin Ross Harris was arrested and charged with his son's murder.[1] On November 14, 2016, after a trial which garnered national media attention, Ross Harris was found guilty of malice murder, among other charges, and subsequently sentenced to life in prison without any possibility of parole.[2]
