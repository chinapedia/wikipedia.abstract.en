The 2020 WASHINGTON GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the Governor of Washington, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. As Washington does not have gubernatorial term limits, incumbent Democratic Governor Jay Inslee is eligible to run for re-election to a third term in office, but has announced a bid for the presidency in 2020.[1]
