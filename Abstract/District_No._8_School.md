The DISTRICT NO. 8 SCHOOL, also known locally as the BRICK SCHOOL, is a historic school building on United States Route 7 in Georgia, Vermont. Built in 1891, it was one of the last district schools to be built in the state, which mandated town control over schools the following year. It now houses the collection of the Georgia Historical Society and is known as the BRICK SCHOOLHOUSE MUSEUM. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]
