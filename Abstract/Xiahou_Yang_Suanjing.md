_XIAHOU YANG SUANJING_ (_Xiahou Yang's Mathematical Manual_) is a mathematical treatise attributed to the fifth century CE Chinese mathematician Xiahou Yang (also known as Hsiahou Yang). However, some historians are of the opinion that _Xiahou Yang Suanjing_ was not written by Xiahou Yang.[1] It is one of the books in The Ten Computational Canons, a collection of mathematical texts assembled by Li Chunfeng and used as the official mathematical for the imperial examinations.
