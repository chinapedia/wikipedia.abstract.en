JÜRI RATAS' CABINET was the 49th cabinet of Estonia, in office from 23 November 2016 to 29 April 2019.[1][2] It was a centre-left coalition cabinet of Centre Party, Social Democratic Party and conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica Union. It was preceded by the Second Cabinet of Taavi Rõivas, a cabinet that ended when Social Democrats and the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica joined the opposition's no confidence vote against the cabinet.[3][4][5] This was the first time since 1999 the liberal centre-right Reform Party were out of the government.
