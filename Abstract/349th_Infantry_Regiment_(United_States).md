The 349TH INFANTRY REGIMENT was an infantry regiment of the United States Army's 88th Infantry Division, the "Blue Devils." The regiment served in World War I and saw brief action in Alsace, but served with great distinction in World War II in the Italian Campaign. Once the war was over, the regiment joined the Trieste United States Troops, or TRUST, and served in the Free Territory of Trieste as an occupation force until they were sent home and disbanded in 1952. Today, the legacy of the 349th Infantry Regiment is carried on by the 349th Regiment[1], a USAR light support training unit at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
