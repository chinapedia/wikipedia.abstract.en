In multidimensional signal processing, MULTIDIMENSIONAL SIGNAL RESTORATION refers to the problem of estimating the original input signal from observations of the distorted or noise contaminated version of the original signal using some prior information about the input signal and /or the distortion process.[1] Multidimensional signal processing systems such as audio, image and video processing systems often receive as input, signals that undergo distortions like blurring, band-limiting etc. during signal acquisition or transmission and it may be vital to recover the original signal for further filtering. Multidimensional signal restoration is an inverse problem, where only the distorted signal is observed and some information about the distortion process and/or input signal properties is known.[2] A general class of iterative methods have been developed for the multidimensional restoration problem with successful applications to multidimensional deconvolution,[3][4][5] signal extrapolation[6][7] and denoising.[8][9]
