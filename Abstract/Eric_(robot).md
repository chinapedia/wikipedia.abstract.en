Eric_the_Robot_(32822317725).jpg ERIC was the first British robot, built in 1928 by First World War veteran Captain William Richards, and aircraft engineer Alan Reffell. He was constructed to open the Exhibition of the Society of Model Engineers at London's Royal Horticultural Hall in 1928, after George VI (then the Duke of York) cancelled and an exasperated Richards, the exhibition's secretary, offered to "make a man of tin" to take the Duke's place.[1] At the event's opening, Eric rose to his feet, bowed and gave a four-minute opening address.[2]
