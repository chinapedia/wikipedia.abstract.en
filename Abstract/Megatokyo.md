(also stylized as MEGATOKYO) is an English-language webcomic created by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston. _Megatokyo_ debuted on August 14, 2000,[1] and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since July 17, 2002.[2] Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese manga. _Megatokyo_ is freely available on its official website. The stated schedule for updates is Tuesday and Friday, but they typically are posted just once or twice a month on non-specific days (in the beginning a three-per-week schedule of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was the goal). Recently, this schedule has slipped further, due to the health issues of Sarah Gallagher (Seraphim), Fred's wife. _Megatokyo_ was also published in book-format by CMX, although the first three volumes were published by Dark Horse. For February 2005, sales of the comic's third printed volume were ranked third on BookScan's list of graphic novels sold in bookstores, then the best showing for an original English-language manga.[3]
