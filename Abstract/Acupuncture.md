ACUPUNCTURE is a form of alternative medicine[1] and a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body.[2] Acupuncture is a pseudoscience[3][4] because the theories and practices of TCM are not based on scientific knowledge.[5] There is a range of acupuncture variants which originated in different philosophies,[6] and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed.[7] It is most often used to attempt pain relief,[8][9] though it is also recommended by acupuncturists for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.[10]
