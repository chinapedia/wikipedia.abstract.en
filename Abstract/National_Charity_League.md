The NATIONAL CHARITY LEAGUE INC. is a charitable non-profit organization that has mother and daughter members in Chapters in the United States. It was established in Los Angeles, California, in 1925 and was incorporated in 1958. It is a philanthropic organization who deals mainly with community service, social development and cultural experience. His story began in the year 1925 when a small group of women founded the organization in Los Angeles, California. They supported the American Red Cross. The women had their daughters support, and by 1938, the daughters formed their own group. In 1947, both groups united to become a philanthropic organization, and started calling themselves the National Charity League. NCL expanded its program beyond the philanthropic work to include leadership and cultural experience. In 1958, the National Charity League was reorganized and was incorporated and renamed National Charity League, Incorporated.[1]
