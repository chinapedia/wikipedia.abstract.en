EUPHROSYNE VASILEIOU (; 1773 – 11 January 1800), better known as KYRA FROSINI (Κυρά Φροσύνη, "Mistress Phrosyne"), was a Greek socialite who was executed for adultery in Ioannina by the Ottoman governor Ali Pasha of Ioannina along with 16 other women. In legend, she was allegedly executed for political reasons and was thereby viewed as a national heroine. The case of Kyra Frosini has been portrayed in fiction as a novel, an opera, a film as well as in folk songs.
