_DOKDONIA DONGHAENSIS_ is a strictly aerobic, gram-negative, phototrophic bacterium that thrives in marine environments. The organism can grow at a broad range of temperatures on seawater media. It has the ability to form biofilms, which increases the organismâ€™s resistance to antimicrobial agents, such as tetracycline.
