The CORIOBACTERIIA are a class of Gram-positive bacteria within the Actinobacteria phylum.[1][2] Species within this group are nonsporulating, strict or facultative anaerobes that are capable of thriving in a diverse set of ecological niches.[3][4][5][6] _Gordonibacter_ species are the only members capable of motility by means of flagella within the class. Several species within the Coriobacteriia class have been implicated with human diseases that range in severity. _Atopobium_, _Olsenella_, and _Cryptobacterium_ species have responsible for human oral infections including periodontitis, halitosis, and other endodontic infections.[7][8] _Eggerthella_ species have been associated with severe blood bacteraemia and ulcerative colitis.[9]
