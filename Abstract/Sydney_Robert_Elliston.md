Canon SYDNEY ROBERT ELLISTON MA (1870 â€“ 23 October 1943) was a journalist, vicar, and canon of Ripon Cathedral. Two of his brothers were William Rowley Elliston and George Elliston MP. He was involved with the formation of the Ripon Diocesan Board of Finance in 1913, and was its secretary from 1914 to 1935. At his funeral it was said of him that, "The diocese of Ripon owed a great debt to the work of Canon Elliston in laying down sound principles of Church finance."[1][2] While looking after the finances of Ripon diocese, he was at the same time vicar of one of north-east England's Barber churches: the Church of St Thomas the Apostle, Killinghall (1880), designed by William Swinden Barber.[3][4]
