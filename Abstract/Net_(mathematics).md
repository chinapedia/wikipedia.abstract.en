In mathematics, more specifically in general topology and related branches, a NET or MOOREâ€“SMITH SEQUENCE is a generalization of the notion of a sequence. In essence, a sequence is a function with domain the natural numbers, and in the context of topology, the codomain of this function is usually any topological space. However, in the context of topology, sequences do not fully encode all information about a function between topological spaces. In particular, the following two conditions are NOT EQUIVALENT in general for a map _f_ between topological spaces _X_ and _Y_:
