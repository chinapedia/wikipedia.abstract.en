The CASTLEFORDâ€“GARFORTH LINE was a single-track railway line in West Yorkshire, England, connecting Castleford with Garforth east of Leeds. the route was developed to allow coal to be transported from the area, though a passenger service was operated between 1878 and 1951. Initially promoted by Leeds, Castleford and Pontefract Junction Railway, it was taken over by the North Eastern Railway before the line was completed.
