PIGEONHOLE SORTING is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number of elements (_n_) and the length of the range of possible key values (_N_) are approximately the same.[1] It requires O(_n_ + _N_) time. It is similar to counting sort, but differs in that it "moves items twice: once to the bucket array and again to the final destination [whereas] counting sort builds an auxiliary array then uses the array to compute each item's final destination and move the item there."[2]
