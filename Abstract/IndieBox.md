INDIEBOX was a monthly independent video games (indie game) subscription box service. Working directly with the indie game developers, IndieBox designs and manufactures boxed collectorâ€™s edition physical releases of games that are typically only available in digital form. The company has been operating since May 2014.[1] Included in every monthly box is a digital rights management-free (DRM-free) game disc (custom-designed rewritable USB-stick for most boxes released before July 2016), Steam key, full-color printed instruction game manual, game soundtrack CD, sticker, and an exclusive collectible, such as a plushy or action figure of a notable character from that game. All games are packaged in a physical game box similar to software titles in the 1980s and 1990s.[2]
