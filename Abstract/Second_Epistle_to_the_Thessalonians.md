The SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS, commonly referred to as SECOND THESSALONIANS or 2 THESSALONIANS is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, with Timothy as a co-author. Modern biblical scholarship is divided on whether the epistle was written by Paul; many scholars reject its authenticity based on what they see as differences in style and theology between this and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians.[1]
