MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI (;[1] ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[2] anti-colonial nationalist,[3] and political ethicist,[4] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule,[5] and to inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific MAHĀTMĀ (Sanskrit: "high-souled", "venerable"),[6] first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa,[7] is now used throughout the world.
