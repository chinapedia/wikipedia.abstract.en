PHYTOBIOME is a term that relates to a plant (phyto) in a specific ecological area (biome). It includes the plant itself, the environment and all micro- and macro-organisms living in, on, or around the plant. These organisms include microbes, animals and other plants. The environment includes the soil, air and climate. Examples of ecological areas are fields, rangelands, forests.[1] Knowledge of the interactions within a phytobiome can be used to create tools for agriculture, crop management[2], increased health, preservation, productivity, and sustainability of cropping and forest systems.[3][4]
