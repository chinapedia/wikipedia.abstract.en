HOLD COME WHAT MAY is a phrase popularized by logician Willard Van Orman Quine. Beliefs that are "held come what may" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.[1] Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what mayâ€”in other words, that all beliefs are rationally revisable ("no statement is immune to revision"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.[2]
