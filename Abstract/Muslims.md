MUSLIMS are people who follow or practice Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran, their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (_sunnah_) as recorded in traditional accounts (_hadith_).[1] "Muslim" is an Arabic word meaning "submitter" (to God).[2] The largest denomination of Islam are Sunni Muslims who constitute 85-90% of the total Muslim population,[3][4] followed by the Shia who make up most of remaining Muslims.
