_TRITONYCHUS PHANEROSARKUS_ is a Cambrian lobopodian, exceptionally preserved in the Orsten fashion by phosphate deposition, additionally preserving muscle fibres.[1] Its name loosely translates to "Three-clawed animal with well displayed flesh".[2] Phylogenetic analysis suggests that it was a close relative of the Onychophora, possibly even a member of the main lineage. The fossil was discovered in the Xiaotan section, Yongshan, Yunnan Province in the Yu'anshan Formation.[3]
