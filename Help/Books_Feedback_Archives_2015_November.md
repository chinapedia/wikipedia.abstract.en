Why was EPUB support removed? This is useless now for anything but printing

The PDF files are unreadable on an e-reader. This service is only useful for printing the articles now. The EPUB format worked just fine previously, and I relied on it to read articles in my e-reader. Why in the world was this changed and who thought this is an improvement or a good idea?

As a minimal courtesy, there should at least be a warning that this tool is now broken before they waste time trying to use it. REINIS^(talk) 13:50, 5 October 2015 (UTC)

    There is now. — Cheers, Steelpillow (Talk) 09:24, 6 November 2015 (UTC)


Can't create Wiki Book

Can't create Wiki Book User:991joseph/Books/TV. It shows RENDERING PROCESS DIED WITH NON ZERO CODE: 1. Any help please..?--Joseph 06:48, 6 November 2015 (UTC)

    Please see the warning box at the top of this page. — Cheers, Steelpillow (Talk) 09:22, 6 November 2015 (UTC)

        So, you are saying there is no way to solve it..?--Joseph 11:46, 6 November 2015 (UTC)

            As best I understand it, the only way to solve it directly is to get involved with the WikiMedia Foundation's coding community and offer your services to get the management process unlocked and then fix the code yourself - all for free. Otherwise, like me you are stuck waiting for somebody else to come along. I don't _think_ Godot has been pencilled in to do the job, but it sure feels like it.
            As a workaround, some books seem to build OK without the error message. If you can narrow that down to what is tripping the error, for example maybe certain problem articles or a particular book structure, it might be possible to edit the problem bits accordingly. The other limitations will still be there, though.

                The pages Help:Books and Help:Books/Feedback were both created 25 February 2009‎ by User:He!ko. His userpage says "I am one of the book tool developers and work for PediaPress", but he hasn't edited since 21 April 2013. I don't know whether anyone involved with the tool has been reading the feedback here for years. :meta:Book tool#Reporting Bugs, Collecting Feedback & Getting Help includes a link to :meta:Book tool/Feedback which also lacks replies. I don't know whether the other two options have activity. PrimeHunter (talk) 18:20, 6 November 2015 (UTC)

                    As I understand it, there isn't "anyone involved with the tool" any more. that's the problem. Wish I could remember where I read it. — Cheers, Steelpillow (Talk) 18:38, 6 November 2015 (UTC)
