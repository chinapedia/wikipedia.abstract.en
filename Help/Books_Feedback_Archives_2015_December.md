Wikitext versus book

For some reason, when I create a book and then edit in "wiki text" mode, the book does not respect the edits made in the "wiki text" mode. This is horrible. Also, when I access my books via /books, I get a wiki page of the book, but I can't find how to go to the book creator mode.

Ok - now I see - the wiki text mode seems to drop the leading book template stuff.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Axd (talk • contribs) 15:53, 24 December 2015 (UTC)


Simple solution for portable offline viewing

An option to download categories as folders containing the original html pages would solve all the compatibility issues and not require any special coding. Users can then set up the method of viewing of their choice on their own device. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 27.253.11.127 (talk) 14:05, 9 October 2015 (UTC)

    The html code does not contain _everything_ needed to display the page. It would require bundling in a good few CSS stylesheets, javascript code pages and the like. Some of these may have further dependencies, and so on. It would need a fair bit of thought and the result would probably be a bit crippled. — Cheers, Steelpillow (Talk) 12:53, 25 December 2015 (UTC)
