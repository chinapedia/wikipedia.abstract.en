Biography

Dez Gallegos (usually referred to as "Dezi"), was born on September 8, 1995 in Petaluma, California. He began his writing career at the age of eight when he gained county-wide fame for penning a 300-page fan-fiction manuscript for JK Rowling's _Harry Potter_ series.[1]

In 2010, Gallegos co-wrote and assistant directed Walking Elephant Theater Company's _Prop 8 Love Stories_. The show toured throughout the California Bay Area before performing in New York's Off-Broadway for two weeks.[2] The production was named as Broadway World's "Best Special Theater Event" of 2010. _Prop 8 Love Stories_ was published in 2012.[3]

Throughout his high school career, Gallegos wrote and directed _Quite Dead_ (2012) and _God Fights the Plague_ (2014). The latter was a one-man show in San Francisco's historic The Marsh Theater.[4] In 2015 he was awarded the Annette Lust Award for Promising Theatrical Talent presented by the San Francisco Bay Area Theater Critics Circle.[5]

While working as faculty for Cinnabar Theater in Petaluma, CA, Gallegos worked with a group of 9-14 year olds to write, direct, and produce _Hamlet's Orphans_ (2014), a production which was chosen for Best Original Script by the SFBATCC.[6]

In 2015, Gallegos gave a talk entitled "The Human Behind the Hashtag" at the Sonoma County TED (conference).[7] Earlier that year he had released a production of his newest drama, _Yesterday Again, Please_. The show was awarded the 2016 SOTA Award for Best New Play as well as named one of North Bay Stage and Screen's "Top Ten Torn Tickets of 2015".[8]

Gallegos has been featured in _KQED_,[9] _The Daily Californian_,[10] and _The San Francisco Examiner_,[11] among other periodicals.
