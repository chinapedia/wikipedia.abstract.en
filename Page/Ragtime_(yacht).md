Racing_Yacht_Ragtime_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg RAGTIME was one of the world's fastest yachts in the 1970s. In 1973, Ragtime became famous for beating the favorite, Windward Passage by 4 minutes, 31 seconds, in the Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu. It also competed successfully in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race[1][2]

The boat's designer was John Spencer from New Zealand.[3] Built in 1963 it was then owned by Tom Clark and named Infidel. The subsequent owner changed the name to Ragtime.[4]

Pat Farrah retrofitted Ragtime in the 1990s to allow it to continue competing in the Transpac.[5]

It finished 10th in the 2006 Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race.[6]
