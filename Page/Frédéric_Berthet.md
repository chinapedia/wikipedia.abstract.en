FRÉDÉRIC BERTHET (20 August 1954 – 25 December 2003) was a 20th-century French writer.


Biography

A former student of the École Normale Supérieure (1974-1977), Frédéric Berthet is a resident at the Bibliothèque nationale de France where he notably worked on the "fonds Barrès".

Frédéric Berthet was cultural attaché in New York from 1984 to 1987. Pierre Bayard, One of his comrades in the École Normale and friend, said of him: "He had a fascinating aura, thanks to his prestigious associations:Barthes, Sollers, Julia Kristeva... But most of all, he was very funny. [...] Thanks to him I discovered Fitzgerald, Philip Roth, Brautigan, Evelyn Waugh".[1]...

Five books were published during his lifetime, in the space of ten years. _Simple journée d'été_, which the author himself defined as a "suite" of short stories, in the musical sense of the term, appeared in Denoël's L'Infini series in January 1986. Notably, this first publication contained no mention of genre or literary format. _Daimler s'en va_, a new incursion into the "romanesque territory," according to his own terms, was published in the same series, now at Gallimard, in May 1988. The book, praised in particular in _Le Monde_ by Bertrand Poirot-Delpech, who devoted the work his entire column,[2] experienced a critical success. From then on, and although the title of this novel invited to reflection like the last word of his narrative to silence, each of Frédéric Berthet's books was awaited with curiosity.

In January 1993, appeared simultaneously _Felicidad_, his second collection of short stories (L'Infini's headline read "Nouvelles du front"), and _Paris-Berry_ (that of the "Blanche Collection" read "Counter-attack"), a short story as unclassifiable as the preceding ones, but which aroused in the press a wave of interrogations, if not indignations: a bit casual, was this irruption in the mythical collection of Gallimard a provocation?

His last book, _Le Retour de Bouvard et Pécuchet_ was published by Éditions du Rocher in March 1996.

The literary work of Frédéric Berthet, however, began in 1970. He was 16 years old. Over the course of these thirty-three years, his literary activity was carried out in various forms: essays, lectures, communications, interviews, translations, articles and press columns... Their reading reveals today that each of these events participated of the same topicality of thought: the realization of a "program" formulated since 1970 and remained in suspense the day after his disappearance.

Frédéric Berthet lived in Chambon-sur-Voueize since 1993.
