YENYENNING LAKE, also often spelt YENYENING LAKES,[1] and associated lakes[2] are in the upper Avon River catchment area, and the source of the Western Australian Avon River and Swan River systems. It is situated in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia approximately north east of Brookton.[3]

The lakes are part of what are called playa lake chains, and the system is often referred to as an example.[4]

The catchment area is composed of alluvial and aeolian deposits; it receives an average annual rainfall of and has an annual evaporation rate of . The lakes are found along major ancient drainage lines with a broad drainage floor over a paleochannel and at the meeting point of the zone of ancient drainage and the zone of rejuvenated drainage. The larger lakes in the system are separated by sandy rises, saline drainage floors and diffuse drainage lines.[5]

Situated in the West Australian Wheatbelt region, the lakes have had adjoining land heavily used for agriculture since European settlement in the region.[6] The lakes occur in three adjoining local government areas, Beverley, Brookton and Quairading. The lakes which are a wildlife haven were often referred to as the County Peak lakes[7] and can bee seen from the summit of County Peak which is nearby.[8]

The resultant problems, including salinity issues, have been researched and investigated extensively.[9]

Remnant vegetation that surrounds the lakes has been made into a nature reserve.[10]

In the early twentieth century some of the lakes had been identified as either fresh or salty[11] and in the 1970s the lakes were known for duck shooting.[12][13]
