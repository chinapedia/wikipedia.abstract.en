CONSOLE CONNECT INC. was a technology company based in the United States. It focused on B2B peering server connectivity, specifically in the Software Defined Interconnect (SDI) field. It was founded by Al Burgio, who was the company's CEO.[1]

Console Connect’s primary product was the Console Connect Platform. It is a web application that was integrated with Microsoft Azure. The service was intended to reduce the cost of server-to-server communication, by bypassing the internet, using direct links that Console Platform had already negotiated for clients.[2]

Sales for Console Platform largely were first party, and were promoted directly on Amazon Direct Connect Platform, the Google Cloud Platform and Azure Marketplace galleries - which were the primary cloud platforms that Console Platform provides connection to.[3]

Console Connect Inc. had won industry awards, including TechTarget’s 2016 Network Innovation Award for the Console Platform.[4]

The company was a venture-backed startup, and claims to have raised $65 Million in venture capital as of the end of 2015.[5][6]
