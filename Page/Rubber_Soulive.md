_RUBBER SOULIVE_ is the 10th studio album by Soulive, on which the trio covers 11 Beatles's songs.

Allmusic reviewer Hal Horowitz writes: "Like the Liverpool lads who intuitively meshed together, Soulive's members interlock to yield results greater than the sum of its parts on this successful tribute that combines the Beatles sense of excitement, imagination. and musical exploration with a funky, down-home R&B/jazz groove."[1]
