The _DAILY PLANET_ is a fictional broadsheet newspaper appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Superman. The newspaper was first mentioned in _Action Comics_ #23 (April 1940). The _Daily Planet_ building's most distinguishing and famous feature is the enormous globe that sits on top of the building.

The newspaper is based in the fictional city of Metropolis, and employs Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen, with Perry White as its editor-in-chief. The building's original features appear to be based upon the Old Toronto Star Building, where Superman co-creator Joe Shuster was a newsboy when the _Toronto Star_ was still called the _Daily Star_. Shuster has claimed that Metropolis was visually inspired by Toronto.[1] However, over the years, Metropolis has served as a fictional analogue to New York City.[2]


Fictional history

Golden and Silver Age

TorontoStar3.jpg, demolished in 1972, was Shuster's model for the _Daily Planet_ building.]] Daily_Planet.jpg When Superman first appeared in comics (specifically 1938's _Action Comics_ #1), his alter ego Clark Kent worked for a newspaper named the _Daily Star_, under editor George Taylor. Superman co-creator Joe Shuster named the _Daily Star_ after the _Toronto Daily Star_ newspaper in Toronto, Ontario, which had been the newspaper that Shuster's parents received and for which Shuster had worked as a newsboy. It was not until later years that the fictional paper became the _Daily Planet._ (The real-world newspaper was called the _Evening Star_ prior to 1899, the _Toronto Daily Star_ is now known as the _Toronto Star_.)[3]

While choosing a name for the fictitious newspaper, consideration was given to combining the names of _The Globe and Mail_ and the _Daily Star_ to become _The Daily Globe_. But when the comic strip appeared, the newspaper's name was permanently made the _Daily Planet_ to avoid a name conflict with real newspapers. In _Superman_ (volume 1) #5 (Summer 1940), the publisher of the _Daily Planet_ is shown to be Burt Mason, a man who is determined to print the truth even when corrupt politician Alex Evell threatens him. In _Superman_ #6 (September–October 1940), Mason gives free printing equipment to _The Gateston Gazette_ after its editor, Jim Tirrell, is killed and its equipment is destroyed by racketeers that Tirrell insisted on reporting.

When DC made use of its multiverse means of continuity tracking between the early 1960s and mid-1980s, it was declared that the _Daily Star_ was the newspaper's name in the Golden Age or "Earth-Two" versions of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, while the _Daily Planet_ was used in the Silver Age or "Earth-One" versions. The Clark Kent of Earth-Two eventually became the editor-in-chief of the _Daily Star_, something his Earth-One counterpart did not achieve.[4]

In the Silver and Bronze Age universes, Clark's first contact with the _Daily Planet_ came when reporter (and future editor) Perry White came to Smallville to write a story about Superboy, and wound up getting an interview where the Boy of Steel first revealed his extraterrestrial origins. The story resulted in Perry earning a Pulitzer Prize.[5] During Clark Kent's years in college, Perry White was promoted to editor-in-chief upon the retirement of the _Daily Planet_'s previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.[6]

After graduating from Metropolis University with a degree in journalism, Clark Kent went to work at the _Planet_, and quickly met Lois Lane (who had been working there for some time already).[7][8] After Clark was hired, Jimmy Olsen joined the paper's staff.[9]

In 1971, the _Daily Planet_ was purchased by Morgan Edge, president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System. Edge proceeded to integrate Metropolis television station WGBS-TV's studios into the _Daily Planet_ building, and named Clark Kent as the anchor for the WGBS evening news.[10] Eventually, Clark's former schoolmate from Smallville Lana Lang joined Clark as a co-anchor.[11]

After the 1985–1986 miniseries _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, many of these elements, including Morgan Edge buying the _Daily Planet_, were retroactively changed or eliminated from the Superman canon.

Post-Crisis

In the post-Crisis comics' canon, years before Clark or Lois began working for the paper, Lex Luthor owned the _Daily Planet._ When Luthor, deciding to sell the paper, began taking bids for the _Planet_, Perry White convinced an international conglomerate, TransNational Enterprises, to buy the paper. They agreed to this venture with only one stipulation: that Perry White would become editor-in-chief. White had served as the _Planet_ editor-in-chief ever since, barring the few times he was absent. During those times people such as Sam Foswell and Clark Kent have looked after the paper. Franklin Stern, an old friend of White's, became the _Daily Planet_'s publisher.

The _Planet_ saw its share of rough times during White's tenure. For example, it had many violent worker strikes. The building itself, along with most of the city, was destroyed during the "Fall of Metropolis" storyline; it is only much later that it was restored by the efforts of various superheroes. The _Planet_ building sustained heavy damages after the villain Doomsday's rampage. Later, Franklin Stern decided to put the paper up for sale. Lex Luthor, disliking the heavy criticism of himself and his company that the _Planet_ became noted for, purchased the _Daily Planet_ and subsequently closed the paper down. Luthor fired every employee of the newspaper except for four people: Simone D'Neige, Dirk Armstrong, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane. As a final insult, Luthor saw to it that the _Planet_ globe was unceremoniously dumped in the Metropolis landfill. In the _Planet_'s place emerged "LexCom," a news-oriented Internet website that primarily catered to Luthor's views of "quality journalism."

After Lois Lane made a deal with Luthor where, in exchange for him returning the _Planet_ to Perry, she would kill one story of his choosing with no questions asked, Luthor sold the _Daily Planet_ to Perry White for the token sum of one dollar. The paper was quickly reinstated, rehiring all of its old staff. Sometime later, ownership of the _Planet_ fell into the hands of Bruce Wayne, where it has remained ever since. In the _Batman: Hush_ storyline, it is named a subsidiary of Wayne Entertainment.

During the "Y2K" storyline (involving the city of Metropolis being infused with futuristic technology thanks to a descendant of the villain Brainiac), the _Daily Planet_ building was "upgraded" along with the rest of Metropolis, and a holographic globe replaced the physical one. Eventually due to temporal instabilities caused by the B13 Virus, Metropolis and the Daily Planet building, globe and all, were restored to their former states.

In the current comics and media spinoffs, the _Daily Planet_ is presented as a thoroughly modern news operation, including operating an Internet website much like most large newspapers. The _Planet_'s reporters also have access to the best modern equipment to aid their work, though Perry White has often been shown as still favoring his manual typewriter. In 2008, it was said that Clark (at least in this era/continuity) uses a typewriter at his desk due to his powers causing minor interference in regular desktop computers.[12]

During this era, the _Planet_'s major competitors in Metropolis include the tabloid newspaper the _Daily Star_, WGBS-TV (which also employed Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant for a time), and Lex Luthor's various media operations. A contemporary publication is _Newstime_ Magazine, where Clark Kent worked as the editor for a time. The publisher of _Newstime_ is Colin Thornton, who is secretly the demon Satanus, an enemy of Superman's.

_Superman: Birthright_

In the _Superman: Birthright_ limited series, the _Daily Planet_'s publisher was Quentin Galloway, an abrasive overbearing loudmouth who bullied Jimmy Olsen, and later Clark Kent, before being told off by Lois Lane, whom Galloway could not fire because of her star status.[13] This was meant to be a new origin for Superman but one that applied to the Post-Crisis continuity, so later _Planet_ history concerning Luthor temporarily owning it and other events still applied.

Post-Infinite Crisis

During the story _Infinite Crisis_, parts of the Post-Crisis history were altered. These changes were explained gradually over the next several years. The 2009 mini-series _Superman: Secret Origin_ clarified the earlier history of the _Planet_ in the new continuity. The story established that while Lex Luthor, in the revised history, owns every media in Metropolis and uses it to enforce his public image as a wealthy benefactor, the _Planet_ had always stood free, refusing him ownership and even condemning his actions in editorials signed by Perry White himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the _Planet_, the newspaper was almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters.[14] This changed after Superman begins his career. Thanks to Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen when he debuts, the paper's circulation increased 700%.

General Sam Lane (Lois' father) attempted to capture Superman, seeing him as an alien threat. When he failed to do so, he forcibly shut down the _Planet_ as part of an attempt to force Perry White and Lois to turn over any information they had on Superman that they haven't released to the public. Eventually, Superman turned the public to his favor and Sam Lane was seen in a bad light after his soldier John Corben AKA Metallo ruthlessly endangered civilians. These events lead to the people of Metropolis no longer looking at Lex Luthor as a savior and _The Daily Planet_ becomes the city's top-selling paper, as well as a major player in media.

In _Final Crisis_ #2, the villain Clayface triggers an explosion in The _Daily Planet_ building, greatly damaging the offices, leaving many injured and at least one person dead. Lois Lane is hospitalized. Despite the chaos of _Final Crisis_ and more than half of humanity being enslaved by evil, the newspaper continues to spread news and inform the public via a printing press in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. In _Final Crisis_ #7, it is shown functioning once again.

The New 52

With the reboot of DC's line of comics in 2011, the _Daily Planet_ was shown in the _Superman_ comics as being bought by Morgan Edge and merged with the Galaxy Broadcasting System, similar to the Silver/Bronze Age continuity.[15] In _Action Comics_, it is revealed that in the new history/universe, Clark Kent begins his journalism career in Metropolis roughly six years before Galaxy Broadcasting merges with the _Daily Planet_. Along with being a writer for _The Daily Star_, partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of everyday citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the _Star_, Clark meets _Planet_ photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lane's work at the _Daily Planet_, eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves _The Daily Star_ on good terms and accepts a position at _The Daily Planet_.

After the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the "Superman beat." But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the _Daily Planet_ is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clark's friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.

At the conclusion of the New 52, following the New 52 Superman's death, Lex Luthor buys the _Daily Planet_.[16]

30th and 31st Centuries

In virtually every incarnation of the era inhabited by the Legion of Super-Heroes, the _Daily Planet_ is depicted as a fixture in Metropolis, and one of Earth's major media sources. Frequently, the Flash's wife Iris West Allen (a native of the era) is depicted as a member of its staff or editorial board.

In other media

The _Daily Planet_ has been featured in all adaptations of _Superman_ to other media.

-   From 1976-1981, the _Daily Planet_ was a promotional page appearing in regular DC publications (similar to Marvel Comics' Bullpen Bulletins), featuring previews of upcoming publications set in the format of a page from the titular newspaper. Notable features of the page were "The Answer Man", where DC writer/editor Bob Rozakis would answer questions sent in by readers, and a comic strip by cartoonist Fred Hembeck poking fun at DC characters.[17]
-   A 16-page "Special Invasion Edition" of _The Daily Planet_ was published by DC in November 1988 as a tie-in to the _Invasion!_ crossover event,[18] ostensibly the same edition of the paper shown on the final page of _Invasion!_ #1.[19]

Live-action television

-   During most of the 1950s television series _Adventures of Superman_, the _Daily Planet_ exterior was Los Angeles City Hall. In season one, the E. Clem Wilson Building was used for exterior shots of the Planet building.
-   _Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_ introduced the idea of a smaller globe above the building's entrance (the rooftop was never shown). At the end of the first season the paper was bought and closed down by Luthor (as would later happen in the comics). Its relaunch was funded by Metropolis businessman Franklin Stern.
-   In the 2000s live-action television series _Smallville_, the _Daily Planet_ building is located across the street from the LuthorCorp building. One of the main characters of _Smallville_, Chloe Sullivan, worked in the basement of the _Planet_ (seasons 5-7). Her cousin Lois Lane continues to work there, as did Chloe's on again/off again love interest (and eventual husband) Jimmy Olsen until his death at the end of season 8. Clark Kent started to work at the _Daily Planet_ as a copy boy in the show's eighth season, but eventually worked his way up to a reporter in the ninth season. In episode 10 of the 6th season a street sign is shown as Chloe (Allison Mack) runs out of the _Daily Planet_ from Linda Lake (Tori Spelling) and shows that the _Planet_ is located at 355 Burrard St. Smallville also features the _Daily Star_ as a separate newspaper, which was first seen in "Icarus".
-   _The Daily Planet_ was mentioned in various episodes of _Supergirl_.

Films

-   In 1978's _Superman_ and its sequels, the _Daily Planet_ exterior was the New York _Daily News_ building. The globe, which used to be on the top of the building, was apparently replaced with one in the lobby as to make room for a helipad on the roof. In fact, The Daily News building in New York has featured a globe in its lobby for almost all of its history. The real-life _Daily News_ was headquartered in The News Building until the mid-1990s.
-   The 2006 _Superman Returns_ movie has redesigned the _Daily Planet_ as a completely computer generated image of a fictional building inserted into the Empire State Building skyline.
-   In the 2013 film _Man of Steel_ the _Daily Planet_ exterior was filmed in the Chicago Board of Trade Building. The interior was filmed in the Willis Tower.[20] The _Planet_ appears again in _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_.

Animations

-   In _Superman: The Animated Series_, in the episode "World's Finest Part 2", it is mentioned that the _Daily Planet_ has offices in Gotham City, as well when Lois Lane says she is transferring "to the _Planet_'s Gotham City bureau."
-   The _Daily Planet_ appears in _Superman: Doomsday_.
-   The _Daily Planet_ appears in _Superman Unbound_.
-   In _Justice League: War_, the Daily Planet building is seen in the background of a fight between Superman, Batman, and Green Lantern.
-   A parallel universe version of the _Daily Planet_ renamed PLANETNWZ.COM appears in the 2015 animated film _Justice League: Gods and Monsters_. PLANETNWZ.COM is a blog and a harsh critic of the Justice League's violent and destructive method.
