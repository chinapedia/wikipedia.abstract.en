History

Friedehorst Park was laid out in about 1875 around the rural estate of Lehnhof, which was owned by the consul general, banker and senator, Theodor Lürmann, probably by Wilhelm Benque, creator of Bürgerpark Bremen and Knoops Park, in a rural style. The manor house, originally a building in the Swiss chalet style, was built in 1888 and replaced in 1904 by a new one in the Neo-Baroque style, which in turn was demolished in the 1930s. The park was originally larger that it is today, having an area of 16 ha. The _Stiftung Friedehorst_ (Friedehorst Foundation) with its buildings is located on the eastern side of the park. To the west of the park the suburb of Lehnhofsiedlung was built in 1950/51.[9]
