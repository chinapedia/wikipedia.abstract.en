The 2017 BALTIMORE RAVENS SEASON was the franchise's 22nd season in the National Football League and their 10th under head coach John Harbaugh. This was also the 10th season with Joe Flacco as the team's starting quarterback. The Ravens improved on the previous season's 8–8 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third consecutive season by a last second touchdown in a 31–27 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17.

Week 3: Jacksonville Jaguars 44, Baltimore Ravens 7

NFL LONDON GAMES

Week 4: Pittsburgh Steelers 26, Baltimore Ravens 9

Week 5: Baltimore Ravens 30, Oakland Raiders 17

After several weeks of dismal offensive plays, the Ravens traveled west to Oakland where they have had trouble in the past. But the offense was able to power through behind a very strong defensive performance, albeit with Raiders' starting quarterback Derek Carr injured.[11]

Week 6: Chicago Bears 27, Baltimore Ravens 24 (OT)

Week 7: Minnesota Vikings 24, Baltimore Ravens 16

Week 8: Baltimore Ravens 40, Miami Dolphins 0

Week 9: Tennessee Titans 23, Baltimore Ravens 20

Week 11: Baltimore Ravens 23, Green Bay Packers 0

The Ravens came into Lambeau Field having never won a game with a 0-3 record there. However, they forced five turnovers off a Packers offense struggling greatly without injured star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, which proved costly as the Ravens got their third shutout of the season 23-0, their first ever win in Wisconsin.

Week 12: Baltimore Ravens 23, Houston Texans 16

Week 13: Baltimore Ravens 44, Detroit Lions 20

Week 14: Pittsburgh Steelers 39, Baltimore Ravens 38

Week 15: Baltimore Ravens 27, Cleveland Browns 10

Week 16: Baltimore Ravens 23, Indianapolis Colts 16

Week 17: Cincinnati Bengals 31, Baltimore Ravens 27

The Ravens' playoff dreams were dashed in heartbreaking fashion after Eric Weddle's would be game-winning interception was negated by a defensive pass interference call, in which the drive ended with a go-ahead Bengals touchdown. After a 4th down Flacco pass to Wallace that failed to convert into a 1st down, the Ravens turned over the ball and lost to the Bengals. This loss would be significant because in addition to eliminating them from the playoffs, it allowed the Buffalo Bills to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1999 season.
