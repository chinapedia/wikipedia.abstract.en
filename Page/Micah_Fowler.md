MICAH D. FOWLER (born March 5, 1998) is an American actor with cerebral palsy. He is most known for his roles in _Labor Day_ and as JJ DiMeo in the television series _Speechless_.[1] Fowler has also had minor roles in _Blue's Clues_ and _Sesame Street_.


Early life

The younger brother of actress Kelsey Fowler, he grew up in Barnegat Township, New Jersey.[2] He grew up performing in local theater productions along with his sister. After his sister started taking roles on Broadway, Fowler thought he might like to advance his acting career as well.[3]


Career

Micah D. Fowler started pursuing acting at the age of 5, which led him to roles on _Blue's Clues_ and _Sesame Street_. He booked his role for _Labor Day_ at age thirteen. For his most recent role, as "JJ DiMeo" on _Speechless_, he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with _People magazine_, Fowler said it was the "best birthday present ever!"[4]

Regarding his role on _Speechless_, he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs.[5] He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying.[6]

Fowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television.[7]


Ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation

When not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation (CPF). After each episode of _Speechless_, the CPF's website posts content and short informational videos about cerebral palsy. Fowler encourages, "So the next time you watch _Speechless_, take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night."[8]


Personal life

When taking the role for _Speechless_, Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he sacrificed by missing much of his sled hockey season and much of his senior year. He planned to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring of 2017.[9]

While Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on _Speechless_, he did join Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show.

Growing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television. He said, "I couldn't help but notice the lack of characters dealing with disabilities."[10] He hopes to be in a _Star Wars_ film or a Marvel movie.[11]
