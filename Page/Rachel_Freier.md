In 2016, she campaigned and was elected as a Civil Court judge for the Kings County 5th judicial district in New York State, thereby becoming the first Hasidic Jewish woman to be elected as a civil court judge in New York State,[2][3][4] and the first Hasidic woman[5] to hold public office[6] in United States history.[7] Although she ran for the Civil Court, after her election she was assigned to serve on the Criminal Court in the Kings County 5th judicial district.[8] She previously worked as a real estate attorney and community activist, and served as a volunteer court lawyer in the New York City Family Court.[9]


Early life and education

Freier was born in Borough Park, Brooklyn,[10][11] the eldest of five children in a Hasidic Jewish family.[12] While attending the Bais Yaakov high school in Borough Park, she took a course in legal stenography,[13] and she graduated from high school in 1982.[14] At age 19 she married David Freier, with whom she has three sons and three daughters.[15]

Freier worked first as a legal secretary, and, in 1994, as a paralegal at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher,[16] in order to support her husband in kollel.[17] Her husband went on to complete an accounting degree at Touro College,[18] and in 1996,[19] she also decided to pursue a college education. She began studying law at age 30 after realizing she was working for lawyers younger than her.[20]

She enrolled at Lander College, part of the Touro College and University System as well,[21] where she became director of the women's pre-law society, and graduated six years later with a bachelor of science degree in political science.[22][23][24]

She then entered Brooklyn Law School,[25][26] completing her degree in four years, graduating in June 2005.[27][28] She passed the New York State Bar in 2006.[29]

Volunteer activities

In 2008,[55] Freier was one of the founders of B'Derech, a GED program for Haredi youth at-risk.[56][57] The organization also helps troubled teens with therapy and hypnosis.[58] The program launched in partnership with the New York branch of Bramson ORT College adding a Men's Division[59] and Women’s Division.[60]

In 2010, Freier advocated to save Breslov Yeshiva in Williamsburg, in spite of opposition from some who harassed the students and maligned the Rabbi, Yoeli Roth.[61] Freier received threats for defending the yeshiva, but she won the court case.[62]

In 2011, she became involved with Ezras Nashim, an all-female Orthodox Jewish volunteer EMT ambulance service established with the goal of preserving women's modesty in emergency medical situations, especially childbirth.[63] The group was formed after its request to add a female corps of EMT volunteers to the all-male Hatzalah organization, the long-standing Orthodox Jewish EMT service in New York City, was rejected, Hatzalah was the subject of controversy as articles in the _New York Post_ [64] and _JEMS Magazine_ criticize the organization for its discriminatory practice of not allowing women to join. The group of Orthodox women cited the need for modesty and sensitivity to the needs of fellow Orthodox women.[65][66] Freier is working on a project to buy an ambulance for the organization.[67] Freier initially provided advocacy services for the group, and took over the directorship of the organization in 2012.[68] Ezras Nashim was licensed by the New York State Department of Health in February 2013,[69] though the volunteer corps respond in their own private vehicles as Ezras Nashim is still awaiting a license to operate a full ambulance service.[70]
