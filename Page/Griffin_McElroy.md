During the 2008 United States presidential election, McElroy also acted as MTV's local journalist for his home state of West Virginia.[8] He departed _Joystiq_ in 2012 in order to found _Polygon_ along with his brother Justin McElroy and Christopher Grant, going on to later become a senior video producer for the site.[9][10] During his tenure, he oversaw a large volume of video content for the site, including their _Monster Factory_ series and several let's plays.[11][12] In 2018, Griffin and Justin both announced their departure from _Polygon_, in order to focus on their podcasting careers and families.[13]

Podcasting

Since 2010, Griffin McElroy, along with his brothers Justin and Travis, has co-hosted the comedy podcast _My Brother, My Brother and Me_, an "advice show for the modren[sic] era" hosted as part of the Maximum Fun network. The brothers also starred in a 2017 TV show based on the podcast, which originally aired on Seeso.[14]

In 2014, the McElroy brothers launched a tabletop role-playing game podcast entitled _The Adventure Zone_.[15] Initially playing _Dungeons & Dragons_, the show moved into other game systems in later arcs. Griffin McElroy acted as the Dungeon Master for the initial 69-episode _Balance_ arc,[16] and later took on the similar role of "Keeper" for the Powered by the Apocalypse based _Amnesty_ arc.[17] Griffin McElroy also composes much of the original soundtrack for the series.[18] The first sub-arc of _The Adventure Zone: Balance_, named _Here There Be Gerblins_, has been adapted into a graphic novel, published by First Second Books, with a sequel set to follow the plot of the second sub-arc "Murder on the Rockport Limited" coming soon.[19]

Griffin and his brothers also co-host a yearly podcast with Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, released every American Thanksgiving since 2015, called _Til Death Do Us Blart_[20] where they review the film _Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2_. The brothers also host the documentary podcast _The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls 2,_ which ultimately resulted in the announcement that all three were set to make cameo appearances in the film.[21][22]

Since 2017, Griffin McElroy has also co-hosted the podcast _Wonderful!_ with his wife, Rachel, where they discuss things they are interested in and enjoy.[23] The two had previously hosted another podcast named _Rose Buddies_, in which they recapped episodes of _The Bachelor_ and related television series.[24]

Voice acting

McElroy has appeared as a voice actor in several animated series, including _Clarence_, _Big City Greens_, _We Bare Bears_, and _Camp Camp_.[25][26] He also provided voice commentary for the 2017 video game _100ft Robot Golf_, alongside his brothers.[27] In September 2018, following a successful podcasting campaign, the McElroy brothers confirmed that they would be voicing characters in the film _Trolls World Tour_.[28]
