CHUTNEY MARY is a fine dining Indian restaurant in London, founded in 1990 by Ranjit Mathrani & Namita Panjabi through their restaurant company whose current name is MW Eat. It has received considerable critical acclaim over the years. It was originally in Kings Road Chelsea, but relocated to St James's, London in 2015.

Chutney Mary pioneered in redefining the public face of Indian cuisines by showcasing the gourmet foods from 6-7 different regions of India at any one time. It had the rigorous philosophy that the foods of the different regions could best be cooked by the chefs from that region. It was an extremely ambitious undertaking and akin to having a pan European gourmet. Chutney Mary was probably the first Indian restaurant in the world to trace the regional provenance of each dish. Chutney Mary was also pioneered as an Indian restaurant in taking wines seriously, and led the way in the pairing of Indian food and wine.

The regional provenance and the dishes on the Chutney Mary proved the trailblazer for the supermarket packaged foods – e.g. Waitrose which from the mid 90's started prepared dished with the regional provenance and with names from the Chutney Mary menu.
