The NIGER DELTA GREENLAND JUSTICE MANDATE (NDGJM) is a militant group operating in Nigeria's Niger Delta region. The group was founded on August 2, 2016 in Delta State and is composed mainly of ethnic Urhobos, and a fairly large number of members belonging to the Isoko ethnic group.

Following the ceasefire declared by their close allies, the Niger Delta Avengers, on August 27, 2016 the NDGJM is now the most active of all the Niger Delta rebel groups, having carried out numerous attacks on oil producing facilities since their founding in early August. The group has also issued numerous statements, mocking the Nigerian military's so-called "Operation Crocodile Smiles", commenced on August 30, calling it a scam and nothing more than a propaganda stunt aiming to call back all the foreign oil corporations that have ceased operations in the delta since the NDA's bombing campaign of mid-2016.

On October 13, 2016 the group released a statement declaring total war on the Nigerian government, code-named "Operation Hammurabi Code", and warns that all Nigerian soldiers and foreign multinational corporation associates will be mercilessly rooted out and eliminated if found to be operating in the delta.
