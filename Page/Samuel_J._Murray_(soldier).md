SAMUEL JOHN MURRAY (December 7, 1918 – April 28, 2004) was a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army’s 2nd Infantry Division, who earned the Distinguished Service Cross[1] for his leadership on the front lines at the Battle of the Bulge. Wounded by gun fire and a bursting shell, Murray continued to direct his men, through freezing conditions, battling hunger and exhaustion. Their efforts were said to have contributed to the victory of the Allied forces.

He later graduated from Columbia University Law School[2] and interrupted a career with the Davis Polk law firm to become an investigator of the conditions of dock workers through the New York State Crime Commission, Waterfront Investigation,[3] an issue made popular by the 1955 Academy Award winning film, On the Waterfront with Marlon Brando.
