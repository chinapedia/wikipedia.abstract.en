YISHUN POND PARK (or YISHUN POND) is an urban park located at Yishun, Singapore. It is situated along Yishun Central in front of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and connects the residential areas to Yishun MRT station and Northpoint Shopping Centre.

The park features a large pond that serves as a recreational spot for residents and doubles as a water catchment area.[1] Water from the pond is used in the irrigation system of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.[2]

The park was renovated in 2006 and is linked to Yishun Park via an 84-meter elevated bridge.
