A group of riders that included Andriy Hrivko (), Alexis Gougeard (), Mattia Frapporti (), Mirco Maestri and Luca Wackermann (), Iuri Filosi and Kohei Uchima () broke clear of the peloton in the early kilometres, with a gap of over three minutes ahead of the day's only categorised climb, at Scansano.

Classification leadership table

In the 2017 Tirreno–Adriatico, four jerseys were awarded. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages except for the individual time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2017 Tirreno–Adriatico, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.

  Position         1    2    3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10

  Points awarded   12   10   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1

  : Points for stage victory

The second classification was the points classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top ten in a stage. Unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages – with the exception of the team time trial, which awarded no points towards the classification – were awarded the same number of points. Points were also won in intermediate sprints; five points for crossing the sprint line first, three points for second place, two for third and one for fourth. The leader of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.

  Position     1    2    3   4   5   6   7

  Points for   15   10   7   5   3   2   1
  Points for   5    3    2   1   0

  : Points for the mountains classification

There was also a mountains classification, for which points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb before other riders. Each climb was categorised as either Superior-, or single-category, with more points available for the more difficult, Superior-category climb, Monte Terminillo. For Monte Terminillo, the top seven riders earned points; on the other climbs, only the top four riders earned points. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a green jersey.

The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. Only riders born after 1 January 1992 were eligible; the young rider best placed in the general classification was the leader of the young rider classification. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists in a team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest cumulative time.
