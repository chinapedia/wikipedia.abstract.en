History

1983–2010

An Ceathrú Póilí was founded in 1983 and was housed in Ardscoil Bhéal Feirste. After the Ardscoil was destroyed by fire in a 1984,[4] the shop had a nomadic existence until the founding of Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich in 1991 in the old Broadway Presbyterian Church on Falls Road. The centre was used as an Irish-medium secondary school (now Coláiste Feirste) and theatre space with the book shop located on the ground floor with An Caifé Glas (now known as _Bia_).

An Ceathrú Póilí was renovated in 2011 with Irish president Mary McAleese re-opening the cultural centre in 2011.[5] The shop began selling online in September 2016. It hosts regular book launches in collaboration with publishers Coiscéim, Cló Iar-Chonnacht and An Gúm.
