He was among the few Filipino officials who have served in all three branches of the government.[2]


Early life and education

Liwag was born on June 12, 1906 in Gapan, Nueva Ecija to Diego Liwag and Isabel Ramos. He finished elementary schooling as valedictorian at the Gapan Intermediate School, high school at the University of the Philippines, again as valedictorian, and subsequently hurdled the Liberal Arts course with honors. In 1932, he completed his law course at the University of the Philippines College of Law, cum laude, and placed second in the 1932 Philippine Bar Examinations.[3] He is a member of Upsilon Sigma Phi batch 1927.[4]

In 1945, he began his public service as prosecutor in the Department of Justice, assuming later the position of head of the office of special prosecutors. Four years later, he was appointed judge-at-large of the Court of First Instance and the following year was named district judge for Albay and Catanduanes. He was appointed Solicitor General in 1952, a position he held until 1954.[5]

President Diosdado Macapagal made him Undersecretary of Justice in 1961 and on May 19 of that year, appointed him as Secretary. He served from May 20, 1962 to July 7, 1963. It was the time of the Stonehill scandal and as Secretary of Justice, Liwag had the huge task of prosecuting the American and his associates.
