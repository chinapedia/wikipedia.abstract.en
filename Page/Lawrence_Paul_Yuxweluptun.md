LAWRENCE PAUL YUXWELUPTUN is a Canadian First Nations artist, of Coast Salish and Okanagan descent.[1] His paintings use elements of First Nations imagery and surrealism, and explore issues such as environmentalism, land ownership, and Canada's treatment of First Nations peoples.


Early life

Yuxweluptun was born in Kamloops, British Columbia in 1957, and grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia. His father is Coast Salish and his mother is from the Okanagan region. Both of his parents were politically active; his father was a member of the North American Native Brotherhood, and a founder of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, while his mother led the Indian Homemakers Association of British Columbia.[2] His name means "man of many masks", and was given to him in his adolescence by the Sxwaixwe Society.[3] He attended the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and graduated from Emily Carr in 1983 with an honours degree in painting.[4][5]


Symbolism and technique

Yuxweluptun works primarily in painting, but has also created multimedia works.[6] Many of his pieces show elements of Surrealism, including similarities to the melting objects in Salvador Dali's paintings.[7] His work incorporates traditional elements from Northwest First Nations art, as well as evocations of the Canadian landscape painting tradition, such as the Group of Seven.[8]

Environmental issues are often central themes in Yuxweluptun's work.[9] His paintings have overtly political statements and titles, and often highlight land use and land ownership issues. Generally, Yuxweluptun's paintings are described as "provocative"; for example, his multimedia piece _Residential School Dirty Laundry_ illustrates a cross made out of children's underwear with red paint to represent blood, and references the treatment of First Nations children in the Canadian Indian residential school system.[10]


Artwork

Inherent Rights, Vision Rights

"Inherent Rights, Vision Rights" was one of the very first Virtual Reality (VR) artworks ever made in Canada and was produced between 1991 and 1993 at the Banff Centre for the Arts for the Art and Virtual Environments Project.[11] The work's components included Macintosh and PC computers, a sampler, spatialized sound, custom-made controls and stereoscopic display.[12] It was also the first VR piece to be exhibited by the National Gallery of Canada.[13] It was exhibited at the National Gallery of Canada in 1992 in the exhibition _Land, Spirit, Power: First Nations at the National Gallery of Canada. / Terre, esprit, pouvoir. Les Premières Nations au Musée des beaux-arts du Canada_ (September 25, 1992 to Sunday, November 22, 1992).[14][15]

"Inherent Rights, Vision Rights," pioneered new techniques for the exhibition of VR pieces by blending computer-generated 3D sound with figures derived from Lawrence Paul’s paintings.[16] The viewer does not wear a helmet to experience the work. Instead, the viewer enters a kiosk similar to an old-fashioned stereoscope, and experiences spatialized sound and computer graphics. The kiosk represents a Longhouse, described in a 1993 edition of _Canadian Art_ as a "simulated cartoon longhouse inhabited by a variety of Yuxweluptun's typical animal spirits and ghosts."[17]

_Haida Hot Dog_

One of Yuxweluptun's earlier pieces, the 1984 work _Haida Hot Dog_, comments in pop-art style on the commodification of First Nations, and particularly Haida, artwork.[18]


Awards

Yuxweluptun was the recipient of the Vancouver Institute for the Visual Arts (VIVA) award in 1998.[19]

In 2013, Yuxweluptun received a Fellowship at the Eitelijorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.[20]


Exhibitions

Yuxweluptun's work has been included in numerous international group and solo exhibitions, such as _INDIGENA: Contemporary Native Perspectives_ in 1992 and 1993. _INDIGENA_ was a major touring exhibition of Indigenous art curated by Gerald MacMaster and Lee-Ann Martin.[21]

_Unceded Territories,_ a solo exhibition, was co-curated by Karen Duffek (MOA Curator, Contemporary Visual Arts & Pacific Northwest) and Tania Willard (artist and independent curator, Secwepemc Nation) at the Museum of Anthropology (MOA), University of British Columbia, in 2016.[22][23]

Yuxweluptun's work was exhibited in _Sakahàn: International Indigenous Art,_ the National Gallery of Canada’s special exhibition.[24] It ran from May 17 to September 2, 2013 and was deemed the largest-ever global survey of contemporary Indigenous art in 2013.[25][26]
