PSG ESPORTS is a French professional esports organization founded in 2016, and based in the city of Paris in France. The club is the esports department of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. PSG Esports was officially formed on 20 October 2016 by Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi during a press conference held at the Parc des Princes in Paris.[1]

PSG Esports hired French former professional _League of Legends_ player Bora "YellOwStaR" Kim as Head of eSports to supervise the club's players and recruitment.[2] In October 2017, both parties mutually agreed to part ways after "YellOwStaR" disagreed with the club's suspension of the League of Legends team.[3] Currently, Yassine Jaada is the club's leading figure. He is PSG's Chief Gaming Officer (CGO).[4]

In March 2017, PSG Esports announced partnerships with gaming and betting operator PMU eSports and Taiwanese tech company Asus. These two brands became the first shirt sponsors of the newly-formed esports section.[5] Other partnerships include energy drink Monster Energy, Chinese streaming site Douyu and male grooming products brand Lynx.[6]

PSG Esports have active teams in _FIFA_,[7] _Rocket League_,[8] _Dota 2_ (PSG.LGD),[9][10] _FIFA Online_,[11] _Mobile Legends: Bang Bang_ (PSG.RRQ),[12] and _Brawl Stars_.[13] Formerly, the club also had a _League of Legends_ team.[14][15]


History

_FIFA_

PSG Esports entered _FIFA_ with Danish prodigy and twice FIFA eWorld Cup champion (2014, 2016) August "Agge" Rosenmeier. The club also launched its policy of young talented players with the signing of highly skilled rookie Lucas "DaXe" Cuillerier, considered a rising star of FIFA and one of the best player in the world.[16]

In October 2016, "DaXe" became _FIFA 17_ World Champion at the Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) that took place during the Paris Games Week in Paris, bringing at the same time the first trophy for PSG Esports.[17] In November 2016, "Agge" won the Legia eSports Cup, a tournament featuring 10 FIFA players from professional football clubs, as well as the DreamHack Winter.[18][19] "DaXe" claimed its second title with PSG Esports in April 2017 after winning the FIFA 17 tournament during the Gamers Assembly in Poitiers.[20]

Rafael "Rafifa13" Fortes and Ahmed "Aameghessib" Al-Meghessib joined PSG's FIFA team in 2017.[21][22] The duo went on to represent PSG at the 2017 FIFA eWorld Cup in London.[23] After the World Cup, Johann "ManiiKa" Simon and Gordon "Fiddle" Thornsberry also arrived to the team.[24][25]

In turn, PSG released "Agge" from his contract in September 2017, after one year at the club.[26] In November 2017, "DaXe" retained its crown by becoming FIFA 18 World Champion at the ESWC during the Paris Games Week.[27] In April 2018, FIFA 17 world champion Corentin "RocKy" Chevrey joined PSG's FIFA roster.[28] In May 2018, "Fiddle" won the Gfinity FIFA 18 US Spring Cup Xbox.[29] In November 2018, "Fiddle" left the club and signed with Cincinnati on a free transfer.[30]

In February 2019, "DaXe" won the Orange e-Ligue 1 Winter Tournament on Xbox after defeating Monaco's Florian "RayZiaaH" Maridat 4–3 in the final.[31] Later that month, PSG Esports signed French FIFA YouTuber and specialist AF5. As PSG Esports FIFA players were increasingly solicited, it became complicated for them to create content around their careers and share it with their fans, while remaining 100% focused on their competitions. AF5 will follow the club's FIFA players on the competitions they are playing in and create exclusive content on their experiences and performances, starting with the FIFA eWorld Cup 2019.[32]

_League of Legends_

In December 2016, PSG Esports revealed its League of Legends' roster for the 2017 European League of Legends Challenger Series. The team consisted of Etienne "Steve" Michels as Toplaner, Sung-Min "Blanc" Jin as Midlaner, Thomas "Kirei" Yuen as Jungler, Hampus "Sprattel" Abrahamsson as Support and WooHyung "Pilot" Na as AD Carry.[33][34][35][36][37] In February 2017, Hadrien "Hadrien" Forestier joined as coach before the start of the tournament, while Matti "WhiteKnight" Sormunen arrived to the squad as Substitute Toplaner later that same month.[38][39]

Despite a rough start, PSG's League of Legends team made it to the European Challenger Series playoffs, where they will face Fnatic Academy in a best of 5 to reach the European League Championship Series promotion tournament. PSG had only one point until the fourth week, but managed to win the next two series thanks in part to the arrival of "WhiteKnight".[40] However, the LCS promotion tournament's spot slipped through their fingers after losing against Fnatic Academy.[41]

After a disappointing Spring Split, PSG announced the departures of "Pilot", "Sprattel", "Steve" and "WhiteKnight" from its League of Legends team.[42][43][44][45] Meanwhile, Tomáš "Nardeus" Maršálek and Felix "Noxiak" Lewis arrived to the team for the Summer Split as AD Carry and Support, respectively.[46]

In October 2017, however, PSG Esports chose to suspend its activities on League of Legends until further notice after concluding that "the revenue sharing model offered by game publisher Riot Games is very far from compensating the costs of a structure with European ambitions, partly because of the strong inflation of pro-gamers salaries, in our mind unjustified regarding the audience numbers evolution of the last months."[47]

_Rocket League_

In September 2017, PSG Esports announced its participation in the Rocket League Championship Series after picking up the previous Frontline roster, including Victor "Ferra" Francal, Dan "Bluey" Bluett, and Thibault "Chausette" Grzesiak.[48] In October 2017, PSG's trio dominated the Rocket League Championship Series Season 4 and qualified to the World Championship in October.[49] A month later, they were also crowned ESL Championat National champions at Paris Games Week, before finishing fifth in the World Championship, just off the podium.[50]

In February 2018, PSG claimed the DreamHack Open Leipzig.[51] In August 2018, the team signed Danish player Emil "Fruity" Moselund as replacement of the outgoing "Bluey".[52] In September 2018, the _Rocket League_ team won the Rewind Gaming: The Colosseum tournament.[53] In July 2019, PSG clinched the 2019 DreamHack Valencia.[54]

_Dota 2_

In April 2018, PSG Esports announced it would be signing the roster of Chinese _Dota 2_ team LGD Gaming, rebranding themselves as PSG.LGD.[55] The roster consists of Wang "Ame" Chunyu, Lu "Maybe" Yao, Yang "Chalice" Shenyi, Xu "Fy" Linsen, and Jian Wei "xNova" Yap.[56] In May 2018, PSG.LGD won its first major trophy on Dota 2 after being crowned Epicenter XL Major champions in Moscow.[57] A few days later, PSG.LGD also claimed the MDL Changsha Major in Changsha and qualified for The International 2018.[58]

The _Dota 2_ team (PSG.LGD) signed a 13-month partnership deal with Chinese ready-to-wear brand HLA Jeans, which will appear on PSG's _Dota 2_ team shirt. Team players will wear HLA Jeans clothing during club activities as well.[59]

_FIFA Online_

In October 2018, building on their success on _Dota 2_, PSG Esports and LGD Gaming expanded their partnership with the opening of a _FIFA Online_ section. The free-to-play dedicated to Asian territories entered the FIFA eWorld Cup circuit last year. The PSG.LGD team on FIFA online will be composed of Li "Yuwenc" Sijun, Mo "MzDragon" Zilong, Chen "Milano" Junyu, and Johann "ManiiKa" Simon.[60]

_Mobile Legends: Bang Bang_

In February 2019, after a strong partnership with LGD Gaming on _Dota 2_ and _FIFA Online_, which allowed the club to enter the Chinese market, PSG Esports announced it would be signing the roster of Indonesian _Mobile Legends: Bang Bang_ team Rex Regum Qeon.[61] The deal sees PSG become the first traditional sports team to enter mobile-game esports via the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang league with the rebranded PSG.RRQ squad. The move is designed to give the French club a greater presence in Asia, especially in Indonesia, which has an estimated 43 million gamers.[62]

The roster consists of Muhammad "Lemon" Ikhsan, Diky "Tuturu", William "Liam" Setiawan, Try "AyamJAGO" Sukardi, Chen "James" Jui Teng, and Calvien "InstincT". The majority of the team's competitions will be broadcast, while game results and statistics will be available on Team RRQ's Instagram and YouTube channel.[63]

_Brawl Stars_

In February 2019, PSG Esports entered mobile game _Brawl Stars_ with a team composed of Murat "SunBentley" Can, Maxime "TwistiTwik" Alic, and Anthony "Tony M" Cagny.[64] Later that same month, PSG signed Théodore Bayoux, alias Trapa, as _Brawl Stars_ manager. He will also be one of the club's official YouTubers.[65]
