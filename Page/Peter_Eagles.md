[[Royal_Army_Chaplains'_Department|Deputy PETER ANDREW EAGLES, (born 6 July 1959) is a British Anglican bishop. Since 2017, he has been the Bishop of Sodor and Man; he was consecrated a bishop in the Church of England in June 2017, and he was installed in September 2017. He is a former chaplain of the British Army, serving as Archdeacon for the Army (2011–2017) and the Deputy Chaplain-General of the Royal Army Chaplains' Department (2014–2017).


Early life and education

Eagles was born on 6 July 1959.[1] He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, an all-boys independent school in Guildford, Surrey.[2] He studied German and Russian at King's College, London, and he graduated in 1982 with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree and the Associateship of King's College (AKC).[3][4]

Between 1982 and 1986, Eagles was an assistant master at Tonbridge School, an independent school in Tonbridge, Kent, and also worked as a freelance translator.[5] In 1986, he entered St Stephen's House, Oxford, an Anglo-Catholic theological college, to train for holy orders and study theology.[6] He graduated with a further BA in 1988.[7]


Ordained ministry

Eagles was ordained in the Church of England: made a deacon at Petertide 1989 (1 July), by Graham Leonard, Bishop of London, at St Paul's Cathedral[8] and ordained a priest the Petertide following (1 July 1990), by Tom Butler, Bishop of Willesden, at his title church.[9] From 1989 to 1992, he served his curacy at St Martin's Church, Ruislip, an Anglo-Catholic church in the Diocese of London.[10]

Military service

On 27 January 1990, Eagles was commissioned into the Royal Army Chaplains' Department of the British Army as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (equivalent in rank to captain).[11] He was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (equivalent in rank to major) on 27 January 1998,[12] and to Chaplain to the Forces 2nd Class on 5 September 2005 (equivalent in rank to lieutenant colonel).[13] From 2007 to 2008, he was Chaplain of the Royal Military Chapel (Guards Chapel) at Wellington Barracks in London.[14]

On 28 January 2008, Eagles was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 1st Class (equivalent in rank to colonel) and appointed an Assistant Chaplain General.[15][16] On 28 July 2011, he was collated and licensed as the Archdeacon for the Army, the most senior Anglican chaplain in the British Army, during a service at Lambeth Palace Chapel;[17] as such he is a member of the General Synod of the Church of England.[18] From 2013 to 2014, he attended the Royal College of Defence Studies to prepare for further promotion.[19] On 14 July 2014, he was appointed the Deputy Chaplain General (equivalent in rank to brigadier), thereby becoming the second most senior chaplain in the British Army.[20]

Eagles officially retired from the British Army on 6 July 2017.[21]

Episcopal ministry

On 4 May 2017, it was announced that Eagles would be the next Bishop of Sodor and Man.[22][23] He was consecrated a bishop on 22 June 2017 during a service at York Minster,[24] by John Sentamu, Archbishop of York.[25] He was installed at the Cathedral Church of St German in Peel, Isle of Man on 30 September 2017.[26] As Bishop of Sodor and Man, he has an _ex-officio_ seat on the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man which he took up upon his installation as bishop.[27]

Views

Eagles belongs to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England.[28] Though he has a traditionalist background, due to the circumstances of the Diocese of Sodor and Man (only having one bishop), he plans to "ordain all who are called to be deacons and priests".[29][30]


Personal life

In 1992, Eagles married Gail Seager. Together they have one son.[31]


Honours

On 17 October 2013, Eagles was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen (QHC).[32] On 15 October 2015, he was installed as an honorary canon of Salisbury Cathedral.[33][34]
