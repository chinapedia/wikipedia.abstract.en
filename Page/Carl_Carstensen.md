2nd World Scout Jamboree

The Second World Jamboree was officially opened on 10 August 1924 by Rear-Admiral Carl Carstensen, acting as the personal representative of King Christian X.[2] Fourteen countries entered composite troops for the World Scout Championship, a test of Scoutcraft and stamina which continued throughout the week, and included camp inspections, hygiene, discipline, campfire songs and yells, folk dancing, swimming, handicraft, an obstacle course and patrol hike. The Boy Scouts of America won the competition, Great Britain came second and Hungary third. It was decided, however, not to renewing the idea, for fears that nationalism could harm Scout brotherhood.[3]
