ALLIED FORCES SOUTH NORWAY (SONOR) was a NATO command tasked with the defense of Southern Norway. SONOR's area of responsibility included all of Norway with the adjacent sea territory excluding the three northernmost counties of Norway, which were under Allied Forces North Norway.


History

Allied Forces South Norway (SONOR) and was activated in 1962 along with Allied Forces North Norway (NON) and Allied Forces Baltic Approaches. Unlike most other NATO commands SONOR was a staffed entirely by members of the Norwegian Armed Forces. Its operational headquarters was located in Stavanger and today houses NATO's Joint Warfare Centre. The commander of SONOR had three deputies: Commander Land Forces South Norway, Commander Air Forces South Norway and Commander Naval Forces South Norway. Incoming allied units would have come under the command of these three deputy commanders.[1]


Structure 1989

In case of war SONOR had the following units at its disposal:

Naval Forces South Norway (NAVSONOR) was tasked with the defence of Southern Norway's coastal waters against Soviet naval incursions and amphibious landings. Operations to the South of Norway's coastal waters were under the command of NATO's Allied Command Channel and Allied Forces Baltic Approaches. Therefore, most major naval units of the Norwegian Navy would have come under other NATO commands, with NAVSONOR retaining control of coastal artillery units and smaller coastal defense boats. NAVSONOR also dispatched a squadron of fast attack crafts to NAVNON on a rotational basis.

Norway Air-Landed Marine Expeditionary Brigade (NALMEB) Prepositioning Program material at the Bjugn Cave Facility]]

In 1981 the governments of Norway and the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding that in case of war the U.S. Marine Corps' 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade would be deployed to Norway as the Norway Air-Landed Marine Expeditionary Brigade (NALMEB). To facilitate a rapid deployment of the brigade and its associated air and logistical units via strategic airlift the two nations agreed to preposition equipment and materiel for 15,000 troops, and war stocks for 30 days in Norway. Because of the harsh Norwegian climate it was decided that unlike the REFORGER depots in Germany, the depots in Norway would be underground facilities. Thus between 1985 and 1989 American and Norwegian engineers drilled nearly 63,000 square meters of underground storage tunnels into the mountains around Trondheim. After the sites had been filled with materiel and equipment, Norwegian troops were tasked with its maintenance, with two exceptions: the two stored fleet hospitals were maintained by two small US Navy detachments.

By 1990 the eight artificial caves were filled with all the equipment and the Norway Air-Landed Marine Expeditionary Brigade could have been deployed to Norway within 48h.[4]

The eight underground depots were:

-   Ørland Air Station, fighter wing reception site and depot
-   Værnes Air Station, rotary wing reception site and depot
-   Bjugn Cave Site, in Bjugn, ground equipment and supply depot
-   Frigård Cave Site, in Holtålen, ground equipment and supply depot
-   Tromsdal Cave Site, in Verdal, ground equipment and supply depot
-   Hammerkammen Cave Site, in Stjørdal ground ammunition depot
-   Hammernesodden Cave Site, in Namdalseid ground ammunition depot
-   Kalvåa Cave Site, in Bjugn air/ground ammunition depot

Additionally the U.S. military maintained a small number of units in Southern Norway in peacetime:

-   United States European Command
    -   United States Navy
        -   Fleet Hospital Support Facility 15, in Bjugn to maintain the stored Fleet Hospital Fifteen
