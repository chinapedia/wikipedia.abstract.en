ONSEN UI is an open-source UI framework and components for HTML5 hybrid mobile app development, based on PhoneGap / Cordova.[1] It allows developers to create mobile apps using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. While it was originally based on AngularJS and supported jQuery,[2] with its version 2, Onsen UI has become JavaScript framework-agnostic, meaning developers can create mobile apps with or without any JavaScript framework.[3] Onsen UI also provides comprehensive tools and services through Monaca, both products are developed by the same company. Onsen UI was created in 2013.
