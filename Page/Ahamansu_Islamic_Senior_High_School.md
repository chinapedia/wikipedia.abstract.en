AHAMANSU ISLAMIC SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL[1]("AHISHS") is public co-educational high school located in Ahamansu, Ghana. It is the first Islamic senior high school in the Volta Region and one of three second cycle institutions in the Kadjebi District.[2]


History

Ahamansu Islamic Senior High School[3] started as private high School in 2006 by the Zongo Community with funds from donor organisations. In support of the idea, the Ahamansu Traditional Council offered large parcels of land to be used as campus for the establishment of the school.

Eric Osei became the first Headmaster of the School from 2006 to 2010. In 2010 Godfried Nyarko[4] replaced Osei as Headmaster. Nyarko advised for the necessary measures to be taken to ease the financial burdens of the school and to curtail the school's over-reliance on the National Service Scheme, Ghana for teachers.

Godfried Nyarko initiated the requisite processes with the help of staff and National Service Personnel, which eventually culminated in the absorption of the school into the public system. In 2011, officers from the Ghana Education Service Headquarters, Accra inspected the schools facilities and recommended it's absorption. The school became a public one in the year 2012. Charlotte Agboga took over from Godfried Nyarko and became the substantive Headmistress of the school.
