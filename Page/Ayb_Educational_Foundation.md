The History

In February 2006, willing to contribute to the development of Armenia and having numerous opportunities of investing their time, efforts and funds, eight friends met in Moscow and decided to establish Ayb Educational Foundation and Ayb Club. In December, Ayb Educational Foundation was officially established.[17] In the same month, Ayb’s first program - Intensive Subject Courses was launched. Within the framework of this program, Ayb’s educational methodologies were conceived and tested.

In May 2007, Ayb opened the first modern Physics lab - AybLab at the PhysMath School in Yerevan. As of today, there are eight AybLabs at five schools in four marzes in Armenia.[18] In the same year, when few people had access to internet in Armenia, Ayb made thousands of academic materials of MIT OpenCourseWare publication accessible for applicants, students and professors of 33 HEIs in Armenia, without the need to access internet.[19]

In May 2008, Ayb conducted the first pilot for the International Kangaroo Mathematics Contest in Armenia. In 2010, two other mass school contests were launched - All Armenian Tournament for Young Chemists and the Russian Bear International Contest of the Russian Language. In 2014, Ayb developed and for the first time implemented Meghu Armenian Language Contest in Armenia and Artsakh . Since 2016, Ayb Educational Foundation also organizes the national stage of one of the most popular mass school robotics contests - the Word Robot Olympiad, in Armenia.

In August 2009, a series of master classes was launched for Chemistry teachers of various Armenian schools. Later on, this program developed into master classes in various formats for various audiences.

In January 2010, in its first session of the year, the Government of the Republic of Armenia passed a decree to allocate 6.5 ha land adjacent to the Tbilisi highway in Yerevan to Ayb Educational Foundation for the implementation of the Ayb Learning Hub (Ayb School) project. In October 2011, Ayb High School was opened.[20]

In July 2013, the Central Bank of Armenia and the Ayb Educational Foundation signed a cooperation agreement on opening a school in Dilijan equipped with Ayb’s educational technologies. In September 2013, the first academic year of the Dilijan Central School started in a temporary location and construction of the main school building was launched. The building was opened in September 2015.[21]

In January 2014, collaborating with the University of Cambridge and University College London Institute of Education, Ayb Educational Foundation started a large-scale national educational initiative – the National Program for Educational Excellence (NPEE). Its main instrument – the Araratian Baccalaureate (AB), a globally competitive academic program developed by Ayb was introduced at Ayb School in September 2015.[22] In May 2016, Ayb School students took first-ever Araratian Baccalaureate exams, which are accredited by the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) as being equivalent to Cambridge A Levels.[23]

In October 2015, two fablabs (fabrication laboratories designed by MIT) were opened adjunct to the Ayb School in Yerevan and the Dilijan Central School.[24]
