It takes its name from a locality of the municipality of Mara, in the province of Sassari, where is located the cave of _Sa de Ucca of Tintirriolu_ (the mouth of the bat) in which in 1971 were observed for the first time, by Renato Loria and David H. Trump, archaeological evidence related to this culture.

It is considered the first culture in Sardinia to have used natural cavities like graves, which then formed small necropolis. The deads were buried in graves and in small artificial caves, oval and vaulted.

The people who developed this culture practiced agriculture and preferred to live near the coast. Various findings, attributable to this culture, were found even in inland areas, when these populations occupied sites that were inhabited by earlier cultures. It then spread in the plain of Oristano, not far from obsidian sources and from the ports of the coast. The houses were mostly underground, with roofs made with marsh grasses.
