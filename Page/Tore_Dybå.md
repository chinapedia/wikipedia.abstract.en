TORE DYBÅ (born 31 July 1961) is a Norwegian scientist and software engineer in the fields of information systems and computer science. He has been a Chief Scientist at SINTEF ICT since 2003.


Career

Dybå received his Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1987. In 2001 he received his Doctoral degree (PhD) in Computer and Information Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

He worked as a software engineer and consultant in Norway and Saudi Arabia from 1987 until 1994 when he moved to SINTEF. Dybå had an adjunct position at the Simula Research Laboratory from 2002 to 2009, and from 2010 until 2015 he was a Professor of Software Engineering at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo.


Research

Dybå's research is related to organizational and socio-technical aspects of software development and how software development can be improved. He has been particularly concerned with combining rigorous research with topics of importance to the software industry, including software process improvement, agile software development and management, and empirical methods for software engineering.


Awards

For the period 2001-2012, the _Journal of Systems and Software_ ranked Dybå as the top scholar worldwide in agile software development. The ranking named Dybå as the most active researchers by total articles in the period as well as the most cited researcher by total number of citations and adjusted citations.[1]

In 2014 Dybå, together with Kitchenham and Jørgensen, received the Association for Computing Machinery's ACM SIGSOFT award for the most influential paper in the last ten years for the initial paper on evidence-based software engineering.[2]

Dybå et al.’s article on evidence-based software engineering for practitioners was chosen by the editorial and advisory boards of _IEEE Software_ as one of the magazine's 25th anniversary top picks of recommended reading.[3]
