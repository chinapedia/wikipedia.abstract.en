The LEARNED COUNCIL[1] () was a political group of clerics in the 3rd Parliament, led by Hassan Modarres.[2]

According to Touraj Daryaee, it did not consider itself a party and was a group of "hardline rightists partiularly opposed to the Democrats".[3] The group opposed the policy of centralization advocated by the government, secularization of penal code, property tax, conscription and women's suffrage.[4][5]
