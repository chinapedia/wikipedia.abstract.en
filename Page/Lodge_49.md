_LODGE 49_ is an American comedy-drama television series created by Jim Gavin.[1] AMC set a straight-to-series order of 10 episodes on October 5, 2016.[2] The first season premiered on August 6, 2018.[3] The title alludes to the novella _The Crying of Lot 49_ by Thomas Pynchon, which Gavin references as an inspiration.[4][5]

On October 4, 2018, the series was renewed for a second season,[6] which is set to premiere on August 12, 2019.[7]


Plot

The series is described as modern fable set in Long Beach, California, about a disarmingly optimistic local ex-surfer, Dud (Wyatt Russell), who's drifting after the death of his father and collapse of the family pool business.

In the first season, Dud joins a fraternal order known as the Lynx and is welcomed by middle-aged plumbing salesman and "Luminous Knight" Ernie (Brent Jennings). Dud hopes the Lodge can put him on the path to recover the idyllic life he's lost.
