_CHEMISTRY_ is a collaborative EP by Nigerian rapper Falz and singer Simi. It was jointly released on October 27, 2016, by Bahd Guys Records and X3M Music.


Background and promotion

Prior to the release of the EP, it was rumored that both Falz and Simi were dating. The rumours were fueled as a result of their collaborative singles "Jamb Question" and "Soldier".[1] The promotion of the EP saw them release pre-wedding-themed photos on social media before finally announcing the release of the EP in an industry night event, where they jointly performed.[2][3]


Critical reception

Upon its release, _Chemistry_ was met with positive reviews from mainstream music critics. Chiagoziem Onyekwena of Filter Free Nigeria scored the album 80%, stating: "If the musical currency of love songs is believability, then Chemistry is an extremely rich EP".[4] Oghene Michael of 360 Nobs described the project as an "experiment of the word art".[5] Respected music critic, Joey Akan of Pulse Nigeria highlighted the marketing aspect of the project, stating that the duo "capitalized on the very sentiments of the public to create a product that can be sold for value".[6] He went on to give the EP 4 stars out of 5, describing it as "a celebration of a working relationship that people spend a lifetime trying to find and hold on to".[7]

In a mixed review, _BellaNaija_{{'}}s Adetoye Shokunbi argued that "_Chemistry_ is an album larger than itself", before he went on to notice that "Simi’s continued biting of Bollywood melodies and Falz’ predictable Yoruba-accented shtick may raise questions about authenticity and freshness".[8] Taofik Bankole of _Nigerian Entertainment Today_ was critical about the production and arrangement of the EP, describing it as "top notch" and rating it 4 out of 5 stars, stating that, "this project tells us what we already know about Falz and Simi’s music, [....], the world already knows no duo will ever have a better chemistry".[9]
