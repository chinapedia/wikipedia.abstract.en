__notoc__ The NATO-1 VISA is a non-immigrant visa which allows representatives from NATO member states, their official staff, and their immediate family members to travel to United States.[1] Recipients are normally exempt from inspection, and the visa is valid for the duration of the individual's stay in the US.[2]

Heads of state traveling to the U.S. are ineligible for this visa category, even when on official NATO business, and must apply for an A-1 visa regardless of their purpose of travel. NATO officials and their family members may not utilize the NATO-1 visa if traveling for a purpose other than official business, and must instead apply for the alternate applicable visa category.[3]
