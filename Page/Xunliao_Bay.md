The origins of the name

According to folklores, there are mainly two kinds of origins of the name Xunliao.

One is related to Su Shi, an eminent writer in the Earlier Song Dynasty (Chinese: 北宋；960–1127). Due to his against to Wang Anshi's Political Reforms (Chinese: 王安石变法；1019–1086), Su was banished to Huiyang District where he preferred traveling to Xunliao to avoid summer heat. At that time, Xunliao was named as "Yaliao" (Chinese: 鸭寮), however, Su found Daya Bay looked like the image of Bagua (Chinese: 八卦) and Xunliao just located at the direction of “Xun” (Chinese: 巽), which in Bagua represented "wind" (Chinese: 风). The “wind”echoes with the image of sea, and thus Su changed the name into “Xunliao”.[2][3]

The other dates back to A.D. 1447 when the place was originally named Shunliao (Chinese: 顺寮); nevertheless, after its suffering from a fire calamity in the history, the locals started to regard the name as an ill omen. Finally, a divination helped people decide to use the character “Xun” in Bagua to replace "Shun" (Chinese: 顺) in order to avoid bad luck. Since then this area has been named as Xunliao.[4][5]


Tourism development

Throughout history, the local people made a living on agriculture and fishery industry, which still has a space to develop though there is an increasing growth in living standards. In 1990s, however, with the attention and administration of the governments from the county, the city and the province, a tourist industry emerged, and since then, it has made a growing contribution to the local economy.
