The MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY MARCHING BAND (also known as THE MAVERICK MACHINE) is the marching band of Minnesota State University, Mankato. The band generates enthusiasm and excitement by promoting school spirit and morale.[1] The group performs at home football, hockey, and basketball events. The Maverick Machine consists of five ensembles including the marching band, drumline, color guard, pep band, and the indoor winds, the first collegiate WGI winds group in Minnesota.

The group was originally formed in the 1950s as part of the transition to NCAA Divisional Athletics. During the subsequent years, the group has formed and reformed based on participation and costs. The current band was reformed in 2014 as a result of the leadership of the current director, Michael Thursby.[2]

On average, the Maverick Machine plays at over 50 events per season, for approximately 170,000 people.[3]
