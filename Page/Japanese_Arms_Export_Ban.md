The Japanese Arms Export Ban, known as the Three Arms Exports Ban,[1] is a de facto law that governs Japanese export of military hardware outside of the country.[2]

The basis of the ban is from the THREE PRINCIPLES ON ARMS EXPORTS are three principles adopted by the National Diet of Japan in 1967, dealing with situations in which arms cannot be exported from Japan.[3]

The three principles were that arms exports were not allowed to go to:[4]

1.  Communist bloc countries
2.  Countries under arms exports embargo under United Nations Security Council resolutions
3.  Countries involved in or likely to be involved in international conflicts


History

After World War II

After the end of World War II, Japan has exported some Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck (Kyū) jeeps as part of war reparations to the Philippines[5] and to South Vietnam.[6]

Vietnam war

As it had done during the Korean War in the 1950s, during the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Japan sold a large amount of materials to US forces. In 1966, it was reported by the Xinhua News Agency that up to 92% of the napalm being used in Vietnam was manufactured in Japan, and Nippon Yushi Corporation in Aichi prefecture was suspected.[7] The company denied it was producing napalm, but the secretary-general of the plant's union stated that "almost anyone" could produce napalm using the chemicals produced by the company.[8]

The Mainichi Shimbun found no proof that napalm bombs were being produced in Japan, but in 1966, the US did ask for 4,000 Korean War-era napalm bombs at a former US Air Force base to be handed back.[9]

Increasing of restrictions

In 1976, the government of Japan announced that arms exports not restricted by the three principles would also be restrained.[10] Aside from some technology transfers to the United States Japan banned arms exports. However, after the Japan Air Self-Defense Force retired their Lockheed F-104J/DJ Starfighter aircraft 36 of them were provided to the Taiwanese Air Force.[11][12][13][14][15]

Loosening of restrictions

In April 1, 2014, the total ban on arms exports was ended by the government of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe[16][17] under the Three Principles on Arms Exports to Three Principles on Defense Equipment Transfers[18] according to the guidelines of the National Security Strategy adopted on December 17, 2013.[19]

Following this, Japan made moves to sell _Sōryū_-class submarines to Australia[20][21] and Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft to the United Kingdom,[22][23] but these attempts were not successful.

The SDF Law was amended to allow the transfer of JSDF equipment for lower prices than the current prices when the JSDF bought them before.[24]

Arms Exports

United States

Two retired MH-53E helicopters of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force were sold to the US in 2015, for their components. The US was running short of parts for its own fleet of the aging aircraft.[25][26]

On December 24, 2018, it was announced that Tokyo is seriously considering selling their F-15s to Washington in order to acquire funds to purchase F-35s.[27] Washington would consider selling the F-15s to friendly countries with weak air forces.[28]

Philippines

The JMSDF planned to lease at least five TC-90 aircraft to the Philippines to conduct maritime patrols.[29][30][31][32] From November 2016, to November 2017, six Philippine Navy pilots were trained to fly the aircraft at Tokushima Airport. Maintenance staff were also trained.[33][34][35] Two aircraft were transferred free of charge in March 2017,[36] and three more were be transferred in 2018.[37] The aircraft were ultimately donated rather than leased.[38]

The Ground Self-Defense Force retired its UH-1H helicopters in 2012. The Philippines had planned to buy 16 new Bell 412 EPI helicopters from Canada, but the deal collapsed. Canada was concerned about how the helicopters would be used.[39] In 2017, Japan offered to supply around 40,000 spare parts for UH-1H aircraft to the Philippines.[40][41] In 2018 it was announced that Japan would supply the parts to the Philippines free of charge.[42] In March 2019, it was reported that an initial delivery of parts to the Philippine Air Force was made and more parts are to arrive in August 2019.[43]

According to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, the Philippines is the first nation in the ASEAN nation to get military equipment from Japan.[44]

India

There are also efforts to sell the ShinMaywa US-2 military flying boats to India.[45][46]

New Zealand

New Zealand expressed interest in the Kawasaki C-2 aircraft and the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft.[47] New Zealand chose the P-8 Poseidon rather than the Kawasaki P-1.[48]

Thailand

In 2016, efforts to sell an air-defense radar manufactured by Mitsubishi to Thailand[49] were unsuccessful.[50]

UAE

There were attempts to sell the C-2 to the United Arab Emirates.[51][52][53]

Bor incident

South Korean soldiers in Bor were aided by JGSDF soldiers deployed to South Sudan as part of UNMISS, when ammunition supplies were exhausted during an attack from December 19/22 2013.[54] During a National Security Council meeting, they ruled that JGSDF forces should provide ammunition to their South Korean counterparts.[55] This aid was a "Contribution in Kind" scenario;[56] went unused and was returned.[57]
