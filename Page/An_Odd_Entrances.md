_AN ODD ENTRANCES_ is the eighteenth studio album by the American garage rock band Thee Oh Sees, released on 18 November 2016 by Castle Face Records. The album was recorded during the same sessions as the band's previous album, _A Weird Exits_, released three months previously.[1]

The album is the band's last with the drummer Ryan Moutinho, who left the band two days before its release,[2] and is also their last album released under the name Thee Oh Sees.


Critical reception

In a positive review for _AllMusic_, Tim Sendra praised both the album and the band's overall 2016 output. Discussing the songs, "The Poem" and "At the End, On the Stairs", he wrote, "Both these songs, and the sonic experiments that surround them, boast of just how impressively good Dwyer and Thee Oh Sees were in 2016. Packed full of confident exploration, sonic wizardry, expert guitar manipulation, and tight songcraft, this album of "leftovers" is as good as most of their contemporaries' best work."[3] Noting the band's psychedelic shift in tone, _Consequence of Sound_'s Nina Corcoran favorably compared _An Odd Entrances_ to the band's earlier work, "_An Odd Entrances_, the companion piece to _A Weird Exits_, not only expands his songwriting, but it solidifies the band’s lineup, showing Dwyer’s ability to steer Thee Oh Sees towards the other end of frenetics."[4]
