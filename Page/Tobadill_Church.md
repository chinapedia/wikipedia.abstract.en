Pfarrkirche_Tobadill.jpg TOBADILL CHURCH is a church in Tobadill, Tyrol, Austria. It is dedicated to Magnus of Füssen.

It originated as a 1705 chapel, replaced by a church designed by Kassian Grießer between 1735 and 1737. The latter was consecrated in 1751, whilst the tower was added in 1768. The church was enlarged in 1792 and a ceiling painting added the following year by Johann Georg Witwer, showing _St Magnus in Glory_ in the choir, _St Magnus defeating the dragon_ and _St Magnus healing the possessed_ in the nave and _the four evangelists_ in the side chapels.
