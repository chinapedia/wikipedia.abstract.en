MAREN ELISABETH BANG (1797–1884) was a Norwegian cookbook writer who wrote the first printed Norwegian cookbook _Huusholdnings-Bog, indrettet efter den almindelige Brug i norske Huusholdninger_ in 1831. Her early publications were anonymous but after 1842 she published in her own name. She was the most productive 19th-century Norwegian author of cookbooks and housekeeping guides.[1][2]


Biography

The daughter of Hans Arnt Poulsen (1768–1809) and Sara Elisabeth Bergström (1770–1845), she was brought up at Skansgården near Kongsvinger in south-eastern Norway. In 1817, she married Lieutenant Lauritz Christian Steen Bang who from 1829 to 1839 was imprisoned for embezzlement while working at Norges Bank in Christiania (now Oslo). While he was in prison, Maren Bang earned a living by selling meals, which she either delivered herself or sold from home. She recorded her recipes, first publishing _Huusholdnings-Bog, indrettet efter den almindelige Brug i norske Huusholdninger_ (Housekeeping Book, Prepared in Accordance with Normal Practice in Norwegian Households) in 1831, with new editions in 1834 and 1838. A selection of her recipes was published separately as _Den Norske Kokkepige_ (The Norwegian Cooking Girl) in 1835.[3]

Later publications included _Huusholdningsbog for Almuen_ Housekeeping for General Use), _Slagtebog_ (Charcuterie), _Almindelig Syltebog_ (Preservation and Pickling), _Nyttige Huusraad_ (Useful Housekeeping Tips), _Bagebog_ (Baking Book) and _Praktisk Farve-Bog for Almuen_ (Practical Methods of Dyeing).[4]

In 1849, the couple moved to Kristiansand where Lieutenant Bang ran a restaurant until his death in 1862. Thereafter, Maren Bang returned to her writing, undertaking major revisions of her earlier works while publishing _Vinbog_ (Wine Book) and _Raad og Veiledning for Landmanden_ (Advice and Guidance for Countrymen).[5]

Bang spent her later years in Kristiania where she died of gastroenteritis on 3 July 1884.[6]
