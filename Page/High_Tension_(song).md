is the 46th single by Japanese idol girl group AKB48. It was released on through You, Be Cool!/King Records.[1] This is the final single appearance of Haruka Shimazaki, who left the group shortly after the release. The single's choreography is also centered by Shimazaki.[2][3] The title song is used as the theme song of their drama _Cabasuka Gakuen_ premiered on October 30, 2016[4] and was used for one of the team battles during Produce 48's group battle stage.

The single's title is an example of Wasei-eigo and refers to a state of high excitement instead of any of the usual meanings of "tension" in English.
