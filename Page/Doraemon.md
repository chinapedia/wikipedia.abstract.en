Plot

Doraemon, a cat robot from the 22nd century, was sent by Sewashi Nobi to help Nobita Nobi, a young boy who scores poor grades and is frequently bullied by his two classmates, so that his descendants can improve their lives. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores unexpected gadgets that improve his life. He has many gadgets, which he gets from The Future Department Store, such as Bamboo-Copter, a small piece of headgear that can allow you to fly; Anywhere Door, a pink-colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob; Time Kerchief, a handkerchief that can turn an object new or old or a person young or old; Translator Tool, a cuboid jelly that can allow people to converse in any language across the universe; Designer Camera, a camera that produces dresses; and many more.

Nobita's closest friend is Shizuka Minamoto, who eventually becomes his wife in the future and has a child with him named Nobisuke Nobi (the same name as Nobita's father). Nobita is often bullied by Takeshi Goda (nicknamed "Gian"), and Suneo Honekawa, but they are shown to be friends in some of the episodes. In most episodes, a typical story consists of Nobita taking a gadget from Doraemon for his needs eventually causing more trouble than he was trying to solve. As for the movies, Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Suneo, and Gian (and sometimes Dekisugi) are often shown ready for an adventure to protect people. They are adventurous, humorous, and emotional.

Manga

Doraemon_first_appearance.jpg.]] In December 1969 the _Doraemon_ manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by Shogakukan. The magazines were aimed at children from nursery school to fourth grade. In 1977 _CoroCoro Comic_ was launched as the flagship magazine of _Doraemon._[3]

Since the debut of _Doraemon_ in 1969, the stories have been selectively collected into forty-five tankōbon volumes, which were published under Shogakukan's _Tentōmushi Comics_ imprint, from 1974 to 1996. Shogakukan published a _master works_ collection consisting of Twenty volumes between July 24, 2009 and September 25, 2012.[4][5]

In addition, Doraemon has appeared in a variety of manga series by Shōgakukan. In 2005 Shōgakukan published a series of five more manga volumes under the title _Doraemon+_ (_Doraemon Plus_), which were not found in the forty-five original volumes. On December 1, 2014, a sixth volume of _Doraemon Plus_ was published. This was the first volume in eight years.[6]

There have been two series of bilingual, Japanese and English, volumes of the manga by SHOGAKUKAN ENGLISH COMICS under the title _Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future_, and two audio versions.[7][8] The first series has ten volumes and the second six.[9]

In July 2013, Fujiko Fujio Productions announced that they would be collaborating with ebook publisher Voyager Japan and localization company AltJapan Co., Ltd. to release an English language version of the manga in full-color digitally via the Amazon Kindle platform in North America.[10] Shogakukan released the first volume in November 2013.[11] This English version incorporates a variety of changes to character names; Nobita is "Noby", Shizuka is "Sue", Suneo is "Sneech", and Gian is "Big G", while dorayaki is "Yummy Bun/Fudgy Pudgy Pie."[12] A total of 200 volumes have been released.

Shogakukan started digital distribution of all forty-five original volumes throughout Japan from July 16, 2015.[14]

Anime

Television series

After a brief animated series in 1973 by Nippon Television, _Doraemon_ remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when a newly formed animation studio, Shin-Ei Animation (now owned by TV Asahi) produced an anime series of _Doraemon._[15] This series became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,787 episodes on March 25, 2005. In Asia, this version is sometimes referred to as the Ōyama Edition, after the voice actress who voiced Doraemon in this series.[16]

Celebrating the anniversary of the franchise, a new _Doraemon_ series began airing on TV Asahi on April 15, 2005 with new voice actors and staff, and updated character designs.[17] This version is sometimes referred to in Asia as the Mizuta Edition, as Wasabi Mizuta is the voice actress for Doraemon in this series.[18]

On May 12, 2014, TV Asahi Corporation announced an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to bring the 2005 series to the Disney XD television channel in the United States beginning in the summer of that year.[19][20][21] Besides using the name changes that were used in AltJapan's English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits have also been made to make the show more relatable to an American audience, such as Japanese text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, items such as yen notes being replaced by US dollar bills, and the setting being changed from Japan to the United States.[22] Confirmed cast member of the new American adaptation include veteran anime voice actress Mona Marshall of _South Park_ fame in the title role of Doraemon and Johnny Yong Bosch of _Power Rangers_ and _Bleach_ fame as Noby. The English dub is produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment.[23] Initial response to the edited dub was positive.[24] The Disney adaptation began broadcast in Japan on Disney Channel from February 1, 2016. The broadcast offered the choice of the English voice track or a newly recorded Japanese track by the US cast.[25]

In EMEA regions, the series is licensed by LUK International.[26] The series began broadcast in the United Kingdom on August 17, 2015 on Boomerang.[27]

Feature films

In 1980, Toho released the first of a series of annual feature length animated films based on the lengthy special volumes published annually. Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a shōnen demographic, taking the familiar characters of _Doraemon_ and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the dinosaurs, the far reaches of the galaxy, the heart of darkest Africa (where they encountered a race of sentient bipedal dogs), the depths of the ocean, and a world of magic. Some of the films are based on legends such as Atlantis, and on literary works including _Journey to the West_ and _Arabian Nights._ Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.

Video games

There are a total of 63 Japanese-only video games ranging from platformer games to RPG games, which began with the Emerson's Arcadia 2001 system. Doraemon can also be seen in Namco's popular _Taiko no Tatsujin_ rhythm game series like _Taiko no Tatsujin_ (11 – 14 only), _Metcha! Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Nanatsu no Shima no Daibouken_, _Taiko no Tatsujin Wii_, _Taiko no Tatsujin Plus_, and _Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Dororon! Yokai Daikessen!!_.

Its popularity has led to controversy in both countries. In 2016, politicians and conservative activists in both India and Pakistan campaigned to ban the show from television because they claimed it "corrupts children."[52][53] In India, legal notices were served against several companies in India, targeting _Doraemon_ and _Crayon Shin-chan_, as having an adverse effect on children. In Pakistan, _Doraemon_ was targeted by the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf as having a negative impact on children, because of Nobita's constant reliance on Doraemon's gadgets to solve problems, and they attempted to ban 24 hour cartoon channels in general, because of their supposed ruining of children's minds. They also attempted to ban the Hindi dub of the series, as Pakistan's official language is Urdu.[54]

As one of the oldest, continuously running icons, Doraemon is a recognizable character in this contemporary generation. Nobita, the show's protagonist, is a break from other characters typically portrayed as special or extraordinary, and this portrayal has been seen as reasons of its appeal as well as the contrary, especially in the United States.[57] Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro considers _Doraemon_ to be "the greatest kids series ever created".[58]
