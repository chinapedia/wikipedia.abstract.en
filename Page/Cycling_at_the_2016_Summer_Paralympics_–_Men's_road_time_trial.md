The MEN'S ROAD TIME TRIAL cycling events at the 2016 SUMMER PARALYMPICS took place on September 17 at Flamengo Park, Pontal. Eleven events took place over twelve classifications. The T1-2 time trial, which took in two classifications, was a 'factored' event, with times adjusted by classification to allow fair competition.


Classification

Cyclists are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows cyclists to compete against others with a similar level of function. The class number indicates the severity of impairment with "1" being most impaired.

Cycling classes are:[1]

-   B: Blind and visually impaired cyclists use a Tandem bicycle with a sighted pilot on the front
-   H 1–4: Cyclists with an impairment that affects their legs use a handcycle
-   T 1–2: Cyclists with an impairment that affects their balance use a tricycle
-   C 1-5: Cyclists with an impairment that affects their legs, arms and/or trunk but are capable of using a standard bicycle
