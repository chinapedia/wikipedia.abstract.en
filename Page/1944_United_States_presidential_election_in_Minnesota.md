The 1944 UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN MINNESOTA took place on November 7, 1944, in Minnesota as part of the 1944 United States presidential election.

The Democratic candidate, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state over New York governor Thomas E. Dewey by a margin of 62,448 votes, or 5.55%. Nationally, Roosevelt was re-elected to an unprecedented fourth term as president, with 432 electoral votes and a comfortable 7.5% lead over Dewey in the popular vote. However, Roosevelt would not serve the entirety of his fourth term, as he died within a half-year after winning his final election.

Roosevelt was the only president of the United States who was elected to more than two quadrennial terms. The 22nd Amendment, ratified on February 27, 1951, ensures that Roosevelt will continue to hold this record indefinitely, as the said amendment prohibits any person from serving more than two and a half terms as president.
