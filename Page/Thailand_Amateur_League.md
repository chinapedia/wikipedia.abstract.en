THAILAND AMATEUR LEAGUE (Thai: ไทยแลนด์ อเมเจอร์ลีก) , commonly known as the TA, is the fifth level of Thai football organised by Thai League Co.,Ltd. It was started in 2017 by an idea from Police General Somyot Poompanmoung, the president of Football Association of Thailand for improving all Thai Amateur clubs to be better and allowing other clubs which are in other regions chances to play in a national FA tournament. In 2017, the tournament is divided into 12 regions and participated by 119 clubs which are former members Football Division 3, and debutants in the season.[1] As the tournament is considered as the lowest level of Thai football, so the number of participants is unlimited as well as any club is able to send an application to participate in the tournament. In 2016 the Football Division 3 became a trophy for the Thailand Amateur League.
