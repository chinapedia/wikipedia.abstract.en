ACROTHELOIDEA is a superfamily of Discinid brachiopods, alternatively ascribed to the lingulidsâ€”for a discussion of discinid taxonomy, see Discinida.

The story goes that there's an evolutionary transition from Eoobolus through Pustulobolus and Bostfordia to Acrotretids.[1]

Acrotheloids have an apical foramen.[2]
