DAVID MCALISTER BARRY (born July 3, 1947) is an American author and columnist who wrote a nationally syndicated humor column for the _Miami Herald_ from 1983 to 2005. He has also written numerous books of humor and parody, as well as comic novels. Barry's honors include the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary (1988) and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism (2005).

Barry has defined a sense of humor as "a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge."[1]


Early life and education

Barry was born in Armonk, New York, where his father, David, was a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and Pleasantville High School, where he was elected "Class Clown" in 1965. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Haverford College in 1969.[2]

As an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, he avoided military service during the Vietnam War by registering as a religious conscientious objector.[3] Notwithstanding his father's vocation, Barry decided "early on" that he was an atheist.[4] He said, "The problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes."[5]


Writing career

Barry began his journalism career in 1971, working as a general-assignment reporter for the _Daily Local News_ in West Chester, Pennsylvania, near his alma mater, Haverford College. He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a copy editor at the Associated Press's Philadelphia bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.[6]

At Burger, he taught effective writing to business people. In his own words, he "spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to...stop writing things like 'Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,' but...eventually realized that it was hopeless."[7] Brian_Engler-Dave_Barry_&_The_Fairfax_Prize-Close-up_9-22-2013.JPG In 1981 he wrote a humorous guest column in the _Philadelphia Inquirer_ about watching the birth of his son, which attracted the attention of Gene Weingarten, then an editor of the _Miami Herald_{{'}}s Sunday magazine _Tropic_. Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry's column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1988 for "his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns."[8]

Barry's first novel, _Big Trouble_, was published in 1999. The book was adapted into a motion picture directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and Patrick Warburton, with a cameo by Barry (deleted in post-production). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001 but was postponed following the September 11, 2001, attacks because the story involved smuggling a nuclear weapon onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.

In response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, for calling themselves the "Grand Cities", Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.[9]

Articles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as _Boating_, _Home Office Computing_, and _Reader's Digest_, in addition to the _Chicken Soup for the Soul_ inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in the _Best American Sportswriting_ series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book _Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here's How!_ (), a follow-up to Barry's role in publicizing International Talk Like a Pirate Day. His books have frequently appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List.

On October 31, 2004, Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column in order to spend more time with his family. In December 2005, Barry said in an interview with _Editor and Publisher_ that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.

In 2005, Barry won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.[10]

On Sunday, September 22, 2013, the opening night of the 15th annual Fall for the Book festival in Fairfax, Virginia, Barry was awarded the event's highest honor, the Fairfax Prize,[11][12] honoring outstanding literary achievement, presented by the Fairfax Library Foundation.


_Dave's World_ television series

From 1993 to 1997, CBS broadcast the sitcom _Dave's World_ based on the books _Dave Barry Turns 40_ and _Dave Barry's Greatest Hits_. The show starred Harry Anderson as Barry and DeLane Matthews as his wife Beth. In an early episode, Barry appeared in a cameo role. After four seasons, the program was canceled shortly after being moved from Monday to the "Friday night death slot".


Music

During college, Barry was in a band called the Federal Duck. While at the _Miami Herald_, he and several of his colleagues created a band called the Urban Professionals, with Barry on lead guitar and vocals. They performed an original song called "The Tupperware Song" at the Tupperware headquarters in Orlando, Florida.[13]

Beginning in 1992, Barry played lead guitar in the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band made up of published authors. _(Remainder_ is a publishing term for a book that doesn't sell.) The band was founded by Barry's sister-in-law, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, for an American Booksellers Association convention, and has also included Stephen King, Amy Tan, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Matt Groening, and Barry's brother Sam, among others.[14][15] The band's members "are not musically skilled, but they are extremely loud," according to Barry. Several high-profile musicians, including Al Kooper, Warren Zevon, and Roger McGuinn, have performed with the band, and Bruce Springsteen sat in at least once. The band's road tour resulted in the book _Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude_. The Rock Bottom Remainders disbanded in 2012 following Goldmark's death from breast cancer. They have reunited several times, performing at the Tucson Festival of books in 2016 and 2018.


Other activities

Beginning in 1984, Barry and _Tropic_ editors Gene Weingarten and Tom Shroder have organized the Tropic Hunt (now the Herald Hunt), an annual puzzlehunt in Miami. A Washington, D.C., spinoff, the Post Hunt, began in 2008.

Barry has run several mock campaigns for President of the United States, running on a libertarian platform. He has also written for the Libertarian Party's national newsletter.[16]

The screen adaptation of Barry's book _Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys_ was released in 2005; it is available on DVD.


Personal life

Barry married Lois Ann Shelnutt in 1969.[17] He next married Beth Lenox, in 1976. Barry and Lenox worked together at the _Daily Local News_, where they began their journalism careers on the same day in September 1971; they had one child, Robert, born October 8, 1980. Barry and Lenox divorced in 1993. Barry experienced tragedy in his family; his father David W and his youngest brother suffered alcoholism, and his father died in 1984, his sister Mary Katherine was institutionalized for schizophrenia, and his mother committed suicide in 1987.[18][19] In 1996, Barry married _Miami Herald_ sportswriter Michelle Kaufman;[20] they had a daughter, Sophie, in 2000. Barry has had dogs named Earnest, Zippy, and now Lucy. All have been mentioned regularly in Barry's columns.[21]
