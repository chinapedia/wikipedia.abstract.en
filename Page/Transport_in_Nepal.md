Road is the country's primary transport mode.

Highways

-   Total: 13,223 km

Rail

There are two railway lines in the country: the Raxaul–Sirsiya and the Jainagar–Janakpur. The former is a line from Raxaul, India to Sirsiya Inland Container Depot (or dry port) near Birganj, Nepal, and is primarily used for freight transport.[1] It allows container traffic to be imported to Nepal through the Sirsiya dry port container depot.[2] The latter is a line from Jaynagar, India to Janakpur, Nepal, and is used primarily for passenger transport.[3]

Nepal and India had agreed to construct railway line linking Raxaul with Kathmandu during Prime Minister KP Oli's visit to India.[4] A team of technical officers visited Kathmandu to study the proposed railway from Raxaul to Kathmandu and they have stated that a feasibility study of the project would begin. They have already identified Chobhar as the terminus of the 113 km-long line. [5]

A line through Kathmandu, linking India with Lhasa in Tibet, has been proposed by the K.P. Oli government. In November 2017, Chinese media reported the arrival of a delegation of Chinese railway experts in Nepal. They discussed the possibility of a rail connection between China and Nepal.[6] In August 2018, the two sides reached an agreement on construction details of the railway.[7][8]
