The ABLATIVE CASE (sometimes abbreviated ) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the grammar of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses. The word "ablative" derives from the Latin _ablatus_, the (irregular) perfect passive participle of _auferre_ "to carry away".[1] The ablative case is found in ancient languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, as well as modern languages like Turkish and Hungarian. There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as German. There was an ablative case in Ancient Greek in the early stages of the language, which quickly fell into disuse by the classical period.


Indo-European languages

Latin

The ablative case in Latin (_cāsus ablātīvus_) appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an ablative absolute clause, and adverbially. The Latin ablative case was derived[2] from three Proto-Indo-European cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at).

Greek

In Ancient Greek, there was an ablative case which was used in the Homeric, pre-Mycenaean, and Mycenean periods. It fell into desuetude during the classical period and thereafter with some of its functions taken by the genitive and others by the dative; the genitive had functions belonging to the Proto-Indo-European genitive and ablative cases.[3] The genitive case with the prepositions "away from" and "out of" is an example.

German

German does not have an ablative case (but exceptionally, Latin ablative case-forms were used from the 17th to the 19th century after some prepositions, for example after _von_ in _von dem Nomine_: ablative of the Latin loanword _Nomen_). Grammarians at that time, such as Justus Georg Schottel, Kaspar von Stieler ("der Spate"), Johann Balthasar von Antesperg and Johann Christoph Gottsched, listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for German words. They arbitrarily considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in _von dem Mann[e]_ ("from the man" or "of the man") and _mit dem Mann[e]_ ("with the man"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition as _dem Mann[e]_ to be a dative.

There is some confusion in German culture about the Latin ablative and the German dative.

Albanian

The ablative case is found in Albanian; it is the fifth case, _rasa rrjedhore_.

Sanskrit

In Sanskrit, the ablative case is the fifth case (_pañcamī_) and has a similar function to that in Latin. Sanskrit nouns in the ablative often refer to a subject "out of" which or "from" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: _pátram TARÓḤ pátati_ "the leaf falls FROM THE TREE". It is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring "because of" or "without" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. When it appears with a comparative adjective, (_śreṣṭhatamam,_ "the best"), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: "better than X".

Armenian

The modern Armenian ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from Classical Armenian. The Western Armenian affix -է _-ē_ (definite -էն _-ēn_) derives from the classical singular; the Eastern Armenian affix -ից _-ic’_ (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural. For both dialects, those affixes are singular, with the corresponding plurals being -(ն)երէ(ն) _-(n)erē(n)_ and -(ն)երից _-(n)eric’_.

+------------------+-----------------+------------------------+

The ablative case has several uses. Its principal function is to show "motion away" from a location, point in space or time:

+----------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Western                    | Eastern                     | Gloss                          |
+============================+=============================+================================+

| _k’aġak’ĒN_ yega           | _k’aġak’IC’_ yeka           |                                |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+

| _aysdeġĒN_ heṙu gě pnagēi. | _aysteġIC’_ heṙu bnakvum ēi |                                |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+

It also shows the agent when it is used with the passive voice of the verb:

| _incmē_ mišd gě sirvēir                 | _indznic’_ mišt sirvum ēir            |                                   |
+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| _ազատիչներիէն_ ազատեցանք                | _ազատիչներից_ ազատվեցինք              | We were freed _by the liberators_ |
| ''azadič’nerē| _ազատիչներիէն_ ազատեցանք | ''azatič’ne| _ազատիչներից_ ազատվեցինք |                                   |
| _azadič’nerēn_ azadec’ank’              | _azatič’neric’_ azatvec’ink’          |                                   |
+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

It is also used for comparative statements in colloquial Armenian (including infinitives and participles):

+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Western                               | Eastern                                 | Gloss                                             |

+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Մարիամ _եղբօրՄԷՆ_ պզտիկ է             | Մարո _ախպորԻՑ_ փոքր է                   | Mary is younger (lit. smaller) _than her brother_ |

Finally, it governs certain postpositions:

Uralic languages

Finnish

In Finnish, the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning "from, off, of": _pöytä – pöydältä_ "table – off from the table". It is an outer locative case, used like the adessive and allative cases, to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the elative, which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.

The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times (_kymmeneltä_ "at ten") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.

The Finnish ablative has the ending _-lta_ or _-ltä_, depending on vowel harmony.

Usage

away from a place:

-   _katolta_: off the roof
-   _pöydältä_: off the table
-   _rannalta_: from the beach
-   _maalta_: from the land
-   _mereltä_: from the sea

with the verb _lähteä_ (stop):

-   _lähteä tupakalta_: stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now, lit. 'leave from the tobacco')
-   _lähteä hippasilta_: stop playing tag (_hippa_=tag, _olla hippasilla_=playing tag)

to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something:

-   _haisee pahalta_: smells bad
-   _maistuu hyvältä_: tastes good
-   _tuntuu kamalalta_: feels awful
-   _näyttää tyhmältä_: looks stupid
-   _kuulostaa mukavalta_: sounds nice

Hungarian

The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from, as well as a concept, object, act or event originating from an object, person, location or entity. For example, one walking away from a friend who gave him a gift could say the following:

    _a barátomTÓL jövök_ (I am coming (away) from my friend).
    _a barátomTÓL kaptam egy ajándékot_ (I got a gift from my friend).

When used to describe movement away from a location, the case may only refer to movement from _the general vicnity_ of the location and not from inside of it. Thus, _a postától jövök_ would mean one had been standing _next to_ the post office before, not inside the building.

When the case is used to refer to the origin of a possible act or event, the act/event may be implied while not explicitly stated, such as _Meg foglak védeni a rablóTÓL_: I will defend you from the robber.

The application of vowel harmony gives two different suffixes: _-tól_ and _-től_. These are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively.


Turkic languages

Azerbaijani

The ablative in Azerbaijani (__) is expressed through the suffixes _-dan_ or _-dən_:

Ev – evDƏN
_House – from/off the house_

Aparmaq – aparmaqDAN
_To carry – from/off carrying_

Turkish

The ablative in Turkish (_-den hali_ or _ayrılma hali_) is expressed through the suffixes _-den_, _-dan_, _-ten_ or _-tan_:

Ev – evDEN
_House – from/off the house_

At – atTAN
_Horse – from/off the horse_

Taşımak – taşımakTAN
_To carry – from/off carrying_

Ses – sesTEN
_Sound/volume – from/off sound/volume_

In some situations simple ablative can have a "because of" meaning, in these situations ablative can be optionally followed by "dolayı" (because of) preposition.

Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. / ''I was uneasy because of high volume. ''
