_THE BIG LEBOWSKI_ () is a 1998 crime comedy stoner film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, after which The Dude learns that a millionaire (also named Jeffrey Lebowski) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; but the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, and John Turturro also appear, in supporting roles.

The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, "We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant."[1] The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.

_The Big Lebowski_ was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite,[2] noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.[3] In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[4][5] A spin-off based on John Turturro's character, titled _The Jesus Rolls_, was filmed in 2017, with Turturro also acting as writer and director.


Plot

In 1991, Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, a middle-aged bachelor with a penchant for cannabis and bowling, gets assaulted in his Los Angeles home by two goons hired by pornographer Jackie Treehorn, demanding money owed to him by the wife of another, wealthier Jeffrey Lebowski (the eponymous "Big Lebowski"). Realizing they have the wrong man, they leave, but not before one of them urinates on The Dude's rug.

The next day, The Dude tells of what happened to his friends and bowling partners, Donald "Donny" Kerabatsos and Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak. The Dude seeks compensation from the other Lebowski, a cantankerous and wheelchair-bound philanthropist. His request is refused, but The Dude takes a valuable rug from the mansion on his way out after telling Brandt, Lebowski's sycophantic assistant, that Mr. Lebowski had said he could take any rug in the house. Upon his departure, The Dude also meets Bunny, Lebowski's young trophy wife.

A few days later, The Dude is told that Bunny has been kidnapped, and Lebowski wants The Dude to deliver a briefcase containing ransom money and perhaps recognize the culprits. Later that night, another pair of thugs appear at The Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious and take his new rug.

When the kidnappers call, Walter comes along intent on giving them another briefcase (filled with Walter's "dirty undies") so that he and The Dude can keep the ransom money for themselves. When they arrive at the meeting location, Walter throws out his briefcase which is quickly intercepted by the kidnappers, who leave quickly on motorcycles. Later that night, after another game of bowling, The Dude's car is stolen with the real briefcase still inside.

Lebowski's adult daughter Maude then calls, revealing that she took the rug and asking The Dude to visit her. She plays a pornographic video for him showing Bunny to be one of Treehorn's actresses. She thinks Bunny staged her own abduction and asks The Dude to recover the ransom which her father withdrew from the family's personal foundation. Shortly thereafter, The Dude is confronted by Lebowski. Angry that The Dude failed to deliver the ransom money, he shows him a severed toe, presumed to be Bunny's. Later, three German nihilists invade The Dude's apartment and threaten him, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. Maude says the nihilists are actually Bunny's friends.

The next day, The Dude's car is found by the police, minus the briefcase. Later, while cruising in the car, The Dude finds the homework of a high school student named Larry Sellars on his seat. Walter and The Dude go to the Sellars' house that evening and repeatedly demand that Larry confess to having stolen the money, but he does not respond, so Walter uses a golf club to wreck a new sports car parked outside the house which he believes Larry bought with the money. However, the real owner of the car then rushes outside and wrecks The Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.

Shortly thereafter, The Dude is forcefully taken before Treehorn by his goons. Treehorn asks about the whereabouts of Bunny and the money she owes him. Treehorn then drugs the Dude's white Russian cocktail, causing him to have a dream about starring in a Treehorn film about bowling with Maude. He awakes in police custody where he is assaulted by the Malibu police chief. On the ride home, after being kicked out of a cab, The Dude is unknowingly passed by a sports car driven by Bunny, who is revealed to still have all of her toes. The Dude returns home, only to find his bungalow ransacked by Treehorn's goons. He is greeted by Maude, who seduces him, specifically to conceive a child; The Dude objects until Maude states that she wishes him to have no involvement in the child's upbringing. She also explains that her father has no money of his own, his wife having left everything to the family charity.

Having had an epiphany, The Dude has Walter drive him back to the Lebowski estate where they find Bunny's crashed car, but she is otherwise safe. It becomes evident to the characters that when Bunny willingly left town on an unannounced trip for a few days, her friends (the German nihilists) faked a kidnapping so they could extort money from Lebowski. When Lebowski, who hated his wife, heard of the supposed kidnapping, he withdrew the money from the foundation, kept it for himself and actually gave The Dude a briefcase containing only a couple of phone books. Walter and The Dude confront Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, and Walter throws him out of his wheelchair, thinking he is faking his paralysis.

The Dude and his friends then return to the bowling alley, assuming the ordeal is over, only to be confronted in the parking lot by the nihilists, who have set The Dude's car on fire. They once again demand the ransom money. Learning there never was any money, they try to rob them anyway, but Walter violently beats all three of them. However, during the scuffle, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.

A few days later, Walter and The Dude go to the beach to scatter Donny's ashes. Walter delivers an informal eulogy which he turns into a tribute to the Vietnam War, and accidentally covers The Dude with Donny's ashes after misjudging the wind. The Dude is initially angry with Walter, but gets over it and they go bowling. At the bowling alley, the film's cowboy narrator states that Maude is pregnant with a "little Lebowski" and expresses his hope that The Dude and Walter will win their upcoming bowling tournament.

Production

Development

The Dude is mostly inspired by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature, _Blood Simple_.[12][13] Dowd had been a member of the Seattle Seven, liked to drink White Russians, and was known as "The Dude".[14] The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC's School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that "tied the room together".[15] Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for _Blood Simple_.[16] Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them all kinds of stories from his own life, including ones about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car.[17] As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat.[18]

Exline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because "it's a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation".[19] The Coens met filmmaker John Milius, when they were in Los Angeles making _Barton Fink_ and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter.[20] John Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who would have been another source of inferences to create Jeff Bridges' character.[21] Also known as the Dude,[22] Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film _Big Wednesday_.[23]

According to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann, "who worked naked from a swing", and on Yoko Ono.[24] The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired, in part, by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988, at the Public Theater in a play called _Mi Puta Vida_ in which he played a pederast-type character, "so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with," Joel said in an interview.[25]

The film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes."[26] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, "He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain."[27]

The significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, "important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless."[28]

Screenplay

The Coen Brothers wrote _The Big Lebowski_ around the same time as _Barton Fink_. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the _Roseanne_ television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film _Wild Bill_. The Coens decided to make _Fargo_ in the meantime.[29] According to Ethan, "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in _Barton Fink_.[30] They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area.[31] When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's _The Long Goodbye_ as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that _The Big Lebowski_ "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges".[32] When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies."[33] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process.[34] In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.[35]

Pre-production

PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded _Fargo_, backed _The Big Lebowski_ with a budget of $15 million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In _The Big Lebowski_ we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role."[36] In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude."[37] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear.[38] He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own.[39] The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.[40] Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the "Gladiator" or what they called the "Chin Strap" and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.[41]

For the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music[42] and for it to be "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview.[43] For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he "came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs.[44] For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it."[45]

Cinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look.[46] Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals.[47] The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's _Pictures at an Exhibition_. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.[48]

Principal photography

Actual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks)[49] and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar.[50] According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges "was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot."[51] Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on _The Lost World: Jurassic Park_. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997[52] while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.[53]

Architecture

The scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.[54]

Deakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, "it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.[55] The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.[56]

To achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera "on something like a barbecue spit", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.[57]


Soundtrack

The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind.[58] They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ and _Inside Llewyn Davis_) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac."[59] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's "The Man in Me" (from _New Morning_).[60] However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful."[61][62] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be "Music Archivist" because he "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management".[63]

For Joel, "the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies".[64] Music defines each character. For example, "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was "Lujon" by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. "The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them", remarked Ethan in an interview.[65] The character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, a homage to the band Kraftwerk. The album cover of their record _Nagelbett_ (_bed of nails_) is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for _The Man-Machine_ and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk song and album. In the lyrics the phrase "We believe in nothing" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film.[66]


Reception

_The Big Lebowski_ received its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 1998, at the 1,300-capacity Eccles Theater. It was also screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival[67][68] before opening in North America on March 6, 1998 in 1,207 theaters. It grossed USD $5.5 million on its opening weekend, grossing US$17 million in the United States, just above its US$15 million budget. The film's worldwide gross outside of the US was $28 million, bringing its worldwide gross to $46,189,568.[69]

Many critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices.[70] Peter Howell, in his review for the _Toronto Star_, wrote: "It's hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of _Fargo_. There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps."[71] Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and in 2011 stated that "it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film."[72]

Todd McCarthy in _Variety_ magazine wrote: "One of the film's indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell's original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers."[73] _USA Today_ gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was "too passive a hero to sustain interest", but that there was "enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide".[74]

In his review for _The Washington Post_, Desson Howe praised the Coens and "their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana – but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented – the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better."[75]

Janet Maslin praised Bridges' performance in her review for _The New York Times_: "Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair."[76] Andrew Sarris, in his review for the _New York Observer_, wrote: "The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year."[77] In a five star review for _Empire Magazine_, Ian Nathan wrote: "For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana" and "In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers."[78] Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "weirdly engaging".[79] In a 2010 review, Ebert gave _The Big Lebowski_ four stars out of four and added the film to his "Great Movies" list.[80]

However, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the _Chicago Reader_: "To be sure, _The Big Lebowski_ is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it represents a moral position—and the Coens' relative styling of their figures invariably does—it's an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie."[81] Dave Kehr, in his review for the _Daily News_, criticized the film's premise as a "tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film".[82] _The Guardian_ criticized the film as "a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes."[83]

_The Big Lebowski_ holds an approval rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 7.36/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges."[84]


Legacy

Since its original release, _The Big Lebowski_ has become a cult classic.[85] Ardent fans of the film call themselves "achievers".[86][87] Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002.[88] He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other.[89] Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen _The Big Lebowski_ and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before.[90]

and Jeff Bridges at the 2011 Lebowski Fest]] An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities.[91] The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event.[92] The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.[93]

Dudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film's main character, was founded in 2005. Also known as _The Church of the Latter-Day Dude_, the organization has ordained over 220,000 "Dudeist Priests" all over the world via its website.[94]

Two species of African spider are named after the film and main character: _Anelosimus biglebowski_ and _Anelosimus dude_, both described in 2006.[95] Additionally, an extinct Permian conifer genus is named after the film in honor of its creators. The first species described within this genus in 2007 is based on 270-million-year-old plant fossils from Texas, and is called _Lebowskia grandifolia_.[96]

_Entertainment Weekly_ ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list.[97] The film was also ranked No. 34 on their list of "The Top 50 Cult Films"[98] and ranked No. 15 on the magazine's "The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83" list.[99] In addition, the magazine also ranked The Dude No. 14 in their "The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years" poll.[100] The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.[101] _The Big Lebowski_ was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of _Los Angeles Times_ writers and editors with two criteria: "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list."[102] _Empire_ magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" poll.[103] Roger Ebert added _The Big Lebowski_ to his list of "Great Movies" in March 2010.[104]

Use as social and political analysis

The film has been used as a tool for analysis on a number of issues. In September 2008, _Slate_ published an article that interpreted _The Big Lebowski_ as a political critique. The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is "a neocon", citing the film's references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War.[105]

A journal article by Brian Wall, published in the feminist journal _Camera Obscura_, uses the film to explain Karl Marx's commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism.[106]

In _That Rug Really Tied the Room Together_, first published in 2001, Joseph Natoli argues that The Dude represents a counter narrative to the post-Reaganomic entrepreneurial rush for "return on investment" on display in such films as _Jerry Maguire_ and _Forrest Gump_.[107][108][109]

It has been used as a Carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues.[110][111][112]

On January 24, 2019, Jeff Bridges posted a 5-second clip on Twitter with the statement: "Can't be living in the past, man.
