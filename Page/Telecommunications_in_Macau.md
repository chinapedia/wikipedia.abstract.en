With Macau's population (about 500,000) and its small market, only a few media options are available for the local people. Because radio signals, newspapers and magazines from Hong Kong are available in Macau, the local media are always a minority group in terms of sales and number of viewers.


Newspapers

There are eighteen newspapers (twelve in Chinese, four in Portuguese and two in English). _O Mun Yat Po_ or _Macau Daily News_) is reportedly owned by the Communist Party of China and has the largest circulation (4,000). Additionally, Chinese-language newspapers from Hong Kong are popular.

Macau has eight Chinese-language, three Portuguese-language and two English-language dailies. The _Macau Daily Times_ is Macau's only English-language newspaper edited seven days a week. _Macau Post Daily_ is published from Monday to Friday. It is owned by a local publishing company, Everbright Co. Ltd., which is locally owned.[1]


Radio

There are 250,000 radios; two twenty-hour FM radio stations, one Portuguese, one Chinese; and four AM stations. Hong Kong radio stations also are popular in Macau.

-   Radio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 2, shortwave 0 (2005)
-   Radios: 160,000 (1997)


Television

There are 70,300 television sets (1997 estimate); two television channels: one Portuguese and one Chinese. Hong Kong television networks TVB and ATV can be received and are widely watched by Macau residents.

-   Television broadcast stations: 3 (2006)

Macau also owns its very own television station called TDM. And it has 6 channels (4 of the 6 channels are the digital thematic channels).

In 1999 there were 686 telephone lines per 1,000 people. Cellular-telephone-use statistics were not available.

Following the completion of the upgrades in related software and hardware, China Unicom will be equipped with the facilities needed to provide high-speed mobile data services for users in Macau, including broadcasting and video telephony.[2]
