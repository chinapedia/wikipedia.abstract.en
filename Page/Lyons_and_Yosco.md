LYONS AND YOSCO were an American vaudeville duo consisting of Italian American musicians George Lyons and Bob Yosco. They were called in one account "the finest pair of Italian street musicians playing in the Vaudeville ranks."[1] They toured the United States from 1909 into 1923, doing a musical and comedy act.[2][3][4] The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware described their performance, saying they were "the best vocalists and instrumentalists of the street variety on the stage, proved intensely interesting, while their droll comedy kept the audience laughing much of the time."[5]

They were also successful composers of popular music, including ragtime. One of their best known works was the million-selling ragtime piece, "Spaghetti Rag" which was notably popular during the ragtime revival in the 1950s. Their compositions were recorded by performers for Victor Records and Columbia Records.[6][7]


George Lyons

George Lyons was the stage name for Dominick George Martoccio (b. 26 June 1889, New York City – d. 31 January 1958, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida).[8][9][10] In his life he was a Vaudeville performer, a composer, and a movie actor. He was described by the _Los Angeles Herald_ as "a premier harpist, playing most every kind of music, including ragtime, on his instrument."[11] Prior to his partnership with Bob Yosco, he worked in 1908 and 1909 with Eddie Parks, a singer and dancer, and when they parted he seems to have kept the basic act to use with Yosco.[12][13] He starred in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short movie, _George Lyons, The Singing Harpist_ in 1929, performing four songs.[14] He also acted in the MGM movies _Hylton and His Band_ (1937) and _In the Spotlight_ (1935).[15]


Bob Yosco

Robert Joseph Yosco, (b. 1874, Castelmezzano, Italy – d. 1942, Brooklyn, New York) was born Rocco Giuseppe Iosco.[16][17] He was a Vaudeville performer, a comedian, composer, singer and actor, and was reported by newspaper accounts to play mandolin, violin and cello. The Los Angeles Herald called his cello and mandolin playing "of high order", but was less impressed with his singing.[18] The Harrisburg Telegraph had a different opinion, saying they "took their audience by storm with their vocal duets. They were applauded several times for encores. They could sing in a real way and that is half of any act."[19]

Lawrence Yosco

Robert's brother Lawrence Yosco was also involved in music, founding the _Lawrence Yosco Manufacturing Company_ of New York, making banjos and mandolins.[20] He also toured the country as a guitar and banjo soloist.[21]


Works

Lyons_and_Yosco_in_color.jpg According to David A. Jasen, in his book _Ragtime gems: original sheet music for 25 ragtime classics_, sheet music for ragtime songs sometimes sold a million copies (the standard of today's Platinum Record for recorded music).[22] It tended not to happen as quickly as with music sales today, taking as long as 20 years for the hit "Maple Leaf Rag", but it did happen.[23]

"Spaghetti Rag" was part of a list of million-selling songs that included Scott Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag" and Charles L. Johnson's "Dill Pickles Rag".[24] "Spaghetti Rag" was covered by artists such as Vess L. Ossman (1 July 1912), Jack Fina (January 1950), Ray Anthony (March 1950), Frankie Carle (March 1950), Beatrice Kay (April 1950), Jan August (July 1950), Russ Morgan (January 1952), Big Tiny Little (1957), and Jo Ann Castle (1960).[25] It is also cited as an influence on Tom Lehrer's "The Vatican Rag", which is considered a rip-off by some critics.[26][27][28] They also composed popular songs like "I'm Coming Back to Dixie and You", which was performed by The Peerless Quartet (16 June 1914)[29] and Frank Crumit (14 April 1920).[30]
