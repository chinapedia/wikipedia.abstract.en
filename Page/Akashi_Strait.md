The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge crosses the strait. This 3.911 kilometer long suspension bridge links the city of Kobe, the capital of the Hyōgo Prefecture, on Honshu Island to Iwaya on Awaji Island, also within the Hyōgo Prefecture. Its longest span measures 1.991 kilometers.[4] After 10 years of construction it was finally opened to traffic on 5 April 1998.[5] At the time of its opening in 1998, it was the world's longest suspension bridge.[6]

The Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred beneath the Akashi Strait and struck on 17 January 1995 with magnitude 7.2.[7] The Nojima Fault is responsible for the Great Hanshin earthquake. The fault cuts across Awaji Island and a surface trace of about 10 kilometers long appeared on Awaji Island due to the earthquake.[8] The Nojima Fault is a branch of the Japan Median Tectonic Line which runs the length of the southern half of Honshu island.
