9-month ban after positive test for banned substance

On 7 February 2018, Cassie Fien accepted a nine-month ban and waived a hearing after testing positive for the banned substance Higenamine. Fien tested positive in an out-of-competition test in April 2017. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) said Higenamine was increasingly being found in dietary supplements, though often listed under different names. Fien’s ban, imposed by Athletics Australia, was backdated to 9 August 2017, and will conclude on 9 May. The ASADA said in a statement: "Ms. Fien’s sanction was reduced to nine months on the basis of her degree of fault and the fact that the supplement, ‘Liporush’, was a contaminated product."[8]


Military career

Fien is an enlisted training instructor with the RAAF.[9][10]
