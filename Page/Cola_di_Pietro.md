COLA DI PIETRO (active late 14th-century) was an Italian painter, active in the Marche and Umbria regions in a late Gothic style.

Almost no biographical information is available. He was likely born in Camerino. It is not stated if he was associated with the early 15th century painter from Camerino, Arcangelo di Cola, who painted in Tuscany and the Lazio. Frescoes attributed to Cola di Pietro are found in the churches of San Francesco and Santa Maria Maddalenain Pievebovigliana.[1]
