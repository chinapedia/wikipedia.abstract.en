The _JUDAS PRIEST TOUR_ was a concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It ran from 25 November 1969 until 20 April 1970, venturing through cities in England and Scotland.[1][2]

This tour consisted of the early original line-up of the band featuring Al Atkins (vocals), Ernie Chataway (guitar), Bruno Stapenhill (bass) and John Partridge (drums). Previous member John Perry (guitar) was killed in an automobile accident, according to Atkins, shortly after the band's formation and was subsequently replaced by Chataway.[3] This is not the same entity that would become the famous band in the ensuing years. This band would break up in mid-1970, and Atkins would join the singer-less band Freight featuring K.K. Downing and Ian Hill, changing their name soon after Atkins joined to the more familiar one known today.


Setlist

The band performed cover songs as they had no material of their own at the time. Another song, apparently from blues/folk musician Sonny Terry, was played but is not known what they performed [4]

1.  "Born to be Wild" (Steppenwolf cover)
2.  "Summertime Blues" (Eddie Cochran cover)
3.  Unknown Sonny Terry song
