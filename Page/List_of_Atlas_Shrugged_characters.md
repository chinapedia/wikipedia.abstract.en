Protagonists

Dagny Taggart

Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel. She is Vice-President in
Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother,
James Taggart. Given James' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all
the workings of the railroad.

Francisco d'Anconia

Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in _Atlas
Shrugged_, an owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining
operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny
Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed
the "climax" of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of
skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar
Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began
working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune
without the aid of his family's wealth and power. Later, Francisco
bankrupts the d'Anconia business to put it out of others' reach. His
full name is given as "Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián
d'Anconia".[1]

John Galt

John Galt is the primary male hero of _Atlas Shrugged_. He initially
appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who
often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees' cafeteria, and leads
Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart
Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in
the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true
identity.

Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer
for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a
generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but
abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an
easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by
Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed
throughout much of the novel, working a job and living by himself, where
he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his
leadership. Much of the book's third division is given to his broadcast
speech, which presents the author's philosophy of Objectivism.

Henry "Hank" Rearden

Henry (known as "Hank") Rearden is one of the central characters in
_Atlas Shrugged_. He owns the most important steel company in the United
States, and invents Rearden Metal, an alloy stronger than steel (with
similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in Philadelphia with
his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden
represents a type of self-made man or prototypical hero, and illustrates
Rand's theory of sex in so far as he accepts the traditional view of
sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to Dagny
Taggart. Rearden eventually divorces Lillian, abandons his steel mills
following a bloody assault by government-planted workers, and joins John
Galt's strike.

Eddie Willers

Edwin "Eddie" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in
Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and
grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is
completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does
not possess the creative ability of Galt's associates, but matches them
in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their
creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the
captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.

Ragnar Danneskjöld

One of Galt's first followers, and world-famous as a pirate, who seizes
relief ships sent from the United States to the People's States of
Europe. He works to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy
are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough
capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the
book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to
persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar
of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last
several years. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their
relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of
Ludlow as a retired film star. Considered a misfit by Galt's other
adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in
understanding Galt's perspective.

According to Barbara Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at
the time the book was written, there were sections written describing
Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.[2]
In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld's
name was a tribute to Victor Hugo's novel, , wherein the hero becomes
the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld. In the published book,
Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or
Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

Antagonists

James Taggart

The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important
antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of
making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny
Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in
almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and
political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This
contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire
to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will
succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a
complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive
himself in this respect.

Lillian Rearden

The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and
(secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value.
Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart
about her husband's affair with his sister. This information is used to
persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the
property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses
James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.

Dr. Floyd Ferris

Ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the State Science
Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive
achievement, and publishes a book entitled _Why Do You Think You Think?_
He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to
blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the
group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel
Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X
weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine.
When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on
Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants
from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the
heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

Dr. Robert Stadler

A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague
Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar
Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise
but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He
works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are
perverted for use by the military, including a sound-based weapon known
as Project X (Xylophone). He is killed when Cuffy Meigs (see below)
drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X, causing it to destroy
itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius. The
character was, in part, modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had
interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of
nuclear weapons.[3] To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the
epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act
for the good.

Wesley Mouch

The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly
employs in Washington, who rises to prominence and authority throughout
the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for
betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill
(which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to
one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior
position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.
Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that
eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.


Secondary characters

The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.[4]

-   HUGH AKSTON is identified as "One of the last great advocates of
    reason." He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the
    Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he
    taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He
    was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three.
    Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that
    Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must
    have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now
    works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful
    at the job. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his
    true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the
    dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on
    Aristotle.
-   JEFF ALLEN is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one
    of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she
    allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns
    the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor
    Company (Rand's extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of
    communism), as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.
-   CALVIN ATWOOD is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins
    Galt's strike.
-   MAYOR BASCOM is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of
    the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
-   DR. BLODGETT is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate
    Project X.
-   ORREN BOYLE is the head of Associated Steel, antithesis of Hank
    Rearden and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San
    Sebastián Mines. He disappears from the story after having a nervous
    breakdown following the failed 'unification' of the steel industry.
-   LAURA BRADFORD is an actress and Kip Chalmers' mistress. She is one
    of the passengers on his train, and dies in the Taggart Tunnel
    disaster.
-   BILL BRENT is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of
    Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel
    disaster.
-   CHERRYL BROOKS is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart
    after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line
    was falsely deemed his greatest success. She marries him thinking he
    is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at
    first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's
    descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the
    railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl
    puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame, but eventually admits to
    Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic
    qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying
    someone like Dagny. Shortly after making this admission, she commits
    suicide by jumping over a street guardrail to her death, unable to
    live with her worthless husband and seeing no way to escape him.
-   MILLIE BUSH was "a mean, ugly little eight-year-old" girl voted to
    receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the Marxist "family"
    committee who determined how pay was allocated at The Twentieth
    Century Motor Company. Her teeth are later knocked out by a man
    denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he
    valued.
-   EMMA CHALMERS, Kip Chalmers' mother, gains some influence after his
    death. Known as "Kip's Ma," she starts a soybean-growing project in
    Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railroad freight cars to move
    the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never
    reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also,
    the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.
-   KIP CHALMERS is a Washington man who has decided to run for election
    as Legislator from California. On the way to a campaign rally, the
    Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a
    split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His
    demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his
    train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel.
    The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction
    of the Taggart Tunnel.
-   DAN CONWAY is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango
    railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows.
    When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of
    Colorado, he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet
    life of books and fishing.
-   KEN DANAGGER owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank
    Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and
    join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade
    him otherwise.
-   QUENTIN DANIELS is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart
    to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process,
    Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself
    had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galt's Gulch.
-   SEBASTIAN D'ANCONIA was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the
    d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his
    opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the Inquisition,
    leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in
    South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a
    new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who
    had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco
    d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart.
    Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked
    each other.
-   BALPH EUBANK is called "the literary leader of the age", despite the
    fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies. He
    complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as
    peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books
    to 10,000 copies. He is a misogynist who thinks it disgusting that
    Dagny Taggart is a railroad vice-president.
-   The FISHWIFE is one of the strikers, who earns her living by
    providing the fish for Hammond's grocery market; she is described as
    having "dark, disheveled hair and large eyes", and is a writer. Galt
    says she "wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one
    deals with words, one deals with the mind." According to Barbara
    Branden in her book _The Passion of Ayn Rand_, "The Fishwife is
    Ayn's Hitchcock-like appearance in _Atlas Shrugged_."[5] So says too
    Leonard Peikoff.[6]
-   LAWRENCE HAMMOND runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few
    companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He
    eventually quits and joins the strike.
-   RICHARD HALLEY is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who
    mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph.
    Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At
    age 24, his opera _Phaethon_ was performed for the first time, to an
    audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, _Phaethon_ was
    performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest
    ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley
    retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. It is later
    revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.
-   MRS. WILLIAM HASTINGS is the widow of the chief engineer at the
    Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt
    did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to
    find Hugh Akston.
-   DR. THOMAS HENDRICKS is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new
    method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the
    American medical system was put under government control.
-   TINKY HOLLOWAY is one of the "looters" and is frequently referred to
    and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only one
    major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.
-   LEE HUNSACKER is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service
    when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a
    lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge
    Narragansett joining the strike. A failed businessman, he laments
    constantly that no-one ever gave him a chance.
-   GWEN IVES is Hank Rearden's secretary, described as being in her
    late twenties and remaining calm and professional despite the chaos
    that threatens his business. When Rearden abandons his mills and
    joins Galt's strike, she and many other employees do the same.
-   GILBERT KEITH-WORTHING is a British novelist of erstwhile fame, now
    neglected but still considered a "walking classic," and a proponent
    of the idea that freedom is an illusion. Kip Chalmers brings him
    along on the train to California, "for no reason that either of them
    could discover"; he dies in the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
-   OWEN KELLOGG is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in
    New York. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent
    men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she
    decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she
    returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his
    job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.
-   FRED KINNAN is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike
    the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his
    purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations
    of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's
    three-hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says
    what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the
    people Galt is out to destroy.
-   PAUL LARKIN is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of
    the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a
    plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with
    Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart
    that he will go along with them.
-   EUGENE LAWSON heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job
    with the government when it his bank goes bankrupt. One of the
    looter's cabal, he is a collectivist who abhors production and
    money-making.
-   MORT LIDDY is a hack composer who writes trite scores for movies and
    modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a
    primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden's friends and a
    member of the cultural elite.
-   CLIFTON LOCEY is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of
    vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.
-   PAT LOGAN is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He
    later strikes.
-   KAY LUDLOW is a beautiful actress and the wife of Ragnar
    Danneskjöld.
-   DICK MCNAMARA is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line.
    Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track
    for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously
    disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and
    settled in Galt's Gulch.
-   CUFFY MEIGS is the Director of Unification for the railroad
    business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he
    dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as "impervious
    to thought". Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally
    destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across
    the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.
-   DAVE MITCHUM is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado
    Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible
    for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.
-   CHICK MORRISON holds the position of "Morale Conditioner" in the
    government. He quits when society begins to collapse and flees to a
    stronghold in Tennessee. His fellow looters consider it unlikely
    that he will survive.
-   HORACE BUSSBY MOWEN is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and
    Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees
    nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and
    would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other
    than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce
    switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything
    with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting
    the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues
    production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative
    source.
-   MIDAS MULLIGAN is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in
    protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an
    incompetent applicant. When the order came down, he liquidated his
    entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike.
    He is the legal owner of the land where Galt's Gulch is located.
    Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed
    after a news article called him "Midas" in a derogatory fashion,
    which Mulligan took as a compliment.
-   JUDGE NARRAGANSETT is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas
    Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan
    applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he
    retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen
    editing the United States Constitution, crossing out the
    contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit
    Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.
-   BEN NEALY is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to
    replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is
    incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country.
    Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power.
    He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on
    Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it,
    because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.
-   TED NIELSEN is the head of Nielsen Motors. He eventually goes on
    strike, along with most of the other industrialist "producer" types,
    by closing his motor factory. Dagny later finds him when she visits
    Galt's Gulch for the first time.
-   BETTY POPE is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual
    affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that
    casts ridicule on her high social position.
-   DR. POTTER holds some undefined position with the State Science
    Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.
-   DR. SIMON PRITCHETT is the prestigious head of the Department of
    Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading
    philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a
    collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to
    seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that
    nothing can be understood.
-   REARDEN'S MOTHER, whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at
    his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and
    berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip
    Rearden.
-   PHILIP REARDEN is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in
    his brother's home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on
    him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.
-   DWIGHT SANDERS owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality
    airplanes, and joins the strike.
-   BERTRAM SCUDDER is an editorial writer for the magazine _The
    Future_. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never
    says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers,
    and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called _The
    Octopus_. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of
    Opportunity Bill. Scudder claims that the most important thing in
    life is "brother love" but seems to have nothing but hatred for
    those around him. He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her
    affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.
-   CLAUDE SLAGENHOP is president of political organization Friends of
    Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes
    that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for
    action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of
    Opportunity Bill.
-   GERALD AND IVY STARNES are the two surviving children of Jed
    Starnes, the founder of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
    Together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a
    communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into
    bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a pseudo-Buddhist
    ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the
    failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.
    Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to
    be loved. He committed suicide after the woman he loved married
    another man. Gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the
    employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish
    parties using company funds. Ivy, on the other hand, is described as
    a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no
    desire for wealth of her own.
-   ANDREW STOCKTON runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado.
    When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.
-   NATHANIEL "NAT" TAGGART was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental.
    He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the
    business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a
    penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in
    the country. He never earned money by force or fraud (except for
    bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight
    of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and
    successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is
    often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad
    headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to
    Francisco when she is ready to join Galt's strike. It is suspected
    that he is modeled after James Jerome Hill, builder of the Great
    Northern Railroad.
-   MR. THOMPSON is the "Head of the State" for the United States. He is
    not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He
    knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and
    back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on
    President Harry S. Truman, and that she deliberately decided not to
    call him "President of the United States" as this title has
    "honorable connotations" which the character does not deserve.
-   LESTER TUCK is the campaign manager for Kip Chalmers and one of his
    guests on the train trip to California. He dies in the Taggart
    Tunnel disaster.
-   CLEM WEATHERBY is a government representative on the board of
    directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least
    bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real
    knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is
    the least appreciated by his own bosses.
-   The WET NURSE (TONY) is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to
    watch over Rearden's mills. Though he starts out as a cynical
    follower of the looters' code, his experience at the mills
    transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He
    is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot,
    but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.
-   ELLIS WYATT is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly
    revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for
    extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil
    wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom
    he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her
    brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the
    government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him
    to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering
    note: "I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours." One
    particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it
    becomes known as "Wyatt's Torch". Later Dagny meets him in Galt's
    Gulch.
