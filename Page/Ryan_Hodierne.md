RYAN HODIERNE (born 1983) is a South African sports scientist. A biomechanist with the Sports Science Centre at Singapore Sports Institute, Hodierne is one of the unsung heroes to whom Joseph Schooling paid tribute for his 2016 Summer Olympics success, including the nutritionist Kirsty Fairbairn and high performance manager Sonya Porter.[1]

In an interview with the SIngapore newspaper _Today_, Schooling called him "the best I have seen in biomechanics". Hodierne analyzed hours of race footage of his performance against his competitors and told him only hours before the final "where he could make his swim more efficient, so he would not only lead early in the race, but also continue to stay ahead."[2][3]


Career

Hodierne is a member of the High Performance Advisory Committee to South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC).[4]

He previously worked with the South African swimmer Chad le Clos.[5]
