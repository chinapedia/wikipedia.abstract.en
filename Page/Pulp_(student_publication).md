_PULP_ is the online student publication of the University of Sydney Union and was established in 2016. As a replacement for student magazine _BULL_ that was discontinued, _Pulp_ is now the second student-run publication at the University of Sydney alongside student newspaper Honi Soit.

Described as "an online platform for student content", the publication has distinct viral social news and entertainment content ideal for social media sharing. However the website has also expanded into serious journalism and reportage in 2016.[1][2]


History

In late 2015, Honi Soit reported that student magazine BULL would be replaced by 'an online news site with more “Buzzfeed style articles”' in 2016.[3] This decision was made by the student Board of Directors who govern the University of Sydney Union after the decreased readership in 2015. It was also confirmed that the website would have “two permanent paid part time student journalists” appointed for yearly terms and that the new website would be integrated into the current University of Sydney Union website.[4]


Content

The content of _Pulp_ varies between news, feature articles and culture pieces in line with the priorities of the editors, the University of Sydney Union and the wider reader base.
