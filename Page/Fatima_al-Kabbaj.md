FATIMA AL KABBAJ was one of the few first female students to attend the University of al-Qarawiyyin. She later became the sole female member of the Moroccan Supreme Council of Religious Knowledge.[1]


Education

Fatima al-kabbaj started her education at the _a dar al faqiha_ where she learnt Quran. Then she moved to _Madrasa al-najah_ for her elementary studies. After finishing her studies, al-Kabbaj and her family realized that there were limited opportunities for higher studies. After several discussions and debates about the introduction of women to the University of al-Qarawiyyin, al-Kabbaj was admitted to the university along with 9 other female students. She stayed there for 10 years and graduated in the mid-1950s.[2]

She would later provide education in _sharia_ to the king and his family, and argued that women were often better able to engage the illiterate and poor than the state-appointed Imams.[3]

Her experience was said to "challenge assumptions about Moroccan womenâ€™s historical access to religious authority and their mobility within the male-dominated field of Islamic scholarship."[4]
