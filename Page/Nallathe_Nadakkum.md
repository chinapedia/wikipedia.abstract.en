Plot

Prakash (Saravanan) is a public prosecutor who lives with his widow mother (Bhanumathi). In the past, his father was sentenced to the death penalty for the crime he didn't commit. So Prakash became a lawyer to save innocent people.

Sengodan is accused of killing the village chief Meganathan (Saathappan Nandakumar) in the village (Mangalapuram) festival. During the first day of his trial, Sengodan claims innocence and refuses to have a lawyer. Prakash strongly believes that Sengodan is a killer. Later, Sengodan's sister Jeeva (Kaveri), who is also Prakash's lover, personally meets Prakash to prove that her brother is wrongfully accused. During the second day of his trial, Prakash tries everything to save Sengodan from the capital punishment but he fails and Sengodan is sentenced to the death penalty.

Afterwards, Prakash's mother who had a heart disease dies of heart attack. During the funeral rites, a wounded man states that Sengodan is innocent and passes away in the arms of Prakash. Prakash is now determined to save the innocent Sengodan from the hanging. He takes one-month leave and goes to Mangalapuram in order to investigate this odd affair. He comes to know that his lover Jeeva committed suicide after the verdict, and her ghost is singing the night in the village. Prakash then takes refuge at Valliammal's (Manorama) house. Valliammal's daughter Jaya (Rohini) slowly falls in love with Prakash.

Prakash starts to suspect Meganathan's brother Vikraman (Napoleon) and Meganathan's widow Ramadevi (Silk Smitha) to be the murderers. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
