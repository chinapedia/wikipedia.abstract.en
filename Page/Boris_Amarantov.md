BORIS GEORGIEVICH AMARANTOV (; September 19, 1940 — March 3, 1987) was a Soviet variety actor, actor and director. He won many international competitions and festivals.


Early life

He was born into the family of a dynastic priest.

On his sixth attempt, he enrolled at the State College of Circus and Variety Arts in Moscow. The young candidate was supported by a well-known clown-mime Leonid Yengibarov, a member of the selection committee.[1]


Career

In 1962 Boris graduated from the State College with the performance _Ke-la-la_ (backing track _Chella llà_), which was staged by Sergei Kashtelyan. With this song he performed on the _Little Blue Light_ and starred in the film _Fair Wind, 'Blue Bird'!_.[2]

In the same year Amarantov was awarded at the VIII World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki,[3] having made an impression his act _Save the World (Nuclear Worker Failed)_ a warning of the threat from escalating the Cold War. The number was based on the combination and contrast of two pieces of music of the song "Top, Тop, Stomping the Вaby" by Tamara Miansarova and composition in rockabilly style called "I Want You to Be My Baby", performed by American singer Lillian Briggs.[4]

Soon Amarantov created his own theater of pantomime where the performance _Miracles in Нis Вag_ was created, staged by Grigory Chukhray, Mark Donskoy and Amarantov. The play was a success.

Later Amarantov became a victim of the machinations of the Soviet bureaucratic machine: as a result of intrigues on the part of senior officials of the Ministry of Culture of the RSFSR, his theater closed repeatedly, and after its reestablishment, Amarantov himself was fired from it. After losing this job, he worked as a night watchman. In July 1975, he wrote a letter to the Supreme Soviet Presidium of a statement renouncing his Soviet citizenship and the requirement to give him the right to exit from the USSR to the West. He was refused in this request, was threatened and harassed.

In August 1977, he emigrated from the USSR and arrived in the United States in November. Contrary to his hopes, Amaranth's hopes of a career as an actor in the USA did not materialize. He moved to France, where he attended the school of mime Marcel Marceau and successfully worked in the Marceau's troupe ,and also successfully toured many countries of the world. He lived mainly in France.


Death

After returning to the USSR,at the beginning of perestroika and hoping to re-direct, Boris Amarantov died under mysterious circumstances on March 3, 1987. He was buried at the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery (129 section).[5]
