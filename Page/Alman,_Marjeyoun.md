ALMAN () is a village in the Marjeyoun District in South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer, the name _Alman_ is perhaps from the Arabic form of “a sign-post” or “a mountain”.[1]


History

In 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and noted that some houses were built with large stones which appeared ancient.[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A few houses built of stone on the ruins of a village; they contain about forty Metawileh. The place is situated on the edge of the cliffs above the Litany River, and is surrounded by a few gardens with figs and olives; there are five rock-cut cisterns and a birket."[3] They further noted: "The present village is built on the ruins of a former town, of which the foundations can be seen. The houses are built with great blocks of ancient appearance. On the north side there is a rock-cut tomb, with roughly-sculptured figures over the entrance: this is called _Mugharet ish Shahl_."[4]
