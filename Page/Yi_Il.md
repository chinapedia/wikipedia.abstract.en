In 1583, when Nitangjie (니탕개, 尼湯介), the Wild Jurchens rebelled against the Joseon government in Hoeryeong, Yi repelled the rebel forces. In 1586, as Nitangjie rebelled again, Yi had swept base of rebel forces as _Hoeryeong Busa_ (회령부사) and Yi became _Hambuk Byeongmajeoldosa_ (함북병마절도사) thanks to his contribution. Yi attacked Jurchen in revenge for their invasion. In the attack, Yi killed about 380 soldiers of Jurchen and burnt about 200 houses. In 1589, Yi discussed national defense in frontier with Shin Rip and Jung Eon-sin as _Jellabyeongsa_ (전라병사).

On 24 April 1592, Yi fought against Japan at the Battle of Sangju. Yi organized a unit about 800 soldiers but they were unstructured. Yi started to train with them on 25 April. They were defeated by Japan in a surprise attack. Yi had run off to Chungju and met Shin Rip. Shin Rip tried to kill Yi but Yi wasn't killed because Kim Yeo-mul stopped Shin Rip. Yi participated in Battle of Chungju with Shin Rip and he was defeated and pulled back to Pyongan Province once again. Yi contributed to recapture Pyeongyang with forces of Ming by winning Siege of Pyongyang on 8 January 1593. Later, he had trained the forces and as Hanyang was recaptured and _Hulleondogam_ (훈련도감) was founded became _Ubyeon Pododaejang_ (우변포도대장) and concentrated on training soldiers as _Jwajisa_ (좌지사). Yi settled the rebellion of Song Yu-jin as _Sunbyeonsa_ (순변사). In 1601, Yi died in Jeongpyeong while he was being transported on the suspicion of murder.[2][3]
