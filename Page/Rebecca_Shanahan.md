REBECCA SHANAHAN is a New South Wales-based artist and arts educator whose work has been exhibited at a number of art galleries across Australia and who has also written for a range of outlets. In 2006, Shanahan described herself as being "interested in photographic space, time and surface" [1] for an extensive research project funded by the Australian Research Council.[2]

Her photographic portrait 'untitled' was a finalist for the Art Gallery of New South Wales' 2004 Photographic Portrait Prize.[3] In 2015, judges for the Fremantle Arts Centre Print Award gave a high commendation to Shanahan's ode to the book I had but Could not Keep.[4]

Shanahan's writing has appeared in publications such as Art Guide Australia [5] and Mamamia.[6]

Shanahan's exhibition Homelands, which she developed with fellow artist Damian Dillon, was listed as an 'exhibition to watch' in Australian arts magazine Artlink.[7] An illustrated book of the exhibition is stored in the National Library of Australia.[8]
