A RHYME is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, exactly the same sound) in the final stressed syllables and any following syllables of two or more words. Most often, this kind of "perfect" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of lines of poems and songs.[1] More broadly, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word _rhyme_ has come to be sometimes used as a shorthand term for any brief poem, such as a rhyming couplet or nursery rhyme.


Etymology

The word derives from Old French _rime_ or _ryme_, which may be derived from Old Frankish _*rīm_, a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English _rīm_ meaning "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German _rīm_, ultimately cognate to Old Irish _rím_, Greek __ _arithmos_ "number". Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from Latin _rhythmus_, from Greek __ (_rhythmos_, rhythm).[2][3]

The spelling _rhyme_ (from original _rime_) was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin _rhythmus_.[4] The older spelling _rime_ survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of linguistics and phonology for which _rime/rhyme_ is used to refer to the nucleus and coda of a syllable. Some prefer to spell it _rime_ to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see syllable rime).


Function of rhyming words

Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example William Shakespeare often used a rhyming couplet to mark off the end of a scene in a play.


Types of rhyme

The word _rhyme_ can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a perfect rhyme. Examples are _sight_ and _flight_, _deign_ and _gain_, _madness_ and _sadness_.

Perfect rhymes

Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme, which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable.

-   SINGLE, also known as masculine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (_rhyme_, _sublime_)
-   DOUBLE, also known as feminine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (_picky_, _tricky_)
-   DACTYLIC: a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (_cacophonies_, _Aristophanes_)

General rhymes

In the general sense, _general rhyme_ can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

-   SYLLABIC: a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (_cleaver_, _silver_, or _pitter_, _patter_; the final syllable of the words _bottle_ and _fiddle_ is , a liquid consonant.)
-   IMPERFECT (OR NEAR): a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (_wing_, _caring_)
-   WEAK (OR UNACCENTED): a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (_hammer_, _carpenter_)
-   SEMIRHYME: a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (_bend_, _ending_)
-   FORCED (OR OBLIQUE): a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (_green_, _fiend_; _one_, _thumb_)
-   ASSONANCE: matching vowels. (_shAke_, _hAte_) Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
-   CONSONANCE: matching consonants. (_RaBieS, RoBBerS_)
-   HALF RHYME (or SLANT RHYME): matching final consonants. (''Roxie', _LEXIE_)
-   PARARHYME: all consonants match. (_tell_, _tall_)
-   ALLITERATION (or HEAD RHYME): matching initial consonants. (_SHip_, _SHort_)

Identical rhymes

Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, _rime riche_ in French poetry.

Though homophones and homonyms satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.

If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.[5][6] An example of such a _super-rhyme_ or "more than perfect rhyme" is the _identical rhyme_, in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in _gun_ and _begun_. Punning rhymes, such as _bare_ and _bear_ are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, it is called a _holorhyme_ ("For I scream/For ice cream").

In poetics these would be considered _identity_, rather than rhyme.

Eye rhyme

Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently.[7] Examples in English are _cough_, _bough_, and _love_, _move_.

Some early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.

Mind rhyme

Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to rhyming slang, but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour,” a mind rhyme has occurred.

Classification by position

Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:

-   TAIL RHYME (also called END RHYME or RIME COUÉE) is a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind).
-   INTERNAL RHYME occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line, or within a different line.
-   OFF-CENTERED RHYME is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line. This is sometimes called a misplaced-rhyme scheme or a spoken word rhyme style.
-   HOLORIME, mentioned above, occurs when two entire lines have the same sound.
-   BROKEN RHYME is a type of enjambement producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line.
-   CROSS RHYME matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following (or preceding) line.[8]

A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.


History

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes.

The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese Shi Jing (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the Bible.[9] Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme,[10] but rhyme was used very occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem _Cui dono lepidum novum libellum_.[11] The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in _The Wasps_ by Aristophanes are noted by a translator.[12]

Rhyme is central to classical Arabic poetry tracing back to its 6th century pre-Islamic roots. According to some archaic sources, Irish literature introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim.[13] In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. The leonine verse is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.

Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain).[14] Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.[15]

Since dialects vary and languages change over time, lines that rhyme in a given register or era may not rhyme in another, and it may not be clear whether one should pronounce the words so that they rhyme. An example is this couplet from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus:

    Rejoice, O Judah, and in songs divine
    With cherubim and seraphim harmonious join.[16]


Rhyme in various languages

Celtic languages

    _For Welsh, see cynghanedd_

Rhyming in the Celtic Languages takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, "for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one."[17] In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song _Bríd Óg Ní Mháille_:

Here the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.

Chinese

Besides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, Chinese rhymes often include tone quality (that is, tonal contour) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.

Use of rhyme in Classical Chinese poetry typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.

Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese, such as Middle Chinese.

English

Old English poetry is mostly alliterative verse. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is The Rhyming Poem.

As stress is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.[18]

Some words in English, such as "orange" and "silver", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with lesser-known words like "Blorenge" – a hill in Wales – or the surname Gorringe), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a synonym ("orange" could become "amber", while "silver" could become a combination of "bright and argent").A skilled orator might be able to tweak the pronunciation of certain words to facilitate a stronger rhyme (for example, pronouncing 'orange' as 'oringe' to rhyme with 'door hinge')

One view of rhyme in English is from John Milton's preface to _Paradise Lost_:

A more tempered view is taken by W. H. Auden in The Dyer's Hand:

Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of doggerel.

French

In French poetry, unlike in English, it is common to have _identical rhymes_, in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, _flour_ and _flower_, would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones _doigt_ ("finger") and _doit_ ("must") or _point_ ("point") and _point_ ("not") is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories of "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "rime riche" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme "tu" with "vu" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

_Holorime_ is an extreme example of _rime richissime_ spanning an entire verse. Alphonse Allais was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Marc Monnier:

Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. They are encountered in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century.

The most important "silent" letter is the "mute e". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "double rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "single rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate single and double alexandrine couplets.

The now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that "pont" rhymed with "vont" but not with "long"; but spelling and pronunciation did not coincide exactly—"pont" also rhymed with "rond". There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:

-   The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants is lost in the final position. Therefore, "d" and "t" (both pronounced /t/) rhyme. So too with "g" and "c" (both /k/), "p" and "b" (both /p/), and "s", "x" and "z" (all /z/). Rhymes ending in /z/ are called "plural rhymes" because most plural nouns and adjectives end in "s" or "x".
-   Nasal vowels rhyme whether they are spelled with "m" or "n". ("Essaim" rhymes with "sain" but not with "saint")
-   If a word ends in a stop followed by "s", the stop is silent (therefore "temps" rhymes with "dents"). In the archaic orthography some of these silent stops are omitted from the spelling as well (e.g. "dens" for "dents").

German

Because German phonology features a wide array of vowel sounds, certain imperfect rhymes are widely admitted in German poetry. These include rhyming "e" with "ä" and "ö", rhyming "i" with "ü", rhyming "ei" with "eu" (spelled "äu" in some words) and rhyming a long vowel with its short counterpart.

Some examples of imperfect rhymes (all from Friedrich Schiller's "An die Freude"):

-   Deine Zauber binden wIEDER / Alle Menschen werden BrÜDER
-   Freude trinken alle WESEN / Alle Guten, alle BÖSEN
-   Einen Freund, geprüft im TOD; / und der Cherub steht vor GOTT.

Greek

    _See Homoioteleuton_

Ancient Greek poetry is strictly metrical. Rhyme is used, if at all, only as an occasional rhetorical flourish.

The first Greek to write rhyming poetry was the fourteenth-century Cretan Stephanos Sachlikis. Rhyme is now a common fixture of Greek poetry.

Hebrew

Ancient Hebrew rarely employed rhyme, e.g. in Exodus 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe.[19]

Latin

In Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton and alliteration were frequently used devices.

Tail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by Cicero:

But tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of Latin poetry until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early Middle Ages. This is the Latin hymn _Dies Irae_:

Medieval poetry may mix Latin and vernacular languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed macaronic.

Portuguese

Portuguese classifies rhymes in the following manner:

-   RIMA POBRE (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same grammatical category (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (_-ão_, _-ar_);
-   RIMA RICA (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
-   RIMA PRECIOSA (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different morphology, for example _estrela_ (star) with _vê-la_ (to see her);
-   RIMA ESDRÚXULA (odd rhyme): rhyme between proparoxytonic words (example: _ânimo_, "animus", and _unânimo_, "unanimous").

Russian

Rhyme was introduced into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Two words ending in an accented vowel are only considered to rhyme if they share a preceding consonant. Vowel pairs rhyme—even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. As in French, formal poetry traditionally alternates between masculine and feminine rhymes.

Early 18th-century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.[20]

Polish

In Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although sometimes it was sometimes imitated form Latin. Homer's, Virgil's and even Milton's epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators.[21] Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others ottava rima (ABABABCC) and sonnet (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).

The metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the Polish alexandrine (tridecasyllable, in Polish "trzynastozgłoskowiec"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].

Arabic

Rhymes were widely spread in the Arabian peninsula around the 6th century, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas.[22] In addition, the Koran uses a form of rhymed prose named saj'.

Sanskrit

Patterns of rich rhyme (_prāsa_) play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the _pada_ (metrical foot): _ādiprāsa_ (first syllable), _dvitīyākṣara prāsa_ (second syllable), _antyaprāsa_ (final syllable) etc.

Tamil

There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called _etukai_ (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.

The other rhyme and related patterns are called _mōnai_ (alliteration), _toṭai_ (epiphora) and _iraṭṭai kiḷavi_ (parallelism).

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as _veṇpā_, have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar.

Vietnamese

Rhymes are used in Vietnamese to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

NGHÈO như con MÈO
/ŊƐU ɲɯ kɔn MƐU/
"Poor as a cat"

Compare the above Vietnamese example, which is a _rhyming_ simile, to the English phrase "(as) poor as a church mouse", which is only a _semantic_ simile.[23]
