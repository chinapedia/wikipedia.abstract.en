In algebra, given a commutative ring _R_, the GRADED-SYMMETRIC ALGEBRA of a graded _R_-module _M_ is the quotient of the tensor algebra of _M_ by the ideal _I_; here the ideal _I_ is generated by elements of the form:

-   xy − ( − 1)^(|x||y|)yx
-   x² when |_x_| is odd

for homogeneous elements _x_, _y_ in _M_ of degree |_x_|, |_y_|. By construction, a graded-symmetric algebra is graded-commutative; i.e., xy = ( − 1)^(|x||y|)yx and is universal for this.

In spite of the name, the notion is a common generalization of a symmetric algebra and an exterior algebra: indeed, if _V_ is a (non-graded) _R_-module, then the graded-symmetric algebra of _V_ with trivial grading is the usual symmetric algebra of _V_. Similarly, the graded-symmetric algebra of the graded module with _V_ in degree one and zero elsewhere is the exterior algebra of _V_.
