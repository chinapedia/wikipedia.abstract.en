The VASLUI TROLLEYBUS SYSTEM is a small one route trolleybus network in the Romanian city of Vaslui.

The network opened on 1 July 1994. It was operated by a fleet of five Rocar trolleybuses. It closed on 7 July 2009. Construction on a depot commenced, but was never finished with buses being serviced on the street.[1][2]

In August 2016 the 6.5 kilometre line reopened with the help of a European Union grant. Three Graf & Stift trolleybuses were purchased from Salzburg.[3]
