KRISWONTWO is a Danish producer from Copenhagen.[1]

Georgia Anne Muldrow said the following about the Scandinavian producer: "Kriswontwo is gifted with the ability to trust and fully follow through on his instinct; He polishes up his work with great attention to detail but he doesn't sacrifice the rawness of his original idea. It takes a whole lot of talent and discipline to be able to make that initial kneejerk reaction the centerpiece of such an elegant sound." [2]

In 2016 a youtube video surfaced showing Yasiin Bey (fka. Mos Def) working on lyrics to a beat by Kriswontwo. [3]

In 2017 Dr. Dre played "Flawless (feat. Phat Kat)" from Kriswontwo's second album "Back To One" on his radio show, The Pharmacy. [4]
