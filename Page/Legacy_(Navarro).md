"LEGACY" is an oboe concerto composed by Óscar Navarro in 2015. The oboist Ramón Ortega Quero commissioned the piece in 2013 after hearing and enjoying Navarro's _Segundo concierto para clarinete y orquesta_.[1] It was premiered on 17 April 2015 in Herford with the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie under Manuel Gómez López.[2] The same week they toured North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, giving five additional concerts in Bad Salzuflen, Minden, Detmold, Paderborn y Gütersloh.[3] The Spanish premiere was to take place on 30 October 2015 in La Nucía (Alicante), with the Orquesta Sinfónica de la Región de Murcia (Murcia Symphony Orchestra) under Francisco Maestre,[4] and on the following day on Teulada, but both were suspended.[5]

"Legacy", the concert's title, refers to the legacy of every single composer to the oboe repertoire through the ages. According to Navarro, "With this concert, I want to leave my mark or legacy, with a view to the present and future".[6]
