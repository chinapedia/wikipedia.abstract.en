PAOLO FERABOLI (born September 20, 1976) is the founder and current Director of the Automobili Lamborghini Advanced Composite Structures Laboratory (ACSL), and founder and CEO of Gemini Composites, LLC in Seattle, Washington.


Life

Dr. Feraboli was born and grew up in Bologna, Italy. He graduated in mechanical engineering at the University of Bologna in 2002 with a Master's thesis on turbulent heat transfer.[1] He received his doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2005 with a dissertation on impact of carbon fiber composite structures under the guidance of Professor Keith T. Kedward. Among his mentors during his doctoral studies were composite pioneers such as John Halpin of Air Force Research Laboratory,[2] and Larry Ilcewicz of the Federal Aviation Administration.[3][4]


Career

In 2001-2002, Dr. Feraboli was an intern at the Esperienza Compositi at Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. R&D headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, under the supervision of Attilio Masini, the head of the composite division since 1985.[5][6] While at Lamborghini, he worked on the Murciélago and Murciélago Roadster carbon fiber components in the body and chassis.[7][8][9]

In 2004-2005, during his doctoral study, he was a visiting researcher at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia in the Mechanics and Durability branch, where he continued his research on impact damage.[10]

Between 2005 and 2013, Dr. Feraboli was a Professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at the University of Washington. During this period, he founded and inaugurated the Lamborghini Lab on the UW campus. He also worked in the Boeing 787 Technology Integration team as the liaison with the Structural Methods and Allowables group,[11] where he focused on certification strategies for carbon fiber composites.[12]

While at UW, Dr. Feraboli began work on chopped carbon fiber composite material forms under Boeing and FAA sponsorship.[13] This work led to the development of the Forged Composite technology, which he worked with Callaway Golf and Lamborghini to launch at the 2010 Paris Auto Show on the Diablo Octane driver and Sesto Elemento supercar. In 2012, Dr. Feraboli started his own company called Gemini Composites to bring Forged Composite technology to other customers and markets.

Since May 2013, Dr. Feraboli is a Research Professor at the Nagoya Institute of Technology in Japan.[14]

In January 2014, Dr. Feraboli left the University of Washington, and with him the Lamborghini Lab. The lab was reestablished as a stand-alone organization, still in Seattle, and co-located with Gemini Composites.[15]


Awards

-   In 2004, Dr. Feraboli received the Ph.D. Research Scholarship Award from the American Society of Composites for "outstanding composite materials research by a Ph.D. student"[16]
-   In 2008, he received the Hayashi Memorial International Award of the Japan Society for Composite Materials.[17]
-   In 2009, he received the MIL-HDBK-17 (now CMH-17) Appreciation Award by the Federal Aviation Administration for his contribution in the creation and leadership of the crashworthiness working group.[18]
-   In 2010, he received the Elsevier Young Composites Researcher Award of the American Society for Composites.[19]
