ISAIAH 50 is the fiftieth chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 40-55 are known as "Deutero-Isaiah" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter includes the third of the songs of the "Suffering Servant".

Verse 3

    _I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering._[2]

Similarly in :

    _The sun became black as sackcloth of hair._


Third servant song

The servant songs were first identified by Bernhard Duhm in his 1892 Commentary on Isaiah. The songs are four poems taken from the Book of Isaiah written about a certain "servant of YHWH". God calls the servant to lead the nations, but the servant is horribly repressed. In the end, he is rewarded. Those four poems are:

1.  2.  3.  4.  Isaiah 52-53

The third of the "servant songs" begins at Isaiah 50:4, continuing through 50:11. The Jerusalem Bible divides it into two sections:

-   Isaiah 50:4-9: The servant speaks
-   Isaiah 50:10-11: Exhortation to follow the servant.[3]

This song has a darker yet more confident tone than the others. Although the song gives a first-person description of how the Servant was beaten and abused, here the Servant is described both as teacher and learner who follows the path God places him on without pulling back. Echoing the words of the first song, "a bruised reed he will not break",[4] he sustains the weary with a word. His vindication is left in God's hands.[5]
