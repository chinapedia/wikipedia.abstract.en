COALITION OF DOMESTIC ELECTION OBSERVERS (CODEO) is an independent and non-partisan organisation made up of civil society groups, faith-based organizations and professional organisations which observe elections in Ghana.[1]

It was established in 2000 by the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) to assist Ghanaians to engage in country's electoral processes and to assist the Electoral Commission of Ghana.[2][3][4]
