He began the policy of licensing drivers as a way to ensure people were fit to drive, ended all double parking downtown and passed laws limiting how long people could park uptown. Redd also fought to collect back taxes owed the city as a way to increase the city budget.

Redd is also remembered for the special census he implemented in 1928 to study the growth of the city and the ensure an accurate population count. The census was successful in that it showed 22,000 more people than what had been reported on the 1927 census. After the census Charlotte became the largest city in the state, surpassing Winston Salem.[2][3]
