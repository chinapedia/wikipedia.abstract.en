Plot

Samuel (Shaam) is a police officer investigating the crimes of serial child abuse and murder. He receives a phone call from a child abuser who calls himself "Joker". Samuel tracks his location, goes to his place, and is killed by the Joker.

The cases are picked up by Officer Andrews Eappan (Arya), from the Crime Investigation Department (CBCID). The story then shifts to Sarah David (Anikha), a 10-year-old girl whose hero is her father David Nainan (Mammootty), a well known builder.

One day when he returns home from his office, he finds Sarah lying unconscious after being brutally raped. Shattered, he takes her to the hospital where his wife, Dr. Michelle David (Sneha), works. After recovering, Sarah reveals that it was Joker who attacked her. An enraged David and Michelle decide to find and kill him to protect other girls.

Nainan starts his own investigation independent of the police, causing Eapen to become suspicious. He discovers that Nainan's daughter was one of the Joker's victims, and aggressively questions her at home while he is away. Nainan warns Eapan off for upsetting his daughter. Both of them start receiving calls from the Joker, and compete as to who will find and get to the Joker first. The Joker attacks Eapan and Nainan who manages to overpower and kill him.

After, when Eapan asks Nainan who the Joker was, Nainan tells him that it was James, who was working in his office. Eapan admits to having wanted to kill Joker too.
