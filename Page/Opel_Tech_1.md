OPEL TECH-1 CONCEPT is a research vehicle and concept car of General Motors' German subsidiary Opel. It was exhibited on 1981 International Motor Show Germany (IAA) in Frankfurt. It is based on the 1979 Opel Kadett 4th generation "D" and its GM-T platform, called "_T-Car",_[1] designed by Erhard Schnell.


Body

The design targeted a peak of aerodynamics, and reached the drag coefficient of 0.235 _c__(w), not least caused by the panoramic windshield. The face was a precessor of the 1986 Opel Omega, which is successor of Opel Rekord E. The hubcap design came in mass production.[2][3]


Interior

All controls are push buttons. Only steering wheel, gear lever and foot controls were conventional.
