In commutative algebra, a REES DECOMPOSITION is a way of writing a ring in terms of polynomial subrings. They were introduced by .


Definition

Suppose that a ring _R_ is a quotient of a polynomial ring _k_[_x_₁,...] over a field by some homogeneous ideal. A Rees decomposition of _R_ is a representation of _R_ as a direct sum (of vector spaces)

    R = ⨁_(α)η_(α)k[θ₁, …, θ_(f_(α))]

where each _η__(_α_) is a homogeneous element and the _d_ elements _θ__(_i_) are a homogeneous system of parameters for _R_ and _η__(_α_)_k_[_θ__(_f__(_α_)+1),...,_θ__(_d_)] ⊆ _k_[_θ_₁, _θ__(_f__(_α_))].
