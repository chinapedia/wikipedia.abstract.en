And from the very land where Mahadev had tapped his foot sprang an incessant stream of water. It is said that in the Treta Yuga, Bhimsen – the brother of Ravan, the powerful king of Lanka – used to fetch water from Shankhamul, and carry it up to the Koteshwor Temple to offer it to Lord Shiva. Inside the temple periphery, there is also another Shiva Lingam, popular by the name of Khileshwar Mahadev.[1]

Legends have it that she had been transported from Bhaktapur and resettled in Koteshwor via elaborated Vedic tantras and mantras. Next, there is a temple of Saptarishi, one of those very few in Kathmandu. As a result, hundreds of devotees gather around the temple on Rishi Panchami day every year.
