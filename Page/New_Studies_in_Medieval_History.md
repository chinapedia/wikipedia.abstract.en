NEW STUDIES IN MEDIEVAL HISTORY was a series of undergraduate level books on medieval history published by Macmillan between 1973[1] and the mid-1990s.

French and Italian history notably featured in the list of volumes with Chris Wickham's _Early Mediaeval Italy_ (1981), Edward James's _The Origins of France_ (1982), and Roger Collins's _Early Medieval Spain_ (1983) forming a trilogy that was described by Paul Fouracre in _Teaching History_ in 1986 as being "required reading for undergraduates studying the early middle ages".[2] Margaret Gibson, in _The English Historical Review_ in 1988, described the series as having a "reputation for thorough, reliable scholarship".[3]
