ALEXANDER AETOLUS (, _Ἀléxandros ὁ Aἰtōlós_) was a Greek poet and grammarian, the only known representative of Aetolian poetry.[1]


Life

Alexander was the son of Satyrus and Stratocleia, and was a native of Pleuron in Aetolia, although he spent the greater part of his life at Alexandria, where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the Tragic Pleiad.[2][3][4][5]

Alexander flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant. He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.[6]

Notwithstanding the distinction Alexander enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi. Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the _Fisherman_,[7] _Kirka_ or _Krika_,[8] which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and _Helena_,[9] Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.[10][11][12][13][14] His Cynaedi, or _Ionic poems_ (), are mentioned by Strabo[15] and Athenaeus.[16] Some anapaestic verses in praise of Euripides are preserved in Gellius.[17]
