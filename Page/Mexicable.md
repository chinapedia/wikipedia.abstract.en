MEXICABLE is a project by the government of the State of Mexico to build a cable car service as part of a wider public transport system.

The first part of this project was inaugurated on October 4, 2016, in the city of Ecatepec de Morelos. The system, with a length of , runs between San Andrés de la Cañada (in the Sierra of Guadalupe) and Vía Morelos (in Ecatepec), through five intermediate stations.[1][2] It reduces traveling times between those points to 17 minutes, down from the hourlong commutes between the same points using ground transportation.[3][4]

_The New York Times_ reported that the Mexicable Ecatepec has brought some urban renewal to the areas served by Mexicable stations. Streetlights were installed, roads were paved, and about 50 murals were commissioned along the route.[6]
