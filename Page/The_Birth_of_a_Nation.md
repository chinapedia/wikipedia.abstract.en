_THE BIRTH OF A NATION_ (originally called _THE CLANSMAN_)[1] is an American silent epic drama film directed and co-produced by D. W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish. The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play _The Clansman_, by Thomas Dixon Jr. Griffith co-wrote the screenplay with Frank E. Woods, and co-produced the film with Harry Aitken. It was released on February 8, 1915.

_The Birth of a Nation_ is a landmark of film history.[2][3] It was the first 12-reel film ever made and, at three hours, also the longest up to that point.[4] Its plot, part fiction and part history, chronicling the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth and the relationship of two families in the Civil War and Reconstruction eras over the course of several years—the pro-Union (Northern) Stonemans and the pro-Confederacy (Southern) Camerons—was by far the most complex of any movie made up to that date. It was originally presented in two parts separated by another movie innovation, an intermission, and it was the first to have a musical score for an orchestra. It pioneered close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras (another first) made to look like thousands.[5] It came with a 13-page "Souvenir Program".[6] It was the first American motion picture to be screened in the White House, viewed there by President Woodrow Wilson.

The film was controversial even before its release and has remained so ever since; it has been called "the most controversial film ever made in the United States".[7] Lincoln, who Dixon saw as a Southerner,[8] was portrayed positively, unusual in a "Lost Cause" environment. But it portrayed black men (many played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women. It presented the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) as a heroic force.[9][10] There were widespread black protests against _The Birth of a Nation_, such as in Boston, while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to see the film.[11] The NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film.[12] Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce _Intolerance_ the following year.[13]

It was a huge commercial success and became highly influential. The film's release has also been acknowledged as an inspiration for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan only months later. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.


Plot

The film consists of two parts of similar length. The first part closes with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, after which there is an intermission. At the New York premiere, Dixon spoke on stage between the parts, reminding the audience that the dramatic version of _The Clansman_ appeared in that venue nine years previously. "Mr. Dixon also observed that he would have allowed none but the son of a Confederate soldier to direct the film version of _The Clansman._"[14]

Part 1: Civil War of United States

assassinates President Abraham Lincoln as portrayed in the film.]] The film follows two juxtaposed families. One is the Northern Stonemans: abolitionist U.S. Representative Austin Stoneman (based on the Reconstruction-era Representative Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania),[15][16] his daughter, and two sons. The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their three sons and two daughters. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, during the brothers' visit to the Cameron estate in South Carolina, representing the Old South. Meanwhile, young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War arrives, the young men of both families enlist in their respective armies. The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in combat. Meanwhile, the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia, after an attack on the Cameron home. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the Siege of Petersburg, earning the nickname of "the Little Colonel", but he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union hospital in Washington, D.C.

During his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see Abraham Lincoln, and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theatre, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and other Radical Republicans are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the Reconstruction Era.[17]

Part 2: Reconstruction

Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a psychopathic mulatto,[18] head to South Carolina to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on fried chicken. by white actor Walter Long.]]

Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.

Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing mixed-race marriages. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's Klan regalia, now considered a crime punishable by death. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them. An intertitle states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright."[19]

Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room. At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.

The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of Jesus Christ. The penultimate title is: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."

Production

The birth of _The Birth_

It is little known, but there was an uncompleted, lost 1911 version, titled _The Clansman_. It used Kinemacolor and a new sound process, and one reason for this version's failure is the unwillingness of theater owners to purchase the equipment to show it. Director was William F. Haddock; producer was George Brennan. Some scenes were filmed on the porches and lawns of Homewood Plantation, in Natchez, Mississippi.[20] 1 reels were completed.[21]

Kinemacolor received a settlement from the producers of _Birth_ when they proved that they had an earlier right to film the work.[22]

The footage was shown to the trade in an attempt to arouse interest. Early movie critic Frank E. Woods attended; Griffiths always credited Woods with bringing _The Clansman_ to his attention.[23]

Development

After the failure of the Kinemacolor project, in which Dixon was willing to invest his own money,[24] he began visiting other studios to see if they were interested.[25] In late 1913, Dixon met the film producer Harry Aitken, who was interested in making a film out of _The Clansman_, and through Aitken, Dixon met Griffith.[26] Like Dixon, Griffith was a Southerner, a fact that Dixon points out;[27] Griffith's father served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army and, like Dixon, viewed Reconstruction negatively. Griffith believed that a passage from _The Clansman_ where Klansmen ride "to the rescue of persecuted white Southerners" could be adapted into a great cinematic sequence.[28]

_Birth of a Nation_ "follows _The Clansman_ [the play] nearly scene by scene".[29] While some sources also credit _The Leopard's Spots_ as source material, Russell Merritt attributes this to "the original 1915 playbills and program for _Birth_ which, eager to flaunt the film's literary pedigree, cited both _The Clansman_ and _The Leopard's Spots_ as sources."[30] According to Karen Crowe, "[t]here is not a single event, word, character, or circumstance taken from _The Leopard's Spots_.... Any likenesses between the film and _The Leopard's Spots_ occur because some similar scenes, circumstances, and characters appear in both books."[31]

Griffith agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the rights to his play _The Clansman_. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received [up to 2007] for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.[32] The American historian John Hope Franklin suggested that many aspects of the script for _The Birth of a Nation_ appeared to reflect Dixon's concerns more than Griffith's, as Dixon had an obsession in his novels of describing in loving detail the lynchings of black men, which did not reflect Griffith's interests.[33]

Filming

and others.]]

Griffith began filming in July 1914 and was finished by October 1914.[34] D. W. Griffith took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor. West Point engineers provided technical advice on the American Civil War battle scenes, providing Griffith with the artillery used in the film.[35]

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000[36] (equivalent to $ in ) but rose to over $100,000[37] (equivalent to $ in )

Score

Although _The Birth of a Nation_ is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary.[38] Though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical cue sheets, or less commonly, full scores (usually for organ or piano accompaniment) along with each print of a film.[39]

For _The Birth of a Nation_, composer Joseph Carl Breil created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music.[40] Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at Clune's Auditorium; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the Liberty Theatre, and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast.[41][42]

Outside of original compositions, Breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from _Der Freischütz_ by Carl Maria von Weber, _Leichte Kavallerie_ by Franz von Suppé, Symphony No. 6 by Ludwig van Beethoven, and "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner, the latter used as a leitmotif during the ride of the KKK.[43] Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many Southern melodies; among these songs were "Maryland, My Maryland", "Dixie",[44] "Old Folks at Home", "The Star-Spangled Banner", "America the Beautiful", "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", "Auld Lang Syne", and "Where Did You Get That Hat?".[45][46] DJ Spooky has called Breil's score, with its mix of Dixieland songs, classical music and "vernacular heartland music" "an early, pivotal accomplishment in remix culture." He has also cited Breil's use of music by Richard Wagner as influential on subsequent Hollywood films, including _Star Wars_ (1977) and _Apocalypse Now_ (1979); the latter film also makes use of "Ride of the Valkyries".[47]

In his original compositions for the film, Breil wrote numerous leitmotifs to accompany the appearance of specific characters. The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as "The Perfect Song" and is regarded as the first marketed "theme song" from a film; it was later used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom _Amos 'n' Andy_.[48][49]


Release

Theatrical run

The first public showing of the film, then called _The Clansman_, was on January 1 and 2, 1915, at the Loring Opera House in Riverside, California.[50] The second night, it was sold out and people were turned away.[51] It was shown on February 8, 1915, to an audience of 3,000 persons at Clune's Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles.[52]

Change of title

The title was changed to _The Birth of a Nation_ before the March 2 New York opening.[53] However, Dixon copyrighted the title _The Birth of a Nation_ in 1905,[54] and it was used in the press as early as January 2, 1915,[55][56] while it was still referred to as _The Clansman_ in October.[57]

Special screenings

White House showing

_Birth of a Nation_ was the first movie shown in the White House, in the East Room, on February 18, 1915.[58] (An earlier movie, the Italian _Cabiria_ (1914), was shown on the lawn.) It was attended by President Wilson, members of his family, and members of his Cabinet.[59] Both Dixon and Griffiths were present.[60] As put by Dixon, not an impartial source, "it repeated the triumph of the first showing".[61]

There is dispute about Wilson's attitude toward the movie. A newspaper reported that he "received many letters protesting against his alleged action in Indorsing the pictures ", including a letter from Massachusetts Representative Thomas Thacher (whose term ended March 15).[62] The showing of the movie had caused "several near-riots".[63] When Assistant Attorney General William H. Lewis and A. Walters, a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, called at the White House "to add their protests", Dr. Wilson's private secretary, Joseph Tumulty, showed them a letter he had written to Thacher on Wilson's behalf. According to the letter, Wilson had been "entirely unaware of the character of the play [movie] before it was presented, and has at no time expressed his approbation of it. Its exhibition at the White House was a courtesy extended to an old acquaintance."[64] Dixon, in his autobiography, quotes Wilson as saying, when Dixon proposed showing the movie at the White House, that "I am pleased to be able to do this little thing for you, because a long time ago you took a day out of your busy life to do something for me."[65] What Dixon had done for Wilson was to suggest him for an honorary degree, which Wilson received, from Dixon's _alma mater_, Wake Forest College.[66] Dixon had been a fellow graduate student in history with Wilson at Johns Hopkins University, and in 1913 dedicated his historical novel about Lincoln, _The Southerner_, to "our first Southern-born president since Lincoln, my friend and collegemate Woodrow Wilson".

The evidence that Wilson knew "the character of the play" in advance of seeing it is circumstantial but very strong: "Given Dixon's career and the notoriety attached to the play _The Clansman_, it is not unreasonable to assume that Wilson must have had some idea of at least the general tenor of the film."[67] The movie was based on a best-selling novel and was preceded by a stage version (play) which was received with protests in several cities — in some cities it was prohibited — and received a great deal of news coverage. Wilson issued no protest when the Evening Star, at that time Washington's "newspaper of record", reported in advance of the showing, in language suggesting a press release from Dixon and Griffiths, that Dixon was "a schoolmate of President Wilson and is an intimate friend", and that Wilson's interest in it "is due to the great lesson of peace it teaches".[68] Wilson, and only Wilson, is quoted by name in the movie for his observations on American history, and the title of Wilson's book (_History of the American People_) is mentioned as well.[69] The three title cards with quotations from Wilson's book read:

  "Adventurers swarmed out of the North, as much the enemies of one race as of the other, to cozen, beguile and use the negroes.... [Ellipsis in the original.] In the villages the negroes were the office holders, men who knew none of the uses of authority, except its insolences."

  "....The policy of the congressional leaders wrought…a veritable overthrow of civilization in the South.....in their determination to 'put the white South under the heel of the black South.'" [Ellipses and underscore in the original.]

  "The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation.....until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the southern country." [Ellipsis in the original.]

In the same book, Wilson has harsh words about the abyss between the original goals of the Klan and what it evolved into.[70][71] Dixon has been accused of misquoting Wilson.[72]

In 1937 a popular magazine reported that Wilson said of the film, "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true."[73] Wilson over the years had several times used the metaphor of illuminating history as if by lightning and he may well have said it at the time. The accuracy of his saying it was "terribly true" is disputed by historians; there is no contemporary documentation of the remark.[74][75]

Showing in the Raleigh Hotel ballroom

The next day, February 19, 1915, Griffiths and Dixon held a showing of the film in the Raleigh Hotel ballroom, which they had hired for the occasion. Early that morning, Dixon called on a North Carolina friend, the white supremacist Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy. Daniels set up a meeting that morning for Dixon with Edward Douglass White, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film, but when Dixon told him it was the "true story" of Reconstruction and the Klan's role in "saving the South", White, recalling his youth in Louisiana, jumped to attention and said: "I was a member of the Klan, sir".[76] With White agreeing to see the film, the rest of the Supreme Court followed. In addition to the entire Supreme Court, in the audience were "many members of Congress and members of the diplomatic corps",[77][78] the Secretary of the Navy, 38 members of the Senate, and about 50 members of the House of Representatives. The audience of 600 "cheered and applauded throughout."[79][80][81]

Consequences

In Griffith's words, the showings to the President and the entire Supreme Court conferred an "honor" upon _Birth of a Nation_.[82] Dixon and Griffiths used this commercially.

The following day, Griffiths and Dixon transported the film to New York City for review by the National Board of Censorship. They presented the film as "endorsed" by the President and the cream of Washington society. The Board approved the film by 15 to 8.[83]

A warrant to close the theater in which the movie was to open was dismissed after a long-distance call to the White House confirmed that the film had been shown there.[84][85]

Justice White was very angry when advertising for the film stated that he approved it and he threatened to denounce it publicly.[86]

Dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by African Americans that the movie encouraged hatred against them, and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism.[87] Dixon always vehemently denied having anti-black prejudices—despite the way his books promoted white supremacy—and stated: "My books are hard reading for a Negro, and yet the Negroes, in denouncing them, are unwittingly denouncing one of their greatest friends".[88]

In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, Wilson's secretary, Dixon wrote: "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat.... Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!"[89] In a letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy".[90] Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson, upon becoming president in 1913, had allowed cabinet members to impose segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. by reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.[91]

New opening titles on re-release

One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film[92] and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints).[93]

These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:

  A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE: We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare

and

  If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.

Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that "Griffith's greatest achievement in _The Birth of a Nation_ was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative".[94] On the other hand, S. Kittrell Rushing complains about Griffith's "didactic" title-cards,[95] while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of liberty which he asserts.[96]


Contemporary reception

Press reaction

The _New York Times_ gave it a quite brief review, calling it "melodramatic" and "inflamatory", adding that:"A great deal might be said concerning the spirit revealed in Mr. Dixon's review of the unhappy chapter of Reconstruction and concerning the sorry service rendered by its plucking at old wounds."[97]

Box office

]]

The box office gross of _The Birth of a Nation_ is not known, and has been the subject of exaggeration.[98] When the film opened, the tickets were sold at premium prices. The film played at the Liberty Theater in New York City for 44 weeks with tickets priced at $2.20 ().[99] By the end of 1917, Epoch reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million,[100] and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919,[101] although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was much lower than the exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as "state's rights" distribution).[102] The film historian Richard Schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that "_Birth_ certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run".[103]

The film held the mantle of the highest-grossing film until it was overtaken by _Gone with the Wind_ (1939), another film about the Civil War and Reconstruction era.[104][105] By 1940 _Time_ magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million.[106] For years _Variety_ had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million.[107] It is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version.[108] It is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.[109] In a 2015 _Time_ article, Richard Corliss estimated the film had earned the equivalent of $1.8 billion adjusted for inflation, a milestone that at the time had only been surpassed by _Titanic_ (1997) and _Avatar_ (2009) in nominal earnings.[110]

Criticism

Like Dixon's novels and play, _Birth of a Nation_ received considerable criticism, both before and after its premiere. Dixon, who believed it entirely truthful, attributed this to "Sectionalists", i.e. non-Southerners who in Dixon's opinion were hostile to the truth about the South.[111] It was to counter these "sinister forces" and the "dangerous...menace" that Dixon and Griffiths sought "the backing" of President Wilson and the Supreme Court.[112]

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) protested at premieres of the film in numerous cities. According to the historian David Copeland, "by the time of the movie's March 3 [1915] premiere in New York City, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for censorship, which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city's film board ban the movie. Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned Griffith's picture".[113] The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.[114] Because of the lack of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP secretary Mary Childs Nerney wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to _The Birth of a Nation_ ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere."[115]

led a demonstration against the film, which resulted in a riot.]] Jane Addams, an American social worker and social reformer, and the founder of Hull House, voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the _New York Post_ on March 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released.[116] She stated that "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse."[117] In New York, Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise told the press after seeing _The Birth of a Nation_ that the film was "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings".[118] In Boston, Booker T. Washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film,[119] while the civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations. On Saturday, April 10, and again on April 17, Trotter and a group of other blacks tried to buy tickets for the show's premiere at the Tremont Theater and were refused. They stormed the box office in protest, 260 police on standby rushed in, and a general melee ensued. Trotter and ten others were arrested.[120] The following day a huge demonstration was staged at Faneuil Hall.[121][122] In Washington D.C, the Reverend Francis James Grimké published a pamphlet entitled "Fighting a Vicious Film" that challenged the historical accuracy of _The Birth of a Nation_ on a scene-by-scene basis.[123] When the film was released, riots also broke out in Philadelphia and other major cities in the United States. The film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On April 24, 1916, the _Chicago American_ reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in Lafayette, Indiana, after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen _The Birth of a Nation_.[124] The mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens.[125] The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.[126]

Both Griffith and Dixon in letters to the press dismissed African-American protests against _The Birth of a Nation_.[127] In a letter to _The New York Globe_, Griffith wrote that his film was "an influence against the intermarriage of blacks and whites".[128] Dixon likewise called the NAACP "the Negro Intermarriage Society" and said it was against _The Birth of a Nation_ "for one reason only—because it opposes the marriage of blacks to whites".[129] Griffith—indignant at the film's negative critical reception—wrote letters to newspapers and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions.[130]

When Sherwin Lewis of _The New York Globe_ wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history, and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was "damaging my reputation as a producer" and "a liar and a coward".[131]

Audience reaction

defended the film from charges of racism.[132]]] _The Birth of a Nation_ was very popular, despite the film's controversy; it was unlike anything that American audiences had ever seen before.[133] The _Los Angeles Times_ called it "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed".[134] Mary Pickford said: "_Birth of a Nation_ was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously".[135] It became a national cultural phenomenon: merchandisers made Ku-Klux hats and kitchen aprons, and ushers dressed in white Klan robes for openings. In New York there were Klan-themed balls, and in Chicago that Halloween, thousands of college students dressed in robes for a massive Klan-themed party.[136] The producers had 15 "detectives" at the Liberty Theater in New York City "to prevent disorder on the part of those who resent the 'reconstruction period' episodes depicted."[137]

The Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying that it "was exactly true to history" by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore it was a "compliment to the black man" by showing how far black people had "advanced" since Reconstruction.[138] Critic Dolly Dalrymple wrote that, "when I saw it, it was far from silent ... incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, gasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".[139] One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her.[140] Katharine DuPre Lumpkin recalled watching the film as an 18-year-old in 1915 in her 1947 autobiography _The Making of a Southerner_: "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people sighed and shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity."[141]

Sequel and spin-offs

D. W. Griffith made a film in 1916, called _Intolerance_, partly in response to the criticism that _The Birth of a Nation_ received. Griffith made clear within numerous interviews that the film's title and main themes were chosen in response to those who he felt had been intolerant to _The Birth of a Nation_.[142] A sequel called _The Fall of a Nation_ was released in 1916. It was the first sequel in film history.[143] The film was directed by Thomas Dixon Jr., who adapted it from his novel of the same name. Despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among American audiences,[144] and is now a lost film.[145]

In 1918, an American silent drama film directed by John W. Noble called _The Birth of a Race_ was released as a direct response to _The Birth of a Nation_.[146] The film was an ambitious project by producer Emmett Jay Scott to challenge Griffith's film and tell another side of the story, but was ultimately unsuccessful.[147] In 1920, African-American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux released _Within Our Gates_, a response to _The Birth of a Nation_. _Within Our Gates_ depicts the hardships faced by African Americans during the era of Jim Crow laws.[148] Griffith's film was remixed in 2004 as _Rebirth of a Nation_ by DJ Spooky.[149] Quentin Tarantino has said that he made his film _Django Unchained_ (2012) to counter the falsehoods of _The Birth of a Nation_.[150]

Influence

In November 1915, William Joseph Simmons revived the Klan in Atlanta, Georgia.[151] The historian John Hope Franklin observed that, had it not been for _The Birth of a Nation_, the Klan might not have been reborn.[152]

Franklin wrote in 1979 that "The influence of _Birth of a Nation_ on the current view of Reconstruction has been greater than any other single force", but that "It is not at all difficult to find inaccuracies and distortions" in the movie.[153]


Current reception

Critical response

deemed _The Birth of a Nation_ "a great film that argues for evil."]] Released in 1915, _The Birth of a Nation_ has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian Kevin Brownlow, the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years".[154] The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatant racism. Film critic Roger Ebert writes:

  Certainly _The Birth of a Nation_ (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet.[155]

Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics, with Ebert mentioning its use as a historical tool: "_The Birth of a Nation_ is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's _Triumph of the Will_, it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."[156]

According to a 2002 article in the _Los Angeles Times_, the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915.[157] History.com similarly states that "There is no doubt that _Birth of a Nation_ played no small part in winning wide public acceptance" for the KKK, and that throughout the film "African Americans are portrayed as brutish, lazy, morally degenerate, and dangerous."[158] David Duke used the film to recruit Klansmen in the 1970s.[159]

In 2013, the American critic Richard Brody wrote _The Birth of a Nation_ was :

  ...a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. It's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of _Birth of a Nation_, even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about _The Birth of a Nation_ is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).[160]

Brody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the Battle of Bull Run by dancing around the "eerie flare of a bonfire" which imply "a dance of death", foreshadowing the destruction of Sherman's March that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene "obscene and horrifying". Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African-Africans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems "unjust and cruel".[161]

In an article for _The Atlantic_, film critic Ty Burr deemed _The Birth of a Nation_ the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.[162] Richard Corliss of _Time_ wrote that Griffith "established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed. More than anyone else—more than all others combined—he invented the film art. He brought it to fruition in _The Birth of a Nation_." Corliss praised the film's "brilliant storytelling technique" and noted that "_The Birth of a Nation_ is nearly as antiwar as it is antiblack. The Civil War scenes, which consume only 30 minutes of the extravaganza, emphasize not the national glory but the human cost of combat. ... Griffith may have been a racist politically, but his refusal to find uplift in the South's war against the Union—and, implicitly, in any war at all—reveals him as a cinematic humanist."[163]

Accolades

In 1992, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute recognized the film by ranking it #44 within the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list in 1998.

Historical portrayal

The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history. University of Houston historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: "Reconstruction was an unmitigated disaster, blacks could never be integrated into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government".[164] The South is portrayed as a victim. The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. However, the first aggression in the Civil War, made when the Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in 1861, is not mentioned in the film.[165] The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and carpetbagging Republican politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called Dunning School of historiography.[166] The film is slightly less extreme than the books upon which it is based, in which Dixon misrepresented Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, storming into weddings to rape white women with impunity.[167]

The film portrayed President Abraham Lincoln as a friend of the Confederacy, and refers to him as "the Great Heart".[168] The two romances depicted in the film, Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman, reflect Griffith's retelling of history. The couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy.[169] Among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families. With the war, however, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy. One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity: "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright."[170]

The film further reinforced the popular belief held by whites, especially in the South, of Reconstruction as a disaster. In his 1929 book _The Tragic Era: The Revolution After Lincoln_, the respected historian Claude Bowers treated _The Birth of a Nation_ as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction.[171] In _The Tragic Era_, Bowers presented every black politician in the South as corrupt, portrayed Republican Representative Thaddeus Stevens as a vicious "race traitor" intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the Klan for "saving civilization" in the South.[172] Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worst sort of "scum" from the North like Stevens "inflamed the Negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction!"[173]

Academic assessment

The American historian John Hope Franklin wrote that not only did Claude Bowers treat _The Birth of a Nation_ as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from _The Birth of a Nation_.[174] Some historians, such as E. Merton Coulter in his _The South Under Reconstruction_ (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many white Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens. Coulter in _The South During Reconstruction_, which again treated _The Birth of a Nation_ as historically correct, and painted a vivid picture of "black beasts" running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians.[175] Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist Alistair Cooke in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by _The Birth of a Nation_, noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how blacks were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.[176]

(_pictured_).]] Veteran film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote:

  ... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in _Intolerance_ (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in _Broken Blossoms_ he told perhaps the first interracial love story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.[177]

Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1868. However, Stevens' biracial housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith, was considered his common-law wife, and generously provided for in his will.[178]

In the film, Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in a positive light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards Southern whites. The president's views are opposite those of Austin Stoneman, a character presented in a negative light, who acts as an antagonist. The assassination of Lincoln marks the transition from war to Reconstruction, each of which periods has one of the two "acts" of the film.[179] In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis.[180] Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts.[181] Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the want of a better alternative, and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had enslaved them.[182] The character of Silas Lynch has no basis in fact, and during the Reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of South Carolina.[183]

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders".[184]

The civil rights movement and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar Eric Foner, who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on W. E. B. DuBois' work but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of suffrage to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated Democratic Party and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.[185]


Legacy

Film innovations

In his review of _The Birth of a Nation_ in _1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die_, Jonathan Kline writes that "with countless artistic innovations, Griffith essentially created contemporary film language ... virtually every film is beholden to [_The Birth of a Nation_] in one way, shape or form. Griffith introduced the use of dramatic close-ups, tracking shots, and other expressive camera movements; parallel action sequences, crosscutting, and other editing techniques". He added that "the fact that _The Birth of a Nation_ remains respected and studied to this day-despite its subject matter-reveals its lasting importance."[186]

Griffith pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands.[187] _The Birth of a Nation_ also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.[188]

Home media and restorations

For many years, _The Birth of a Nation_ was poorly represented in home media and restorations. This stemmed from several factors, one of which was the fact that Griffith and others had frequently reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website _Brenton Film_, many home media releases of the film consisted of "poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in _definitely unoriginal_ black and white".[189]

One of the earliest high-quality home versions was film preservationist David Shepard's 1992 transfer of a 16mm print for VHS and laserdisc release via Image Entertainment. A short documentary, _The Making of The Birth of a Nation_, newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on DVD by Image in 1998 and the UK's Eureka Entertainment in 2000.[190]

In the UK, Photoplay Productions restored the Museum of Modern Art's 35mm print that was the source of Shepard's 16 mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the British Film Institute. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on Channel 4 television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.[191]

Shepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by Kino Video in 2002, this time in a 2-DVD set with added extras on the second disc. These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D. W. Griffith.[192] In 2011, Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35 mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection. They added some material from the Library of Congress and gave it a new compilation score. This version was released on Blu-ray by Kino in the US, Eureka in the UK (as part of their "Masters of Cinema" collection) and Divisa Home Video in Spain.[193]

In 2015, the year of the film's centenary, Photoplay Productions' Patrick Stanbury, in conjunction with the British Film Institute, carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new 4K scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It, too, was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set by the BFI, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War-related films from the period.[194]

In popular culture

-   _The Birth of a Nation_{{'s}} reverent depiction of the Klan was lampooned in Mel Brooks' _Blazing Saddles_ (1974).[195]
-   Ryan O'Neal's character in Peter Bogdanovich's _Nickelodeon_ (1976) attends the premiere of _The Birth of a Nation_, and realizes that it will change the course of American cinema.[196]
-   Clips from Griffith's film are shown in
    -   Robert Zemeckis' _Forrest Gump_ (1994),[197]
    -   The closing montage of Spike Lee's _Bamboozled_ (2000)[198]
    -   Lee's _BlacKkKlansman_ (2018)[199]
-   Director Kevin Willmott's mockumentary _C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America_ (2004) portrays an imagined history where the Confederacy won the Civil War. It shows part of an imagined Griffith film, _The Capture of Dishonest Abe_, which resembles _The Birth of a Nation_ and was supposedly adapted from Thomas Dixon's _The Yankee_ .[200]
-   In Justin Simien's _Dear White People_ (2014), Sam (Tessa Thompson) screens a short film called _The Rebirth of a Nation_ which portrays white people wearing whiteface while criticizing Barack Obama.[201]
-   In 2016, Nate Parker produced and directed the film _The Birth of a Nation_, based on Nat Turner's slave rebellion; Parker clarified:

  I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change.[202]

-   Dinesh D'Souza's 2016 film _Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party_ depicts President Wilson and his cabinet viewing _The Birth of a Nation_ in the White House before a Klansman comes out of the screen and into the real world.[203]
-   The title of D'Souza's 2018 film _Death of a Nation: Can We Save America a Second Time?_ is a reference to Griffith's film.[204]
