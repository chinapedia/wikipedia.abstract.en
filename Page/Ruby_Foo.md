Biography

Ruby Foo was born in San Francisco in 1904. In 1923, she moved to Boston, where she started a one-room restaurant in Chinatown. The venture was a success, and in 1929 she opened Ruby Foo's Den, a restaurant and nightclub, at 6 Hudson Street. Billed as "Chinatown's smartest restaurant", the "Den" was the first known Chinese restaurant in the U.S. to attract a large non-Chinese clientele. In the 1930s and 40s it was a nationally known gathering place for famous athletes, actors, and other celebrities.[1] It became one of the first Boston restaurants to expand into other cities when Foo lent her name to similar establishments in New York City, Miami, Washington D.C., Providence,[2] and Montreal.[3] Foo was a mentor to many aspiring chefs in the Boston area.[4]

Foo was married three times and had two children, Earl and Doris Shong. Her third husband was William Wong. According to the _Boston Globe_, after seeing the famous "Bloody Saturday" photograph of a crying baby in a bombed-out Shanghai railway station, she arranged to have the baby brought to the U.S., where she adopted him in 1938, naming him Ronald.[5][6]

Foo died of a heart attack in her Jamaicaway home on March 16, 1950, aged 42.[7] Her funeral was attended by prominent city and state officials, as well as "stage, screen, and radio personalities".[8] She is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.[9]
