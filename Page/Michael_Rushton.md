MICHAEL RUSHTON (born 1950 in Worthing, West Sussex, England) is a British drummer and vocalist, known for being a member of the blues-rock band Steamhammer[1][2] and later indie bands.

Rushton was a member of several rock and blues bands in the mid to late 1960s. Steamhammer was formed in 1968 in Worthing, Rushton's birthplace.[3] He played drums on the debut 1969 _Steamhammer_ album, aka _Reflection_.[4][5]

Rushton is said to have been sacked from Steamhammer[6] and Mick Bradley took over as the drummer for the band after him.

He has been a drummer and vocalist for Baroque Bordello and Les Innocents.[8] He is sometimes credited as "MICHAÃ‹L RUSHTON".
