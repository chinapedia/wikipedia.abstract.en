A 5x5 Mainarizumu puzzle MAINARIZUMU (マイナリズム) is a type of logic puzzle published by Nikoli.


Rules

_Mainarizumu_ is played on a square grid, typically 7x7 or smaller, with two kinds of clues: a greater-than or less-than sign connecting two adjacent squares, or a circled digit connecting two adjacent squares. The solver is to enter a digit, between one and the grid width/height, into every square so that:

-   No digit is repeated in any row or column (much like in Sudoku puzzles).[1]
-   If two squares are connected by a greater-than or less-than sign, then the digits in those squares must obey that inequality.[2]
-   If two squares are connected by a circled digit, then the digits in those squares must differ by exactly that amount.[3]
