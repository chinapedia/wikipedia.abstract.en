The CO-CATHEDRAL OF THE ASSUMPTION OF MARY [1] ( ) also called SENJ CO-CATHEDRAL Is a Catholic temple in Senj, Croatia.[2] Once it was the main cathedral of the diocese of Senj, it is now the co-cathedral of the diocese of Gospić-Mark.

The Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary was built in 1169 as a Romanesque basilica of a single nave on the foundations of a pagan temple of the fourth and fifth centuries, whose remains are still visible at the back of the sanctuary at about 1.5 meters deep. The façade and the south side of the cathedral, in the middle of the eighteenth century was decorated with Romanesque arches and brick niches. In the same period the church was expanded with the addition of two side aisles, altars and other works of art. During World War II the cathedral was severely damaged. The current appearance of the building is the result of the restoration executed between 1949 and 1950.
