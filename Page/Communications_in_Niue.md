Internet service

Niue has free Internet service through the efforts of the Internet Users Society Niue, established 1999. However users need to pay NZD$25 to a local IT company to register the MAC address of their WiFi card before being able to log into this WiFi network.

Alternatively, where ADSL is available, users can have connections through Telecom Niue's Internet Services located at Alofi through their island-wide distributed wireline.

.nu Internet domain

The .nu TLD is assigned to Niue.

Niue, through an outside company, registers Internet domain names, so most .nu web addresses are not actually located in Niue. They are commonly used by Danish, Dutch and Swedish websites, because in those languages 'nu' means “now”.

Niue was the first country in the world to plan on offering free nationwide WiFi internet access, using the funds provided by the domain registrations. 95% of Niueans now have internet access at home, work or through the schools, making it the country with the highest per capita internet penetration in the world.
