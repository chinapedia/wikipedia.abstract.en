History

Fuli town is inhabited by Yao and Han nationalities and has been part of Fuchuan since the 4th year of the Kaibao period in the Song Dynasty. Its main industry revolves around agriculture, predominantly rice, organic vegetables, and citrus, and is the core agricultural demonstration zone in Guangxi.[3]


Cittaslow (slow city movement)

In July 2015, Cittaslow sent a delegation to Fuchuan to do field inspection and evaluation. The Agriculture Core Demonstration Plot in Fuli town was considered to meet the standard of an "international slow city". On November 2, Fuchuan County, successfully passed the "international slow city" criteria, specifically with regard to:

-   The creation of a Sea of Flowers, the first-stage completed and open to public on October 1 in 2015, with an area of 550 mu.
-   The Maocaowu leisure and vacation farm of Shenxian lake has been completed.
-   All villages are greened, beautified and brightened according to the mode of "micro countryside".
-   Old buildings and dwellings have undergone renovations based on the idea of "restoring the old as the old".
-   Signboards and guide maps in every scenic spot, crossroad and key areas are further perfected.
-   The building of 10 km of asphalt road in the main stems, 10 km of bikeway, another 10 km of footpath around the lake, sightseeing stacks, viewing decks, information corridors and public toilets.

Cittaslow has also reached cooperation agreements with many domestic enterprises in Fuli, for the promotion of ecological leisure, health preserving, and vacation tourism.[4]

Chen Hua, secretary of Fuchuan County Party committee, said that Fuchuan now has invested more than 6 million yuan ($0.91 million) in an inn and a mountainous resort with a total planned investment of over 12 million yuan. It has also used the 100 mu (6.67 hectares) land planned for tourism and has built a large-scale green parking lot.

In addition to Shenxian Lake Agricultural Sightseeing Park, there is a 2,100 mu Rose Lake Water Park, a 200 mu health maintenance park, and a 300 mu rare fruits picking garden. At present, the area has received nearly 300,000 tourists, earning income of 123 million yuan.[5]
