UNIT LONDON is a contemporary art gallery based at 3 Hanover Square in Mayfair, London, with a secondary location, Unit 6, in Covent Garden. It was founded by two young artists, Joe Kennedy and Jonny Burt, in 2013.[1] The gallery specializes in contemporary art and has exhibited such artists as Mark Demsteader, Jake Wood-Evans, Ivan Alifan, Henrik Aarrestad Uldalen, Ryan Hewett, and Zhuang Hong Yi.[2]


History and development

Established in 2013 by Joe Kennedy and Jonny Burt as a startup gallery in a 300 square foot pop-up space in Chiswick,[3] the gallery quickly gained a reputation through the use of social media, which distinguished it from the marketing strategies of other art galleries. The gallery uses social media to connect with millennials[4] by promoting artists and their brands on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and through the use of videos and web content. Unit London has attracted interest from art lovers, artists, art collectors, and important figures from all creative industries, such as Jude Law, Bob Geldof, and Jean Paul Gautier, who have rallied around the cause and expressed their support for the approach by following, liking, commenting, and sharing the gallery’s posts.[5] Unit London has over 80,000+ followers across all social media platforms.[6]

In 2015, Unit London relocated to a 4,000 square foot gallery in Soho, London,[7] in keeping with the principle that "_Unit London is a gallery, a collective, and a community, which believes in the promotion and showcasing of truly gifted artists, regardless of their profile, reputation, or background. It is upon this fundamental principle that the gallery was founded and its key message has resounded with collectors worldwide._"[8] Unit London has been named as one of the _Top 5 Young Contemporary Galleries in London._[9] The gallery subsequently moved location in March 2018 to Langley Street in Covent Garden_._

In June 2018, the gallery opened a new 6000 square foot space in Mayfair, which is currently its flagship location_._[10] Now its main site, the venue hosts an innovative and dynamic exhibition programme showcasing the gallery’s leading artists, as well as a series of cutting-edge cultural events. Its location in Covent Garden was renamed Unit 6, and now serves as an accessible exhibition and event space which focuses on vibrant group exhibitions, artist development, and a variety of brand-led events.
