DE L'ASSOMPTION BOULEVARD () is a main north-south street in the Montreal boroughs of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie and Saint-Léonard.


Description

The boulevard is 3.6 kilometres long and starts at its intersection with Hochelaga Street and ends at its intersection with Jean-Talon Street. The Assomption metro station is located on the boulevard south of Sherbrooke Street East, at the corner with Chauveau Street. The Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont (the largest hospital in Quebec) is on the north-east side of Assomption where it intersects with Boulevard Rosemont, and on the facing south-west of the boulevard are the Olympic Village and the classic garden city development of Cité-jardin du Tricentenaire.[1] Boulevard_de_l_Assomption.jpg The boulevard got its name in 1951 in honor of the proclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption of Mother Mary a year earlier by Pope Pius XII.


Planned extension and maintenance

Since 2013 there have been plans to improve access to the Port of Montreal by extending the boulevard to Notre-Dame Street.[2][3] This has led to conflicts regarding zoning restrictions in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.[4] Plans have also been delayed by the costs of decontaminating the old Canadian Steel Foundries site (cleared in 2004) at the southern end of the boulevard.[5]

In 2016, ten million dollars were invested in renovations on the stretch of the boulevard through the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie,[6] after protests by residents the previous year.[7]
