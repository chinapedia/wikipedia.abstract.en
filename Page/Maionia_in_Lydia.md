MAIONIA or MAEONIA (), was a city of the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine era located near the Hermos River,[1] in ancient Lydia. Both Ramsay and Talbert[2] tentatively identified the ancient polis with the modern village of Koula (Turkish for fortress) a village known for its carpet manufacture.[3]

The town is mentioned by mentioned by Pliny the Elder,[4] Hierocles,[5] and in the _Notitiae Episcopatuum_. Several coins from Maionia are extant. In antiquity the city was part of the Katakekaumene Decapolis of towns. Once the seat of a residential bishop, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.[6]

Its site is located near Menye in Asiatic Turkey.[7][8]
