_ROXY THE SOUNDTRACK_ is the CD companion released in the _Roxy The Movie_, DVD/CD and Blu-ray/CD sets. The CD soundtrack is not sold separately.


Background

The film used to produce the movie was shot in 1973 using four cameras at three live shows performed on December 8, 9 and 10. What no one knew at the time the film was shot is a malfunction led to the audio and video being out of synch. As John Albanian discusses in the liner notes, the problem was such that not until today's technology could the issue be painstakingly resolved.

This is the third time around for the music from the Roxy shows. In 1974 _ROXY & ELSEWHERE_ released some of the tracks from these shows and a few others. Then the 2014 _ROXY BY PROXY_ release made available more tracks exclusively from the December dates and all different from any on the previous release. This release represents those used in the movie, except tracks 8, 13, 14 & 16.
