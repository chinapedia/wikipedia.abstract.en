The FLAG OF ALAGOAS was created by State Law of Alagoas No. 2628 on 23 September 1963. The colors (red, white, and blue) refer to the French _Tricolore_, symbolizing the ideals of the French Revolution: _liberté, égalité, fraternité_.


Symbolism

The coat of arms symbolizes the first city of Porto Calvo.

The three shells represent the three historic villages of the state, present-day Porto Calvo, Marechal Deodoro, and Penedo.

The three fish represent the three main and largest lagoons of the then-town: Mundaú, Manguaba, and Jequiá, and also represent fishing. The green bouquets in the center of the flag depict sugarcane and cotton.

The five-pointed silver star is a Brazilian heraldic tradition and refers to the star on the coat of arms of Brazil. It also refers to the _Hino de Alagoas_ (pt), which refers to the state as a "bright star" ().
