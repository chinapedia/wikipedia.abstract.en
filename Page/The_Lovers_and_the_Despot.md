The site's consensus states: "_The Lovers and the Despot_ offers a compelling — albeit by no means comprehensive — look at one of the more bizarrely stranger-than-fiction episodes in cinematic history."[1] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 65 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[2]

Writing for _The New York Times_, Manohla Dargis stated that "Despite its flaws and will to kitsch, _The Lovers and the Despot_ has enough enigmas and chills to merit a look, even if some of its spookier moments involve cinephilia rather than the usual weapons of mass destruction."[3]

In Jordan Hoffman's review for _The Guardian_, he wrote that "there’s an incredible story somewhere in this tale [...], but this documentary buries it by way of over-measured effects and chronic pussy-footing."[4] In a review for _RogerEbert.com_, Matt Zoller Seitz called it a "frustrating missed opportunity", saying it "takes a fascinating story about filmmaking, politics, kidnapping and propaganda and gives us almost no insight into the work of its two main characters."[5]

Box office

As of 3 November 2016, the film has grossed $55,511 at the box office.[6]
