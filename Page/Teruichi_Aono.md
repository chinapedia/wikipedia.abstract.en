TERUICHI AONO (青野 照市 _Aono Teruichi,_ born January 1, 1953) is a 9-dan professional shogi player from Yaizu, Shizuoka.[1]


JSA executive

Aono has been selected multiple times to be a member of the Japan Shogi Association's board of directors throughout his career, and was chosen to be JSA senior managing director in 2013.[2] He served in that capacity until February 2017 when he and two other members of the board were dismissed as part of the JSA's response to the 29th Ryūō challenger controversy.[3]


Shogi promotion efforts

Aono is active in promoting shogi outside Japan including visiting England in 1979 to teach the game to local players,[4] and helping to arrange a visit of twenty Chinese elementary school students from Shanghai to visit an elementary school in Sendagaya, Tokyo in 2015 as part of an international exchange program involving shogi.[5]


9-square shogi

Aono created a new shogi variant ９マス将棋 _kyū-masu shōgi_ "9-square shogi" published in 2016 that is useful for teaching the shogi.[6] It uses a 3x3 board and begins with several different staculturalrt positions in which each player has between 2 and 3 pieces that may or may not be in hand. Promotion is restricted to the last rank on each side. All other shogi rules apply. The game can be thought as a set of tsumeshogi (詰将棋 _tsumeshōgi_ "checkmate") and brinkmate (必死 _hisshi_) problems.
