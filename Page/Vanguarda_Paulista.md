VANGUARDA PAULISTA, also named VANGUARDA PAULISTANA (_São Paulo Avant-garde)_ was the name given to a Brazilian cultural movement which happened in São Paulo between 1979 and 1985, at the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship.[1] The moniker was given by city's journalists and music critics, by its avant-garde aspect and referring to one of the venues where the artists performed: the Teatro Lira Paulistana, in the neighborhood of Pinheiros, from which a record label and publishing house were also spun.[2] Vanguarda Paulista musicians had different styles, but there were unifying characteristics among some of them: a spoken word-like singing style, the blending of classical and popular elements, humorous lyrics laden with social criticism, and an independent, do-it-yourself spirit.[3]
