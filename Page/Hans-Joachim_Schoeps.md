HANS-JOACHIM SCHOEPS (January 30, 1909 Berlin - July 8, 1980 Erlangen) was a German-Jewish historian of religion and religious philosophy. He was professor of religions and religious history at the University of Erlangen.[1] Prior to World War II, Schoeps was leader of the German Vanguard (Der deutsche Vortrupp), the German-Jewish followers of Hitler, also referred to as "Nazi Jews". Schoeps went into exile in Falun/Sweden at the end of 1938 (seven weeks after the Kristallnacht), just before the persecutions began in earnest. There his two sons were born. His parents were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp June 4, 1942. His father (* 1864) died there six months later; his mother (* 1886) was gased in Auschwitz.

Schoeps returned to Western Germany in autumn 1946. In 1950, he was made professor of religious history at the university of Erlangen. He remained a monarchist and wanted to re-introduce monarchy in post-war Germany. His involvement in the Vortrupp and his personal engagement for the success of the Nazi movement did not become known at Erlangen while he was a professor there until 1970. He was firmly opposed to the German student movement after 1967, and published a book in 1972 in which he claimed that Germany was threatened by anarchy.[2] Schoeps was a member of the conservative Deutschland-Stiftung.
