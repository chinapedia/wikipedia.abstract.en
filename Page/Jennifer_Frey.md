JENNIFER M. FREY (1968â€“2016) was an American sportswriter.

Frey grew up in western New York, the child of a professor and a schoolteacher. She attended Harvard University.[1]

After college, Frey interned at the _Detroit Free Press_, then the _Miami Herald_. She went on to write for the _Philadelphia Daily News and the New York Times_. In 1995, she joined the _Washington Post_, writing for the sports page, then the style section.[2] Writing of Frey in 1997, David Carr called her "a certified prodigy who can do it all: X's and O's, empathetic profiles, and hard takedowns when the situation requires it."[3]

Frey died of organ failure due to alcoholism on March 26, 2016.[4]
