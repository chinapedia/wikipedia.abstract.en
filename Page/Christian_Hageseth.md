Entrepreneur

American Cannabis Partners

Through American Cannabis Partners (ACP), Hageseth aims to grow the legal marijuana industry in a responsible way. He aims to connect like-minded teams and investors to make projects come alive. He is currently concentrating on the development of the Colorado Cannabis Ranch, the world's first "weedery". The Colorado Cannabis Ranch is scheduled to open in 2018. Hageseth has spoken at a number of industry events around the US and in Canada, often addressing the need for innovation in the industry and inspiring other entrepreneurs with accounts of his own entrepreneurial journey.[4] He is also often sought out by the media as an industry source.

Colorado Cannabis Ranch

The Colorado Cannabis Ranch is designed to be the world's first "weedery"[5] – similar to the concept of a winery or brewery but for legal marijuana.[6] Hageseth is currently developing this project through his company American Cannabis Partners. The aim of the Colorado Cannabis Ranch is to demystify and de-stigmatize legal cannabis, and also set new standards in cultivation. Hageseth envisions that the Ranch will allow visitors to tour a legal marijuana cultivation center for the first time. He also plans for an on-site restaurant and bar, and an amphitheater to be part of the experience.

Green Man Cannabis

Hageseth founded Green Man Cannabis, a legal marijuana cultivation and retail business in 2009. Until 2015 Green Man Cannabis cultivated and sold medical marijuana only. In 2015 the company was licensed to cultivate and sell both medical and recreational marijuana. Green Man Cannabis has two retail locations in Denver, CO. The business has won multiple awards, including six High Times Cannabis Cups – the most prestigious award for product excellence.[7]
