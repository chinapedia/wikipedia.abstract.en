ROLLOUT.IO provides a mobile software development kit (SDK) that enables feature flagging for mobile apps, allowing developers to remotely control the deployment of new features. The SDK currently supports native iOS apps written in Swift or Objective-C. It supports continuous deployment, gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and the entire software development lifecycle.[1]


History

In February 2016, Rollout announced additional funding from Sweet Capital in the amount of $1 million.[5]

In April 2017, Rollout launched a new product called ROX.[6]

Products

Difference to well-known rollout library

This company and its products should not be confused with the older and widely used rollout open source software library, which has been in development and is used by FetLife and other contributors since 2010.
