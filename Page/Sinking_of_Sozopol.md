Plot

Aging architect Chavo (Deyan Donkov) arrives to Sozopol which is connected to the earlier part of his life.

He is determined to drink 10 bottles of vodka and to commit suicide. He meets his friends, thinks about his past and little by little the rain in Sozopol becomes stronger and stronger responding to his feelings.

Chavo shares his plans to commit suicide with his friend Doc (Stefan Valdobrev) who prescribes him anti-depressants.

The film reflects his complicated relationship with his oppressive artist father and the tragic destiny of his younger brother who ends up drowning.

Tension heightens in the film. The turmoil of nature reflects the loneliness of the architect and his feelings of guilt.

He thinks of his lost love Neva (Snezhina Petrova) and somehow expects a miracle after he drinks the tenth bottle of vodka. Because of her he left his wife Tanya and his children.

The structure of the film is non-linear, the past present and future are inter-connected and create a special atmosphere of ambiguity. The end of the film is unexpected and we find out that the friend Gina committed suicide by jumping into the sea.
