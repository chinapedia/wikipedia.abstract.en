K_(u){{\}}K bands (IEEE)

-   SHF (ITU)

}}

The NATO J BAND is the designation given to the radio frequencies from 10 to 20 GHz (equivalent to wavelengths between 3 and 1.5Â cm). Since 1992 frequency allocations, allotment and assignments are in line to NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).[1] However, in order to identify military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for crises management planning, training, Electronic warfare activities, or in military operations, this system is still in use.
