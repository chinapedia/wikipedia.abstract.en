History

Pollada[2] is a food that goes back many years and has been prepared for generations as an alternative for collecting funds. It is believed that the first form of preparation of pollada was in the economic inflation periods of Peru, which forced Peruvians to live with overpriced foods.

The rising of the prices decreased the quality of life. Therefore, many Peruvians opted for this unique form of helping each other or helping themselves, selling a food that helped to meet the needs that they could have. But pollada has always been prepared as a family recipe and not for carrying out various events.
