_LIVE AT BAKER'S KEYBOARD LOUNGE_ is a live album by saxophonist James Carter with guests David Murray, Johnny Griffin and Franz Jackson recorded at Baker's Keyboard Lounge in 2001, and released on the Warner Bros. label in 2004.[1]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Al Campbell says, "_Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge_ finds Carter cutting loose like a musician who's been conceptually sidetracked long enough. This is a back to basics blowing session and concepts be damned".[2] In _JazzTimes_ Chris Kelsey called the album "a rollicking session that captures the loose vibe of a nightclub set to near perfection".[3] On _All About Jazz_ Russ Musto noted, "James Carter is a passionate player whose solos are frequently pushed over the top by his awesome virtuosity. That tendency is put to good use on this live extravaganza recorded before a raucous crowd at Baker's Keyboard Lounge. ... Carter moves effortlessly through his arsenal of saxophones on an exciting program of jazz classics".[4]
