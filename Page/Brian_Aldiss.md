BRIAN WILSON ALDISS, OBE (; 18 August 1925 – 19 August 2017) was an English writer and anthology-editor, best known for science fiction novels and short stories. His byline reads either BRIAN W. ALDISS or simply BRIAN ALDISS, except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.

Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society. He was (with Harry Harrison) co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award, and one John W. Campbell Memorial Award.[1] He wrote the short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" (1969), the basis for the Stanley Kubrick-developed Steven Spielberg film _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_ (2001). Aldiss was associated with the British New Wave of science fiction.[2]


Life and career

Early life, education, and military service

Aldiss was born on 18 August 1925,[3] above his paternal grandfather's draper's shop in Dereham, Norfolk. When Aldiss's grandfather died, his father, Bill (the younger of two sons), sold his share in the shop and the family left Dereham. Aldiss's mother, Dot, was the daughter of a builder.[4] He had an older sister who was stillborn, and a younger sister.[5] As a 3-year-old, Aldiss started to write stories which his mother would bind and put on a shelf.[6] At the age of 6, he went to Framlingham College but moved to Devon and was sent to board at West Buckland School in Devon in 1939 after the outbreak of the war.[7] As a child he discovered the pulp magazine _Astounding Science Fiction_, and read all the novels by H. G. Wells and Robert Heinlein, and later Philip K. Dick.[8] In 1943, during the Second World War, he joined the Royal Signals[9] and saw action in Burma.[10]

Writing and publishing

His Army experience inspired the Horatio Stubbs second and third books, _A Soldier Erect_ and _A Rude Awakening_, respectively.[11]

After the war, he worked as a bookseller in Oxford.[12] He also wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers' trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, which attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the publisher Faber and Faber.[13] As a result, Faber and Faber published Aldiss' first book, _The Brightfount Diaries_ (1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.

About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to ISFDB, his first speculative fiction in print was the short story _Criminal Record_, published by John Carnell in the July 1954 issue of _Science Fantasy_.[14] Several of his stories appeared in 1955, including three in monthly issues of _New Worlds_,[15] also edited by Carnell.

In 1954, _The Observer_ newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500. Aldiss' story _Not For An Age_ was ranked third following a reader vote.[16]

_The Brightfount Diaries_ had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of science fiction fans in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published, a collection of short stories entitled _Space, Time and Nathaniel_ (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, and he made the decision to become a full-time writer. Aldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year's Worldcon, but finished behind "no award".[17] He was elected president of the British Science Fiction Association in 1960. He was the literary editor of the _Oxford Mail_ newspaper from 1958 to 1969.[18] Around 1964, he and long-time collaborator Harry Harrison started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, _Science Fiction Horizons_, which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as James Blish, and featured a discussion among Aldiss, C. S. Lewis, and Kingsley Amis in the first issue[19] and an interview with William S. Burroughs in the second.[20] In 1967 Algis Budrys listed Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, Roger Zelazny, and Samuel R. Delany as "an earthshaking new kind of" writers, and leaders of the New Wave.[21]

Besides his own writings, he had great success as an anthologist. For Faber he edited _Introducing SF_, a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and _Best Fantasy Stories_. In 1961, he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher Penguin Books under the title _Penguin Science Fiction_. This was remarkably successful, went into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies: _More Penguin Science Fiction_ (1963) and _Yet More Penguin Science Fiction_ (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as _The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus_ (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles _Space Opera_ (1974), _Space Odysseys_ (1975), _Galactic Empires_ (1976), _Evil Earths_ (1976), and _Perilous Planets_ (1978) which were quite successful. Around this time, he edited a large-format volume _Science Fiction Art_ (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and pulps.

In response to the results from the planetary probes of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that Venus was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, Aldiss and Harrison edited an anthology _Farewell, Fantastic Venus!_, reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies _The Year's Best Science Fiction_ (Nos. 1–9, 1968–1976).[22]

Aldiss invented a form of extremely short story called the _mini-saga_. _The Daily Telegraph_ hosted a competition for the best mini-saga for several years, and Aldiss was the judge.[23] He has edited several anthologies of the best mini-sagas.

Aldiss travelled to Yugoslavia, where he met fans in Ljubljana, Slovenia and published a travel book about Yugoslavia entitled _Cities and Stones_ (1966), his only work in the genre.[24] He published an alternative-history fantasy story, "The Day of the Doomed King" (1968), about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages, and wrote a novel called _The Malacia Tapestry_, about an alternative Dalmatia.

Art

In addition to a highly successful career as a writer, Aldiss was an accomplished artist. His first solo exhibition, _The Other Hemisphere_, was held in Oxford, August–September 2010, and the exhibition's centrepiece _Metropolis_ (see figure) has since been released as a limited edition fine art print.[25](The exhibition title denotes the writer/artist's notion, "words streaming from one side of his brain inspiring images in what he calls 'the other hemisphere'".)[26]

Personal life

In 1948, Aldiss married Olive Fortescue, secretary to the owner of Sanders' bookseller's in Oxford, where he had worked since 1947.[27] He had two children from his first marriage: Clive in 1955 and Caroline Wendy in 1959, but the marriage "finally collapsed" in 1959 and dissolved in 1965.[28][29]

In 1965, he married his second wife, Margaret Christie Manson (daughter of John Alexander Christie Manson, an aeronautical engineer),[30] a Scottish woman and secretary to the editor of the _Oxford Mail_; Aldiss was 40, and she 31.[31] They lived in Oxford and had two children together, Tim and Charlotte.[32][33] She died in 1997.[34]

Death

Aldiss died on 19 August 2017, the day after his 92nd birthday.[35][36]


Awards and honours

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1990.[37]

Aldiss was the "Permanent Special Guest" at the annual International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) from 1989 through 2008. He was also the Guest of Honor at the conventions in 1986 and 1999.[38]

The Science Fiction Writers of America made him its 18th SFWA Grand Master in 2000[39] and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2004.[40]

He was awarded the title of Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature in the 2005 Birthday Honours list.[41]

In January 2007 he appeared on _Desert Island Discs_. His choice of record to 'save' was "Old Rivers" sung by Walter Brennan, his choice of book was John Heilpern's biography of John Osborne, and his luxury a banjo. The full selection of eight favourite records is on the BBC website.[42]

On 1 July 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool in recognition of his contribution to literature.[43] The Brian W Aldiss Archive at the University holds manuscripts from the period 1943–1995.[44]

In 2013, Aldiss was recipient of the World Fantasy Convention Award at the World Fantasy Convention in Brighton, England.

Aldiss sat on the Council of the Society of Authors.[45]

He won two Hugo awards: in 1962 for the _Hothouse_ series; and in 1987 for _Trillion Year Spree_.[46][47] Aldiss also won a Nebula award in 1965 for "The Saliva Tree".[48]

        A short novel about the huge, old galactic empire of Nuls, a giant, three-limbed, civilised alien race. Earth is just a lesser-than-third-class colony ruled by a Nul tyrant whose deceiving devices together with good willing but ineffective attempts of a Nul signatory to clarify the abuses and with the disorganised earthling resistance reflect the complex relationship existing between imperialists and subject races which Aldiss himself had the chance of seeing at first hand when serving in India and Indonesia in the forties.

        Set in a far future Earth, where the earth has stopped rotating, the Sun has increased output, and plants are engaged in a constant frenzy of growth and decay, like a tropical forest enhanced a thousandfold; a few small groups of elvish humans still live on the edge of extinction, beneath the giant banyan tree that covers the day side of the earth.

        Perhaps Aldiss's most experimental work, this first appeared in several parts as the 'Acid Head War' series in _New Worlds_. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young Serb, who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic crusade. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of _Finnegans Wake_.
