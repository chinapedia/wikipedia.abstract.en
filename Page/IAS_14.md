Differences between IAS 14 and IFRS 8

IFRS 8 requires companies to be more transparent about their business decisions and management information. Where IAS 14 required companies to base their reported business segments on the information presented in their financial statement, IFRS 8 requires them to also base this segmentation on any distinction made between business segments by key management in their decision making and information that is used internally by the company.
