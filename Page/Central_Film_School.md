CENTRAL FILM SCHOOL (CFS) (formerly CENTRAL FILM SCHOOL LONDON) is a private film school in East London, based in Universal House, Wentworth Street. It was founded in 2008.[1]

The school offers undergraduate degrees in Practical Filmmaking and Screenwriting, as well as short courses and postgraduate degrees. The school hosts around 100 students each year.

In 2015, CFS entered into partnership with Bertha Foundation, a philanthropic organisation that funds documentary features.[2] The school has begun to offer documentary courses to reflect this partnership.

In recent years, CFS has hosted student Q&As with filmmakers such as Nick Hornby,[3] George Amponsah (director of _The Hard Stop_),[4] and Sir Ronald Harwood.

Alumni include BAFTA Cymru award-winning director Kim Strobl,[5][6] Bollywood director Zaid Ali Khan,[7] Tamil actor Naga,[8] and Nigerian actor Demola Adedoyin.[9]
