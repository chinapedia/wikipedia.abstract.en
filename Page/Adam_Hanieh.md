ADAM HANIEH is a British development studies academic and human rights activist.

He is a reader in development studies at SOAS, University of London, founding member of the SOAS Centre for Palestine Studies[1] and member of the Council for British Research in the Levant. He is noted for his research on the political economy of the Middle East, labour migration, class and state formation in the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Palestine studies.[2][3]

From 1997â€“2003, he completed an MA in Regional Studies at Al Quds University. Hanieh holds a PhD in political science from York University in Canada, and taught at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates prior to joining SOAS in London.[4]

In September 2016 he was due to deliver a series of guest lectures at Birzeit University in Palestine, but was detained and deported from Israel upon entry and told that he was banned by the Government of Israel from entering Israel/Palestine for ten years. SOAS condemned the ban, and the SOAS Director Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos stated that the incident constituted "an arbitrary breach of academic freedom."[5]
