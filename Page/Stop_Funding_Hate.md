STOP FUNDING HATE is a social media campaign which aims to stop companies from advertising in, and thus providing funds for, certain British newspapers that it argues use "fear and division to sell more papers".[1]


Launch

The Stop Funding Hate campaign was set up in August 2016 by Richard Wilson, a former Corporate Fundraising Officer at Amnesty International. The campaign gained over 70,000 likes on its Facebook page in the first three days of activity[2] and the campaign's launch video was viewed over 6 million times.[3] In February 2017 Stop Funding Hate launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds, finishing with £102,721 raised.[4][5]


Campaigns

The campaign has called on companies including Aldi, Asda, Barclays, British Airways, Co-op UK, Gillette, Iceland, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Lego, Virgin Media and Waitrose to stop advertising in newspapers such as _The Sun_, the _Daily Mail_ and _Daily Express_.[6][7][8]

Stop Funding Hate's first campaign, targeting Virgin Media, claimed that their values were "totally at odds with the Sun’s track record of misleading reporting", and was signed by over 40,000 people.[9][10] Following their coverage of the high court's November ruling on Brexit, advertisers in the _Daily Mail_ were targeted by the campaign and its supporters using the hashtag #StopFundingHate.[11][12] In a Christmas campaign by Stop Funding Hate, the group released a mock advert in the style of John Lewis' Christmas adverts, calling on the department store to stop advertising in certain newspapers.[13]

In August 2017 Stop Funding Hate undertook its first street campaign in conjunction with the social justice charity Citizens UK. The campaign targeted mobile network operators including Sky Mobile, Virgin Mobile UK, BT Mobile, EE Limited, O2 and Tesco Mobile using the slogan "Start Spreading Love".[14]


Results

In September 2016 Specsavers withdrew an advert from the _Daily Express_ after hundreds, including Stop Funding Hate, complained that it was funding "fear and division".[15]

Gary Lineker showed support for the campaign, saying that he had spoken to Walkers about their advertisements in _The Sun_.[16] Following calls from the campaign and its supporters, Lego announced in November 2016 that it was ending its advertising with the _Daily Mail_, stating they were "not planning any future promotional activity with the newspaper", making it the first company to end its advertising in one of the targeted newspapers since the campaign's inception.[17] In February 2017 the internet service provider Plusnet withdrew adverts from _The Sun_ and The Body Shop announced they had no future plans to advertise in _The Daily Mail_ after social media criticism.[18][19] In November 2017 Paperchase also announced that they would stop advertising in _The Daily Mail_, saying that they had "listened to customers".[20]

A campaign which targeted The Co-operative Group led to their chief executive Richard Pennycook saying in 2016 that they would be "looking at our advertising for next year to see whether we can align it more closely with our natural sources of support rather than more generic media advertising".[21] However, in a 2017 update by Nick Crofts, President of the National Members’ Council, it was stated that after investigation, "Many people buy these papers at the Co-op and some of them will be our members. Advertising in these papers also drives sales which are important to our businesses".[22]

Virgin Trains stopped selling The Daily Mail onboard the trains which it operates in conjunction with Stagecoach Group in November 2017. After criticisms that the move censored the newspapers that passengers could read, Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Rail Group, reinstated the paper in January 2018. Speaking in a statement on his own behalf and that of Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter, Branson said: "Brian and I agree that we must not ever be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice. Nor must we be seen to be moralising on behalf of others. Instead we should stand up for the values we hold dear and defend them publicly, as I have done with the Mail on many issues over the years."[23]


Finances

In addition to the £102,721 initially raised, a further crowdfunding campaign generated £80,251 from supporters in January 2018.[24] The campaign that finished in March 2019 raised £5,067 against a target of £45,000.[25]

Accounts filed at Companies House with a balance sheet date of 30 April 2018 showed that Stop Funding Hate had current assets of £130,549 and owed £130,549 to creditors. It had zero net assets and zero reserves.[26]

The Community Interest Company Report (CIC 34) filed with the annual accounts showed that the Stop Funding Hate board had been remunerated.[27]


Criticism

Writing for the _Press Gazette_, Dominic Ponsford criticised Stop Funding Hate and its campaigners for encouraging people to influence the content of newspapers they don't read themselves, and raised concerns about advertisers influencing the content of newspapers.[28] In a response to Ponsford's article, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff argued that Ponsford did not consider the "total vacuum of responsibility within the journalism world when it comes to how our content is going to affect our audience".[29] In _Spiked_, Naomi Firsht described the campaign as "entirely about censorship", arguing that consumers should simply not buy newspapers if they disagree with their content.[30] Writing in _The Spectator_, Brendan O'Neill described the campaign "elitist, repugnant and illiberal, as are all attempts at press censorship".[31] Stop Funding Hate responded to criticisms of censorship by saying that they "fully support freedom of choice & are not calling for any publication to be removed from sale".[32] The _Daily Mail_, responding to Paperchase's decision to cease advertising with them, described Stop Funding Hate as "a small group of hard left Corbynist individuals seeking to suppress legitimate debate and impose their views on the media".[33]
