Sidi_medien.JPG Sidi_medien_03.JPG VALLITANUS OR VALLIS was an ancient Roman–Berber colonia in Carthage, Tunisia. The town is identified with ruins at Sidi Medien,[1][2] where are located the remains of a Roman theatre,[3][4] and a number of Roman inscriptions bearing witness to the town's name, and some local officials of the time can be found near the theatre.[5][6]

Roman Vallitanus was also the seat of an ancient bishopric under the metropolitan of Cartagine.[7] Four bishops from antiquity are known.

-   Bonifatius (Donatist bishop fl.314)
-   Restitutus (Donatist bishop floruit 404)
-   Bonifatius (Catholic bishop fl. 411)
-   Restitutus (Catholic bishop fl.525)

The bishopric ceased to function in the early 8th century with the arrival of Islam. Since the 1920s the diocese has been reestablished in name as a titular see and bishops have been appointed since.[8] The current bishop of Vallitanus is José Rafael Palma Capetillo, who replaced Jean-Michel di Falco Léandri.
