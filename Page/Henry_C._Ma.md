He authorized a management survey conducted by J. Plaridel Silvestre, Regional Commissioner of the Asia Pacific office of the World Scout Bureau in 1975, which resulted in reforms of the Scout organization. Ma was particularly fond of project management was only emerging in the late 1960s. A list in 1975 contained twenty complicated and multi-faceted projects covering facilities, Scout Groups, leaders, youth training, staffing, funding, and even the future.[1]

In 1980, Ma was awarded the 143rd _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.[2]
