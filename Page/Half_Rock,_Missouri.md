HALF ROCK is an unincorporated community in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A post office called Half Rock was established in 1867, and remained in operation until 1900.[2] According to tradition, the community was derisively so named on account of the quality of the coffee at a nearby store (i.e. the coffee was "half rock".)[3]
