SHAIRA ANA TERESIANA LUNA[1] (born September 20, 1986) is a Filipina photographer. She, among others, was known as a "gifted child" and a "Promil kid", having been featured in Wyeth's infant formula ad in 1995.[2][3][4]

Luna is currently a fashion and advertising photographer represented by the international creative talent agency Jed Root Manila,[5][6] founded by American businessman Jed Root in 1989.


Early life and education

Shaira Luna was born on September 20, 1986, in Malate, Manila. She is the oldest child of businessman Bong Luna and Centro Escolar University dentistry graduate Jenny Luna, who were in their middle 20's when she was conceived.[7][8] She has a younger brother. As an infant, Luna reportedly began speaking fluently as early as six months, and can read and write the alphabet at age one. At age two, Luna was already knowledgeable in different branches of science, as well as playing various musical instruments such as the piano and the violin; she began having interests in learning the French and Spanish languages, while she also spoke English fluently.[9][10][11]

Her parents then sought professionals' help due to these capacities Luna was having. A personnel from the Department of Education, Cultural Studies (DECS) discovered that Luna had the IQ of a sixth grader, similar to that of a high school student. According to her mother Jenny, Luna's intelligence might have been a result of heredity, citing her family's history of achievers who graduated from school with honors.[12] She then was advised to have Luna attend a sixth-grade class at the Philippine Christian University, as she would easily get bored in a kindergarten class.[13][14] Another reason Luna was enrolled at PCU was to improve her social skills since she had the tendency to be shy in public.[15]

Luna was only 13 when she enrolled at De La Salle University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in human biology. After shifting to different courses, she dropped out in 2006.[16]


Career

After purchasing a Canon EOS 350D, her first digital single-lens reflex camera, Luna began shooting for months while still studying in college at De La Salle University. She withdrew from the school in 2006 to pursue this career full-time. She described her early experience in photography as "self-taught,"[17][18] during which time she would "literally shoot everything: I tried portraits, I tried food... I would shoot events, birthdays, _binyag_ (Christening), fiesta, _basketball ng liga_ (basketball leagues). _Minsan libing din_ (Sometimes funerals, too)." In a separate interview, she also said that, "Photography was really just a hobby during college. My career developed very gradually and organicallyâ€”I really went through everything before it even occurred to me that this was something that could be done for a living!"[19]


Personal life

Luna is a patron of _ukay-ukay_ stores, a thrift shop in the Philippines.[20][21] She has considered doing vacuum as well as cooking and doing grocery as some of her personal interests, calling vacuuming "[the] best thing next to the glamorous photography business".[22] She has cited _The Pickers_, _Storage Wars_, and _Ancient Aliens_ as some of her favorite television shows. She frequents the humor website 9GAG.[23]
