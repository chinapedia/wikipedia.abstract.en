AUSTAD is a former municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1909 until its dissolution in 1963. The municipality encompassed the area surrounding the Rosfjorden in the southern, coastal part of the present-day municipality of Lyngdal. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Austad where Austad Church is located.[1]


Name

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old _Austad_ farm (Old Norse: _Alvisstaðir_). The first element of the name is derived from the male name _"Ålvir"_ and the last element is _"stad"_ (Old Norse: _staðir_) which means "homestead" or "farm".[2]


History

Austad municipality was created on 1 January 1909 when the old municipality of Lyngdal was divided into three separate municipalities: Lyngdal, Austad, and Kvås. Upon its creation, Austad had a population of 1,263. On 7 January 1916, there was a small border adjustment which transferred a small area (population: 4) from Austad to the neighboring municipality of Spind. On 1 January 1963, Austad and Kvås were re-incorporated into Lyngdal along with the Gitlevågområdet area of Spangereid. Prior to the merger, Austad had a population of 608.[3]
