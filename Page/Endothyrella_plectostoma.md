_ENDOTHYRELLA PLECTOSTOMA_ is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Plectopylidae.


Taxonomy

_Endothyrella plectostoma_ is the type species of the genus _Endothyrella_.[1] This species was described under the name _Helix plectostoma_ by William Henry Benson in 1836.[2] It was the first described species that is currently placed in the family Plectopylidae.[3]


Distribution

The distribution of _Endothyrella plectostoma_ includes India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.[4] It is the only species from the genus _Endothyrella_ that was reported from Myanmar.[5]


Description

The most important shell characters for identification of _Endothyrella plectostoma_ include: very narrow umbilicus; there are five rows of hairs; there is present horizontal parietal plica.[6]

_Endothyrella plectostoma_ has a very small, sinistral shell with very narrow umbilicus.[7] The dorsal surface is conical.[8] Hairs are standing in five rows on the body whorl.[9] Palatal plicae is more or less straight.[10] The 4th and 5th plica is divided.[11] The lamella is slightly curved, with short lower and long upper elongation in anterior direction.[12] There are two denticles posteriorly, one above and one below.[13]

The width of the shell is 8.1–9.0 mm.[14] The height of the shell is 4.6–5.1 mm.[15]

Similar species

The most similar species to _Endothyrella plectostoma_ include _Endothyrella affinis_ and _Endothyrella sowerbyi_.[17] _Endothyrella affinis_ and _Endothyrella tricarinata_ are similar to _Endothyrella plectostoma_ in the narrow umbilicus.[18] All other _Endothyrella_ species of similar size have wider umbilicus.[19] _Endothyrella plectostoma_ is usually smaller, darker than _Endothyrella affinis_, it has a horizontal, relatively long plica anterior to the lamella, and has the periostracal folds arranged on five spiral line.[20] In contrast, _Endothyrella affinis_ lacks the horizontal parietal plica and has four hair rows.[21] Moreover, _Endothyrella plectostoma_ has a narrower umbilicus and more elevated spire than _Endothyrella affinis_.[22]

_Endothyrella sowerbyi_ has a wider umbilicus and a thinner peristome than _Endothyrella plectostoma_.[23] Moreover, the spire is lower and the dorsal side is rather domed in _Endothyrella sowerbyi_ (conical in _Endothyrella plectostoma_), and the main parietal plica is weaker or missing in _Endothyrella sowerbyi_.[24]

_Endothyrella tricarinata_ differs from _Endothyrella plectostoma_ by the larger size, more conical dorsal surface, narrower umbilicus, the shouldered whorls, the presence of only four rows of hairs, and the stronger sculpture.[25]
