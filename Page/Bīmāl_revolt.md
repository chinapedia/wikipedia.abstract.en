The BIMAL REVOLT, BIMAL RESISTANCE, MERCA REVOLT or BANADIR RESISTANCE was a guerrilla war against the Italian Somaliland in southern Somalia. It was fought from 1896 to 1926 and largely concentrated in Lower Shebelle, Banadir and Middle Shebelle.

It is compared to the war of the Mad Mullah in northern Somalia.[1][2] Named after the Bimal clan since they were the major element in the resistance.[3]


History

In the 1890's Italy occupied Marka the center of the Bimal culture. This sparked the beginning and outrage among the Bimal clan, many of them joined the Bimal resistance.

An Italian resident of the city was assassinated in 1904 , his name was Giacomo Trevis. In response Italy occupied the port town of Jazira about 30 miles south of Mogadishu[4]

One of the Italian`s greatest fears was the spread of 'Dervishism' ( had come to mean revolt) in the south and the strong Bimaal tribe of Benadir whom already were at war with the Italians, while not following the religious message or adhering to the views of Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, understood greatly his goal and political tactics. The dervishes in this case were engaged in supplying arms to the Bimaal.[5]

The Italians wanted to bring in an end to the Bimaal revolt and at all cost prevent a Bimal-Dervish alliance, which lead them to use the forces of Obbia and the Mijertein as prevention.[6]
