ANDERSON WENDLE LEANDRO SEALY (born 10 July 1982) is a former Barbadian cricketer who represented West Indies B and the Combined Campuses and Colleges in West Indian domestic cricket. He played as a left-arm orthodox bowler.

Sealy represented Barbados at under-19 level, but never played for the senior national team.[1] He made his first-class debut in the 2001–02 Busta Cup, playing for West Indies B, and finished the season with a team-high 19 wickets (including 5/79 against Bangladesh A).[2] Despite his good form, Sealy was not retained in the West Indies B squad for the 2002–03 season.[3] He returned to the squad for the 2003–04 Carib Beer Cup, but played just two matches.[4]

After a gap of over four years, Sealy returned to top-level West Indian domestic cricket for the 2008–09 WICB Cup (a limited-overs competition), representing the Combined Campuses team.[5] He took four wickets in two matches, including 3/30 against the Windward Islands, and was retained in the squad for the 2008–09 Regional Four Day Competition. In that competition, Sealy took 15 wickets from four matches, including 4/66 against Barbados and 4/170 against the Leeward Islands.[6] However, he was left out of the squad for the following season, instead only being named as a reserve.[7]
