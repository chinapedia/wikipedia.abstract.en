The ADELAIDE HUNT CLUB is an Australian fox hunting club founded in the 1840s.


History

Originally called THE ADELAIDE HOUNDS, the club was founded in Adelaide in the early 1840s.[1] As early as 3 July 1841, the Governor of South Australia Sir George Grey KCB along with about 25 horsemen, hounds and ladies in carriages met for a day’s hunting, on this day a wild dog was the quarry. Without foxes to hunt, wild dogs, kangaroos and emus were the early quarry.[2]

Due to lack of support, hunting declined in Adelaide and the pack was dispersed in the 1850s but was revived in 1869 by a group of wealthy sportsmen led by William Blackler, who imported sufficient hounds to form a pack. The first hunt with his pack was held on 24 May of that year and attracted many interested huntsmen and spectators. In 1871, after a dispute with the Club, Blackler withdrew his support, and at the instigation of James A. Ellery passed his pack to the newly-formed South-East (later Mount Gambier) Hunt Club.[3]

Deer hunting was attempted on several occasions, but provided rather pedestrian sport[4] and the most interesting riding was provided by drag hunting, where an aniseed scent trail was dragged over a course guaranteed to present challenges to the abilities of horse and rider.[5]

The club is very closely linked with the city’s history with events such as the annual ball and steeplechase being social highlights of the new colony. The pack was originally kennelled at various locations on the Adelaide Plains although urban expansion meant they had to move in the late-1900s. The club's current kennels are located at Woodside in the Adelaide Hills.[6]

In 1901 Simpson Newland was president of the club, which at that time held regular meets in the Erindale area.[7]
