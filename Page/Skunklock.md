The SKUNKLOCK is a brand of bicycle lock for securing a bicycle to a pole or other fixture, similar to a standard U-lock. Its cylindrical body contains a noxious chemical inside that is released if the body is cut. The chemical compound is meant as a deterrent to someone attempting to cut the lock and steal the bicycle. The lock is being funded through crowdfunding, with an announced shipping date of June 2017.[1]


Design

The Skunklock is constructed of medium-carbon steel[2] like a typical U-Lock, but contains a pressurized gas that will spray out if the lock is cut.[3]

The makers of Skunklock compare the effects to those of pepper spray, but note that the formula for the chemical inside is proprietary. They say it will temporarily disable a thief by inducing vomiting in 99 percent of people, while making it difficult to see and breathe.[4] The chemicals used are food-grade and non-toxic, sharing chemical similarities to Swedish fermented herring.[5]

Skunklock is being financed through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, which launched in October 2016 with a goal of $20,000 in pre-orders. The makers announced later that month that they had achieved their funding goal.[6]
