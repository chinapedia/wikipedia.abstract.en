PROSHYAN BRANDY FACTORY (), is one of the oldest producers of alcoholic drinks in Armenia, located in Yerevan, on the Ashtarak Highway leading to the village of Proshyan.[1] The factory is mainly famous for its cognac brand _Mané_.


History

Originally, the Proshyan Brandy Factory has been in operation in the village of Proshyan since 1885. However, the current production facilities were opened in 1980 as a state-owned enterprise by the government of the Armenian SSR, at the northwestern outskirts of Yerevan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the factory was privatized in 1996.[2]

Armenian cognac (brandy) is the main product of the factory which is derived form the grapes of the fertile Ararat plain. However, the factory has also a variety of other products including, wine, fruit wine, liqueur, vodka, and canned food. The company also produces a large collection of souvenir brandy. The production is entirely based on Italian technology.

The products of the factory are constantly exported to Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Belarus, Lithuania, Georgia, Germany, Estonia, United States, Greece, Poland, Israel, South Korea, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.[3]

In addition to its main factory in Yerevan, the company also operates the Proshyan-Aygestan winery in the Aygestan village of Ararat Province and the Proshyan-Armavir winery in the Armavir village of Armavir Province. However, the entire bottling process takes place in the main factory in Yerevan.
