Early life

Danial Jones was born June 30, 1830 in Reading, Pennsylvania to Henry and Catharine Jones. Henry was a slave on the Eastern Shore of Maryland until the age of 25 when he escaped into Pennsylvania. The couple had five children. At age 10, Daniel moved to Philadelphia where he learned to be a barber. After seven years, he joined an ocean vessel. As a mariner he once landed in Charleston, South Carolina. Slavery was still legal in South Carolina and black people, free and slave, had a nightly curfew, but Jones desired to go into town. When a bell rang at nine o'clock signalling the start of curfew, Jones did not know what it meant and remained on the streets. A patrol saw him, and Jones realizing his danger, ran back to the ship, making it just in time. January 16, 1849 he joined the California Gold Rush and traveled on the ship, _Gray Eagle_ around Cape Horn to California, landing in San Francisco in May 1849. He then worked in gold mines in California and Oregon.[1]
