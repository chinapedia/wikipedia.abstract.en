LOTERÍA is a Panama Metro station on Line 1. The station was not in the original metro plans and was the twelfth station to be opened.[1] The official opening was carried out by President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela on 27 August 2014, four months after the network had opened.[2] The station was originally to be called _Marañón_ after a nearby district, but, in February 2012, was renamed to reflect its proximity to the offices of Panama's national lottery.[3]

In its first year of operations, Lotería was the ninth most used station of the twelve on the network at that time, used by 8% of the network's passengers.[4]
