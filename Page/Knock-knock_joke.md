The KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE is a question-and-answer joke, typically ending with a pun. Knock-knock jokes are primarily seen as children's jokes, though there are exceptions.

The scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house. The teller of the joke says, "Knock, knock!"; the recipient responds, "Who's there?" The teller gives a name (such as "Noah") or a description (such as "Police") or something that purports to be a name (such as "Needle"). The other person then responds by asking the caller's surname ("Noah who?" "Police who?" "Needle who?"), to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name (" place I can spend the night?" " let me in—it's cold out here!" " help with the groceries!").[1]

The formula of the joke is usually followed strictly, though there are cases where it is subverted:



        Knock, knock.
        Who's there?
        [ Someone or something ]
        [ Someone or something ] who?
        [ Punchline ]

As shown below, knock-knock jokes can take the form of simple puns on the name given (1), jokes specifically involving the door-knocking scenario (2), or puns on the "who?" phrase of the speaker (3). {{columnslist|colwidth=30em|

History

A possible source of the joke is William Shakespeare's _Macbeth_; first performed in 1606. In Act 2, Scene 3 the porter is very hungover from the previous night. During his monologue he uses "Knock, knock! Who's there" as a refrain while he is speaking:



        Knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
        Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
        himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
        time; have napkins enow about you; here
        you'll sweat for't.



        Knock, knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
        name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
        swear in both the scales against either scale;
        who committed treason enough for God's sake,
        yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
        in, equivocator.

Writing in the Oakland Tribune, Merely McEvoy recalled a style of joke from around 1900 where a person would ask a question such as "Do you know Arthur?", the unsuspecting listener responding with "Arthur who?" and the joke teller answering "Arthurmometer!"[2]

A variation of the format in the form of a children's game was described in 1929.[3] In the game of Buff, a child with a stick thumps it on the ground, and the dialogue ensues:



        Knock, knock!
        Who's there?
        Buff.
        What says Buff?
        Buff says Buff to all his men, And I say Buff to you again.

In 1936, the standard knock-knock joke format was used in a newspaper advertisement.[4] That joke was:



        Knock, knock!
        Who's there?
        Rufus.
        Rufus who?
        the most important part of your house.

A 1936 Associated Press newspaper article said that "What's This?" had given way to "Knock Knock!" as a favorite parlor game.[5] The article also said that "knock knock" seemed to be an outgrowth of making up sentences with difficult words, an old parlor favorite. A popular joke of 1936 was "Knock knock. Who's there? Edward Rex. Edward Rex who? the Coronation."[6] Fred Allen's 30 December 1936 radio broadcast included a humorous wrapup of the year's least important events, including a supposed interview with the man who "invented a negative craze" on 1 April: "Ramrod Dank... the first man to coin a Knock Knock."[7]


Popular culture

"Knock knock" was the catchphrase of music hall performer Wee Georgie Wood, who was recorded in 1936 saying it in a radio play, but he simply used the words as a reference to his surname and did not use it as part of the well-known joke formula.[8] The format was well known in the UK and US in the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor. It then enjoyed a renaissance after the jokes became a regular part of the badinage on _Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In_.[9]

According to the _World Encyclopedia of Cartoons_, published by Chelsea House, New York and London 1980, cartoonist Bob Dunn “invented the Knock Knock joke in a million selling book” distributed by Whitman Publishing in 1936. One of the answers on the game show Jeopardy broadcast on 12-27-1989 “Dunn, Dunn Who..Creator of this Joke in 1936” The question "What is the Knock Knock joke."
