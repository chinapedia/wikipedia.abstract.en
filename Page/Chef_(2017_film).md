Critical reception

Raja Sen of NDTV gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, "Saif Ali Khan and the actors try hard, but lazy writing and direction make Chef a flavourless and bland meal".[6] Meena Iyer of The Times of India praised the performance of Saif Ali Khan, the leading actor of the film and gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 saying that, "Chef is predictable in parts, the journey is an enjoyable one."[7] Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "Saif Ali Khan’s Chef offers moments of brilliance which, if weaved in a more organised manner, may have given us a light, affable film. But a lazy and rather uninterested narrative takes away the pleasure."[8] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 and said that, "In a premise begging for food porn, there’s a shocking scarcity of sensory pleasure or vision. Chef is too dull to be delicious."[9] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said that, "Saif Ali Khan's film has some interesting flavours. But 'Chef' feels derivative, and is a late coming of age tale of Peter-Pan-like adults. And that's got to do with the uneven writing. It is a good-looking film, with good-looking people only."[10] Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 saying that, "Chef isn’t perfect; it lags in places, offers quick-fix solutions to characters’ problems, and feels wholly familiar. But at a little over two hours, it doesn’t ask much of you, and offers some pleasure in Saif Ali Khan’s return to form as an actor hard to look away from."[11]
