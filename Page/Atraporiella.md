_ATRAPORIELLA_ is a monotypic fungal genus in the family Steccherinaceae. It contains the crust fungus _ATRAPORIELLA NEOTROPICA_, known only from Belize.


Taxonomy

_Atraporiella_ is a monotypic genus, containing the single poroid species _Atraporiella neotropica_, described as new to science by Norwegian mycologist Leif Ryvarden in 2007. This crust fungus is found in Belize, where it grows on decomposing wood. The type collection was made in the Cayo District in November 2001.[1] Molecular analysis suggests that the genus belongs in the family Steccherinaceae.[2]


Description

The fruit body of _Atraporiella neotropica_ is in the form of a small crust fungus, with length and width dimensions of up to , and a thickness of up to . When fresh, the pore surface is white, but it readily stains dark brown to black when bruised. The pores are angular, numbering about five to six per millimetre. _Atraporiella_ has a monomitic hyphal structure (containing only generative hyphae), and these hyphae are highly branched, 3–6 μm, and have clamp connections. The spores are ellipsoid, thin-walled, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and do not react with Melzer's reagent. They measure 3–3.5 by 1.2–1.4 µm.[3]
