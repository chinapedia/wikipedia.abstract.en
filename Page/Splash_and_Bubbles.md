_SPLASH AND BUBBLES_ is an American computer-animated children's television series created by John Tartaglia. The series debuted on PBS Kids on November 23, 2016, after _Wild Kratts: Creatures of the Deep Sea_.[1] It is produced using motion capture that blends with animatronic interfaces which enables the crew to make animation.[2]


Premise

_Splash and Bubbles_ follows a yellowback fusilier (though at times he and the narrator claim that he is a yellowtail fusilier), Splash, who settles in Reeftown after looking all over the ocean. He then befriends Bubbles, a mandarin dragonet, and the duo, along with friends Dunk and Ripple, explore the reef to venture and make new friends. Each episode also includes a documentary segment, _Get Your Feet Wet_,[3] which features kids asking questions that are occasionally followed up by a musical number.
