The AUCKLAND PRIDE FESTIVAL is an annual festival held in Auckland, New Zealand. It began in 2013[1] and is New Zealand's largest Pride Festival.[2] The Auckland Pride Festival is overseen by a board of nine community members, there is also a Festival Director and a Parade Director who respectively organise the Festival and Parade.


History

2013

2014

2015

In 2015, the New Zealand Police were allowed to march in their uniform.[3]

2016

2017

2018

This was the 6th year of the Auckland Pride Festival, there was over 80 events in the festival[4] and 70 floats in the Parade.[5] Jacinda Ardern became the first New Zealand Prime Minister to walk in the Auckland Pride Parade.[6]

2019

The Auckland Pride Board made the decision after a number of community hui (meetings) to not allow Police to march in their uniform for the 2019 Auckland Pride Parade.[7] This decision was highly controversial, and a number of sponsors withdrew financial support in response, including Vodafone, NZME, ANZ, BNZ, Westpac, Fletcher Building, and SKY City.[8][9][10][11][12][13] In response to this withdrawal, those who supported the Board's decision created a crowdfunding page, which raised $30,468.40.[14]

Some of those who opposed the Board's decision signed a motion of no confidence, and called for a SGM. This motion was defeated at a SGM on December 6, 2018.[15]

A new organisation, "Rainbow Pride Auckland" has formed to establish a “more inclusive and non-judgmental feel to its direction; not only the vast majority of our communities but those individuals and groups who feel marginalised,” following a controversial period which saw the traditional Parade abandoned in favour of a smaller scale grassroots march.

The Auckland Pride Parade, much like the Hero Parade was situated on Ponsonby Road, Auckland until 2019 where the Auckland Pride Festival lost the majority of sponsorship due to the choice to not allow the New Zealand Police march in their uniform.

The Auckland Pride Parade is also one of the closing events and is held on the last weekend of the Auckland Pride Festival.
