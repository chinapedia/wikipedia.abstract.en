The is situated in the Iwata city of Shizuoka Prefecture. In Japan during Nara period, lot of provincial temples and nunneries were built across the country. This temple was built on the Emperor Shoumu's orders in 741. Shōmu (701 – 756?) decreed both a kokubun-ji for monks and a kokubunni-ji (国分尼寺?) for nuns to be established in each province.

When this temple was excavated in 1951, it was discovered that the temple buildings were in the "Shichidō garan" formation, a type of formation similar to Todaiji-temple in Nara. It was designated as a special historic site of the Japan in 1962.

The recent excavations estimate that the site's area was about 180 meters long from east to west and about 253 meters-long from North to South, and that it existed from the later half of the 10th century to the 11th century. In the Middle Ages, number of Kokubun-ji temples declined, but a small temple was built in one corner of Tōtōmi Kokubun temple.

Now the site is preserved as a historical site park and is a popular place to relax. The Iwata station's building is reminiscent of Totomi Kokubunji temple.JR_central_Iwata_station_2008-01-13.jpg
