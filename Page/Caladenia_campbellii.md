_CALADENIA CAMPBELLII_, commonly known as THICKSTEM FAIRY FINGERS or THICK-STEM CALADENIA, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Tasmania. It is a ground orchid with a single, sparsely hairy leaf and one or two flowers that are pinkish on the outside and cream-coloured on the inside. The flowers are self-pollinating and short-lived.


Description

_Caladenia campbellii_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which grows singly or in small groups. It has an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, narrow linear, dark green leaf, long and wide.[1][2]

There are one or two flowers in diameter borne on a fairly thick (about ), sparsely hairy spike high. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and oblong to narrow egg-shaped. The lateral sepals and petals are lance-shaped, long, about wide, cream-coloured on the inside and pinkish on the outside. The labellum is about long and wide and cream-coloured with reddish lines and a yellowish tip. It has three distinct lobes and is erect near its base then more or less horizontal with the tip curving downwards. The lateral lobes are about wide and more or less erect. The mid-lobe is narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide with one broad pair of teeth on its edges. There are two rows of yellow to orange calli with white stalks in the centre of the labellum. The column is long and curves forward near its end. Flowering occurs over a very short period about the first two weeks of November but the flowers are only open for a day or two before self-pollinating.[3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia campbellii_ was first formally described by David Jones in 1998 and the description was published in _Australian Orchid Research_. The type specimen was collected in Sisters Hills in the north-west of Tasmania.[5][6] The specific epithet (campbellii) honours Jeff Campbell, who collected many orchid species for the Launceston Herbarium, including the type specimen for this species.[7][8]


Distribution and habitat

This caladenia grows on slopes and ridges in stunted coastal scrub and forest in a few scattered locations in the north-west of Tasmania.[9]


Conservation

_Caladenia campbellii_ is listed as "Endangered" on the Tasmanian _Threatened Species Protection Act 1995_ and as "Critically Endangered" under the _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ (EPBC Act).[10] There are only 60-100 mature plants known, in two populations, each containing fewer than fifty plants. The main threats to the species are agricultural development and vehicle disturbance.[11]
