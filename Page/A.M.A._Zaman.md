Janab A.M.A. ZAMAN was an Indian politician and trade unionist. As of 1936 he served as councillor in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.[1] He won the Hooghly labour seat in the 1936-1937 Bengal Legislative Assembly election.[2] At the time he belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, but he was known for shifting party affiliations frequently.[3]

A.M.A. Zaman was involved in different trade unions. He was a leader of Jute mill workers during the struggle for independence.[4] Whereas many other leaders hailed from the _bhadralok_, upper classes, A.M.A. Zaman hailed from a working-class background and had been a jute mill worker himself.[5] In the midst of the 1936-1937 labour unrest he founded a jute mill workers union, which was registered in 1936.[6] In July 1937 A.M.A. Zaman was convicted of rioting at a strike in the Wellington Jute Mills in Rishra, but thousands of Hooghly workers turned to the streets to demand his release.[7] A.M.A. Zaman was one of the key speakers of the mass labour rally in Calcutta of July 29, 1937.[8] In December 1937 he was elected general secretary of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress.[9] However, his influence in Hooghly decreased as _sardars_ and _babus_ disseminated a rumour that he had taken a bribe from mill management.[10]

A.M.A. Zaman left the CSP in 1939, after which the party ceased to be influential in Hooghly District.[11] He belonged to the grouping that opposed Indrajit Gupta's influence in the BPTUC.[12]

A.M.A. Zaman was re-elected from the Hooghly-cum-Serampore Registered Factories, Labour seat in the Bengal Legislative Assembly in the 1946 election.[13] He belonged to the Indian National Congress during this period.[14]

After Independence, A.M.A. Zaman won the Jalangi constituency seat of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in the 1951 election as an Indian National Congress candidate.[15][16] As of 1956 he served as Parliamentary Secretary for the Labour Department.[17]

He was the founding president of the Shiva Glass Employees Union during his tenure as legislator.[18]
