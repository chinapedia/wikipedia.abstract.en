The ISLAND BAY YACHT CLUB is a private yacht club located in Springfield, Illinois, on the shore of Lake Springfield.[1]


History

The Island Bay Yacht Club was incorporated in 1935. Earliest fleets to succeed in sailing were the Star, Snipe and Sunfish. In 1979 Island Bay became the first inland freshwater yacht club to receive the St. Petersburg Trophy for having the best regatta of the year, presented by US Sailing, for the Sunfish North American Championship. In 2011 IBYC was the site for the 65th Western Hemisphere Star Regatta, which was the first time in the regatta's history that the International Star Class Yacht Racing Association elected to have the event on an inland lake instead of an ocean.[2][3]
