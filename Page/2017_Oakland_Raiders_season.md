The 2017 OAKLAND RAIDERS SEASON was the 58th overall season of the Oakland Raiders' franchise, the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League, their 23rd season since their return to Oakland, and the third and final season under head coach Jack Del Rio. It was the first season for the team since the franchise announced its impending relocation to Las Vegas.

The Raiders began the season on September 10 at the Tennessee Titans and finished the season December 31 at the Los Angeles Chargers. The Raiders, as they did in 2016, played one home game in Mexico City, this time against the New England Patriots.[1] Although the league approved the Raiders' eventual relocation to Las Vegas on March 27, 2017, the team still maintained its lease at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and intended to use the stadium for at least the 2017 and 2018 seasons and, likely, the 2019 season.[2][3]

After a 12–4 record the prior season that saw the Raiders return to the playoffs for the first time since 2002, the Raiders finished the season 6–10, having the biggest drop in number of wins since 2003. They finished in third place in the AFC West and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The season also marked a return to a double-digit loss record for the first time since 2014.

The offense struggled under first year offensive coordinator Todd Downing, ranking 17th (tied with Denver) in yardage rankings, 25th in rushing yards, and 23rd in points. The defense also struggled under Ken Norton Jr., having no interceptions under Norton. Norton was fired on November 21, 2017.[4] However, the defense showed some improvement under Norton's replacement, John Pagano.[5]

The Raiders fired head coach Jack Del Rio on December 31, 2017, following the final game of the season and a four-game losing streak.[6][7][8]

Staff


Final roster


Preseason

The Raiders' preliminary preseason schedule was announced on April 10. In preparation for the team's eventual move to Las Vegas, the Raiders sought to play at least one of their two preseason games at Sam Boyd Stadium.[24] When the preseason opponents were announced, both home games were scheduled for Oakland.

Donald Penn holdout

Offensive tackle Donald Penn chose not to report to training camp on July 28 as he was unhappy with his contract which was to pay him $6.2 million this season in the second season of a two-year deal.[25] Penn ended his holdout without a new deal and reported to the team on August 23.[26][27] Penn, sought to be paid as a top ten LT in the league, said, “We have a great owner, a good GM. I came in here putting my trust in them.”[28]

Janikowski contract issue

Prior to Week 1 of the regular season, the Raiders sought to have K Sebastian Janikowski agree to rework his contract to pay him less than the $4 million owed to him for the 2017 season.[29] Janikowski remained on the roster as of September 5, meaning he was guaranteed to be paid $238,000.[30] The Raiders reportedly worked out three kickers in anticipation of being unable to reach an agreement with Janikowski.[31] On September 6, Janikowski agreed to a $1 million pay cut to stay with the team.[32] Three days later, Janikowski was placed on injured reserve due to a back injury.[33]

Game summaries

Week 1: at Tennessee Titans

For the third consecutive season, the Raiders traveled to Nashville to take on the Tennessee Titans.[34] It also marked the second consecutive year that the Raiders began the season on the road. On September 9, one day before the first game of the season, the Raiders placed Sebastian Janikowski on injured reserve due to an injured back.[35] They signed Giorgio Tavecchio off the practice squad to do the kicking.[36]

The Raiders started well as the Titans tried to surprise the Raiders with an onside kick on the opening kickoff which the Raiders recovered. Four plays later, Derek Carr hit Amari Cooper who bowled into the endzone for an eight-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders the lead 7–0. The Titans answered on their ensuing drive, going 75 yards on 12 plays with Marcus Mariota rushing for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the game. The Raiders came back as Tavecchio hit his first career field goal, a 20-yarder, to give the Raiders a 10–7 lead. After exchanging punts in the early part of the second quarter, the Titans tied the game with 43 seconds remaining in the half on a Ryan Succop 23-yard field goal. The Raider offense moved 41 yards with time winding down to set up Tavecchio's second field goal, from 52 yards out, to give the Raiders the halftime lead 13–10.[37]

In the second half, the Raider defense held the Titans to punts on consecutive drives as the Raiders notched another 52-yard field goal to extend the lead to 16–10 with a little over four minutes left in the third period. The Raider defense prevented a Titans touchdown on the ensuing drive, forcing the Titans to settle for a 26-yard field goal which narrowed the gap to 16–13 as the period expired. In the fourth quarter, Carr led the Raiders on a seven play, 70-yard drive capped off by a Seth Roberts 19-yard touchdown reception. The Raiders defense, which had struggled immensely the previous year, forced the Titans to punt and then held them to a field goal with 4:49 remaining. Another Tavecchio field goal, this time from 43 yards out, extended the lead to 26–16 with 1:14 left in the game. The Titans could muster no more, missing a 52-yard field goal with 12 seconds remaining as the Raiders pulled out the win 26–16.[38]

In the win, Tavecchio became the first kicker in NFL history to make two 50-yard field goals in an NFL debut.[39] Following his performance, Tavecchio was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week.[40] Marshawn Lynch ran for 76 yards on 18 carries in his Raider debut.[41] Carr threw for 262 yards with two touchdown passes to lead the Raiders to a 1–0 record to start the season.

Week 2: vs. New York Jets

The Raiders opened the home portion of their schedule against the New York Jets. After the teams exchanged three-and-outs on their first possessions, the Raiders moved downfield on an 81-yard drive that culminated in a Derek Carr to Michael Crabtree two-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders an early 7–0 lead. After another Jets punt, the Raiders went 85 yards as Carr hit Crabtree from 26 yards out to extend the lead to 14–0. The Jets answered with a 75-yard drive which ended with a Jermaine Kearse 34-yard pass from Josh McCown for a touchdown, reducing the Raider lead to 14–7. The Raider offense stalled on their next two possessions as the Jets added a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 14–10. With 1:50 remaining in the first half, the Raiders were forced to punt, but Jet returner Kalif Raymond muffed the punt and the Raiders recovered at the Jets four yard line. Three plays later, Oakland native Marshawn Lynch scored from two yards out, his first touchdown as a Raider, to give the Raiders the 21–10 halftime lead.[42]

The Jets began the second half with a field goal that again narrowed the lead, this time to 21–13. The Raiders, however, answered the score convincingly, scoring three touchdowns on their next three possessions as Cordarelle Patterson and Jalen Richard each scored on long rushing plays and Carr hit Crabtree again from 19 yards out after a Jets fumble to push the lead to 42–13. The Jets added a touchdown midway through the fourth period, but the Raider offense ate up the remaining time on the clock, using 8:17 to go 32 yards before a Georgio Tavecchio 29-yard field goal pushed the lead to 45–20 with 25 seconds remaining. The 45–20 win moved the Raiders to 2–0 on the season, the first time since 2002 that they had started a season 2–0.[43]

Derek Carr completed 23 of 28 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns, all to Michael Crabtree. Crabtree caught six passes for 80 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.[44] Marshawn Lynch only rushed for 45 yards on 12 carries, but did get a touchdown as the Raiders rushed for 180 yards in the game. The Raider defense played well again limiting the Jets to 276 yards in the game and sacking Jets QB Josh McCown four times.

Week 3: at Washington Redskins

The Raiders traveled to take on Washington on Sunday Night Football. Beginning a rough night for Derek Carr, on the second play of the game, Carr threw his first interception on the season. Washington took advantage of the turnover, driving 67 yards on eight plays as Kirk Cousins hit Chris Thompson on a 22-yard pass to give Washington the lead 7–0. The teams exchanged punts on each of their next three possessions, but the Raiders turned the ball over again with 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter when Carr was picked off for the second time in the game. Washington again took advantage, driving 72 yards and scoring their second touchdown on a Vernon Davis 18-yard touchdown catch. As a result, the Raiders trailed 14–0 at the half. The Raider offense was completely shut down in the first half, managing only 47 yards from scrimmage.

Washington continued to dominate the Raiders in the second half, driving 75 yards on the opening possession and upping the lead to 21–0 on a Josh Doctson 52-yard touchdown catch. A punt by the Raiders followed and Washington missed a field goal attempt on their next possession as the score remained 21–0. On the Raiders next possession, they were forced to punt, but Jamison Crowder muffed the punt and the Raiders recovered at the Washington 18-yard line. Two plays later, Carr hit Jared Cook from 21 yards out to notch the Raiders first points and cutting the lead to 21–7. A Washington field goal moved the lead to 24–7 as the Raiders were forced to punt again. Following a fumble on the next Washington possession, the Raiders could not get into the end zone from the Washington 20 and were forced to settle for a Giorgio Tavecchio 22-yard field goal. Washington answered the field goal with their own to move the lead back to 17 at 27–10. Neither team could muster anything further as the Raiders fell 27–10. The loss moved the Raiders to 2–1 on the season.[45]

The disappointing performance was led by the Raider offense which went 0–11 on third down tries and managed only 128 total yards. Meanwhile, the Raider defense gave up 472 yards to Washington, 356 through the air.[46]

Week 4: at Denver Broncos

The Raiders next traveled to Denver for their first division game of the year. Once again, the Raider offense struggled, not managing any points until the second quarter. The Denver offense looked good on its second possession of the game, moving 88 yards on seven plays and opening the scoring as Trevor Siemian hit A. J. Derby on a 22-yard pass and catch for a touchdown. Following a quick Raider possession and trailing 7–0, the Raider defense was able to limit Denver to a Brandon McManus 28-yard field goal, stopping the Broncos on the 79-yard drive. Finally, with 5:59 seconds remaining in the second quarter, the Raiders offense came alive. Beginning on their own one-yard line, the Raiders quickly moved out to their 36-yard line before Derek Carr hit Johnny Holton on a bomb for a 64-yard touchdown pass which brought the score to 10–7. The half ended with both offenses managing nothing further.[47]

The Raiders began the second half with the ball, but could not manage a first down again, punting the ball back to the Broncos. Denver capitalized, driving 55 yards before settling for another McManus field goal to move the score to 13–7. A three-and-out by the Raiders on their ensuing possession led to another McManus field goal which extended the Bronco lead to 16–7. Looking to close the gap, the Raiders again failed to manage a first down and attempted a fake punt from inside their own 35-yard line where punter Marquette King attempted to run for the first down, but was instead dropped for a three-yard loss. The Broncos failed to capitalize as McManus missed a 29-yard field goal. Derek Carr was sacked on the first play of the Raiders next possession and had to leave the game with a back injury. Backup quarterback EJ Manuel could not get a first down as the Raiders were forced to punt again with less than three minutes remaining in the third quarter. Neither team managed any points on their first possessors of the fourth quarter. With 8:30 remaining in the game, the Raiders went no huddle and EJ Manuel led the team down the field with five consecutive completions. However, the drive stalled and the Raiders were forced to settled for a Giorgio Tavecchio 38-yard field goal with 5:27 left in the game. The Raider defense forced Denver to punt and Manuel took over with 4:16 left in the game. Completing three of four passes, the Raiders moved to the Denver 41-yard line. However, Manuel's next pass was intercepted by the Broncos at the Denver eight-yard line with 1:46 remaining in the game to end the Raider comeback hopes.[48]

For the second consecutive week, the Raider offense struggled managing only 24 yards rushing while only putting up 249 yard through the air. The Raider defense played well limiting the Broncos to only 298 total yards. The following day, it was announced that Carr had broken a bone in his back (transverse process fracture) and would miss two to six weeks.[49][50]

Week 5: vs. Baltimore Ravens

After playing three of their first four games on the road, the Raiders returned home for the first of three straight home games against Baltimore. Without Derek Carr due to a fracture in his back, EJ Manuel started for the Raiders.[51] The Raiders defense again struggled, giving up 365 total yards, 222 through the air. Joe Flacco and Mike Wallace torched the Raider secondary, connecting on three passes of more than 20 yards. A 52-yard pass from Flacco to Wallace set up the first Raven touchdown on their first possession. Trailing 7–0, Raider tight end Jared Cook fumbled on the ensuing possession and Jimmy Smith returned the fumble 47 yards to put the Raiders in 14–0 hole with over 11 minutes remaining in the first quarter. The Raiders marched 61 yards on 12 plays on their next possession, but had to settle for a Giorgio Tavecchio 32-yard field goal. The Ravens extended the lead on their next possession, going 75 yards on 15 plays before Javorius Allen plunged in from one yard out to extend the lead to 21–3 early in the second quarter. EJ Manuel would find Michael Crabtree on a 41-yard touchdown pass following a scramble, but the Ravens added a field goal before the half to move the score to 24–10.

In the second half, the Raiders pulled within a touchdown following a Marshawn Lynch three-yard score. However, the Raider offense could muster no more as EJ Manuel was sacked three times in the game and was under constant pressure from the Ravens. Two more field goals by the Ravens extended the lead to 30–17 with just over two minutes remaining and sealed the Raiders' third straight loss on the season.[52]

Week 6: vs. Los Angeles Chargers

Looking to stop a three-game losing streak, the Raiders welcomed Derek Carr back after missing one week due to injury to face the Los Angeles Chargers. However, things did not start well for Carr as he threw an interception on his first pass of the day and the Chargers took over at the Raider 30-yard line. the defense held the Chargers to a field goal attempt from 48 yards out which was no good. The Raiders took advantage and moved the ball down the field before Carr hit Michael Crabtree from 23 yards out to give the Raiders a 7–0 lead. Neither team could muster much offense until midway through the second quarter when the Chargers moved 82 yards and scored on a Melvin Gordon touchdown run from one yard out to tie the game. With, 1:34 remaining in the half, the Raiders moved into Charger territory and connected on a Giorgio Tavecchio 44-yard field goal as time expired to give the Raiders a 10–7 lead at the half.

On their first possession of the second half, the Raiders moved deep into Charger territory, but managed no points as Carr was intercepted for the second time in the game. The teams exchanged punts and fumbles as the game moved into the fourth quarter. The Chargers finally managed some offense as Philip Rivers hit Melvin Gordon for a six-yard touchdown pass to give the Charger at 14–10 lead.
