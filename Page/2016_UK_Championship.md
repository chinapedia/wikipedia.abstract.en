Neil Robertson was the defending champion,[3] but he lost 3–6 in the first round to Peter Lines.

In his last 64 match against Barry Hawkins, Fergal O'Brien made 5 centuries, setting up a new record in a best of 11 match.[4]

Mark Allen made the 124th official maximum break in the 7th frame of his last 64 match against Rod Lawler.[5] It was Allen's first maximum break, and it was the fifth time in a row, that a maximum was made in a UK Championship.
