SAINT JOSEPH'S CHURCH is the head church of the Good Shepherd Parish located at 178 Elm Street in Biddeford, Maine.


History

The church was ordered from a decree from Bishop Bacon of the Diocese of Portland to be made on May 13, 1870.[1] The church was to be made for the influx of French-Canadian Roman Catholic immigrants coming from Quebec. The church was dedicated in 1883. For over one hundred years, the church was the tallest building in Maine. The building is also known for its stain-glass windows, organ, art, and size. The church also had its own school, St. Joseph's School. The school was later merged, along with other schools, to the existing Saint James School, which is the only Catholic School under the Good Shepherd Parish.[2]
