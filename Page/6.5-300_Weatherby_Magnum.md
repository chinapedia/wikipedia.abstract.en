The 6.5-300 WEATHERBY MAGNUM is a 6.5mm cartridge created by Weatherby in 2016 as its own rendition to the ever-growing 6.5mm long range rifle market.[1]


Background

As the newest in Weatherby's lineup this cartridge is designed to be in direct competition to the 26 Nosler.[2]


Performance

Claimed by Weatherby to be the fastest 6.5mm cartridge available.[3]

Designed in a similar fashion as other Weatherby cartridges it has a large for caliber case capacity resulting in high velocities. When bullets with high ballistic coefficients are used trajectories are extremely flat, allowing the projectile to retain a significant amount of energy downrange. These attributes make the 6.5-300 quite effective for long range hunting on medium-sized game.


Availability

Currently Weatherby is the only manufacturer of rifles chambered in the 6.5-300 Weatherby Magnum, as well as the only current supplier of ammunition. Although cases could be formed from 300 Weatherby brass. Due to the lack of availability of firearms and high cost of factory ammunition this round is currently out of the realm of the average hunter or marksmen.
