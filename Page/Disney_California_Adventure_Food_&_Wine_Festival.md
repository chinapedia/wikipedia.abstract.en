The DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE FOOD & WINE FESTIVAL is a food and drink festival that takes place each spring in Disney California Adventure in the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The festival includes a number of themed kiosks, each featuring food and beverages from a particular aspect of California cuisine. Other offerings include wine and beer tastings, seminars, and cooking demonstrations. This event was inspired by the similar but much larger Epcot International Food & Wine Festival. This festival was held annual from 2006 through 2010, and was cancelled in 2011 when Disney California Adventure began a period of major construction. The event returned in the spring of 2016.
