History

The Qolla Il-Bajda Battery

Qbajjar_Bay_02.jpg]]The Qolla Il-Bajda Battery, also known as the Qbajjar Battery, is one of the many defensive structures built in the Medieval period, and continued to be used by Britain in World War 1 (WWI) and World War 2 (WWII). When it was originally built, it included:

1.  2 Blockhouses
2.  The Entry Staircase
3.  A gun platform
4.  A parapet
5.  A ditch

These enabled it to provide defense to invading forces, whether it be Ottoman pirates, or Nazi Germany's dive bombers. The BLOCKHOUSES had small gun-holes, incase of a attack from land. Now, this historic monument lies abandoned. [4]
