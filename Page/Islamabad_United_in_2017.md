Pakistan super League

Islamabad United played the inaugural game of the 2017 season against Peshawar Zalmi, which they managed to win by 7 wickets and thus continuing their winning streak from last season.[5] In the following game, however, they lost to Lahore Qalandars by 6 wickets after posting 158 on the board. Misbah top-scored for United through his unbeaten innings of 61 off 36 balls that included 5 sixes.[6]

As the tournament shifted to Sharjah, United continued to rebuild their campaign by handing Quetta Gladiators their first loss of the season. Chasing 149, they managed to do so at a loss of 5 wickets with 5-balls to spare. Sam Billings was the top-scorer with his aggressive knock of 78 from 50 balls.[7] But in the following game against table-bottoms, Karachi Kings, United lost by 8-runs through the Duckworth-Lewis method. This came about after they posted 90 runs in their allotted 13 overs in a rain-marred game that was abandoned after 9.4 overs in the second innings.[8] However, continuing on, United won a thrilling last-ball win against Peshawar Zalmi. Dwayne Smith was instrumental in his team's chase of 137 runs as he scored 72 off 59 balls after United's bowlers had earlier restricted the opposition to a below-par score.[9] Following this victory, however, the team lost to Lahore Qalandars by 1 wicket in a tense game. Batting first, United had difficulties in building their innings and were at one time 83-6. But the team's emerging player, Shadab Khan, scored 42 off 24 balls to get United to a respectable total of 145 which almost proved match-winning.[10]

With the tournament moving back to Dubai, United registered a thrilling win against Quetta Gladiators. After putting up a total of 166, the team was staring at almost certain defeat after the Gladiators were 148 for the loss of just one wicket at the 16th over. However, after a flurry of wickets and the inability of the opposition batsmen to finish the game, United prevailed by 1 run. This win also ensured the team of a play-off spot.[11]
