HENRI VAN DE WAAL (1910 â€“ 1972) was a Dutch writer and art historian known for developing Iconclass.

Van de Waal was born in Rotterdam. In 1934 he finished his education as an art historian in Leiden with a monography on Jan van Goyen.[1] He accepted a position at the National Print Cabinet in The Hague, where he began work on a German concept of image-based historical research, which due to the special circumstances of the interbellum period was drastically reduced. He eventually finished his PhD thesis 12 July 1940, _cum laude_, on the patriotic subject of _Zeventiende eeuwsche uitbeeldingen van den Bataafschen Opstand_ (17th-century images of the Batavian Revolt). Four months later he was dismissed as part of the actions by the German occupational forces against Jews.[2]

Soon after being released from internship in Westerbork in 1945, he took up work as an assistant professor in Leiden, but was appointed a full professorship in art history the same December. In 1946 he presented his ideas about mapping the iconography of art history with "beeld-leer", an image-based concept of recording form, function and content with one code.[3] He remained professor and director of the print cabinet until his death resulting from kidney damage contracted during a case of scarlet fever he had while in Westerbork.[4]

Van de Waal was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957.[5]

His "beeld-leer" resulted in the D.I.A.L. (Decimal Index of the Art of the Low Countries) based on the Dewey Decimal System, and later called Iconclass. Henri van de Waal died in Leiden.
