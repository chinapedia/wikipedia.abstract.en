Overview

Basel-Servette.pdf Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the fourteenth consecutive season. Basel played in the 1979–80 Nationalliga A. They ended the qualification round in second position and won the Championship with 33 points, two ahead of second place Grasshopper Club and of third placed Servette, who had won the Qualification Group. This was the club's eighth championship title in their history. Basel scored a total of 91 goals conceding 38 in the 32 league games. Detlev Lauscher and Erni Maissen led the team's top goal scorers list after the qualifying phase both with 13 league goals. At the end of the season they were joined by Joseph Küttel and all three managed to score 18 league goals in that season.

Basel, as all NLA teams, entered the Swiss Cup in the round of 32. Basel were drawn away against Mendrisiostar where they won 3–1. In the second round, again away from home in the Wankdorf Stadium against Young Boys. In the Swiss League Cup Basel were also drawn away from home against the Young Boys. They lost both duels and thus without further cup matches had enough strength and energy to win the Swiss championship.
