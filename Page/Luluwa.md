LULUWA (also ACLIMA) according to some religious traditions was the oldest daughter of Adam and Eve, the twin sister of Cain and wife of Abel.[1] According to these traditions, she was the first female human who was born naturally.[2] According to Islamic and rabbinic tradition, a marriage between Luluwa and Abel was proposed and arranged by their father Adam. In order to commence contentment from Luluwa's twin brother, Adam (their father) suggested that a sacrifice be made, yet sacrifice was subsequently rejected by God.[3][4] The reason behind the commotion was that Cain viewed Luluwa as being aesthetically more attractive than Awan.[5]


Kalmana or Calmana; Balbira

Some sources in the Eastern Orthodox traditions state Luluwa's name as _Calmana_ or _Calmanna_. Alternative transliterations of her name Aclima include _Aclimah_, _Aclimia_, _Aclimiah_, _Klimia_.[6]

In the _Seder Hadorot_, Luluwa is called _Kalmana_.[7][8]

states that after he had killed Abel, "Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch". In an effort to explain where Cain and Abel acquired wives, some traditional sources stated that each child of Adam and Eve was born with a twin who became their mate. According to the _Seder HaDorot_, the wife and twin sister of Cain was named Kalmana, and the wife and twin of Abel was Balbira.[9]

The sister of Cain was named _Kalmana_ in the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius (first Greek redaction) II.1.,[10] and _Calmana_ in the Golden Legend. The poet Petrus Riga (1140–1209) included _Calmana_ in his famous poem _Aurora_, and this could have been a source for her appearance in Peter Comestor's _Historia Scholastica_. Comestor's Biblical narrative text then served as the standard textbook for Biblical education for centuries.


Luluwa

Religious sources also describe Aclima's name as _Luluwa_. She is described as the most beautiful of the early daughters of Adam and Eve. However, Cain reportedly hated her whilst in Eve's womb with her. The name _Luluwa_ means "beautiful". This narrative was recorded in the _Forgotten Books Of Eden_, which itself is a exegesis of earlier apocryphal texts.[11]
