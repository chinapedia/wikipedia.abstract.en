Kyle_Thiermann_.jpg KYLE THIERMANN (born January 9, 1990) is a professional surfer, writer, podcast host, and filmmaker from Santa Cruz, CA.


Career

In 2018 Thiermann co-created The Motherfucker Awards with author Chris Ryan. At a sold-out gala in LA, famous comedians represented the corporations that did the most to fuck Mother Earth and gave acceptance speeches on their behalf. The aim of the show is to create corporate accountability through comedy.

From 2014-2017 he worked with Discovery Digital Networks as an on-camera correspondent.[1] He frequently appears on their Seeker Stories, DNews, and VR channels. He also works closely with his main surf sponsor, Patagonia to test products, garner media, and help them use business to implement solutions to the environmental crisis.[2]

Kyle Speaks at Universities throughout the country and in 2011 he gave a TEDx Talk in his wetsuit.[3] Kyle’s surfing and filmmaking successes have earned him the Brower Youth Award,[4] American Clean Skies Award,[5] Blue Vision Youth Award,[6] and Surfrider’s Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award.[7]


Early career

From ages 18–25 Kyle created and hosted the YouTube series Surfing For Change. His channel has more than 2.5 million views. While traveling to the best waves around the world, Thiermann created gonzo-style mini-documentaries about current environmental issues happening in the regions. In the series, Thiermann focused on the power people have to create a better world through everyday decisions.[8]

His first YouTube video in the series details how money kept in multinational banks can be used to finance destructive projects all over the world. This video inspired people to move millions of dollars out of centralized banks and into local banks and credit unions, and reached people throughout North America, South America, Africa and much of Europe.[9]

Thiermann explains, “Because I see a big disconnect between the people who are doing awesome work in world and their ability to communicate that work with the rest of world. I see myself as a conduit between people and big organizations, and I package their stories in a way that is digestive enough so that they can take action."[10]

Kyle has covered controversial stories all over the world. These stories have included the Indonesian trash epidemic, GMO protests in Hawaii, working conditions in Sri Lanka, nuclear power in South Africa, and the adverse effects of surf tourism in Nicaragua. He graduated from Gaia University with a Bachelors of Science in Green Business with a focus in Media.
