METHYLEPITIOSTANOL, known by the nicknames EPISTANE, HEMAPOLIN, HAVOC, and EPI PLEX, is a synthetic and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) group which was first described in the literature in 1974 but was never marketed for medical use.[1][2][3] It is the 17α-methylated derivative of epitiostanol, an AAS and antiestrogen which was formerly used in the treatment of breast cancer in Japan.[4][5] Similarly to mepitiostane, methylepitiostanol is an orally active variant of epitiostanol.[6][7] Due to its C17α methyl group, the drug is considered to have a high potential for hepatotoxicity.[8]

Methylepitiostanol surfaced on the internet as a novel designer steroid in dietary supplements around 2009.[9] It was identified in 2015 in over 30 products sold online that listed it as an ingredient on their product label.[10] As of 2015, the drug is reportedly not a controlled substance.[11] However, it may degrade in some product containers into desoxymethyltestosterone (DMT; 3-desoxy-17α-methyl-δ²-DHT), which, in contrast, _is_ a controlled substance.[12][13] Moreover, methylepitiostanol has been reported to be a prodrug of DMT.[14]


Chemistry

Methylepitiostanol, also known as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-DHT) or as 2α,3α-epithio-17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of DHT.[15][16] It is closely related to epitiostanol (2α,3α-epithio-DHT) and mepitiostane (epitiostanol 17-methyloxycyclopentyl ether).[17]
