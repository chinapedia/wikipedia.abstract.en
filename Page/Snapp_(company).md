SNAPP () is an Iranian transportation network company based in Tehran, Iran.[1] Snapp launched in February 2014.[2] Users can request a ride via the iOS, Android, or web application, by indicating their location and destination. The price of the trip is set beforehand, to eliminate Bargaining. Snapp commissions drivers upon completing a background check, and showing a valid drivers license and insurance before hiring them. Snapp, along with Tap30 are the most popular ride-hailing platforms in Iran.[3]

Snapp currently operates in Arak, Urmia, Isfahan and Suburbs (Najaf Abad, Fuladshahr, Shahin Shahr), Ahwaz, Babol, Bandar Abbas, Tabriz and suburbs, Tehran and suburbs, Rasht and suburbs, Sari and suburbs, Shiraz and suburbs, Qaem Shahr, Qazvin, Qom, Karaj and Suburb, Kerman, Mashhad, Yazd, Neyshaboor, Gorgan, Ardebil, Hamedan and Bushehr. They are looking to expand to new cities, and may even seek to expand internationally.[4]

In October 2016, the company received a $20 million investment in a Series A round led by MTN Group, a South-African multinational corporation.[5] According to a 2017 interview with Shahram Shahkar, the CEO of the company, Snapp employs more than 300,000 active drivers and more than 500 personnel.[6] Snapp rebranded itself and changed its logo in 2019.[7]
