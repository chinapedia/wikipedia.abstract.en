The WICKHAM–DE VOL HOUSE is an historic building located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. The house was occupied by two prominent families.[1] O.P. Wickham was a prominent contractor and brick manufacturer who built the house in 1878, and the De Vols, who altered its appearance in 1913, operated a retail hardware business. The two-story brick house was constructed using the Italianate style with Eastlake detailing. After its renovation it took on more of a clean, modern, and horizontal appearance after its roof line and porches were altered. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[2] In 2005 it was included as a contributing property in the Willow-Bluff-3rd Street Historic District.[3]
