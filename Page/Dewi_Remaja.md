DEWI REMAJA (_Miss Teen Malaysia_) is a beauty contest organized by the _Remaja_ magazine (_Youth magazine_) published by the group Karangkraf. The competition is usually in alternating with the competition for the male version of the Hero Remaja (_Mister Teen Malaysia_).

The finalists will not compete in swimsuits. They will only wear the evening gown all the time. The winner of the contest will NOT compete in any international beauty contest such as Miss Universe nor Miss World because most of the finalists are Muslim, and Malaysian Muslim women are not able to compete in any international pageants since 1997.

Among the names of celebrities who have been born through this competition is Mawar Rashid, Puteri Aishah, Neelofa, Izara Aishah, Anzalna Nasir, Scha Al-Yahya, Izreen Azminda, Annahita Bakavoli, Juliana Banos, Rita Rudaini, Wardina Safiyyah, Julia Hana, Pushpa Narayan, Rozita Che Wan, Aleeza Kassim, Jasmin Hamid, Umie Aida, singer Sheril Aida, Rehana Yasin and many others.
