History

Coburg High School was originally established in 1916 on Bell Street in Coburg as one of the first coeducational state secondary schools in Victoria, opening with Ned Sheehan as headmaster and 195 students. Founded during the First World War, at that time the school was used as an emergency hospital during that time. The first ‘Leaving Certificate Class’ graduated from Coburg High School in 1921. By 1924 there were more than 400 students enrolled in the school. By 1955 there were 673 students enrolled and by 1985 there were 758 students.[2]

Coburg High School was a selective-entry high school from 1916 until the 1960s. The Air Training Corps School Flight was established at Coburg High School in 1947. The original school magazine was called ‘Echoes’. During the 77 years of the original Coburg High School, there were two school songs—‘The Best School of All’ and ‘Loyal in All’.

After 77 years, the original Coburg High School was closed in 1993 before its merger with Preston Secondary College (formerly Preston Technical School) in 1994 to become Coburg-Preston Secondary College. Coburg East Primary school was then merged with the Secondary College in 1997 to form Moreland City P-12 College. In 2004, Moreland City College was closed. In 2005, fire damaged the original school building. In 2007, Coburg Senior High School was established as a school for students in Years 10 to 12.[3] By 2012, there were approximately 230 students at Coburg Senior High School.

In 2015, Coburg Senior High School was renamed Coburg High School and was re-established as a Years 7 to 12 school, welcoming its first intake of 160 Year 7 students. In 2016 there are approximately 170 Year 7 students and 160 Year 8 students and about sixty students in Years 10 to 12. The school is continuing to grow in enrolments. The incarnated Coburg High School is located on the site of the former Moreland City College—with the re-establishment of Coburg High School a government grant of $3.5 million was allocated to the school for capital works to renovate Building C.[4]

In October 2016, reunion celebrations were held at Coburg High School to mark the centenary of the opening of the original school.[5] A time-capsule was also opened as part of the centenary celebrations.[6]
