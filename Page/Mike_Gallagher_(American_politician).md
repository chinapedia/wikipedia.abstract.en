Early years

Gallagher lived in Green Bay through middle school. After his parents' divorce, he went to Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California, where he was Valedictorian, Class of 2002, spending summers back in Wisconsin.[1]

Military

Gallagher was a United States Marine Corps officer, serving seven years (2006–2013) on active duty.[2] He twice deployed to the Al Anbar Province, Iraq, serving on General Petraeus' CENTCOM Assessment Team as a commander of intelligence teams. He assessed American military strategy in the Middle East and Central Asia while as a counterintelligence officer, and member of the CENTCOM (Central Command) assessment team.

Education

He went to Princeton, where he first studied Spanish and did a summer internship abroad with the Rand Corporation, working on a strategic study of terrorist groups such as the Basque separatists in Spain. After 9/11, he changed his major from Spanish to Arabic.[3]

He earned his B.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 2006. He earned his MSSI (Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence), at National Intelligence University in 2010. He studied at Georgetown University, earning a M.A. in Security Studies in 2012; a M.A. in Government in 2013; and a Ph.D. in Government - International Relations in 2015. [4]


Political career

Gallagher served as a Republican staffer on the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Scott Walker, then-Governor of Wisconsin, hired Gallagher as a foreign policy advisor in February 2015, in preparation for his 2016 presidential campaign.[5]

After Walker dropped out of the presidential race, Gallagher worked as a senior marketing strategist for Breakthrough Fuel, a supply-chain management company. The firm's CEO hired Gallagher after hearing him speak about national security at a business luncheon. Gallagher was looking for additional work as an adjunct instructor for the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay when twenty Green Bay area business people signed a letter urging him to run for Wisconsin's 8th congressional district seat, for which Reid Ribble was not seeking re-election.[6][7] Gallagher won a primary against Wisconsin state senator Frank Lasee and Forestville village president Terry McNulty.[8] Gallagher then squared off against Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson in the general election.

In September 2016, County Board supervisor Mike Thomas endorsed Gallagher in the Appleton Post-Crescent, contrasting his background in business and the Marine Corps with that of Nelson, a "consummate career politician" who "makes decisions based on political implications and the impact it may have on his public image." Gallagher, wrote Thomas, "would be a true citizen representative in Congress."[9]

During the campaign, Nelson ran an ad saying that Gallagher's failure to denounce certain statements by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump was a sign of a lack of moral courage. Gallagher replied with his own ad, in which he pointed out that Nelson was questioning the moral courage of a Marine who had done two combat tours.[10] In the end, Gallagher won the election 63 percent to 36 percent, a larger margin than the 16 percent margin that the race was polled at in August 2016.[11]

Term limits

In May 2018, Gallagher received Donald Trump's "full-throated endorsement" to "push for congressional term limits", during a meeting at the White House. He has received support from Brian Fitzpatrick, Jodey Arrington and Vicente González. His plan consists of limiting senators "to two terms and representatives to six terms", totaling 12 years each. It would be grandfathered in order not to apply to sitting members of Congress, except for the so-called "freshman class".[20]
