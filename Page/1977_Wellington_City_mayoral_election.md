The 1977 WELLINGTON CITY MAYORAL ELECTION was part of the New Zealand local elections held that same year. In 1977, election were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including eighteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.


Background

The 1977 mayoralty was notable for the highly publicized candidacy of Carmen Rupe, a transgender drag performer and brothel keeper. With the support of local businessman Bob Jones, who organised her campaign and wrote her speeches, Carmen's campaign utilised the slogans _Get in Behind_ and _Carmen for Mayor_[1] and campaigned on a platform to legalise gay marriage and brothels, despite neither being local-government matters in New Zealand.[2]

Former mayor Sir Frank Kitts attempted a comeback after losing narrowly three years earlier. His candidature took many by surprise with the press expecting Labour to try and rejuvenate. Local businessman Jim Belich was approached, but he declined for personal reasons.[3] Frank O'Flynn also considered standing, but withdrew in favour of Kitts, though O'Flynn stood on the council ticket and was elected. A Dominion editorial said of Kitts' candidature "No one knew what Frank Kitts did during his three years in the political wilderness and no one knew why he wanted to come back".[4] His support in the mayoral race fell further, though he was again elected to the Wellington Harbour Board where his vote increased.
