The _' Seoul Animation Center_' () is an animation and cartoon museum and activities center located on the hillside of Namsan in Jung-gu, Seoul. It was established by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in May 1999 to support the South Korean comics and animation industry and later expanded to include games and characters. It is operated and managed by the Seoul Business Agency (SBA) and jointly hosts the Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival (SICAF), and other art exhibits and festivals at the center and on nearby Cartoon Street.[1][2][3][4]


History and location

The center, established in May 1999, is located in Yejang-dong on the northern edge of Namsan Mountain, and occupies four separate buildings which were constructed in 1962. It hosts exhibitions, education programmes and festivals and receives more than 250,000 visitors every year.[5]

The surrounding neighborhood was developed during the Japanese colonial era[6] and housed the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, which formed in 1961, with their interrogation section in one of the center's buildings.[7] The area has been dubbed ‘Animation Town’,[8] and includes Cartoon Street, which entrance is directly across the street from the center[9][10] The center is an approximate ten minute walk to Myeong-dong Station, downhill along Cartoon Street; with Soongeui Women's College and Namsan's cable car and walking courses nearby, up the mountain.[11]

The center is managed by the Seoul Business Agency (SBA), which is affiliated with the city government, and provides support to small and medium-sized venture companies.[12] In addition to its own activities, the center partners with SICAF as host for their film festival,[13] and holds events on Cartoon Street, like the _2014 Cartoon Street Festival_ which featured art and Korean cultural experiences.[14]


Facilities

Facilities inside the complex, which is decorated with colourful murals of cartoon characters, include a library, cinema and exhibition hall.[15] The entrance courtyard has cartoon character statues, among them the popular Larva, Pororo,[16] and Robot Taekwon V, with Dooly the Little Dinosaur and Pucca inside. The center hosts exhibitions and experience-based programs that focus on characters from domestic manhwa and animations. The rooftop garden was featured as the house of Choi Han-kyul, played by cast member Gong Yoo, in the Korean drama, Coffee Prince.[17]

Cartoon museum and library

The three-story building includes exhibits, three dimensional artwork, and a library of over 56,000 items, including 48,000 comic books and 8,000 animation videos; and holds performances and magic shows.[18][19][20]

The library is a lending library with comic books on the first floor, and exhibits, individual viewing screens and a mini-theater on the second floor. The collection includes Korean cartoon trends from the 1970s through the 2000s. The interior has trompe-l'œil or "trick art" featured on restroom walls.[21][22] Manager Park Kyoung-jin, part of the Ani-Town Team at the Seoul Business Agency, said in 2014, "Since we started stocking Korean comic books in foreign languages, series that have already been exported, we’ve seen a growing number of foreign tourists."[23]
