GUY RITTER (born 1966[1]) is an American musician who primarily performed thrash metal and speed metal. Ritter is best known for his vocals in the Christian metal band, Tourniquet.


History

Ritter started his musical career with the band Holy Danger.[2] At the time of Holy Danger's beginning in 1985, Ritter was 19.[3] The band disbanded in 1987.[4] In 1989, Ritter had moved to Los Angeles to find musicians to play with.[5] He found Gary Lenaire and Ted Kirkpatrick, and the three founded Tourniquet.[6] The band recorded three albums before Ritter's departure in 1993, after the recording of _Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance_[7][8] There was much speculation on why Ritter departed, such as "This was Guy Ritter's last album with the band. His reasons for leaving were he was getting tired of the thrash vocals and medical allegory" or "Apparently Guy Ritter was unhappy with this new heavier direction the band had taken and decided to part ways in the middle of the recording."[9]

In 1996, Ritter and former bandmate Gary Lenaire formed a new band called Echo Hollow.[10] They formed the band with Matt Rosenblum, a drummer Gary knew, and Matthew Fallentine, Ritter's now-brother-in-law.[11] The band later on added Rafik Oganyan in June 2001.[12] The band disbanded in 2004.[13]


Personal life

Ritter is married to Christin Ritter, Matthew Fallentine's sister.[14][15] They have two children.[16] Ritter is an outspoken Christian.[17] Ritter worked on editing systems for Fox Sports. He enjoys exercise, including hiking and cycling.[18]
