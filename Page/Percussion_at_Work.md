_PERCUSSION AT WORK_ is an album by composer, arranger and conductor Pete Rugolo featuring performances recorded in 1957 and first released on the EmArcy label.[1][2][3][4]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow noted: "Some of arranger Pete Rugolo's Mercury and Emarcy recordings of the late 1950s seemed to concentrate more on getting effects than producing creative jazz. ... the album is primarily for hi-fi freaks and those who love percussion solos."[5]
