Protagonists

Daigo Madoka

Shin Asuka

Ultraman_Dyna_Shin_Asuka.jpg [1] is the main protagonist of _Ultraman Dyna_ and is Ultraman Dyna's human host. Aged 22 years old in the series, he is light-hearted overall, and is one of the rare Ultra human hosts who also serves as the comic relief of the main cast. Asuka often whines and pouts immaturely, and sometimes pretends to be killed in combat just to see his teammates freak out. Despite his immature outlook, he can also be headstrong and overly courageous, fending off aliens far stronger than normal humans with only his hand-to-hand combat skills. His well-known motto is "Never give up", stemming from his character development as his series progresses. Using the , he transforms into Ultraman Dyna by raising the object in mid-air.[2]

During his childhood, Asuka's dad disappeared years ago when his space ship disappeared into a mysterious light. He spent his teenage years in high school as a baseball player and later on worked as a TPC maintenance crew in _The Final Odyssey_, saluting Daigo, who in fact his own predecessor. After enlisting himself as a ZERO Training student, he was accepted into the Super GUTS for being able to score high marks during their entry examination and saving Ryo from the Sphias by sacrificing his own GUTS Wing. During that time, he came in contact with Dyna's light and while fighting Darambia on Mars, this introduced Dyna for the first time. Although hesitating to use it again, he was able to overcome it quickly, embracing his duty as an Ultra Warrior like Daigo and fight against multiple monster and alien threats. In the three-part final episode, his identity as Ultraman Dyna was leaked and kidnapped by the Black Buster Squad to awaken the artificial Ultraman Terranoid, which eventually went rogue from Sphia's takeover. His kidnapper Gondo redeemed himself by sacrificing his life to replenish Dyna's energy and defeated Zelganoid but Asuka collapsed from his injuries and was taken care by his predecessor, Daigo before Ryo picked him again. When Super GUTS unleashed a full campaign against Gransphia, he saved Ryo as Dyna from being held hostage by Neo Gaigareid but during this point that his identity made known to his teammates. Despite Gransphia defeated by Super GUTS and Dyna's combined tactics, the battle came at a high price, forcefully dragging both Asuka and Dyna into a wormhole. While presumed dead, he was actually reunited with his long lost father and the two fly towards the space-time continuum.

Eleven years after _Ultraman Dyna_ ended, which took place in the setting of _Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy_, the wormhole that Asuka went in ended up transported to the Nebula M78 Space from the Showa era. Finding himself in the middle of conflict against Belial's forces, Asuka first rescued the ZAP Spacy crew before he went to the Monster Graveyard and helped fought against Belial and his armies. He soon assist Ultraman Zero by helping out distracting Beryudora while Zero delivered the finishing blow to Ultraman Belial.[3] In _Ultraman Saga_, his popularity as Ultraman Dyna was made public, so much that his stories and identity was published in the textbook. TPC Mars base were celebrating his 15 years of his sacrifice and during that same time he was transported into another world where Alien Bat kidnapped the Earth's citizens to empower his Hyper Zetton as part of his invasion.[4] Asuka/Dyna sided with Team U, humanity's final line of defense but sacrificed himself by petrifying both him and Dyna to halt Cocoon Hyper Zetton's development. His ejected Reflasher was picked by an orphan Takeru, who used it to revive Dyna to assist Ultraman Cosmos and Zero against Zetton. When Hyper Zetton evolved into Imago, Asuka combined his light with Musashi and Taiga to form Ultraman Saga, putting an end to Alien Bat and his Hyper Zetton, therefore returning the kidnapped humans back to Earth. As he departed, he made his last stop on his teammates and assured them that Taiga is safe before leaving again, knowing that his teammates would catch up to him in one of his travels.

Shin Asuka is portrayed by and in his childhood. Tsuruno is a fan of _Ultraman 80_, watching the series in his childhood and was once mistaken that said Ultraman would appear in _Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers_ before Hiroshi Nagano corrected him. The original concept behind Shin Asuka is to have him as a baseball player but this was less focused due to Tsuruno having intermediate experience as a baseball player. His acting as Asuka left a huge impression to his eldest son, who has a habit of saying that his father's job is an Ultraman whenever people asked about it.[5] While acting as Asuka, Tsuruno was reminded to portray himself as a teenager growing up. The props used to portray Asuka, such as his Super GUTS uniform and Reflasher was nicely preserved under Tsuruno's own request, having expected to reprise his character in later years. Since _Ultraman Dyna_ is a show that focuses on space, this left an inspiration to Tsuruno for his interest for astronomy.[6]

Ultra Warriors

Super Ancient Civilization

Unlike Showa Era Ultras, who were mostly from Nebula M78, _Tiga_'s series mainly focuses on Ultra Warriors whose origin is from the of 30 million years prior.

A long time ago, this civilization was known for being a utopia, until the arrival of dark forces, which came in the form of rampaging monsters appeared and spreads fear towards its civilians. Then the light appeared to the cities' people, bestowed its power to selected warriors to fight against the darkness and restoring peace. However, as more warriors were turned into giants of light, a power struggle arose which split them into two factions. Soon, a civil war started between these two factions and as a result, several combatants corrupted after embracing the darkness, therefore destroying the very same civilization they lived on. One after another, the ancient civilization started to fall.

One of the strongest Dark Giants was Tiga Dark, but he switched sides after falling in love with Yuzare and sealed himself and his own companions within R'lyeh. In aftermath of the battle, leftover giants who survived the civil war were left to protect the Earth but when humanity fell under the influence of Gijera, the giants were unable to do anything and left due to their inability to interfere with humanity's decision. This gave the great darkness a chance to appear and strike the ancient civilization. The ancient giants left behind their Ultra DNA and powers (stone statues) for future generations to use in hope of the same incident that befall their civilization would not happen again in the future.[22]

In _The Final Odyssey_, the remains of fallen combatants in R'lyeh donated their light to resurrect the defeated Ultraman Tiga as Glitter Tiga, therefore placing an end to both Demonzour and the dark influences from their civilization.

The Land of Tiga Pyramid

Ultraman_Tiga_Statues.jpg [23] was an ancient golden pyramid which serves as a final resting place for Ultraman Tiga and his two other companions before they left behind their stone bodies and left the Earth. As revealed in _Ultraman Tiga Gaiden_, this pyramid was situated near the Sakimori Village (which was later renamed as ), allowing Tiga's power to be utilized by Tsubasa and later Amui via a bronze Spark Lence when the ancient sorcerer threaten the peace of their village. Said pyramid at that time was heavily disguised as a mountain while Jomonoid tried to destroy it. In the present day, (which took place in the first episode of _Ultraman Tiga_) Golza and Melba were awakened and contemplated to destroy the pyramid with the giants it houses. Guided by Yuzare's hologram in her capsule, GUTS located the pyramid but wasn't able to save it as both monsters destroyed it. When Daigo tried to defend the last statue from being destroyed, it was during that time he assimilated with it, bringing forth Ultraman Tiga to the modern era. The remains of destroyed statues were examined by Professor Yuji Tango, who in turn conspired with Keigo Masaki to search for another giant Ultraman statue in Kumamoto, leading to the birth of Evil Tiga.

As revealed in episode 49 of _Ultraman Dyna_, the remains of destroyed statues in the Tiga Pyramid was used by Gondo Kihachi to create his artificial Ultraman Terranoid.

In reality, Ultraman Tiga's first archetypal design was made in a form of a clay statue by Marbling Fine Arts company. Two other prototypes were also submitted by said company, and in the end one of them was chosen as Tiga's default design. The other two statues were however incorporated to the storyline as aforementioned stone bodies of Tiga's past allies that alongside him to protect the ancient civilization.[24] Also, the original setting for the pyramid was instead supposedly to house five instead of three Ultras, with two statues being destroyed and the other two merging with Tiga to bestow him his Type Change abilities.

Ultraman Tiga

Evil Tiga

Ultraman_Tiga_Evil_Tiga.jpg is a white-colored ancient Ultraman that appeared in episode 44 of _Ultraman Tiga_. Originally a giant of light whose statue buried under the Psytech Building in Kumamoto, he was discovered and had his powers utilized by Keigo Masaki, who like Daigo, a descendant from the ancient giants of light, but desired to use the ancient warrior's power to lead the human race with his own hands, having dreamt of humanity's destruction as well. Daigo disproved his method, not only had he tried to exploit the Ultra Warrior's power with an impure heart, but Masaki's actions were only to fuel his own ego. He assimilated with Evil Tiga's statue via Daigo's Spark Lence and his converter, which turn him into light particles.[25]

But instead of leading humanity, Masaki's forced assimilation caused him to lose control over the giant, leaving Evil Tiga to wreak havoc within Kumamoto and attacked the Ancient Ultra's original companion Guarde until Ultraman Tiga appeared. While both giants fought to a standstill, Tiga performed the Brain Chop attack, which was enough to cripple the corrupted giant for the hero to defeat it.[26] Evil Tiga was destroyed afterwards but unfortunately as revealed in _Ultraman Dyna_, that Ultra's remains was used for the creation of TPC's plan F: Terranoid. Prior to Terranoid's appearance, Evil Tiga appeared in episode 46 as one of the past enemies whose image was used by Moravia while using its powers to project its target's fears.

Being an ancient Ultra Warrior, Evil Tiga bears similar body features to the titular hero despite being differently designed, such as the forehead gem and chest armor. His attacks are the energy blast , flying kick , and defensive shield . His main finisher is the , which is done in a reversal way to Ultraman Tiga's Zeperion Ray.

Evil Tiga is voiced by Takashi Kora in the series, who is also the actor for Keigo Masaki. He is a playable character in the video game _Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3_, where he is voiced by , Ultraman Tiga's voice actor and the narrator of _Ultraman Dyna_. In an original concept, Evil Tiga was meant to appear in the 2016 movie, _Ultraman X The Movie_ under suggestion of writer Takao Nakano but was turned down by Kiyotaka Taguchi after finding the plot too similar to the original Evil Tiga.[27]

Evil Tiga's design was improvised from a rejected design of Ultraman Tiga[28] and was never referred to his real name during his appearance, ironically being called by Rena as a despite his status as a genuine Ultraman. Evil Tiga's original proposal was meant to be a black-colored Ultraman, which was already made in conception by Hiroshi Maruyama since the first airing of _Ultraman Neos_ (1995).[29]

Although a genuine Ultraman, in the Ultra Series' 45th anniversary, Evil Tiga scored the fifth place in an Ultra Monster popularity ranking.[30]

Ultraman

Ultraman Dyna

Ultraman_Dyna_Type_Changes.jpg is the main titular Ultra Warrior of his own series, whose origin in the story remains unknown to this day. Dyna first appeared in the series as a mysterious light that bonded with Asuka after his GUTS Wing was destroyed, which left the man floating in space. When Super GUTS faced against Darambia on Mars, Asuka turned into a mysterious light and the Ultra Warrior made his debut on Mars, and killed Neo Darambia with relative ease. During that time, he was mistaken by a few people to be the long lost Ultraman, Tiga and was given an official name by Super GUTS' communication officer Mai (which revolves around the English word "dynamic") after other proposed names were rejected.[31] Although bonded to Asuka, Dyna's entire activities were controlled by the man's own will, thus making him as the second case of after Tiga himself.[32]

From that point on, Dyna continued to fight against monster and alien threats when they could not be handled by Super GUTS or other military factions alone. Because of his appearance, he is regarded by many (both in-series and fans alike) as the spiritual successor to Ultraman Tiga, having met the latter once while the Earth was in the brink of invasion by Alien Monera. During his brief meeting with Tiga, he also inherited Tiga's light, further cementing his title as Earth's next protector. During the series finale, when the Sphires' invasion reached its climax, his host Asuka was kidnapped and Dyna's power was forcefully used to bring forth TPC's artificial Ultraman Terranoid. When a weakened Dyna faced his mockery, it was then when his host's kidnapper Gondo reformed by sacrificing himself to give Dyna the energy needed to fight back. His relation to Asuka was first exposed to Gondo, Ryo and the Black Buster Squad before the rest of Super GUTS discovered it as well when he tried to save Ryo from Neo-Gaigareid. With the help of Super GUTS, Dyna was able to save the Earth from Gransphire but unfortunately both him and Asuka were sucked into the black hole created from said monster's explosion. Although seemingly killed, Dyna and Asuka in fact survived and the two continued to travel in-between universes, first meeting with Asuka's long lost father, Kazuma.

Dyna possess the that allows him to , switching body colors and fighting prowess to his own preferences, based on Tiga's .[33] In every accessed forms, he retains the common ability to erect , an energy shield that defends him from incoming attacks. Unlike Tiga, Dyna's version is limited, as in each transformation he can only switch to one Type before switching back to the regular Flash Type (default form). However, his advantages is that he is capable of accessing his alternate forms right during his transformation, as he did so when fighting against Deathfacer and against Graikis. His three forms include:

-   :[34] Dyna's default form, which bears the color red and blue and the chest armor. Flash Type is based on the original Ultraman's fighting skills and is an analogous to Tiga's Multi Type, both are well-balanced in performances but unlike the latter, Dyna is mostly agile and dynamic, hence the origin of his name "Dyna". Apart from that, his Dyna Techtor allows him to manipulate light energies into various beam attacks, true to the form's namesake "flash". His main finisher is the , which is performed in a similar manner to the original Ultraman's Spacium Ray but can also unleash a stronger variation, the , by spreading his arms backward in a similar manner to Tiga's Zeperion Ray. Apart from that, he can also utilize real life-based skills such as , a forkball attack. In later appearances, he demonstrated other techniques, such as the healer-type in _Ultraman Saga_ and in _Ultraman Orb: The Origin Saga_.

-   : Dyna's blue-colored alternate form, based on Tiga Sky Type as both focuses on speed. Unlike Tiga, who proficiens in aerial combat, Dyna possess the ability to perform ESP-based attacks, such as to utilize telekinesis or to manipulate natural elements to his liking. A variation of the latter is also utilized known as the , which helps him perform electrokinesis. He used it once to recharge his energy via Kokakuchu's plasma lightning. His main attack is , which can be performed in two variations: the that banished his targets to a black hole or that reflect incoming attacks back to his opponents. Alongside Cosmos' Luna Mode, this form is the foundation of Ultraman Zero's Luna-Miracle Zero.[35]

-   : Dyna's red-colored alternate form; its color scheme being inversion to Miracle Type, as the red color dominates the most than silver and is based on Tiga Power Type, as both focus on brute strength. Compared to Tiga who also utilized range attacks, Dyna only has a little of them, and most of his attacks are strength-related. His only ranged attack is , which involves launching a spherical projectile towards the enemy or creating an Ultra Barrier to hold off the opponent's ranged attacks before launching it back to them. His known physical attacks are , spinning his opponents in a high velocity or performing a to defeat his impostor, Imitation Ultraman Dyna. He as well had an attack that was never shown in the series proper, called Garnate Bomber , slamming the opponent's head onto the ground. Alongside Cosmos' Corona Mode, this form is the foundation behind Ultraman Zero's Strong-Corona Zero.[36]

Ultraman Dyna is voiced by Takeshi Tsuruno, the actor of his human host, Shin Asuka. In _Ultraman Boy no Urukoro_, he is voiced by .[37] In the Ultra Series' 45th anniversary, Dyna was placed 17th in the popularity poll and ranked 13th in 2013 with a total of 2301 voters.[38][39]

Terranoid

Ultraman_Dyna_Terranoid.jpg is a man-made Ultra Warrior that appeared in episode 49 of _Ultraman Dyna_.[40][41]

Created by TPC in secret as part of the plan F, Terranoid used the remains of Evil Tiga and the two destroyed statues that laid to rest with Tiga and was built with the likeness of Ultraman Dyna. Requiring an Ultra Warrior's energy to activate it, Gondo ordered the kidnapping of Asuka and used Dyna's energy as it went into the action by fending off Mars Base against an army of Sphires. However, Terranoid's energy quickly ran out due to his inability to conserve energy and was assimilated/hijacked by the Sphires into a horrid monster called . Now a monster, Zelgaoid rebelled against his own creators, forcing Asuka/Dyna to fight in a depleted energy until Gondo sacrificed his own life to replenish Dyna, allowing the giant of light to kill the monster with ease.

Terranoid's appearance is in fact based on Ultraman Dyna (particularly that of Strong-Type) with golden armor accessories. His main attacks are the and . As Zelganoid, he retained his original attacks and is capable of utilizing energy shields and , the former which is also demonstrated in most Sphire-related synthetic beasts.

Terranoid/Zelganoid's grunts were recycled from Dyna's original grunts, who in turn was voiced by Takeshi Tsuruno, Shin Asuka's actor.

Dark Giants

The are Ultra Warriors from the ancient civilization that rose to prominence after a civil war between their own kind torn their civilization apart, causing several participants to fall into the dark side. Around that time, there were four dark giants: Camearra, Darramb, Hudra and their strongest warrior/leader, Tiga Dark. Unfortunately for them, Tiga switched sides to the light side after falling for Yuzare and sealed his own companions, thereby ending the civil war. In the present day, two years after Tiga's final battle with Gatanothor, TPC discovered their stone statue and thought of using Keigo Masaki's own idea to manipulate the Ultra Warriors' powers for military strength but accidentally lifted their seal by mistake and eventually led them to their revival. Unable to escape because of Yuzare's light barrier, all three of them invaded Daigo in his dreams and forced him to join the darkness by giving him Tiga Dark's powers. Although he transformed into Tiga Dark and destroyed Yuzare's barrier, Daigo refused to join them and like the original Tiga, stole their powers and defeated them. Following their defeat, the dark influence disappeared and R'lyeh Island (which was the place they first sealed) sank. The dark giants are based on characters of Cthulhu Mythos by H. P. Lovecraft.

-   :[42] The current leader of the dark giants and Tiga's lover in the past but said relationship turned into an unhealthy obsession due to the reason of Tiga's defection, as well as his reincarnation Daigo fell for another woman. After her revival in the modern times, Camearra used this opportunity to haunt Daigo in his visions and gave him the Black Spark Lence for him to become Tiga Dark. When Daigo/Tiga refused join her in the dark giants and defeated Darramb and Hyudra, Camearra was left to face him in her giant form. His action of rescuing his fiancé Rena further drove Camearra to the point of jealousy and forced her to transform into Demonthor before being defeated by Glitter Tiga. In her final moments, she redeemed from her past actions and died beside Daigo while finally gaining her own light. In her human form, Camearra displayed the ability to invade her target's dreams and visions, as well as the use of ESP and electrokinesis. Her dark Ultra form, which transformed from her own golden Spark Lence appeared as a golden Ultra Warrior with feminine body archetype. Her main ability is utilizing energy whip from her right arm, called , which can also be used as an energy sword called . She is portrayed by and is based on Cthylla.

    -   : Camearra's monster form, which acquired after she assimilated with the restless spirit of Gatanothor. Through this form, she was able to kill Tiga until the ancient giants of light revived him as Glitter Tiga, giving him the strength to defeat Demonzour from within via Zera Death Beam. Demonthor's main attack involves energy spear projections called , which can be concentrated into a beam called .
