Armenia has a massive production of bottled mineral and spring water,[1] with a large number of water bottling companies.


Mineral water

The Republic of Armenia has a large reserve of mineral water, mainly in the regions of Jermuk, Bjni, Arzni, Hankavan, and Dilijan.

Starting from 2004, production levels of bottled mineral water is dramatically growing.

The production volume reached up to 33 million liters during 2012. In 2013, the country witnessed a record in the production of bottled mineral water reaching up to 43.2 million liters, of which 11.8 million liters were exported. Consequently, the water bottling industry has succeeded in restoring and exceeding its pre-2009 crisis volumes, when a record volume of production was observed in 2008, reaching up to 35.8 million liters, of which 9.7 million was exported.

Currently, around 25-30% of mineral water produced in Armenia is being exported. The main exporting country is Russia while the 2nd is the United States. Other major importing countries included Georgia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

In 2013, around 10.5 million liters of mineral water were exported to Russia. Despite the Jermuk water scandal in the USA in 2007,[2] the United States have imported around 300,000 liters of mineral water from Armenia in 2013, making it second-largest importer after Russia. Ukraine are 3rd with 250,000 liters in the same year.
