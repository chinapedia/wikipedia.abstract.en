Plot

Sam's (Jared Padalecki) new hallucination has him having sex with Toni (Elizabeth Blackmore) as a way to know the names. He finally finds about the hallucination and wakes up, realizing it was just a potion given to him and that they also need to talk about Ruby, surprising Sam. She receives a call from Mick (Adam Fergus), a fellow Man of Letters, who chastises her for disobeying orders and also tells her about Ms. Watt's (Bronagh Waugh) death.

Dean (Jensen Ackles) is informed by Castiel (Misha Collins) that he may have found Sam a warded farmhouse after searching rental properties in Aldrich, Missouri, the location Ms. Watt's cell phone had pointed to. Dean decides to go but asks Mary (Samantha Smith) to stay out in order to protect her. Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) has discovered Rowena (Ruth Connell), who is trying to live a normal life out of witchcraft. He finally convinces her for help in using her magic and the Book of the Damned to find Lucifer and lock him again in the Cage by threatening to kill her date.

Meanwhile, Vince Vincente (Rick Springfield) is a washed-up rock star who has been feeling depressed since the death of his girlfriend years ago. While in his hotel room, Vince is stunned to find blood instead of water in his sink. After the objects in his room fly, Vince comes face to face with his dead girlfriend, who is in fact Lucifer disguised, tricking him to say "yes" to be his new vessel. Believing that he will be with his dead lover, Vince gives his consent and Lucifer gains a new vessel. Dean goes inside the farmhouse but he falls on a trap and is captured by Toni, who is planning on using him as a method of torture for Sam's punishment and a way for him to talk.

Lucifer meets with Crowley to talk about their new positions. Crowley wants to continue ruling as King of Hell and tells him that he can better reign Heaven. Lucifer refuses and prepares to kill him when Rowena approaches with a spell and Crowley pours sulphuric acid on him in hopes this will make Vince expel him and they can return him to the Cage.. However, the spell loses its hold and Lucifer regains power, causing Crowley to flee and takes Rowena as a prisoner. Toni begins to torture Dean as well as bringing the topic of Benny. Mary arrives and holds her at gunpoint. However, a fight ensues while Dean frees himself. Toni casts a spell to strangle Mary to force Dean's surrender, but Dean recognizes the spell and knocks Toni unconscious, saving Mary.

After Toni is knocked out, her associate Mick arrives with Castiel. Mick explains that the British Men of Letters are interested in working with the American branch to keep the country safe and that Toni just went too far and will be punished for her actions. While the Americans are skeptical, Mick has disarmed himself and lowered the wards so Castiel could enter as a sign of good faith to show that he means no harm. Mick gives them his phone number and departs with Toni.

That night, Sam talks with Mary, happy that she's back and gives her John's journal to help her understand what's happened since she died. Lucifer reveals to Rowena that he will not kill her, but use her and the Book of the Damned as a weapon and they depart Crowley's lair. While on the way to the airport, Mick chastises Toni for her actions, stating that she was supposed to make them trust the British. Toni refuses to admit she did anything wrong since Sam and Dean are too dangerous; Mick has already sent for their torturer, Mr. Ketch, just in case. The episode ends as Mr. Ketch leaves his room in London to depart for America.

Critical reviews

"Mamma Mia" received positive reviews. Sean McKenna from _TV Fanatic_, gave a 3.9 star rating out of 5, stating: "This was a decent follow-up to the season premiere. Things may not be barreling full steam ahead yet, and I'm still waiting to get excited by the British Men of Letters, but there's something about not knowing fully what's in store that's keeping me engaged. I'm intrigued enough to want to keep going on this latest road."[4]

Bridget LaMonica from _Den of Geek_, gave a 3.5 star rating out of 5, stating: "The espionage angle with the British Men of Letters is interesting, but I need to see more of where it's going before it feels like it fits with the side story of Lucifer getting a new vessel. _Supernatural_ isn't much for globe-hopping, James Bond action â€“ although we did have a moment once when Dean proudly declared himself Batman after a rabbits foot-induced lucky shot."[5]

Hunter Bishop of _TV Overmind_ gave the episode a 4.3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, "I am interested, if a little put off, by the British Men of Letters storyline. Them as a force for evil (and make no mistake, that is what the plane on perpetrating) and as ruthless killing machines comes off as somehow flat. Is that really all they are? Just highly efficient killers of man and monster? I'm not saying it isn't interesting, because it certainly is; just that I don't want a great potential villain (and anti-hero) ruined because they can only play a single note. There has a been a lot of depth in these first two episodes and, it would be very disappointing for the A plot to be anchored by one long trumpet blast."[6]

Samantha Highfill of _EW_ gave the episode a "B-" and wrote, "Altogether, it wasn't a remarkable hour, but it was filled with a lot of necessary story in order to set up the season. Now that the Winchesters are back together and Lucifer has a new vessel, I'm excited to see where we go from here."[7]
