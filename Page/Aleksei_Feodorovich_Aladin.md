ALEKSEI FEODOROVICH ALADIN (1873â€“1927) was a Russian soldier and politician who formed and led the Trudoviks, the Labours' Party. He was elected to the First Duma in 1906 but spent his later years in exile in the United Kingdom.[1][2]


Early life

Aladin was born in Simbirsk in 1873 to a peasant family and attended the same gymnasium as Lenin and Alexander Kerensky. He studied Natural Sciences at Kazan University from 1892 to 1896 where he became a political activist leading to his being expelled and later forcing him to escape to the United Kingdom.[3][4]


Election to the Duma (1906)

Aladin came to Britain as an exile in 1901-2 having escaped Russia where he was briefly imprisoned for political agitation. He returned to Russia in 1905 under a political amnesty to contest the elections for the First Duma, becoming prominent in Russian politics when he was elected a member in 1906. Aladin believed that the future of Russia lay with the peasants and so formed and led the Trudoviks, the Peasants' Party, becoming one of Russia's most respected members of the Duma. He was sent to England as a delegate from the Duma to a peace conference in London but while he was there the Duma was dissolved. The most prominent left-wing members fled to Vyborg in the Grand Duchy of Finland where they issued the Vyborg Manifesto against Nicholas II. These members were banished including Aladin, even though he had not been party to the manifesto and had considered it ill-advised.[5][6]

Aladin remained in the United Kingdom as a lecturer and journalist and working for a motor boat company. In 1907 he went on a lecture tour of the United States.[7] In 1917 he returned to Russia at some risk to himself in the hope that he would have some influence in saving his country. Instead, he was captured and imprisoned by the Bolsheviks. Managing to escape he joined Generals Anton Denikin and Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel in the Crimea between 1917 and 1920 during the ensuing Civil War.


Exile

He had a difficult marriage to Elizaveta Grigor'eva. Aladin died in St Thomas' Hospital in London in 1927, at only 54 years of age, and is buried in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking in Surrey.
