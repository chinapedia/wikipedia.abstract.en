BRYANT is an extinct town in Douglas County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1] Bryant is located on the north side of Bryant Creek along an abandoned stretch of old Missouri Highway 5 and approximately one mile downstream (southeast) from the current Missouri Highway 5 bridge over Bryant Creek.[2]

A post office called Bryant was established in 1888, and remained in operation until 1941.[3] The community was named after nearby Bryant Creek.[4]
