Wild_tic-tac-toe.svg WILD TIC-TAC-TOE is a game similar to tic-tac-toe. However, in this game players can choose to play as X or O.[1][2] This game can also be played in its misere form where if a player creates a three-in-a-row of marks, that player loses the game.[3]


Play

Regular game

Wild tic-tac-toe is played on a 3-by-3 board. Each of the players take turns placing a X _or_ an O on any unoccupied square.[4][5] The player who creates a line of three Xs or Os is the winner of the game.[6][7] This version of the game is forced win for the first player.[8][9][10]

Misere game

This game is exactly like the regular version of the game except the player who creates a line of any three marks (Xs or Os) in a row loses the game.[11][12]

The second player can force a draw by playing a mark opposite of the opponent's mark and choosing X if the opponent chose O (or vice versa).[13]
