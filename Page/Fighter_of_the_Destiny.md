Soundtrack


Reception

The series has been panned by critics for its poor acting performance from the two young leads, and has also been criticized for not adhering closely enough to the original story. Nonetheless, it is popular among many young viewers. The series placed first among audience ratings in its time slot and received over 27 billion views online on all major streaming sites, becoming one of the most watched Chinese television series of all time.[4][5] The success is attributed to the "Lu Han" effect, which refers to the idol's massive influence among his followers.[6][7] In January 2018 , the series reached 30 billion views.


Changes

While the series was originally supposed to be 55 episodes, the number of episodes was later reduced to 52 episodes. This because a major character of the drama had to be cut just prior to the airing of the show, as he was portrayed by Gu Hyun Ho, a Korean bodybuilder and model. This is due to China's ban on South Korean media, as a result of South Korea's agreement to host US missile defense system known as THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system), which China considers a severe threat to its security interests.[8]
