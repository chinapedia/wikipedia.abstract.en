The SAGAN STANDARD is an aphorism that asserts that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" (ECREE).[1][2]


Logic

An extraordinary claim is one which is not supported by the available, or _ordinary_, evidence. Support for such a claim must therefore come from newly observed evidence, or a new recognition of existing evidence, which is _extraordinary_.


History

The aphorism was made popular by astronomer Carl Sagan through the 1980 TV show _Cosmos_.[3] Two 1978 articles, one in _U.S. News & World Report_ and another by Koneru Ramakrishna Rao in the _Journal of Parapsychology_ both quote physicist Philip Abelson, then the editor of _Science_, using the same phrase.[4][5]

Others have put forward very similar ideas with different phrasing. Th√©odore Flournoy, in 1899, put forward the principle that "the weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness",[6] attributing the idea to Laplace, whom he quotes saying, in 1814, that "we ought to examine [seemingly inexplicable phenomena] with an attention all the more scrupulous as it appears more difficult to admit them".[7] In 1808, Thomas Jefferson also said "A thousand phenomena present themselves daily which we cannot explain, but where facts are suggested, bearing no analogy with the laws of nature as yet known to us, their verity needs proofs proportioned to their difficulty."[8] In "On the Extraordinary: An Attempt at Clarification" (1978), sociologist Marcello Truzzi said "an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof."[9]

In 2004 the cyclist Lance Armstrong used the phrase "Extraordinary allegations require extraordinary evidence" to discredit allegations of doping put to him by journalist David Walsh.[10] Armstrong was later asked "What is it about you that makes ordinary proof insufficient to bring you down? For murderers, we're not looking for extraordinary proof, we're looking for proof. But you're saying it must be extraordinary. Why?".[11] Armstrong later confessed to doping in 2013.[12]


Criticism of the aphorism

The aphorism has been criticized both for its apparent support of "orthodoxy" by raising the evidential standard for claims which are outside current social consensus, and for introducing subjectivity and ambiguity in determining what merits an "extraordinary claim". David Deming writes: "[s]cience does not contemplate two types of evidence. The misuse of ECREE ["extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"] to suppress innovation and maintain orthodoxy should be avoided as it must inevitably retard the scientific goal of establishing reliable knowledge."[13]
