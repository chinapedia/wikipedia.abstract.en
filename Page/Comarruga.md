COMARRUGA (or COMA-RUGA) is a seaside resort in the municipality of El Vendrell, in the province of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It stretches along the 2.3 km long Beach of Comarruga. Until 1946 it made part of the former municipality of Sant Vicenç de Calders.


Location

Comarruga is located in the eastern part of the Costa Dorada, some 55 km to the West of Barcelona-El Prat Airport, near the popular tourist resorts of Calafell and Torredembarra. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, Comarruga has become a popular tourist destination, particularly for families. A fine beach of golden sand stretching along more than 2 km is its main attraction.


Climate

Comarruga has a Typical Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: _Csa_) characterized with mild winters and hot summers. The rainiest season is the autumn, and the driest season is the summer. The sunshine hours are above 2,500.


History

The first written reference to Comarruga appears in 1180, when the abbot of Sant Cugat granted to Arnau Sunyer i Berenguer the place named _"ipsum vilare de Coma Ruga"_, near the castles of Calders and Saint Vincent.[1] The concession didn't grant the property of the pond of Comarruga, which belonged to the Monastery of Sant Cugat.

In 1183 the abbot of the Monastery of Sant Cugat granted additional rights in favour of Bernat de Papiol who accepted the compromise of guarding and defending the properties of the monastery and its inhabitants.

In 1887 the train station of Sant Vicenç de Calders was built within the lands of Comarruga. During the 20th century, this train station became one of the most important railway intersections in Catalonia. Due to this reason, a small neighborhood developed around it, mostly of railway workers and its families. During the Spanish Civil War, this station was attacked several times by the fascist army of General Franco. Thanks to the collaboration of Italian airplanes (hydroplanes) during the Christmas holidays of 1938 (between the 25th and the 29th), Comarruga was heavily bombed causing dozens of casualties.

In 1892 the hot springs of the pond and small creek (_riuet_) of Comarruga were declared of public interest for its health properties by the Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery of Barcelona. In 1920 a Hotel and Spa was built near the pond. This started the urban development of Comarruga which later in the 1960s and 1970s would become an important tourist town.
