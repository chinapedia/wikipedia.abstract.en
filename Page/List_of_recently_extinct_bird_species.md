    _This page refers only to birds that have gone extinct since 1500; for the list of birds known only from fossils, see List of fossil bird genera. For birds extinct in Late Quaternary prehistoric times and usually known from specimens not completely fossilized, see List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species._

Over 190 species of birds have become extinct since 1500, and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived. Other areas, such as Guam, have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced brown tree snake.

Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.

Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of rails in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species.

The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the San Benedicto rock wren is possibly the most extreme example—its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.

Extinct bird species

Aepyornithiformes

-   Elephant bird, _Aepyornis maximus_ and/or _A. medius_ (Madagascar, 16th century?)

Dinornithiformes

-   Upland moa, _Megalapteryx didinus_ (South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)

Apterygiformes

-   West Coast spotted kiwi, _Apteryx occidentalis_ (South Island, New Zealand, c. 1900)

        A doubtful form known from a single bird; may be a little spotted kiwi subspecies or a hybrid between that species and the rowi.

Anseriformes

]] Ducks, geese and swans

-   Crested shelduck, _Tadorna cristata_ (Northeastern Asia, late 20th century?)

        A relict species from northeastern Asia. Officially critically endangered due to recent unconfirmed reports.

-   Réunion sheldgoose, _Alopochen kervazoi_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)
-   Mauritius sheldgoose, _Alopochen mauritianus_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.1695)
-   Amsterdam wigeon, _Mareca marecula_ (Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)
-   Saint Paul Island duck, _Anas_ sp. (Saint Paul Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)

        Only known by a painting from 1793. Might be identical with the Amsterdam wigeon or a distinct species or subspecies.

-   Mascarene teal, _Anas theodori_ (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, late 1690s)
-   Mariana mallard, _Anas oustaleti_ (Marianas, West Pacific, 1981)
-   Finsch's duck, _Chenonetta finschi_ (New Zealand, possibly survived to 1870)
-   Pink-headed duck, _Rhodonessa caryophyllacea_ (East India, Bangladesh, North Myanmar, 1945?)– a reclassification into the genus _Netta_ is recommended, but not generally accepted.

        Officially critically endangered; recent surveys have failed to rediscover it.

-   Réunion pochard, _Aythya_ cf. _innotata_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)

        A bone of a pochard found on Réunion seems to resolve the reports of _canards_ other than the Mauritian duck having occurred on the island. The taxonomic status of this form cannot be resolved until more material is found, however.

-   Labrador duck, _Camptorhynchus labradorius_ (Northeastern North America, c. 1880)[1]
-   New Zealand merganser, _Mergus australis_ (New Zealand, Auckland Islands, Southwest Pacific, c.1902)

Galliformes

]] Quails and relatives
See also Bokaak "bustard" under Gruiformes below

-   The pile-builder megapode, _Megapodius molistructor_ may have survived on New Caledonia to the late 18th century as evidenced by descriptions of the bird named _"Tetrao australis"_ and later _"Megapodius andersoni"_.
-   The Viti Levu scrubfowl, _Megapodius amissus_ of Viti Levu and possibly Kadavu, Fiji, may have survived to the early 19th or even the 20th century as suggested by circumstantial evidence.
-   Raoul Island scrubfowl, _Megapodius_ sp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 1876)

        A megapode is said to have inhabited Raoul Island until the population was wiped out in a volcanic eruption. It is not clear whether the birds represent a distinct taxon or derive from a prehistoric introduction by Polynesian seafarers.

-   New Zealand quail, _Coturnix novaezelandiae_ (New Zealand, 1875)
-   Himalayan quail, _Ophrysia superciliosa_ (North India, late 19th century?)

        Officially critically endangered. Not recorded with certainty since 1876, but thorough surveys are still required, and there was a recent set of possible (though unlikely) sightings around Naini Tal in 2003. A little-known native name from Western Nepal probably refers to this bird, but for various reasons, no survey for _Ophrysia_ has ever been conducted in that country, nor is it generally assumed to occur there (due to the native name being overlooked).

Charadriiformes

(_Pinguinus impennis_), Natural History Museum, London, England]] Shorebirds, gulls and auks

-   Javan lapwing, _Vanellus macropterus_ (Java, Indonesia, mid-20th century)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, but as this conspicuous bird has not been recorded since 1940, it is almost certainly extinct.

-   Christmas sandpiper, _Prosobonia cancellata_ (Kiritimati Island, Kiribati, 1850s)
-   Tahiti sandpiper, _Prosobonia leucoptera_ (Tahiti, Society Islands, 19th century)
-   White-winged sandpiper, _Prosobonia ellisi_ (Moorea, Society Islands, 19th century)

        Doubtfully distinct from _P. leucoptera_.

-   North Island snipe, _Coenocorypha barrierensis_ (North Island, New Zealand, 1870s)
-   South Island snipe, _Coenocorypha iredalei_ (South and Stewart Islands, New Zealand, 1964)
-   Eskimo curlew, _Numenius borealis_ (Northern North America, late 20th century?)

        May still exist; officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.

-   Slender-billed curlew, _Numenius tenuirostris_ (Western Siberia, early first decade of the 21st century?)

        May still exist; officially classified as critically endangered. A few birds were recorded in 2004, following several decades of increasing rarity. There was an unconfirmed sighting in Albania in 2007. A survey to find out whether this bird still exists is currently being undertaken by the RSPB (BirdLife in the UK).

-   Great auk, _Pinguinus impennis_ (Newfoundland, 1852)
-   Canary Islands oystercatcher, _Haematopus meadewaldoi_ (Eastern Canary Islands, E Atlantic, c. 1940?)

        Later sightings of black oystercatchers off Senegal were not likely to be of this sedentary species, but two records from Tenerife - the last in 1981 - may be.

Gruiformes

Rails and allies - probably paraphyletic

-   Antillean cave rail, _Nesotrochis debooyi_, known by pre-Columbian bones from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Stories of an easy-to-catch bird named carrao heard by Alexander Wetmore in 1912 on Puerto Rico might refer to this species.
-   Hawkins' rail, _Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi_ (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, 19th century)
-   Red rail, _Aphanapteryx bonasia_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
-   Rodrigues rail, _Erythromachus leguati_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
-   Bar-winged rail, _Nesoclopeus poecilopterus_ (Fiji, Polynesia, c. 1980)
-   Dieffenbach's rail, _Gallirallus dieffenbachii_ (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, mid-19th century)
-   ]]Tahiti rail, _Hypotaenidia pacificus_ (Tahiti, Society Islands, late 18th – 19th century)
-   Wake Island rail, _Hypotaenidia wakensis_ (Wake Island, Micronesia, 1945)
-   Tongatapu rail, _Gallirallus hypoleucus_ (Tongatapu, Tonga, late 18th - 19th century)
-   New Caledonian rail, _Gallirallus lafresnanayanus_ (New Caledonia, Melanesia, c. 1900?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, the last records were in 1984 and it seems that all available habitat is overrun by feral pigs and dogs, which prey on this bird.

-   Vava'u rail, _Gallirallus_ cf. _vekamatolu_ (Vava'u, Tonga, early 19th century?)

        This bird is known only from a drawing by the 1793 Malaspina expedition, apparently depicting a species of _Gallirallus_. The 'Eua rail, _Gallirallus vekamatolu_, is known from prehistoric bones found on 'Eua, but this species is almost certainly not _G. vekamatolu_, as that bird was flightless and hence is unlikely to have settled three distant islands. However, it probably was a close relative.

-   Norfolk Island rail, _Gallirallus_ sp., may be the bird shown on a bad watercolor illustration made around 1800.
-   Chatham rail, _Cabalus modestus_ (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, c. 1900)
-   Réunion rail or Dubois' wood-rail, _Dryolimnas augusti_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
-   Ascension crake, _Mundia elpenor_ (Ascension, Island, Atlantic, late 17th century)– formerly _Atlantisia_
-   Saint Helena crake, _Porzana astrictocarpus_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
-   was an omnivore]]Laysan rail, _Porzana palmeri_ (Laysan Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1944)
-   ]]Hawaiian rail, _Porzana sandwichensis_ (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1890)
-   Kosrae crake, _Porzana monasa_ (Kosrae, Carolines, c. mid-late 19th century)
-   Miller's rail, _Porzana nigra_ (Tahiti, Society Islands, c. 1800)

        Known only from paintings and descriptions; taxonomic status uncertain, as the material is often believed to refer to the extant spotless crake.

-   Saint Helena swamphen, _Aphanocrex podarces_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, 16th century)– formerly _Atlantisia_
-   ]]Lord Howe swamphen, _Porphyrio albus_ (Lord Howe Island, SW Pacific, early 19th century)
-   Réunion swamphen or _Oiseau bleu_, _Porphyrio coerulescens_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, 18th century)

        Known only from descriptions. Former existence of a _Porphyrio_ on Réunion is fairly certain, but not proven to date.

-   Marquesas swamphen, _Porphyrio paepae_ (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas)

        May have survived to c. 1900. In the lower right corner of Paul Gauguin's 1902 painting _Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa ou le Marquisien à la cape rouge_ there is a bird which resembles native descriptions of _P. paepae_.

-   North Island takahē, _Porphyrio mantelli_, known from subfossil bones found in New Zealand's North Island; may have survived to 1894 or later.
-   New Caledonian gallinule, _Porphyrio kukwiedei_ from New Caledonia, Melanesia, may have survived into historic times. The native name _n'dino_ is thought to refer to this bird.
-   Samoan wood rail, _Gallinula pacifica_ (Savai'i, Samoa, 1907?)

        Probably better placed in the genus _Pareudiastes_, unconfirmed reports from the late 20th century suggest it still survives in small numbers and therefore it is officially classified as critically endangered.

-   Makira woodhen, _Gallinula silvestris_ (Makira, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)

        Only known from a single specimen, this rail is probably better placed in its own genus, _Edithornis_. There are some unconfirmed recent records that suggest it still survives, and thus it is officially classified as critically endangered.

-   Tristan moorhen, _Gallinula nesiotis_ (Tristan da Cunha, Atlantic, late 19th century)
-   Mascarene coot, _Fulica newtonii_ (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
-   Fernando de Noronha rail, Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Fernando de Noronha, W. Atlantic, 16th century?)

        A distinct species of rail inhabited Fernando de Noronha island, but it has not been formally described yet. Probably was extant at first Western contact.

-   Tahitian "goose", Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Tahiti, late 18th century?)

        Early travelers to Tahiti reported a "goose" that was found in the mountains. Altogether, a species of rail in the genus _Porphyrio_ seems to be the most likely choice.

-   Bokaak "bustard", Rallidae? gen. et sp. indet. 'Bokaak'

        An unidentified terrestrial bird is mentioned in an early report from Bokaak in the Marshall Islands. It is described as a "bustard" and may have been a rail or a megapode. In the former case it may have been a vagrant of an extant species; in any case, no bird that could be described as "bustard-like" is found on Bokaak today.[2]

-   Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. 'Amsterdam Island'

        Unknown rail from Amsterdam Island; one specimen found, but not recovered. Extinct by 1800, or it may have been a vagrant of an extant species.

Podicipediformes

Grebes

-   Colombian grebe, _Podiceps andinus_ (Bogotá area, Colombia, 1977)
-   Alaotra grebe, _Tachybaptus rufolavatus_ (Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, 1985)

        Officially declared extinct in 2010, 25 years after the last official sighting. Declined through habitat destruction and hybridization with the little grebe. Disappeared from only known location in the 1980s.

-   Atitlán grebe, _Podilymbus gigas_ (Lake Atitlán, Guatemala, 1989)

Cathartiformes

-   "Painted vulture", _Sarcoramphus sacra_ (Florida, United States, late 18th century?)
    -   A bird supposedly similar to the king vulture identified by William Bartram on his travels in the 1770s. Skeptics have stated that it is likely based on a misidentification of the northern caracara, although evidence has increasingly shifted towards it being a valid species that existed, based on an independent illustration of a near-identical bird made several decades earlier by Eleazar Albin. See King vulture article for discussion.

Pelecaniformes

Pelicans and related birds

-   Bermuda night heron, _Nyctanassa carcinocatactes_ (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century)

        Sometimes assigned to the genus _Nycticorax_.

-   Réunion night heron, _Nycticorax duboisi_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
-   Mauritius night heron, _Nycticorax mauritianus_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
-   Rodrigues night heron, _Nycticorax megacephalus_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
-   Ascension night heron, _Nycticorax olsoni_ (Ascension Island, Atlantic, late 16th century?)

        Known only from subfossil bones, but the description of a flightless Ascension bird by André Thévet cannot be identified with anything other than this species.

-   New Zealand little bittern, _Ixobrychus novaezelandiae_ (New Zealand, late 19th century)

        Long considered to be vagrant individuals of the Australian little bittern, bones recovered from Holocene deposits indicate that this was indeed a distinct taxon, but it might not be a separate species.

-   Réunion ibis, _Threskiornis solitarius_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, early 18th century)

        This species was the basis of the "Réunion solitaire", a supposed relative of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire. Given the fact that ibis (but no dodo-like) bones were found on Réunion and that old descriptions match a flightless sacred ibis quite well, the "Réunion solitaire" hypothesis has been refuted.

Suliformes

Boobies and related birds

-   Spectacled cormorant, _Phalacrocorax perspicillatus_ (Komandorski Islands, North Pacific, c. 1850)
-   Mascarene booby, _Papasula_ sp. (Mauritius and Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-19th century)
    -   An undescribed booby species that was formerly considered a population of Abbott's booby. Known physically only from subfossil bones, but is likely the bird referred to as a "boeuf" by early settlers. The "boeuf" was last recorded on Rodrigues in 1832 and likely went extinct following the deforestation of the island.

Procellariiformes

Petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses and storm petrels.

-   Olson's petrel, _Bulweria bifax_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
-   Bermuda shearwater, _Puffinus parvus_ (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 16th century)
-   Saint Helena petrel, _Pseudobulweria rupinarum_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
-   Jamaica petrel, _Pterodroma caribbaea_ (Jamaica, Caribbean)

        Possibly a subspecies of the black-capped petrel; unconfirmed reports suggest it might survive. Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.

-   _Pterodroma_ cf. _leucoptera_ (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, 20th century?)

        A wing of a carcass similar to Gould's petrel was recovered on Mangareva in 1922, where it possibly bred. No such birds are known to exist there today.

-   Guadalupe storm petrel, _Oceanodroma macrodacyla_ (Guadalupe, East Pacific, 1910s)

        Officially critically endangered, possibly extinct, but a thorough survey in 2000 concluded the species was certainly extinct.

-   Imber's petrel, _Pterodroma imberi_

        Described from subfossil remains from the Chatham Islands, became apparently extinct in the early 19th century.

Sphenisciformes

Penguins

-   The Chatham penguin, _Eudyptes_ sp. (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific), is only known from subfossil bones, but a bird kept captive at some time between 1867 and 1872 might refer to this taxon.

Columbiformes

]] Pigeons, doves and dodos
For the "Réunion solitaire", see Réunion ibis.

-   Saint Helena dove, _Dysmoropelia dekarchiskos_, possibly survived into the Modern Era.
-   Passenger pigeon, _Ectopistes migratorius_ (Eastern North America, 1914)

        The passenger pigeon was once among the most common birds in the world, a single flock numbering up to 2.2 billion birds. It was hunted close to extinction for food and sport in the late 19th century. The last individual, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

-   Bonin wood pigeon, '' Columba versicolor'' (Nakodo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1890)
-   Ryukyu wood pigeon, _Columba jouyi_ (Okinawa and Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, late 1930s)
-   Réunion pink pigeon, _Nesoenas duboisi_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)

        Formerly in _Streptopelia_. There seems to have been at least another species of pigeon on Réunion (probably an _Alectroenas_), but bones have not yet been found. It disappeared at the same time.

-   Rodrigues pigeon, _Nesoenas rodericana_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, before 1690?)

        Formerly in _Streptopelia_. A possible subspecies of the Madagascar turtle dove (_N. picturata_), this seems not to be the bird observed by Leguat. Introduced rats might have killed it off in the late 17th century.

-   Liverpool pigeon, _"Caloenas" maculata_

        Also known as the spotted green pigeon, the only known specimen has been in Liverpool Museum since 1851 and was probably collected on a Pacific island for Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It has been suggested that this bird came from Tahiti based on native lore about a somewhat similar extinct bird called the _titi_, but this has not been verified.

-   Purple-winged ground dove, _Claravis geoffroyi_ (Pampas, East-central South America, 2007?[3])
-   Sulu bleeding-heart, _Gallicolumba menagei_ (Tawitawi, Philippines, late 1990s?)

        Officially listed as critically endangered. Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the Sulu Archipelago in 1995, however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline, and by now, habitat destruction is almost complete. If not extinct, this species is very rare, but the ongoing civil war prevents comprehensive surveys.

-   Norfolk ground dove, _Gallicolumba norfolciensis_ (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1800)
-   Tanna ground dove, _Gallicolumba ferruginea_ (Tanna, Vanuatu, late 18th-19th century)

        Only known from descriptions of two now-lost specimens.

-   Thick-billed ground dove, _Gallicolumba salamonis_ (Makira and Ramos, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)

        Last recorded in 1927, only two specimens exist. Declared extinct in 2005.

-   ]]Choiseul pigeon, _Microgoura meeki_ (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, early 20th century)
-   Red-moustached fruit dove, _Ptilinopus mercierii_ (Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, Marquesas, mid-20th century)

        Two subspecies, the little-known _P. m. mercierii_ of Nuku Hiva (extinct mid-late 19th century) and _P. m. tristrami_ of Hiva Oa.

-   Negros fruit dove, _Ptilinopus arcanus_ (Negros, Philippines, late 20th century?)

        Known only from one specimen taken at the only documented sighting in 1953, the validity of this species has been questioned, but no good alternative to distinct species status has been proposed. Officially critically endangered, it might occur on Panay, but no survey has located it. One possible record in 2002 does not seem to have been repeated.

-   ]]Mauritius blue pigeon, _Alectroenas nitidissima_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1830s)
-   Farquhar blue pigeon, _Alectroenas_ sp. (Farquhar Group, Seychelles, 19th century)

        Only known from early reports; possibly a subspecies of the Comoros or Seychelles blue pigeon.

-   Rodrigues grey pigeon, _"Alectroenas" rodericana_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)

        A mysterious bird of unknown affinities, known from a few bones and, as it seems, two historical reports.

-   Dodo, _Raphus cucullatus_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, late 17th century)

        Called _Didus ineptus_ by Linnaeus. A metre-high flightless bird found on Mauritius. Its forest habitat was lost when Dutch settlers moved to the island and the dodo's nests were destroyed by the monkeys, pigs and cats that the Dutch brought with them. The last specimen was killed in 1681, only 80 years after the arrival of the new predators.

-   Rodrigues solitaire, _Pezophaps solitaria_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1730)

Psittaciformes

Parrots '', Museum Wiesbaden, Germany]]

-   New Caledonian lorikeet, _Charmosyna diadema_ (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century?)

        Officially critically endangered, there have been no reliable reports of this bird since the early 20th century. It is, however, small and inconspicuous.

-   ]]Norfolk kaka, '' Nestor productus'' (Norfolk and Philip Islands, SW Pacific, 1851?)
-   Society parakeet, _Cyanoramphus ulietanus_ (Raiatea, Society Islands, late 18th century)
-   Black-fronted parakeet, _Cyanoramphus zealandicus_ (Tahiti, Society Islands, c. 1850)
-   Paradise parrot, _Psephotus pulcherrimus_ (Rockhampton area, Australia, late 1920s)
-   Oceanic eclectus parrot, _Eclectus infectus_, known from subfossil bones found on Tonga, Vanuatu, and possibly Fiji, may have survived until the 18th century: a bird which seems to be a male _Eclectus_ parrot was drawn in a report on the Tongan island of Vavaʻu by the Malaspina expedition. Also a 19th-century Tongan name _ʻāʻā_ ("parrot") for "a beautiful bird found only at ʻEua" is attested (see here[4] under "kaka"). This seems to refer either _E. infectus_ which in Tonga is only known from Vavaʻu and ʻEua, or the extirpated population of the collared lory which also occurred there. It is possible but unlikely that the species survived on ʻEua until the 19th century.
-   ]]Seychelles parakeet, _Psittacula wardi_ (Seychelles, W Indian Ocean, 1883)
-   Newton's parakeet, _Psittacula exsul_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1875)
-   Mascarene grey parakeet, _Psittacula bensoni_ (Mauritius, possible Réunion as _Psittacula cf bensoni_). Formerly described as Mauritius grey parrot, _Lophopsittacus bensoni_. Known from a 1602 sketch by Captain Willem van Westzanen and by subfossil bones described by David Thomas Holyoak in 1973. Might have survived to the mid-18th century.
-   Mascarene parrot, _Mascarinus mascarin_ (Réunion and possibly Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1834?)

        Last known individual was a captive bird which was alive before 1834.

-   Broad-billed parrot, _Lophopsittacus mauritianus_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1680?)

        May have survived to the late 18th century.

-   Rodrigues parrot, _Necropsittacus rodericanus_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, late 18th century)

        The species _N. francicus_ is fictional, _N. borbonicus_ most likely so.

-   Glaucous macaw, _Anodorhynchus glaucus_ (N Argentina, early 20th century)

        Officially critically endangered due to persistent rumors of wild birds, but probably extinct.

-   Cuban macaw, _Ara tricolor_ (Cuba, West Indies, late 19th century)

        A number of related species have been described from the West Indies, but are not based on good evidence. Several prehistoric forms are now known to have existed in the region, however.

-   Carolina parakeet, _Conuropsis carolinensis_ (SE North America, c. 1930?)

        Although the date of the last captive bird's death in the Cincinnati Zoo, 1918, is generally given as its extinction date, there are convincing reports of some wild populations persisting until later. Two subspecies, _C. c. carolinensis_ (Carolina parakeet, east and south of the Appalachian range–extinct 1918 or c. 1930) and _C. c. ludovicianus_ (Louisiana parakeet, west of the Appalachian range–extinct c. 1912).

-   Guadeloupe parakeet, _Aratinga labati_ (Guadeloupe, West Indies, late 18th century)

        Only known from descriptions, the former existence of this bird is likely for biogeographic reasons and because details as described cannot be referred to known species.

-   Martinique amazon, _Amazona martinica_ (Martinique, West Indies, mid-18th century)
-   Guadeloupe amazon, _Amazona violacea_ (Guadeloupe, West Indies, mid-18th century)

        These extinct amazon parrots were originally described after travelers' descriptions. Both are now considered valid extinct species that are closely related to the imperial amazon.

Cuculiformes

Cuckoos

-   Delalande's coua, _Coua delalandei_ (Madagascar, late 19th century?)
-   Saint Helena cuckoo, _Nannococcyx psix_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, 18th century)

-   Guadalupe caracara, _Caracara lutosa_ (Guadalupe, E Pacific, 1900 or 1903)
-   Réunion kestrel, _Falco duboisi_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)

Strigiformes

]] Typical owls and barn owls.

-   Pernambuco pygmy owl, _Glaucidium mooreorum_ (Pernambuco, Brazil, 2001?[5])

        Might still exist, classified as critically endangered. A 2018 BirdLife study citing extinction patterns recommended reclassifying this species as possibly extinct.

-   Réunion owl, _Mascarenotus grucheti_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century?)
-   Mauritius owl, _Mascarenotus sauzieri_ (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1850)
-   Rodrigues owl, _Mascarenotus murivorus_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)

        The preceding three species were variously placed in _Bubo_, _Athene_, _"Scops"_ (=_Otus_), _Strix_ and _Tyto_ before their true affinity was realized.

-   New Caledonian boobook, _Ninox_ cf. _novaeseelandiae_ (New Caledonia, Melanesia)

        Known only from prehistoric bones, but might still survive.

-   Laughing owl, _Sceloglaux albifacies_ (New Zealand, 1914?)

        Two subspecies, _S. a. albifacies_ (South Island and Stewart Island, extinct 1914?) and _S. a. rufifacies_ (North Island, extinct c. 1870s?); circumstantial evidence suggests that small remnants survived until the early/mid-20th century.

-   The Puerto Rican barn owl, _Tyto cavatica_, known from prehistoric remains found in caves of Puerto Rico, West Indies; may still have existed in 1912, given reports of the presence of cave-roosting owls.
-   The Andros Island barn owl, _Tyto pollens_, known from prehistoric remains found on Andros (Bahamas); may have survived to the 16th century, as indicated by the "chickcharney" legend.
-   Siau scops owl, _Otus siaoensis_ (20th century?)

        Only known from the holotype collected in 1866. Endemic to the small volcanic island of Siau north of Sulawesi in Indonesia; might still survive, as there are ongoing rumors of scops owls at Siau.

Caprimulgiformes

CAPRIMULGIDAE - nightjars and nighthawks
Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large insects and similar prey. They are easily located by the males' song, but this is not given all year. Habitat destruction represents currently the biggest threat, while island populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators, notably dogs, cats, pigs and mongooses.

-   Jamaican poorwill, _Siphonorhis americana_ (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century?)

        Reports of unidentifiable nightjars from the 1980s in habitat appropriate for _S. americana_ suggest that this cryptic species may still exist. Research into this possibility is currently underway; pending further information, it is classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.

-   Cuban pauraque, _Siphonorhis daiquiri_ (Cuba, West Indies, prehistoric?)

        Described from subfossil bones in 1985. There are persistent rumors that this bird, which was never seen alive by scientists, may still survive. Compare Puerto Rican nightjar and preceding.

-   Vaurie's nightjar (_Caprimulgus centralasicus_) is only known from a single 1929 specimen from Xinjiang, China. It has never been found again, but the validity of this supposed species is seriously disputed. It was never refuted to be an immature female desert European nightjar.

Apodiformes

Swifts and hummingbirds

-   Coppery thorntail, _Discosura letitiae_ (Bolivia?)

        Known only from three trade specimens of unknown origin. Might still exist.

-   Brace's emerald, _Chlorostilbon bracei_ (New Providence, Bahamas, late 19th century)
-   Gould's emerald, _Chlorostilbon elegans_ (Jamaica or northern Bahamas, West Indies, late 19th century)
-   Turquoise-throated puffleg, _Eriocnemis godini_ (Ecuador, 20th century?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Known only from six pre-1900 specimens, the habitat at the only known site where it occurred has been destroyed. However, the bird's distribution remains unresolved.

Coraciiformes

Kingfishers and related birds

-   Saint Helena hoopoe, _Upupa antaois_ (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)

Piciformes

Woodpeckers and related birds

-   Bermuda flicker (_Colaptes oceanicus_) (Bermuda, 17th century?)

    Known only from fossils found in Bermuda and dated to the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene; however, a 17th century report written by explorer Captain John Smith may refer to this species.

-   Imperial woodpecker, _Campephilus imperialis_ (Mexico, late 20th century)

    This 60-centimetre-long woodpecker is officially listed as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Occasional unconfirmed reports come up, the most recent was in late 2005.

-   Ivory-billed woodpecker, _Campephilus principalis_ (Southeastern U.S. and Cuba, late 20th century)

        The American ivory-billed woodpecker (_Campephilus principalis principalis_) is most likely extinct, but there is uncertainty on whether or not it was rediscovered in the White River National Wildlife Refuge of Arkansas in 2004, as intensive searching in the five following years has failed to confirm its survival.
        The Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (_Campephilus principalis bairdii_) was last seen in 1987 and is generally considered extinct, but a few patches of unsurveyed potential habitat remain.

Passeriformes

Perching birds

FURNARIIDAE- Ovenbirds

-   Cryptic treehunter, _Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti_ (E Brazil, 2007?)

        Officially classified as possibly extinct.

-   Alagoas foliage-gleaner, _Philydor novaesi_ (E Brazil, 2011?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, though a 2018 BirdLife study citing extinction patterns recommended reclassifying this species as extinct.

, victim of feral cats]] ACANTHISITTIDAE– New Zealand "wrens"

-   Lyall's wren, _Traversia lyalli_ (New Zealand, 1895?)

        The species famously (but erroneously) claimed to have been made extinct by a single cat named "Tibbles".

-   Bushwren, _Xenicus longipes_ (New Zealand, 1972)

        Three subspecies: _X. l. stokesi_ (North Island, extinct 1955); _X. l. longipes_ (South Island, extinct 1968); _X. l. variabilis_ (Stewart Island, extinct 1972).

MOHOIDAE – Hawaiian "honeyeaters". Family established in 2008, previously in Meliphagidae.

-   Kioea, _Chaetoptila angustipluma_ (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1860s)
-   ]]Hawaiʻi ʻōʻō, _Moho nobilis_ (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1930s)
-   Oʻahu ʻōʻō, _Moho apicalis_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
-   Molokaʻi ʻōʻō, _Moho bishopi_ (Molokaʻi and probably Maui, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1910 or 1980s)
-   Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, _Moho braccatus_ (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1987)

MELIPHAGIDAE – honeyeaters and Australian chats

-   Chatham bellbird, _Anthornis melanocephala_ (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1910)

        Sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the New Zealand bellbird, _Anthornis melanura_. Unconfirmed records exist from the early-mid-1950s.

-   The identity of _"Strigiceps leucopogon"_ (an invalid name),[6] described by Lesson in 1840, is unclear. Apart from the holotype supposedly from "New Holland", a second specimen from the "Himalaya" may have existed (or still exist). Lesson tentatively allied it to the Meliphagidae, and Rothschild felt reminded of the kioea.

ACANTHIZIDAE – scrubwrens, thornbills, and gerygones

-   Lord Howe gerygone, _Gerygone insularis_ (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1930)

PACHYCEPHALIDAE – whistlers, shrike-thrushes, pitohuis and allies

-   Mangarevan whistler, ?_Pachycephala gambierana_ (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, late 19th century?)

        Tentatively placed here. A mysterious bird of which no specimens exist today. It was initially described as a shrike, then classified as an _Eopsalteria_ "robin" and may actually be an _Acrocephalus_ warbler.

DICRURIDAE – monarch flycatchers and allies

-   Maupiti monarch, _Pomarea pomarea_ (Maupiti, Society Islands, mid-19th century)
-   Eiao monarch, _Pomarea fluxa_ (Eiao, Marquesas, late 1970s)

        Previously considered a subspecies of the Iphis monarch, this is an early offspring of the Marquesan stock.

-   Nuku Hiva monarch, _Pomarea nukuhivae_ (Nuku Hiva, Marquesas, mid-late 20th century)

        Previously considered a subspecies of the Marquesas monarch, this is another early offspring of the Marquesan stock.

-   Ua Pou monarch, _Pomarea mira_ (Ua Pou, Marquesas, c. 1986)

        Previously considered another subspecies of the Marquesas monarch, this was a distinct species most closely related to that bird and the Fatuhiva monarch.

-   Guam flycatcher, _Myiagra freycineti_ (Guam, Marianas, 1983)

ORIOLIDAE – Old World orioles and allies

-   North Island piopio, _Turnagra tanagra_ (North Island, New Zealand, c. 1970?)

        Not reliably recorded since about 1900.

-   South Island piopio, _Turnagra capensis_ (South Island, New Zealand, 1960s?)

        Two subspecies, _T. c. minor_ from Stephens Island (extinct c. 1897) and the nominate _T. c. capensis_ from the South Island mainland (last specimen taken in 1902, last unconfirmed record in 1963)

CALLAEIDAE – New Zealand wattlebirds ]]

-   Huia, _Heteralocha acutirostris_ (North Island, New Zealand, early 20th century)

HIRUNDINIDAE – swallows and martins

-   White-eyed river martin, _Pseudochelidon sirintarae_ (Thailand, late 1980s?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, this enigmatic species is only known from migrating birds and it was last seen in 1986 at its former roost site. Recent unconfirmed reports suggest that it may occur in Cambodia.

-   Red Sea cliff swallow, _Petrochelidon perdita_ (Red Sea area, late 20th century?)

        Known from a single specimen, this enigmatic swallow probably still exists, but the lack of recent records is puzzling. It is alternatively placed in the genus _Hirundo_.

ACROCEPHALIDAE – marsh and tree warblers

-   Nightingale reed warbler, _Acrocephalus luscinius_ (Guam, c. 1970's)
-   Aguiguan reed warbler, _Acrocephalus nijoi_ (Aguiguan, Marianas, c. 1997)
-   Mangareva reed warbler, _Acrocephalus astrolabii_ (Marianas?, mid-19th century?)

        Known from just two specimens found from Mangareva Island in the western Pacific.

-   Pagan reed warbler, _Acrocephalus yamashinae_ (Pagan, Marianas, 1970s)
-   Garrett's reed warbler, _Acrocephalus musae_ (Society Islands, 19th century?)
-   Moorea reed warbler,'' Acrocephalus longirostris'' (Moorea, Society Islands, 1980s?)

        Last reliable sighting was in 1981. Survey in 1986/1987 remained unsuccessful. A photograph of a warbler from Moorea in 1998 or 1999 taken by Philippe Bacchet remains uncertain, as do reports from 2003 and 2010.

MUSCICAPIDAE – Old World flycatchers and chats

-   Rück's blue flycatcher, _Cyornis ruckii_ (Malaysia or Indochina, 20th century?)

        An enigmatic bird known from two or four possibly migrant specimens, last recorded in 1918. Might exist in northeast Indochina and might be a subspecies of the Hainan blue flycatcher.

MEGALURIDAE – megalurid warblers or grass warblers

-   Chatham fernbird, _Bowdleria rufescens_ (Chatham Islands, New Zealand, c. 1900)

        Often placed in genus _Megalurus_, but this is based on an incomplete review of the evidence.

CISTICOLIDAE – cisticolas and allies

-   Tana River cisticola, _Cisticola restrictus_ (Kenya, 1970s?)

        A mysterious bird, found in the Tana River basin in small numbers at various dates, but not since 1972. Probably invalid, based on aberrant or hybrid specimens. An unconfirmed sighting was apparently made in 2007 in the Tana River Delta.

ZOSTEROPIDAE – white-eyes - probably belonging to Timaliidae

-   Marianne white-eye, _Zosterops semiflavus_ (Marianne Island, Seychelles, late 19th century)
-   Lord Howe white-eye, _Zosterops strenuus_ (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1918)
-   White-chested white-eye, _Zosterops albogularis_ (Norfolk Island, between 2006 and 2010)

TIMALIIDAE – Old World babblers

-   Black-browed babbler, _Malacocincla perspicillata_ (Borneo?, Indonesia, 20th century?)

        Known from a single mid-19th century specimen, this bird may be extinct or could still exist. If the specimen label, usually considered erroneous in claiming "Java" as the bird's origin, is correct, it may have gone extinct earlier.

PYCNONOTIDAE – bulbuls

-   Rodrigues bulbul, _Hypsipetes cowlesi_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, extinction date unknown, 17th century or 18th century might be possible)

        Known only from subfossil bones.

SYLVIOIDEA _INCERTAE SEDIS_

-   Aldabra brush warbler, _Nesillas aldabrana_ (Aldabra, Indian Ocean, c. 1984)
-   Rodrigues "babbler" (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, 17th century?)

        Known from subfossil bones. Provisionally assigned to Timaliidae, but placement highly doubtful.

STURNIDAE – starlings ]]

-   Kosrae starling, _Aplonis corvina_ (Kosrae, Carolines, mid-19th century)
-   Mysterious starling, _Aplonis mavornata_ (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid-19th century)
-   Tasman starling, _Aplonis fusca_ (Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1923)

        Two subspecies, _A. f. fusca_– Norfolk starling (extinct c. 1923); _A. fusca hulliana_– Lord Howe starling (extinct c. 1919).

-   Pohnpei starling, _Aplonis pelzelni_ (Pohnpei, Micronesia, c. 2000)

        Only one reliable record since 1956, in 1995, leaves the species' survival seriously in doubt.

-   Bay starling, _Aplonis? ulietensis_ (Raiatea, Society Islands, between 1774 and 1850)

        Usually called "bay thrush" (_Turdus ulietensis_); a mysterious bird from Raiatea, now only known from a painting and some descriptions of a (now lost) specimen. Its taxonomic position is thus unresolvable at present, although for biogeographic reasons and because of the surviving description, it has been suggested to have been a honeyeater. However, with the discovery of fossils of the prehistorically extinct starling _Aplonis diluvialis_ on neighboring Huahine, it seems likely that this bird also belonged to this genus.

-   Hoopoe starling, _Fregilupus varius_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, 1850s)

        Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae.

-   Rodrigues starling, _Necropsar rodericanus_ (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century?)

        Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae. The bird variously described as _Necropsar leguati_ or _Orphanopsar leguati_ and considered to be identical with _N. rodericanus_ (which is only known from subfossil bones) was found to be based on a misidentified albinistic specimen of the Martinique trembler (_Cinclocerthia gutturalis_)

TURDIDAE – thrushes and relatives

-   Grand Cayman thrush, _Turdus ravidus_ (Grand Cayman, West Indies, late 1940s)
-   Bonin thrush, _Zoothera terrestris_ (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1830s)
-   ʻĀmaui, _Myadestes woahensis_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
-   ]]Kāmaʻo, _Myadestes myadestinus_ (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1990s)
-   Olomaʻo, _Myadestes lanaiensis_ (Hawaiian Islands, 1980s?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered because a possible location on Molokaʻi remains unsurveyed. Two subspecies are known from Lanaʻi (_M. l. lanaiensis_, extinct early 1930s), Molokaʻi (_M. l. rutha_, extinct 1980s?) and a possible third subspecies from Maui (extinct before late 19th century).

MIMIDAE – mockingbirds and thrashers

-   Cozumel thrasher, _Toxostoma guttatum_ (Cozumel, Caribbean, early first decade of the 21st century?)

        It is still unknown whether the tiny population rediscovered in 2004 survived Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005. Unconfirmed records in April 2006 and October and December 2007.

ESTRILDIDAE– estrildid finches (waxbills, munias, etc.

-   Black-lored waxbill, _Estrilda nigriloris_ (D.R. Congo, Africa, late 20th century?)

        An enigmatic waxbill not seen since 1950; because part of its habitat is in Upemba National Park, it may survive.

ICTERIDAE – grackles

-   Slender-billed grackle, _Quiscalus palustris_ (Mexico, 1910)

PARULIDAE – New World warblers

-   ]]Bachman's warbler, _Vermivora bachmanii_ (southern US, c. 1990?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered.

-   Semper's warbler, _Leucopeza semperi_ (Saint Lucia, Caribbean, 1970s?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered. Suitable habitat remains and there have been unconfirmed records within the last decade.

PLOCEIDAE – weavers

-   Réunion fody, _Foudia delloni_

        Formerly _Foudia bruante_, which might refer to a color morph of the red fody.

FRINGILLIDAE – true finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers

-   Bonin grosbeak, _Chaunoproctus ferreorostris_ (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, 1830s)
-   ʻŌʻū, _Psittirostra psittacea_ (Hawaiian Islands, c. 2000?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered, this was once the most widespread species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. It has not been reliably recorded since 1987 or 1989.

-   Lanaʻi hookbill, _Dysmorodrepanis munroi_ (Lanaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1918)
-   Pila's palila, _Loxioides kikuichi_ (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands), possibly survived to the early 18th century.

-   Oʻahu nukupuʻu, _Hemignathus lucidus_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, late 19th century)
-   Hawaiʻi ʻakialoa or lesser ʻakialoa, _Akialoa obscurus_ (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1940)
-   Maui Nui ʻakialoa, _Akialoa lanaiensis_ (Lanaʻi and, prehistorically, probably Maui and Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1892)
-   Oʻahu ʻakialoa, _Akialoa ellisiana_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, early 20th century)
-   Kauaʻi ʻakialoa, _Akialoa stejnegeri_ (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1969)
-   (kākāwahie)]]Kakawahie, _Paroreomyza flammea_ (Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1963)
-   Oʻahu ʻalauahio, _Paroreomyza maculata_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, early 1990s?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered. Last reliable record was in 1985, with an unconfirmed sighting in 1990.

-   Maui akepa, _Loxops ochraceus_ (Maui, Hawaiian Islands, 1988)
-   Oʻahu akepa, _Loxops wolstenholmei_ (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, 1900s)

-   Laysan honeycreeper, _Himatione fraithii_ (Laysan, Hawaiian Islands, 1923)
-   Poʻo-uli, _Melamprosops phaeosoma_ (Maui, Hawaiian Islands, 2004?)

        What was most likely the last known bird died in captivity on 28 November 2004.

EMBERIZIDAE – buntings and American sparrows

-   Hooded seedeater, _Sporophila melanops_ (Brazil, 20th century?)

        Officially classified as critically endangered. It is known only from a single male collected in 1823 and has variously been considered an aberrant yellow-bellied seedeater or a hybrid.

-   Bermuda towhee, _Pipilo naufragus_. Known by subfossil remains and possibly from a travel report by William Strachey in 1610.


Possibly extinct bird subspecies or status unknown

Extinction of subspecies is a subject very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as redlists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of threatened subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations, such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any combination of absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.

Struthioniformes

Ratites and related birds

-   Arabian ostrich, _Struthio camelus syriacus_ (Arabia, 1966)

    The last record of this ostrich subspecies was a bird found dead in Jordan in 1966.

Apterygiformes

-   North Island little spotted kiwi, _Apteryx owenii iredalei_ (North Island, New Zealand, late 19th century)

    A doubtfully distinct little spotted kiwi subspecies.

Casuariiformes

]]

-   King Island emu, _Dromaius novaehollandiae minor_ (King Island, Australia, 1822)

    A dwarf subspecies of the emu; extinct in the wild c. 1805, the last captive specimen died in 1822 in the Jardin des Plantes.

-   Kangaroo Island emu, _Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus_ (Kangaroo Island, Australia, 1827)

    A dwarf subspecies of the emu; extinct since c. 1827.

-   Tasmanian emu, _Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis_ (Tasmania, Australia, mid-19th century)

    A dwarf subspecies of the emu; the last wild bird was collected in 1845. It may have persisted in captivity until 1884. It may be invalid.

Tinamiformes

Tinamous

-   Magdalena tinamou, _Crypturellus (erythropus) saltuarius_ (Colombia, late 20th century?)

    Variously considered a red-legged tinamou subspecies or a distinct species, this bird is currently only known with certainty from the 1943 type specimen. An additional specimen exists (or existed), but its present whereabouts is unknown. Recent research suggest that it is still extant and there was a likely – although as yet unconfirmed – record near the type locality by Colombian ornithologist Oswaldo Cortés in late 2008.

Anseriformes

Ducks, geese and swans

-   Bering cackling goose, _Branta hutchinsii asiatica_ (Komandorski and Kuril Islands, N Pacific, c. 1914 or 1929)

    A subspecies of the cackling goose (formerly called the Bering Canada goose (_Branta canadensis asiatica_)) which is doubtfully distinct from the Aleutian subspecies.

-   Rennell Island teal, _Anas gibberifrons remissa_ (Rennell, Solomon Islands, c. 1959)

    A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the Sunda teal, which disappeared due to predation on young birds by introduced tilapia (_Oreochromis mossambicus_).

-   Niceforo's pintail, _Anas georgica niceforoi_ (Colombia, 1950s)

    A yellow-billed pintail subspecies that has not been recorded since the 1950s.

-   Borrero's cinnamon teal, _Anas cyanoptera borreroi_ (Colombia, mid-20th century?)

    A subspecies of the cinnamon teal known only from a restricted area in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, with a couple of records from Ecuador. It was discovered in 1946 and thought to be extinct by 1956.

-   Coues' gadwall, _Anas strepera couesi_ (Teraina, Kiribati, c.1900)

    This island subspecies of the gadwall was discovered in 1874 and has not been recorded since, with none found by a 1924 expedition from Honolulu's Bishop Museum.

Galliformes

Quails and relatives

-   Italian grey partridge, _Perdix perdix italica_ (Italy, 1980s)

    A subspecies of the grey partridge whose validity has been questioned; the last purebred individuals disappeared during the late 1980s due to hybridization with introduced birds.

-   Lake Amik black francolin, _Francolinus francolinus billypayni_ (S Turkey, possibly Lebanon, 1960s)

    A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the black francolin.

-   Sicilian black francolin, _Francolinus francolinus_ ssp. (Sicily, Mediterranean, c.1869)

    Another doubtfully distinct black francolin subspecies.

-   Heath hen, _Tympanuchus cupido cupido_, (New England, North America, 1932)

    A subspecies of the greater prairie-chicken or possibly a distinct species.

-   New Mexico sharp-tailed grouse, _Tympanuchus phasianellus hueyi_ (New Mexico, North America, 1950s)

    A sharp-tailed grouse subspecies, last recorded in Colfax County in 1952.

-   Moroccan guineafowl, _Numida meleagris sabyi_ (Morocco, mid-late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the helmeted guineafowl. Reportedly still kept in captivity in Morocco in the late 1990s. Possibly extinct in the wild by 1950, three records from the 1970s may refer to feral-domestic hybrids.

Charadriiformes

Shorebirds, gulls and auks

-   Kiritimati sandpiper, _Prosobonia cancellata cancellata_ (Kiritimati, Kiribati, 19th century?)

    The doubtfully distinct nominate subspecies of the Tuamotu sandpiper, sometimes considered a distinct species, but only known from a painting.

-   Andalusian hemipode, _Turnix sylvatica sylvatica_ (Mediterranean region, extant)

    The nominate subspecies of the small buttonquail has been considered likely extinct, having last been recorded in Spain in 1981. However, it was confirmed extant with the discovery of a population in Morocco in 2007.

-   Tawitawi small buttonquail, _Turnix sylvatica suluensis_ (Tawitawi, Philippines, mid-20th century?)

    A small buttonquail subspecies. It has not been recorded since the 1950s, but there have been few surveys and it is likely to persist.

-   New Caledonia painted buttonquail, _Turnix varius novaecaledoniae_ (New Caledonia, Melanesia, early 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the painted buttonquail that has been variously considered anything from a hybrid between introduced species to a full species. Plentiful subfossil bones indicate that it was indeed a good endemic form. The last specimen was taken in 1912 and surveys since have failed to record it.

Gruiformes

Rails and allies - probably paraphyletic

-   Goldman's yellow rail, _Coturnicops noveboracensis goldmani_ (Mexico, late 20th century?)

    A yellow rail subspecies that has not been recorded since 1964 and lost much of its wetland habitat.

-   Macquarie rail, _Gallirallus philippensis macquariensis_ (Macquarie Islands, southwest Pacific, 1880s)

    Buff-banded rail subspecies.

-   Raoul Island banded rail, _Gallirallus philippensis_ ssp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, southwest Pacific, late 19th century?)

    Reports of the former occurrence of the species on Raoul seem plausible enough, but they may relate to vagrant individuals of another buff-banded rail subspecies.

-   Peruvian rail, _Rallus semiplumbeus peruvianus_ (Peru, 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the Bogota rail which is known from a single specimen collected in the 1880s. It may still be extant.

-   Western Lewin's rail, _Lewinia pectoralis clelandi_ (SW Australia, late 1930s?)

    A subspecies of Lewin's rail not recorded since 1932 despite multiple surveys in the late 20th century.

-   Assumption white-throated rail, _Dryolimnas cuvieri abbotti_ (Assumption, Astove and Cosmoledo, Aldabra Islands, early 20th century)

    A white-throated rail subspecies.

-   Jamaican uniform crake, _Amaurolimnas concolor concolor_ (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century)

    The uniform crake's nominate subspecies declined rapidly to extinction following the introduction of the small Asian mongoose to Jamaica in 1872.

-   Intact rail, _Gymnocrex plumbeiventris intactus_ (Melanesia, 20th century?)

    A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the bare-eyed rail known from a single specimen, c. mid-19th century, from the Solomon Islands or New Ireland. The taxon may be extant.

-   Bornean Baillon's crake, _Porzana pusilla mira_ (Borneo, 20th century?)

    A subspecies of Baillon's crake known from a single 1912 specimen and not found since; may be extinct, but the species is hard to find.

-   Moroccan bustard, _Ardeotis arabs lynesi_ (Morocco, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the Arabian bustard. Last observed in 1993 at Lac Merzouga/Lac Tamezguidat.

-   Luzon sarus crane, _Antigone antigone luzonica_ (Luzon, Philippines, late 1960s)

    A subspecies of the sarus crane which is not always accepted as valid, possibly because the existing specimens have not been thoroughly studied since it was described.

Ciconiiformes

Herons and related birds - possibly paraphyletic

-   Bonin nankeen night heron, _Nycticorax caledonicus crassirostris_ (Nakoudo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1890)

    A nankeen night heron subspecies.

-   Principe olive ibis, _Bostrychia olivacea rothschildi_ (Principe, Gulf of Guinea, extant)

    A subspecies of the olive ibis or (as _B. bocagei rothschildi_) the São Tomé ibis if this is considered a distinct species. It was unrecorded through most of the 20th century and has been considered extinct, but was recorded on multiple occasions in the 1990s and should now be considered extant.

Pteroclidiformes

Sandgrouses

-   Fayyum sandgrouse, _Pterocles exustus floweri_ (Fayyum area, Egypt, late 20th century?)

    This subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse was last recorded in 1979 and is likely to have gone extinct since.

Columbiformes

Pigeons, doves and dodos

-   Madeiran wood pigeon, _Columba palumbus maderensis_ (Madeira, East Atlantic, early 20th century)

    A subspecies of the wood pigeon.

-   Ogasawara Japanese wood pigeon, _Columba janthina nitens_ (Ogasawara Islands, Northwest Pacific, extant)

    Japanese wood pigeon subspecies thought to have gone extinct in the 1980s, but there have been recent reports and photographs and the taxon is now considered extant, though very rare.

-   Lord Howe pigeon, _Columba vitiensis godmanae_ (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, 1853)

    Metallic pigeon subspecies last recorded in 1853 and almost certainly extinct by 1869.

-   Tongan metallic pigeon, _Columba vitiensis_ ssp. (Vava'u, Tonga, late 18th century?)

    This subspecies of the metallic pigeon is only known from a footnote in John Latham's _General History of Birds_ and seems to have died out some time before 1800; possibly, the location is erroneous and the note really refers to the extant population on Fiji.

-   Amirante turtle-dove, _Nesoenas picturata aldabrana_ (Amirante Islands, Seychelles, late 20th century)

    This subspecies of the Malagasy turtle dove persisted until at least 1974, after which it was hybridised out of existence through breeding with the introduced nominate subspecies.

-   Catanduanes bleeding-heart, _Gallicolumba luzonica rubiventris_ (Catanduanes, Philippines, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the Luzon bleeding-heart known from a single specimen collected in 1971. There have been recent reports of the taxon and, as much of its forest habitat remains, it is likely to be extant.

-   Basilan bleeding-heart, _Gallicolumba crinigera bartletti_ (Basilan, Philippines, mid-20th century?)

    A subspecies of the Mindanao bleeding-heart, it was last reported in 1925 and given the massive habitat destruction is likely extinct.

-   Vella Lavella ground dove, _Gallicolumba jobiensis chalconota_ (Vella Lavella, Makira and Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the white-breasted ground dove or possibly a distinct species. Known from only four specimens, there are no recent records and the local population report it has disappeared.

-   White-headed Polynesian ground dove, _Gallicolumba erythroptera albicollis_ (Central Tuamotu Islands, 20th century?)

    The Central Tuamotu subspecies of the Polynesian ground dove, often referred to as _G. e. pectoralis_, disappeared at an undetermined date, but might still exist on some unsurveyed atolls. The identity of northern Tuamotu populations, possibly still extant, is undetermined.

-   Ebon crimson-crowned fruit dove, _Ptilinopus porphyraceus marshallianus_ (Ebon?, Marshall Islands, late 19th century?)

    Crimson-crowned fruit dove subspecies of doubtful validity. Known from a single specimen collected in 1859; it is not certain whether this bird actually occurred on Ebon. All that can be said is that this subspecies is no longer found anywhere.

-   Mauke fruit dove, _Ptilinopus rarotongensis "byronensis"_ (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid- or late 19th century)

    A subspecies of the lilac-crowned fruit dove, known only from the description of a now-lost specimen. The prehistorically extinct population on Mangaia is likely to belong to another distinct subspecies too.

-   Negros spotted imperial pigeon, _Ducula carola nigrorum_ (Negros and probably Siquijor, late 20th century?)

    Spotted imperial pigeon subspecies not recorded since the 1950s.

-   Norfolk pigeon, _Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae spadicea_ (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, early 20th century)

    A subspecies of the New Zealand pigeon not recorded since 1900. Similar birds were reported from Lord Howe Island; these seem to represent another extinct subspecies, but are undescribed to date.

-   Raoul Island kereru, _Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae_ ssp. nov. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 19th century)

    Another undescribed subspecies (or possibly species) of the New Zealand pigeon, known from bones and a brief report.[7]

Psittaciformes

Parrots

-   Sangir red and blue lory, _Eos histrio histrio_ (Sangir Archipelago, Indonesia, 1990s?)

    The nominate subspecies of the red-and-blue lory was hybridized out of existence by escaped trade individuals of the subspecies _talautensis_, the last purebred individuals disappearing in the 1990s or even much earlier.

-   Sinú parakeet, _Pyrrhura picta subandina_ (Colombia, mid-20th century?)

    Formerly recognized as a distinct species, this bird has a very restricted distribution and was last reliably recorded in 1949. It was not found during searches in 2004 and 2006 and seems to be extinct; efforts to find it again continue, but are hampered by the threat of armed conflict.

-   Challenger's lory, _Eos histrio challengeri_ (Nenusa Islands, Talaud Archipelago, early 20th century?)

    A supposed subspecies of the red and blue lory, but probably invalid.

-   Macquarie parakeet, _Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae erythrotis_ (Macquarie Islands, SW Pacific, 1890s)

    Red-crowned parakeet subspecies last recorded in 1890 and not found by surveys in 1894.

-   Lord Howe parakeet, _Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens_ (Lord Howe Island, SW Pacific, c. 1870)

    Red-crowned parakeet subspecies.

-   Réunion parakeet, _Psittacula eques eques_ (Réunion, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)

    Known only from a painting and descriptions; if it is accepted as valid, it would become the nominate subspecies of the Mauritius parakeet, extant on Mauritius, which would then have to be called _P. eques echo_.

-   Siquijor colasisi, _Loriculus philippensis siquijorensis_ (Siquijor, Philippines, 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the colasisi or Philippine hanging parrot, either very rare or already extinct.

-   Puerto Rican conure, _Aratinga chloroptera maugei_ (Mona and possibly Puerto Rico, West Indies, 1890s)

    A weakly differentiated subspecies of the Hispaniolan parakeet.

-   Sinú brown-throated parakeet, _Aratinga pertinax griseipecta_ (Colombia, mid- or late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the brown-throated parakeet known from only two specimens collected in 1949 and of unclear taxonomical and conservation status.

-   Culebra amazon, _Amazona vittata gracilipes_ (Culebra, West Indies, early 20th century)

    A weakly differentiated subspecies of the Puerto Rican amazon, which is itself highly endangered.

Cuculiformes

Cuckoos

-   Greater crested coua, _Coua cristata maxima_ (SE Madagascar, late 20th century?)

    Crested coua subspecies, known only from a single specimen taken in 1950. It may be a hybrid, but if not it is probably extinct.

-   Assumption Island coucal, _Centropus toulou assumptionis_ (Assumption Island, Seychelles, early 20th century)

    A Madagascar coucal subspecies last recorded in 1906. It is often considered synonymous with the Aldabra form _insularis_, which has since recolonized Assumption Island.

-   Cabo San Lucas groove-billed ani, _Crotophaga sulcirostris pallidula_ (Mexico, c. 1940)

    A weakly differentiated and probably invalid subspecies of the groove-billed ani.

-   Bahia rufous-vented ground cuckoo, _Neomorphus geoffroyi maximiliani_ (E Brazil, mid-20th century?)

    Rufous-vented ground cuckoo subspecies.

Falconiformes

Birds of prey

-   Cape Verde kite, ''Milvus _(_milvus_)_ fasciicauda'' (Cape Verde Islands, E Atlantic, 2000)

    Considered either a subspecies of the red kite, a distinct species, or a hybrid between red and black kites, the validity of this taxon has recently been questioned on the basis of molecular analysis. However, hybridization and a confusing molecular phylogeny of red kite populations, coupled with the distinct phenotype of the Cape Verde birds, suggest that the taxonomic status of this form is far from resolved.

-   Car Nicobar sparrowhawk, _Accipiter butleri butleri_ (Car Nicobar, Nicobar Islands, 20th century?)

    The nominate subspecies of the Nicobar sparrowhawk– which is currently listed as vulnerable– is possibly extinct. It was last reliably recorded in 1901 and despite searches, has not been sighted after an unconfirmed record in 1977. However, the species is known for being very shy and a population may persist unrecorded.

-   Volcano Islands peregrine falcon, _Falco peregrinus furuitii_. (Ogasawara Islands, 1940s)

    Peregrine falcon subspecies from the Ogasawara Islands. No sightings since 1945. A survey in 1982 failed to find this bird. Only known from Iwo Jima and Torishima.

Strigiformes

Typical owls and barn owls

-   Sulu reddish scops owl, _Otus rufescens burbidgei_ (Sulu, Philippines, mid-20th century)

    A subspecies of the reddish scops owl. Known from a single questionable specimen and may not be valid.

-   Virgin Islands screech owl, _Megascops nudipes newtoni_ (Virgin Islands, Caribbean, 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the Puerto Rican screech owl, of somewhat doubtful validity, which occurred on several of the Virgin Islands, West Indies. The last reliable records are in 1860; there were a number of unconfirmed reports during the 20th century, but it was not found in thorough surveys in 1995.

-   Socorro elf owl, _Micrathene whitneyi graysoni_ (Socorro, Revillagigedo Islands, mid-20th century?)

    A subspecies of the elf owl. Officially listed as critically endangered, the last specimen was taken in 1932, but there was apparently still a large population in 1958; it was not found by subsequent searches and it appears to be extinct.

-   Antiguan burrowing owl, _Athene cunicularia amaura_ (Antigua, St Kitts and Nevis, West Indies, c. 1900)

    Burrowing owl subspecies, last collected in 1890 and extinct by 1903.

-   Guadeloupe burrowing owl, _Athene cunicularia guadeloupensis_ (Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante, West Indies, c. 1890)

    Burrowing owl subspecies. Extinct by 1890.

-   Lord Howe boobook, _Ninox novaeseelandiae albaria_ (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, 1950s)

    Southern boobook subspecies last recorded in the 1950s.

-   Norfolk boobook, _Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata_ (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1990s)

    Individuals of the nominate subspecies were introduced in a last-ditch effort to save the local owl population. There now exists a hybrid population of a few dozen birds; the last individual of _N. n. undulata_, a female named _Miamiti_, died in 1996, though individuals descended from her remain.

-   Cave-nesting masked owl, _Tyto novaehollandiae troughtoni_ (Nullarbor Plain, Australia, 1960s)

    Doubtfully distinct from nominate subspecies, but differed behaviorally.

-   Buru masked owl, _Tyto sororcula cayelii_ (Buru, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)

    Subspecies of the lesser masked owl. Last recorded in 1921; the identity of a similar bird found on Seram remains to be determined. Seems to survive, as an owl matching this bird's description was encountered in August 2006.

-   Peleng masked owl, _Tyto rosenbergii pelengensis_ (Peleng, Banggai Islands, mid-20th century)

    Subspecies of the Sulawesi owl or a separate species. Possibly extant, but the only specimen known was taken in 1938 and there have been no further records.

-   Samar bay owl, _Phodilus badius riverae_ (Samar, Philippines, mid-20th century)

    Subspecies of the Oriental bay owl or a possibly distinct species. Taxonomy doubtful, but only specimen lost in 1945 bombing raid, so validity cannot be verified; no population exists on Samar today.

Caprimulgiformes

Nightjars and allies

-   New Caledonian white-throated nightjar, _Eurostopodus mystacalis exsul_ (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century)

    This distinct subspecies of the white-throated nightjar is possibly a separate species. It was found only once; due to its cryptic habits, it possibly still exists, but this is now considered unlikely.

Apodiformes

Swifts and hummingbirds

-   Miravalles hummingbird, _Amazilia cyanifrons alfaroana_ (Costa Rica, Central America, 20th century?)

    This subspecies of the indigo-capped hummingbird is only known from a specimen collected in Costa Rica in 1895. It is likely to have gone extinct since

-   Alejandro Selkirk firecrown, _Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi_ (Alejandro Selkirk Island, Juan Fernández Islands, Southeast Pacific, 1908)

    Juan Fernández firecrown subspecies last recorded in 1908.

-   Luzon Whitehead's swiftlet, _Collocalia whiteheadi whiteheadi_ (Luzon, Philippines, 20th century?)

    The nominate subspecies of Whitehead's swiftlet is only known from four specimens collected at Mount Data in 1895. From the lack of further records and the massive habitat destruction, it is usually considered extinct. Given the size of the island, it might still exist though.

Coraciiformes

Kingfishers and related birds

-   Sangihe dwarf kingfisher, _Ceyx fallax sangirensis_ (Sangihe, Indonesia, 1998?)

    This subspecies of the Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher was last seen in 1997 but not during a thorough survey one year later; it is either close to extinction or already extinct. Sometimes it is said to occur on Talaud Islands also, but this is erroneous.

-   Rarotonga kingfisher, _Todiramphus_ cf. _tutus_ (Rarotonga, Cook Islands, mid-1980s?)

    There exist reports of locals that kingfishers–probably a subspecies of the chattering kingfisher which is found on neighboring islands, but possibly vagrants from there–were found until around 1979 and there is a last record from 1984. Presently, no kingfishers are known to exist on Rarotonga.

-   Mangareva kingfisher, _Todiramphus gambieri gambieri_ (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, late 19th century)

    Only known from a single 1844 specimen, the nominate subspecies of the Tuamotu kingfisher was not found again when it was next searched for in 1922.

-   Guam kingfisher, _Todiramphus cinnamominus cinnamominus_ (Guam, West Pacific, 1986)

    This subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher became extinct in the wild in 1986 when 29 birds were taken for a captive breeding programme, which is ongoing. Its decline was caused by the depredations of introduced brown tree snakes.

-   Ryūkyū kingfisher, _Todiramphus cinnamominus miyakoensis_ (Miyako-jima, Ryukyu Islands, late 19th century)

    Previously considered as a full species, but better regarded as a subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher (_Todiramphus cinnamominus_). Only seen once by scientists, in 1887; the specimen taken is somewhat damaged, making identification by other than molecular analysis difficult. It is now thought likely that the specimen came from Guam, where the nominate subspecies was distributed, rather than Miyako, which would make this subspecies invalid.

-   Javan blue-banded kingfisher, _Alcedo euryzona euryzona_ (Java, Indonesia, extant)

    The nominate subspecies of the blue-banded kingfisher; the last specimen was taken in 1937 and the taxon has been considered extinct, but it was mist-netted five times in 2000-2001 at Halimun National Park, which has not undergone much change since.

-   Guadalcanal little kingfisher, _Alcedo pusilla aolae_ (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, ?)

    Little kingfisher subspecies.

-   Sakarha pygmy kingfisher, _Ispidina madagascariensis dilutus_ (Southwest Madagascar, late 20th century?)

    This subspecies of the Madagascar pygmy kingfisher is only known from one specimen taken in 1974 in an area where most habitat had already been lost. However, there have been records of the species (uncertain subspecies) from near the type locality, suggesting it is likely to be extant.

-   Ticao hornbill, _Penelopides panini ticaensis_ (Ticao, Philippines, 1970s)

    A subspecies of the Visayan hornbill of somewhat uncertain status–possibly a distinct species, possibly a color morph–the last confirmed report was in 1971 and it became extinct shortly thereafter.

Piciformes

Woodpeckers and related birds

-   Grand Bahama West Indian woodpecker, _Melanerpes superciliaris bahamensis_ (Grand Bahama, Bahamas, 1950s)

    A West Indian woodpecker subspecies of somewhat uncertain validity.

-   Javan buff-rumped woodpecker, _Meiglyptes tristis tristis_ (Java, Indonesia, c. 1920?)

    The nominate subspecies of the buff-rumped woodpecker became rare during the 19th century due to destruction of habitat. The last confirmed record was in 1880, and it is now considered at least very rare.

-   Guadalupe red-shafted flicker, _Colaptes auratus rufipileus_ (Guadalupe, East Pacific, c. 1910)

    A subspecies of the northern flicker (or the red-shafted flicker, as _C. cafer rufipileus_), it was last recorded in 1906 and not found again in both 1911 and 1922. It may be invalid. Recently, vagrant birds of a mainland red-shafted subspecies have begun recolonizing the island as the habitat improves after the removal of feral goats.

-   Northern white-mantled barbet, _Capito hypoleucus hypoleucus_ (Colombia, extant)

    The nominate subspecies of the white-mantled barbet has been considered extinct, but has been recorded recently.

-   Botero white-mantled barbet, _Capito hypoleucus carrikeri_ (Colombia, extant)

    Another subspecies of the white-mantled barbet, also considered extinct by some sources, but confirmed extant by researchers in Colombia.

-   Todd's jacamar, _Brachygalba lugubris phaeonota_ (Brazil, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the brown jacamar, or possibly a hybrid, color morph or full species. Might survive, as it is only known from a remote and seldom-visited area.

-   Cebu white-bellied woodpecker, _Dryocopus javensis cebuensis_ (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century)

    Only known by three specimens collected before 1900.

Passeriformes

Perching birds

PITTIDAE – pittas

-   Bougainville black-faced pitta, _Pitta anerythra pallida_ (Bougainville, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)

    A subspecies of the black-faced pitta. Once common on Bougainville; not recorded since 1938, but likely to have been overlooked.

-   Choiseul black-faced pitta, _Pitta anerythra nigrifrons_ (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, late 20th century?)

    Another subspecies of the black-faced pitta. Not found during recent searches; doubtful records from nearby islands. Also may have been overlooked by observers.

TYRANNIDAE – tyrant flycatchers

-   Bogotá bearded tachuri, _Polystictus pectoralis bogotensis_ (C Colombia, 20th century)

    A bearded tachuri subspecies, or possibly a distinct species, that has not been recorded for some time and is now extinct.

-   Grenadan Euler's flycatcher, _Lathrotriccus euleri flaviventris_ (Grenada, West Indies, 1950s?)

    A subspecies of Euler's flycatcher, formerly known as _Empidonax euleri johnstonei_. It has not been recorded since the 1950s.

-   San Cristóbal vermilion flycatcher, _Pyrocephalus rubinus dubius_ (San Cristóbal, Galapagos, late 20th century)

    A subspecies of the vermilion flycatcher, described as extremely rare by David W. Steadman in the 1980s and not found despite a six-month survey in 1998. Sometimes considered a full species.

FURNARIIDAE – ovenbirds

-   Peruvian scale-throated earthcreeper, _Upucerthia dumetaria peruana_ (Peru, 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the scale-throated earthcreeper, it is only known from two specimens taken in the early 1950s at Puno, Peru, and has never been found since. It may well persist, as there is no obvious reason why it should have become extinct.

-   Northern stripe-crowned spinetail, _Cranioleuca pyrrhophia rufipennis_ (N Bolivia, 20th century?)

    A stripe-crowned spinetail subspecies known from a few specimens and not recorded since the 1950s; may be endangered or possibly extinct.

FORMICARIIDAE – antpittas and antthrushes

-   Northern giant antpitta, _Grallaria gigantea lehmanni_ (Colombia, 20th century?)

    A giant antpitta (or possibly great antpitta) subspecies apparently not recorded since the 1940s. Might still survive in Puracé National Natural Park, where there is plentiful habitat remaining.

-   Antioquia brown-banded antpitta, _Grallaria milleri gilesi_ (Antioquia, Colombia, 20th century?)

    A brown-banded antpitta subspecies recently described from a specimen collected in 1878. It has not been recorded since, despite surveys at a number of likely locations.

MALURIDAE – Australasian "wrens"

-   Macdonnell Ranges grasswren, _Amytornis modestus modestus_ (Northern Territory, Australia, 1936)

    Thick-billed grasswren subspecies. The last record was a clutch of eggs taken in 1936.

-   Namoi grasswren, _Amytornis modestus inexpectatus_ (New South Wales, Australia, 1886)

    Another thick-billed grasswren subspecies, last recorded in 1886.

-   Large-tailed grasswren, _Amytornis textilis macrourus_ (Western Australia, 1910)

    Western grasswren subspecies, last collected in 1910 and since extinct.

PARDALOTIDAE – pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills and gerygones

-   Western rufous bristlebird, _Dasyornis broadbenti littoralis_ (Australia, mid-20th century)

    Rufous bristlebird subspecies not recorded since 1940, despite a number of surveys since, beginning in the 1970s.

-   King Island brown thornbill, _Acanthiza pusilla archibaldi_ (King Island, Australia, extant)

    A brown thornbill subspecies which has only been recorded c.10 times since its discovery and considered extinct by some sources. The latest record comes from 2002, suggesting a population is likely to be extant, but very rare.

PETROICIDAEAustralasian "robins"

-   Tiwi Island hooded robin, _Melanodryas cucullata melvillensis_ (Tiwi Islands, Australia, 1992)

    Subspecies of the hooded robin, last observed in 1992 and not found in exhaustive searches later in the 1990s.

CINCLOSOMATIDAE – whipbirds and allies

-   Mount Lofty spotted quail-thrush, _Cinclosoma punctatum anachoreta_ (Australia, mid-1980s?)

    A subspecies of the spotted quail-thrush, last recorded in 1983 and not found in a survey the following year.

ARTAMIDAE – woodswallows, currawongs and allies

-   Western pied currawong, _Strepera graculina ashbyi_ (Victoria, Australia, 1927)

    This pied currawong subspecies has been swamped by other subspecies, which probably came into contact following habitat destruction in the 1830s. The last certainly distinct individuals were recorded in 1927.

MONARCHIDAE – monarch flycatchers

-   Negros celestial monarch, _Hypothymis coelestis rabori_ (Negros and possibly Sibuyan, Philippines, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the celestial monarch, not uncommon on Negros in 1959, but not recorded since. A single Sibuyan specimen from an unspecified locality taken in the 19th century is the only record for this island.

-   Hiva Oa monarch, _Pomarea mendozae mendozae_ (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas, late 20th century)

    Marquesas monarch nominate subspecies, which was very rare by 1974 and not found during multiple surveys in the 1990s.

'''Rhipiduridae – fantails

-   Lord Howe fantail, _Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina_ (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1925)

    New Zealand fantail subspecies that was considered virtually extinct in 1924 and not found by surveys four years later.

-   Guam rufous fantail, _Rhipidura rufifrons uraniae_ (Guam, Marianas, 1984)

    Rufous fantail subspecies, a conspicuous bird which has not been recorded since 1984.

CAMPEPHAGIDAE – cuckoo-shrikes and trillers

-   Cebu bar-bellied cuckoo-shrike, _Coracina striata cebuensis_ (Cebu, Philippines, early 20th century)

    Bar-bellied cuckoo-shrike subspecies not recorded since its collection in 1906.

-   Maros cicadabird, _Coracina tenuirostris edithae_ (Sulawesi, mid-20th century)

    A subspecies of the cicadabird known from a single specimen collected in 1931; quite possibly just a vagrant individual.

-   Cebu blackish cuckoo-shrike, _Coracina coerulescens altera_ (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)

    A blackish cuckoo-shrike subspecies; could be extant as the birds are rather unmistakable and a 1999 record therefore likely to be valid, though surveys since then have failed to find it/

-   Marinduque blackish cuckoo-shrike, _Coracina coerulescens deschauenseei_ (Marinduque, Philippines, late 20th century?)

    Another blackish cuckoo-shrike subspecies, described from specimens collected in 1971, but apparently not seen since. As few ornithologists have visited Marinduque and forest remains on the island, it is thought likely to remain extant.

-   Norfolk long-tailed triller, _Lalage leucopyga leucopyga_ (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1942)

    A subspecies of the long-tailed triller, possibly a distinct species.

ORIOLIDAE – orioles and figbird

-   Cebu dark-throated oriole, _Oriolus xanthonotus assimilis_ (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)

    A distinct local white-with-black-markings color morph of the Icelandic subspecies of the common raven.

CALLAEIDAE – New Zealand wattlebirds

-   South Island kōkako, _Callaeas cinereus cinereus_ (South Island, New Zealand, 1960s?)

    This subspecies of the kōkako is usually considered extinct, as it has not been reliably recorded since 1967. However, recent reports from Fiordland suggest that a population could exist.

REGULIDAE – kinglets

-   Western Turner's eremomela, _Eremomela turneri kalindei_ (Congo Basin, late 20th century?)

    The West African subspecies of Turner's eremomela has not been recorded since the end of the 1970s, but there is unsurveyed habitat in its range where it is likely to survive. Placement in Cettiidae requires confirmation.

ACROCEPHALIDAE – acrocephalid warblers or marsh- and tree warblers

-   Marshall Islands reed warbler, _Acrocephalus rehsei_ ssp.? (Marshall Islands, Micronesia, c.1880?)

    Oral tradition and some early reports mention a bird called _annañ_ which inhabited some of the Marshall Islands. The best match is the Nauru reed warbler; the _annañ_ might have been an undescribed subspecies of that species, or a distant but related species of reed warbler.[8]

-   Laysan millerbird, _Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris_ (Laysan Island, Hawaiian Islands, late 1910s)

    The millerbird's nominate subspecies.

-   Huahine Polynesian warbler, _Acrocephalus caffer garretti_ (Huahine, Society Islands, c.1900)

PYCNONOTIDAE – bulbuls

-   Sumatra blue-wattled bulbul, _Pycnonotus nieuwenhuisii inexspectatus_ (Sumatra, Indonesia, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the blue-wattled bulbul known from a single 1937 specimen. The entire "species" may be a hybrid.

CISTICOLIDAE – cisticolas and allies

-   Northern white-winged apalis, _Apalis chariessa chariessa_ (Kenya, late 20th century?)

    The nominate subspecies of the white-winged apalis remains known only from the Tana River, a center of endemism. It was last recorded in 1961.

SYLVIIDAE – sylviid ("true") warblers and parrotbills

-   Vanua Levu long-legged warbler, _Trichocichla rufa clunei_ (Vanua Levu, Fiji, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the long-legged warbler; it was only found once, but there was an unconfirmed sighting in 1990, suggesting it is likely to remain extant. Placement in Sylviidae doubtful.

-   Fayyum warbler, _Sylvia melanocephala/momus norissae_ (Egypt, 1939)

    A doubtfully distinct Sardinian warbler subspecies. It has not been recorded since 1939.

-   Burmese Jerdon's babbler, _Chrysomma altirostre altirostre_ (Myanmar, 20th century?)

    The nominate subspecies of Jerdon's babbler was last confirmed in 1941, but as there has been little fieldwork in its range and a possible sighting in 1994, it is considered likely to persist.

"AFRICAN WARBLERS"

-   Chapin's crombec, _Sylvietta leucophrys chapini_ (Congo Basin, late 20th century?)

    A subspecies of the white-browed crombec, sometimes listed as a separate species. Restricted to the Lendu Plateau, it is probably rare, though unsurveyed forest remains where it is likely to persist.

SYLVIOIDEA _INCERTAE SEDIS_

-   Lake Amik bearded reedling, _Panurus biarmicus kosswigi_ (S Turkey, extant)

    Bearded reedling subspecies, which has been considered extinct owing to the drainage of Lake Amik, but is still extant in the area.

-   Guadalupe Bewick's wren, _Thryomanes bewickii brevicauda_ (Guadalupe, East Pacific, late 1890s?)

    Bewick's wren subspecies. An extinction date of "1903" seems to be in error;[9]the last unquestionable record dates from 1897 and a thorough search in 1901 failed to find it.

-   San Clemente Bewick's wren, _Thryomanes bewickii leucophrys_ (San Clemente, East Pacific, 1941)

    Another Bewick's wren subspecies, last recorded in 1941.

-   Daito wren, _Troglodytes troglodytes orii_ (Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, c. 1940)

    A disputed Eurasian wren subspecies; as it is known from a single specimen that may have been a vagrant individual; it is possibly invalid.

-   Guadeloupe house wren, _Troglodytes aedon guadeloupensis_ (Guadeloupe, Caribbean, late 20th century?)

    Found in 1914, 1969 and the 1970s; now very rare or already extinct. Taxonomy unresolved. Part of the house wren complex; other scientific names include _T. musculus guadeloupensis_ and _T. guadeloupensis_

-   Martinique house wren, _Troglodytes aedon martinicensis_ (Martinique, Caribbean, c. 1890)

    Last found in 1886. Another house wren complex taxon; other scientific names include _T. musculus martinicensis_ and _T. martinicensis_.

    Another subspecies of the island thrush, last collected in 1911 or 1912 and not found anymore in 1939.

-   Lord Howe thrush, _Turdus poliocephalus vinitinctus_ (early 20th century)

    Yet another island thrush subspecies, last recorded in 1913 and extinct by 1928.

-   Lifou thrush, _Turdus poliocephalus pritzbueri_ (Lifou, Melanesia, extant)

    Yet another subspecies of the island thrush. birds surviving on Tanna, New Hebrides, are presently considered the same subspecies. However, given the fact that the species readily differentiates into subspecies and that the distance between Tanna and Lifou is considerable, these birds may belong to a different subspecies, in which case the Lifou thrush would be considered extinct.

-   Peleng red-and-black thrush, _Zoothera mendeni mendeni_ (Peleng, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)

    Red-and-black thrush nominate subspecies; little known.

-   Kibale black-eared ground thrush, _Zoothera camaronensis kibalensis_ (SW Uganda, late 20th century?)

    A black-eared ground thrush subspecies known only from two 1966 specimens. Likely to survive in suitable habitat but could be already extinct.

-   Choiseul russet-tailed thrush, _Zoothera heinei choiseuli_ (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)

    A subspecies of the russet-tailed thrush known from a single specimen found in 1924. It could have been killed off by introduced cats, but the island is poorly known and so it should not be presumed extinct.

-   Saint Lucia forest thrush, _Cichlherminia lherminieri sanctaeluciae_ (St Lucia, West Indies, extant)

    A subspecies of the forest thrush. It has been thought extinct, but the taxon was recorded at Des Chassin in 2007.

-   Pines solitaire, _Myadestes elisabeth retrusus_ (Isla de la Juventud, West Indies, 20th century)

-   Gonâve western chat-tanager, _Calyptophilus tertius abbotti_ (Gonâve, West Indies, c. 1980?)

    A western chat-tanager subspecies last recorded in 1977 and probably extinct.

-   Samaná eastern chat-tanager, _Calyptophilus frugivorus frugivorus_ (E Hispaniola, West Indies, late 20th century)

    An eastern chat-tanager subspecies; the last (unconfirmed?) record was in 1982 and concerted efforts to find it since have failed.
