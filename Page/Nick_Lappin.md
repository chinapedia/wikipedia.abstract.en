Playing career

As a youth, Lappin played in the 2005 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Chicago Mission minor ice hockey team.[1]

Undrafted, Lappin played collegiate hockey with Brown University of the ECAC. Upon completing his senior year in the 2015–16 season, with 33 points in just 31 games, Lappin was signed by the New Jersey Devils to a two-year entry-level deal on March 9, 2016.[2] He soon made his professional debut with the Devils AHL affiliate namesake, in Albany, appearing in 12 games for 7 points. In the post-season, Lappin continued his immediate contribution with 5 goals and 7 points in 11 games.

In his first full professional season in 2016–17, Lappin made his NHL debut for the Devils on October 28, 2016 against the Chicago Blackhawks.[3] He recorded his first NHL point with an assist one night later against the Tampa Bay Lightning.[4] On November 8, 2016, Lappin scored his first NHL goal in a 3–2 win against the Carolina Hurricanes.[5]

On July 1, 2019, Lappin left the Devils organization after 5 seasons to sign as a free agent on a one-year, two-way contract with the St. Louis Blues.[6]
