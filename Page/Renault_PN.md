The RENAULT PN is a bus produced from 1926 until 1930 by the French manufacturer Renault for the Paris service. A variant for suburban transport was called _Renault PY_.


History

In 1926, the Société des transports en commun de la région parisienne (STCRP), the predecessor of the RATP, made its first major order of buses to Renault, after a minor order of Renaults KX _Express_. The order consisted of 50[1] (47 delivered) new low-floor models with rear entry, called Renault PN. 330 PNs were delivered between 1927 and 1930. The PNs were on service until the 1950s.[2]

In 1929, Renault introduced a PN version for suburban use, called PY.[3] 25 were delivered and they were retired from service in 1939.


Technical details

Both the PN and the PY have the same engine, a 5.03-litre flathead inline-four unit, with a power output between at 1,000 rpm and at 1,500 rpm. The radiator is located at the back of the engine. The buses' length is between (PY)[4] and (PN), the width is of [5] and the wheelbase of . The buses have double wheels on the rear.[6] The early models used solid rubber tyres that were later replaced by pneumatics, improving comfort.[7] The gearbox is a 4-speed manual unit.[8] The first vehicles delivered have cone clutch while later models incorporated a disc clutch. The capacity of the PN is of 39 passengers.[9]

The main differences between the PN and the PY are related to the chassis structure. The PN has a forward control style design, with the driver sat over the engine and a low-entry platform on the rear. The PY has more conventional design, with the driver behind the engine compartment and passenger access through a sidefront door.[10]
