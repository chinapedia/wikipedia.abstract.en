Wheeler has served as editor of the _Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly_ (_NILQ_) since 2004,[15] she is on the advisory board of _The Journal of Law and Society_, and the editorial boards of _Law and Critique_, _Insolvency Law and Practice_, _Law in Context_, _Griffith Law Review_, and the _Asian Journal of Law and Society_.[16] As of 2016, Wheeler is Vice Chair and Treasurer of the Committee of Heads of University Law Schools (CHULS),[17] and in 2017 will become its Chair.

In 2013, Wheeler visited Australia to lead a series of workshops give talks discussing independence and accountability in superannuation. In these talks—which were supported by Herbert Smith Freehills, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, and the Centre for Law Markets and Regulation[19]—Wheeler argued that the trend for mandating a structural independence on the boards of listed companies had led to confusion, that this independence actually worked against the fostering of trust and respect between individuals who did not have "shared norms and values". Instead, in such structures independence of thought is supplanted by the less desirable independence of identity.[20] In 2014, Australian news website _The New Daily_ cited Wheeler as "one of the world’s leading experts on superannuation governance".[21]
