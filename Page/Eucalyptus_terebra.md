_EUCALYPTUS TEREBRA_, commonly known as BALLADONIA GIMLET,[1] is a eucalypt that is native to Western Australia.[2]

The tree or sometimes mallee typically grows to a height of [3]. It has a fluted stem and satiny to glossy, dark grey to orange, green-brown smooth bark. The glossy green adult leaves are arranged alternately, the leaf blade has a linear to narrowly lanceolate shape and is long and wide.[4] It blooms in November producing yellow flowers.[5] The unbranched axillary inflorescences have ovoid to globular mature buds with lemon yellow flowers. These will form sessile fruits with a obconical to hemispherical shape which are long and across with four exserted valves. The fruits contain pale to light ovoid brown seeds that are in length.[6]

_E. terebra_ grows in flat areas in the southern part of the Goldfields-Esperance region in calcerous loam or sandy soils. It is distributed through the Coolgardie, Nullarbor and Mallee IBRA regions.

_E. terebra_ is one of the six true gimlet species that have buds in groups of seven. The other true gimlets are _E. campaspe_ , _E. effusa_ , _E. salubris_, _E. ravida_ and _E. tortilis_.[7]

The species name is from the Latin word meaning _gimlet_ or _borer_, in reference to the common name of the group of _Eucalypts_ it is a part of.[8]
