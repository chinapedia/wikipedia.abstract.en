BARNEY AND CHAPMAN was an American architecture firm based in New York, active from about 1892 through 1908. The partnership designed significant municipal buildings, churches, private estates, and an asylum complex for the state of New York.


John Stewart Barney

John Stewart Barney (October 12, 1867[1] - Nov 22 1925[2]) was born in Richmond, Virginia and studied at Columbia University and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Barney partnered with Chapman no later than 1892. Barney was also involved with the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, for instance drawing up plans for the restoration of the Bruton Parish Church in 1904 on a pro bono basis.[3]

He also designed the Emmet Building (1912) at 95 Madison Avenue in association with S. R. Colt.

From 1915 Barney quit architecture and concentrated on fine art painting. John Stewart Barney Jr. was his son.

Henry Otis Chapman

Henry Otis Chapman (1862-1929) was born in Otisville, New York, educated at Cornell, and was in private practice before partnering with Barney. After the partnership ended in 1908, Chapman practiced as a solo architect and as Henry Chapman & Son.[4] Among his later works are the United States Mortgage and Trust Company Building at 940 Madison Avenue, completed in 1921, as of 2016 an Apple store.[5]
