A SPOONERISM is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched (see Metathesis) between two words in a phrase.[1][2] These are named after the Oxford don and ordained minister William Archibald Spooner, who was famous for doing this.

An example is saying "The Lord is a shoving leopard" instead of "The Lord is a loving shepherd." While spoonerisms are commonly heard as slips of the tongue, and getting one's words in a tangle, they can also be used intentionally as a play on words.


Etymology

) in _Vanity Fair_, April 1898]]

Spoonerisms are named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844–1930), Warden of New College, Oxford, who was notoriously prone to this mistake.[3][4] The term "Spoonerism" was well established by 1921. An article in _The Times_ from that year reports that,

  The boys of Aldro School, Eastbourne, ... have been set the following task for the holidays: Discover and write down something about: The Old Lady of Threadneedle-street, a Spoonerism, a Busman's Holiday...[5]

An article in the Daily Herald in 1928 reported Spoonerisms to be a 'legend'. A Mr. Robert Seton, once a student of Dr. Spooner admitted that the Dr.

  made, to my knowledge, only one "Spoonerism" in his life, in 1879, when he stood in the pulpit and announced the hymn: 'Kinkering Kongs their Titles Take'...Later, a friend and myself brought out a book of "spoonerisms"'[6]

In 1937, The Times quoted a detective describing a man as "a bricklabourer's layer" and used "Police Court Spoonerism" as the headline.[7] A spoonerism is also known as a _marrowsky,_ purportedly after a Polish count who suffered from the same impediment.[8]


Examples

.
The caption reads, "Through every passion raging."
The accompanying biography reads, "The only part of him which gets tired is his tongue, and occasionally the oft-repeated lines have got muddled. 'Self-constricted ruddles', 'his striggles were terruffic', and 'deloberately rib me' are a few of the spoonerisms he has perpetrated. Success has not spoilt him. He is a professional humourist, who has been known to make an Englishman laugh at breakfast."]]

Most of the quotations attributed to Spooner are apocryphal; _The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations_ (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: "The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer" (instead of "rate of wages"). Spooner himself claimed[9] that "The Kinquering Congs Their Titles Take" (in reference to a hymn)[10] was his sole spoonerism. Most spoonerisms were probably never uttered by William Spooner himself but rather made up by colleagues and students as a pastime.[11] Richard Lederer, calling "Kinkering Kongs their Titles Take" (with an alternative spelling) one of the "few" authenticated Spoonerisms, dates it to 1879, and he gives nine examples "attributed to Spooner, most of them spuriously."[12] They are as follows:

-   "Three cheers for our queer old dean!" (rather than "dear old queen," which is a reference to Queen Victoria)[13]

-   "Is it kisstomary to cuss the bride?" (as opposed to "customary to kiss")[14]

-   "The Lord is a shoving leopard." (instead of "a loving shepherd")[15]

-   "A blushing crow." ("crushing blow")[16]

-   "A well-boiled icicle" ("well-oiled bicycle")[17]

-   "You were fighting a liar in the quadrangle." ("lighting a fire")[18]

-   "Is the bean dizzy?" ("Dean busy")[19]

-   "Someone is occupewing my pie. Please sew me to another sheet." ("Someone is occupying my pew. Please show me to another seat.")[20]

-   "You have hissed all my mystery lectures. You have tasted a whole worm. Please leave Oxford on the next town drain." ("You have missed all my history lectures. You have wasted a whole term. Please leave Oxford on the next down train.")[21]

A newspaper column[22] attributes this additional example to Spooner: "A nosey little cook." (as opposed to a "cosy little nook").


Popular use

In modern terms, "spoonerism" generally refers to any changing of sounds in this manner.

-   On the TV series _Hee Haw_, comedian/writer Archie Campbell was well known for using spoonerisms in his skits, most famously the "Pee Little Thrigs" and "Rindercella" skits, as well as previously doing so in his own comedy recordings well before the country/western-themed TV variety series, such as his "Beeping Sleauty" sketch.[23]
-   In _Maisie and the Pinny Gig_ by Ursula Dubosarsky, a little girl named Maisie has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, which she calls a "pinny gig."[24]
-   The Washington, D.C. political comedy sketch group Capitol Steps[25] has a long-standing tradition of performing a routine called "Lirty Dies"[26] during every performance, which features a typically 10-minute-long barrage of rapid-fire topical spoonerisms. A few examples over the years range from "Resident Pagan" (President Reagan) and the US's periodic practice of "Licking their Peaders" (Picking their leaders) to the NSA "poopin' on Snutin" (Snoopin' on Putin) and "phugging everybody's bones" (bugging everybody's phones).
-   Comedienne Jane Ace was notorious for her spoonerisms and other similar plays on words during her run as star of the radio sitcom _Easy Aces_.[27]
-   "Puck Flattsburgh" is a common rallying cry in the sports rivalry between Oswego and Plattsburgh State Universities' men's ice hockey teams, especially when Oswego is victorious. The phrase is a double entendre: if read at face value, indicates the sport ("puck") and the Plattsburgh team playing "flat;" read as a spoonerism, it is a veiled profane insult.[28]
-   Similarly to the above example, "Buck Fama" is a popular slogan in the (often contentious) rivalry between Louisiana State University and the University of Alabama (commonly shortened to _Bama_). This slogan can be heard very often from LSU fans.
-   In the Robert McCloskey books _Homer Price_ and _Centerburg Tales_, the sheriff regularly uses spoonerisms, such as "sarber bhop" for "barber shop" and "waul them ahay" for "haul them away."
-   Former Swansea City manager Bob Bradley was often referred to as 'Brad Bobley's Megnuts' by Swansea supporters and football-related TV shows such as _Soccer AM_, who poked fun at his American accent and terminology[29]
-   The dialogue in Jim Henson's _The Frog Prince_ (1971) included a partly-spoonerized instruction to disable a disguised witch's ("Aunt Taminella's") enchantment _on_ a princess: the spoonerism was spoken by the princess herself as "Bake the hall in the candle of her brain", when the actual phrase was meant to say, "Break the ball in the handle of her cane", referring to a crystal ball that held the disguised witch's powers.
-   In _Gummi Bears_, Zummi Gummi often speaks in spoonerisms.
-   Sir Stafford Cripps was once mistakenly called Sir Stifford Crapps by McDonald Hobley[30] on the BBC.[31]

Poetry

Shel Silverstein's book _Runny Babbit_ is almost completely written in spoonerisms, from character names to anything else.

In his poem "Translation," Brian P. Cleary describes a boy named Alex who speaks in spoonerisms (like "shook a tower" instead of "took a shower"). Humorously, Cleary leaves the poem's final spoonerism up to the reader when he says,

  He once proclaimed, "Hey, BELLY JEANS"
  When he found a stash of jelly beans.
  But when he says he PEPPED IN STEW
  We'll tell him he should wipe his shoe.[32]

In Samuil Marshak's poem _What an Absent-Minded Guy_ (Вот какой рассеянный), the titular character uses spoonerisms at one point ("Глубокоуважаемый Вагоноуважатый! Вагоноуважаемый Глубокоуважатый!"). The character is based on the Russian scientist Ivan Kablukov, who was prone to spoonerisms himself.

Twisted tales

Comedian F. Chase Taylor was the star of the 1930s radio program _Stoopnagle and Budd_, in which his character, Colonel Stoopnagle, used spoonerisms. In 1945, he published a book, _My Tale Is Twisted_, consisting of 44 "spoonerised" versions of well-known children's stories. Subtitled "Wart Pun: Aysop's Feebles" and "Tart Pooh: Tairy and Other Fales," these included such tales as "Beeping Sleauty" for "Sleeping Beauty." The book was republished in 2001 by Stone and Scott Publishers as _Stoopnagle's Tale is Twisted_.[33]

Music

-   The title of the NOFX album _Punk In Drublic_ is a spoonerism of the legal offense of being "drunk in public".

-   The title of the Van der Graaf Generator's album _Pawn Hearts_ resulted from a spoonerism by David Jackson, who said one time: "I'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn hearts", meaning to say 'horn parts'.[34]

-   The title of the Caravan album _Cunning Stunts_ is a thinly veiled profane spoonerism.

-   The title of Lords of Acid's 2001 album _Farstucker_ is a thinly veiled profane spoonerism.

-   The names of electronic artist Com Truise and San Holo are spoonerisms of Tom Cruise and Han Solo, respectively.

-   The title of the experimental rock band Butthole Surfers' fourth studio album _Hairway to Steven_ is a take on a spoonerism of the popular song _Stairway to Heaven_ by Led Zeppelin.

Folk etymology

A spoonerism is sometimes used in folk etymology. For example, according to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, some laymen wrongly believe that the English word _butterfly_ derives from '' FLutter By''.[35]


Kniferisms and forkerisms

As complements to _spoonerism_, Douglas Hofstadter used the nonce words _kniferism_ and _forkerism_ to refer to changing, respectively, the vowels or the final consonants of two syllables, giving them a new meaning.[36] Examples of so-called kniferisms include a British television newsreader once referring to the police at a crime scene removing a 'hypodeemic nerdle'; a television announcer once saying that "All the world was thrilled by the marriage of the Duck and Doochess of Windsor";[37] and during a live broadcast in 1931, radio presenter Harry von Zell accidentally mispronouncing US President Herbert Hoover's name as "Hoobert Heever."[38][39] Usage of these new terms has been limited; many sources count any syllable exchange as a spoonerism, regardless of location.[40]
