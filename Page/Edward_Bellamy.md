EDWARD BELLAMY (March 26, 1850 – May 22, 1898) was an American author, journalist, and political activist most famous for his utopian novel, _Looking Backward_. Bellamy's vision of a harmonious future world inspired the formation of numerous "Nationalist Clubs" dedicated to the propagation of Bellamy's political ideas.

After working as a journalist and writing several unremarkable novels, Bellamy published _Looking Backward_ in 1888. _Looking Backward_ was one of the most commercially successful books published in the United States in the 19th century, and it especially appealed to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the dark side of Gilded Age. In the early 1890s, Bellamy established a newspaper known as _The New Nation_ and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging Populist Party. He published _Equality_, a sequel to _Looking Backward_, in 1897, and died the following year.


Biography

Early years

Edward Bellamy was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts. His father was Rufus King Bellamy (1816–1886), a Baptist minister and a descendant of Joseph Bellamy.[1] His mother, Maria Louisa Putnam Bellamy, was a Calvinist.[2] She was the daughter of a Baptist minister named Benjamin Putnam, who was forced to withdraw from the ministry in Salem, Massachusetts, following objections to his becoming a Freemason.[3]

Bellamy attended public school at Chicopee Falls before leaving for Union College of Schenectady, New York, where he studied for just two semesters.[4] Upon leaving school, Bellamy made his way to Europe for a year, spending extensive time in Germany.[5] Bellamy briefly studied law but abandoned that field without ever having practiced as a lawyer, instead entering the world of journalism. In this capacity Bellamy briefly served on the staff of the _New York Post_ before returning to his native Massachusetts to take a position at the _Springfield Union._[6]

At the age of 25, Bellamy developed tuberculosis, the disease that would ultimately kill him.[7] He suffered with its effects throughout his adult life. In an effort to regain his health, Bellamy spent a year in the Hawaiian Islands (1877 to 1878).[8] Returning to the United States, Bellamy decided to abandon the daily grind of journalism in favor of literary work, which put fewer demands upon his time and his health.[9]

Bellamy married Emma Augusta Sanderson in 1882. The couple had two children.

Literary career

Bellamy's early novels, including _Six to One_ (1878), _Dr. Heidenhoff's Process_ (1880), and _Miss Ludington's Sister_ (1885) were unremarkable works, making use of standard psychological plots.[10]

A turn to utopian science fiction with _Looking Backward, 2000–1887,_ published in January 1888, captured the public imagination and catapulted Bellamy to literary fame.[11] The publisher of the book could scarcely keep up with demand. Within a year the book had sold some 200,000 copies and by the end of the 19th century it had sold more copies than any other book published in America up to that time except for _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ by Harriet Beecher Stowe and _Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ_ by Lew Wallace.[12] The book gained an extensive readership in Great Britain, as well, with more than 235,000 copies sold there between its first release in 1890 and 1935.[13]

In _Looking Backward_, a non-violent revolution had transformed the American economy and thereby society; private property had been abolished in favor of state ownership of capital and the elimination of social classes and the ills of society that he thought inevitably followed from them.[14] In the new world of the year 2000, there was no longer war, poverty, crime, prostitution, corruption, money, or taxes.[15] Neither did there exist such occupations seen by Bellamy as of dubious worth to society, such as politicians, lawyers, merchants, or soldiers.[16] Instead, Bellamy's utopian society of the future was based upon the voluntary employment of all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45, after which time all would retire.[17] Work was simple, aided by machine production, working hours short and vacation time long.[18] The new economic basis of society effectively remade human nature itself in Bellamy's idyllic vision, with greed, maliciousness, untruthfulness, and insanity all relegated to the past.[19]

The Bellamyite movement

Although Bellamy retrospectively claimed he did not write _Looking Backward_ as a blueprint for political action, but rather sought to write "a literary fantasy, a fairy tale of social felicity",[20] the book inspired legions of inspired readers to establish so-called Nationalist Clubs, beginning in Boston late in 1888.[21] Bellamy's vision of a country relieved of its social ills through abandonment of the principle of competition and establishment of state ownership of industry proved an appealing panacea to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the dark side of Gilded Age America. By 1891 it was reported that no fewer than 162 Nationalist Clubs were in existence.[22]

Bellamy's use of the term "Nationalism" rather than "socialism" as a descriptor of his governmental vision was calculated, as he did not want to limit either sales of his novel or the potential influence of its political ideas.[23] In an 1888 letter to literary critic William Dean Howells, Bellamy wrote:

Bellamy himself came to actively participate in the political movement which emerged around his book, particularly after 1891 when he founded his own magazine, _The New Nation,_ and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging People's Party.[24] For the next three and a half years, Bellamy gave his all to politics, publishing his magazine, working to influence the platform of the People's Party, and publicizing the Nationalist movement in the popular press. This phase of Bellamy's life came to an end in 1894, when _The New Nation_ was forced to suspend publication owing to financial difficulties.[25]

With the key activists of the Nationalist Clubs largely absorbed into the apparatus of the People's Party (although a Nationalist Party did run candidates for office in Wisconsin as late as 1896[26]), Bellamy abandoned politics for a return to literature. He set to work on a sequel to _Looking Backward_ titled _Equality,_ attempting to deal with the ideal society of the post-revolutionary future in greater detail. In this final work, Bellamy turned his mind's eye to the question of feminism, dealing with the taboo subject of female reproductive rights in a future, post-revolutionary America.[27] Other subjects overlooked in _Looking Backward,_ such as animal rights and wilderness preservation, were dealt with in a similar context.[28] The book saw print in 1897 and would prove to be Bellamy's final creation.

Several short stories of Bellamy's were published in 1898, and _The Duke of Stockbridge; a Romance of Shays' Rebellion_ was published in 1900.

Death and legacy

Edward Bellamy died of tuberculosis in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. He was 48 years old at the time of his death.

His lifelong home in Chicopee Falls, built by his father,[29] was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.[30]

Bellamy was the cousin of Francis Bellamy, famous for creation of the Pledge of Allegiance.

Bellamy Road, a residential road in Toronto, is named for the author.
