's _Love-Letters_ (1684)]]

An EPISTOLARY NOVEL is a novel written as a series of documents. The usual form is letters, although diary entries, newspaper clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic "documents" such as recordings and radio, blogs, and e-mails have also come into use. The word _epistolary_ is derived from Latin from the Greek word ἐπιστολή _epistolē_, meaning a letter (see epistle).

The epistolary form can add greater realism to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an omniscient narrator.


Early works

There are two theories on the genesis of the epistolary novel. The first claims that the genre is originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced.[1] The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from miscellanies of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot.[2] Both claims have some validity. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish "Prison of Love" (_Cárcel de amor_) (c.1485) by Diego de San Pedro, belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of Edmé Boursault's _Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love_ (_Lettres de respect, d'obligation et d'amour_) (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet were expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled _Letters to Babet_ (_Lettres à Babet_). The immensely famous _Letters of a Portuguese Nun_ (_Lettres portugaises_) (1669) generally attributed to Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues, though a small minority still regard Marianna Alcoforado as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry.[3] The founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be James Howell (1594–1666) with "Familiar Letters" (1645–50), who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.

The first novel to expose the complex play that the genre allows was Aphra Behn's _Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister_, which appeared in three volumes in 1684, 1685, and 1687. The novel shows the genre's results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; her further volumes introduced a narrator). Behn furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with letters that fall into the wrong hands, faked letters, letters withheld by protagonists, and even more complex interaction.

The epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as Samuel Richardson, with his immensely successful novels _Pamela_ (1740) and _Clarissa_ (1749). In France, there was _Lettres persanes_ (1721) by Montesquieu, followed by _Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse_ (1761) by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Laclos' _Les Liaisons dangereuses_ (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In Germany, there was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's _Die Leiden des jungen Werther_ (1774) (_The Sorrows of Young Werther_) and Friedrich Hölderlin's _Hyperion_. The first North American novel, _The History of Emily Montague_ (1769) by Frances Brooke was written in epistolary form.

Starting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage burlesques. The most notable example of these was Henry Fielding's _Shamela_ (1741), written as a parody of _Pamela_. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances. Oliver Goldsmith used the form to satirical effect in _The Citizen of the World_, subtitled "Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to his Friends in the East" (1760–61). So did the diarist Fanny Burney in a successful comic first novel, _Evelina_ (1788).

The epistolary novel slowly fell out of use in the late 18th century. Although Jane Austen tried her hand at the epistolary in juvenile writings and her novella _Lady Susan_ (1794), she abandoned this structure for her later work. It is thought that her lost novel _First Impressions_, which was redrafted to become _Pride and Prejudice_, may have been epistolary: _Pride and Prejudice_ contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.

The epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In Honoré de Balzac's novel _Letters of Two Brides_, two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17-year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. Mary Shelley employs the epistolary form in her novel _Frankenstein_ (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man's narrative and confessions. Published in 1848, Anne Brontë's novel _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_ is framed as a retrospective letter from one of the main heroes to his friend and brother-in-law with the diary of the eponymous tenant inside it. In the late 19th century, Bram Stoker released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, _Dracula_. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor's notes, ship's logs, and the like.


Types

There are 3 types of epistolary novels: monologic (giving the letters of only one character, like _Letters of a Portuguese Nun_ and _The Sorrows of Young Werther_), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme Marie Jeanne Riccoboni's _Letters of Fanni Butlerd_ (1757), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters, such as in Bram Stoker's _Dracula_). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels like _Clarissa_, and _Dangerous Liaisons_ is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness': the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension.

An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the fictional editor.[4]


Later works

Epistolary novels have made several memorable appearances in more recent literature:

-   John Cleland's early erotic novel _Fanny Hill_ (1748) is written as a series of letters from the titular character to an unnamed recipient.
-   _The Coquette; or, The History of Eliza Wharton_ (1797) by Hannah Webster Foster is a series of letters between several characters.
-   Sophia Briscoe used the form in both her novels: _Miss Melmoth..._ (1771) and _The Fine Lady..._ (1772).
-   Marianne Ehrmann wrote the epistolary novel _Amalie and Minna_ around 1787.
-   Fyodor Dostoevsky used the epistolary format for his first novel, _Poor Folk_ (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in pre-revolution Russia.
-   _The Moonstone_ (1868) by Wilkie Collins uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of the eponymous diamond might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element, as most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered. He also used the form previously in _The Woman in White_ (1859).
-   Spanish foreign minister Juan Valera's _Pepita Jimenez_ (1874) is written in three sections, the first and third being a series of letters, the middle part narrated by an unknown observer.

-   C. S. Lewis used the epistolary form for _The Screwtape Letters_ (1942), and considered writing a companion novel from an angel's point of view—though he never did so. It is less generally realized that his _Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer_ (1964) is a similar exercise, exploring theological questions through correspondence addressed to a fictional recipient, "Malcolm", though this work may be considered a "novel" only loosely in that developments in Malcolm's personal life gradually come to light and impact the discussion.

-   Stephen King's novel _Carrie_ (1974) is written in an epistolary structure through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and book excerpts.
