_UTOPIAN_ is the debut studio album recorded by Canadian singer and songwriter Virginia to Vegas, released through Wax Records on December 2, 2016. It includes the Platinum-certified single, "We Are Stars", and the top-10 pop radio hit, "Lights Out".


Background

Derik Baker began his career as a songwriter before focusing on singing, at which point he adopted the stage name Virginia to Vegas after failing to garner attention using his birth name.[1] He was discovered on YouTube in 2013 by Wax Records executive Jamie Appleby and signed to the label that year.[2] His debut single, "We Are Stars", was released in January 2014.[3] The song, which features labelmate, Alyssa Reid, reached the top 15 on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified Platinum by Music Canada.

A follow-up single, "Don't Fight the Music", was released in September 2014 which failed to replicate its predecessor's success.[4] Both songs were included on an extended play, titled _Vol. I_, which was released that November.[5] His radio success with the singles contributed to him being nominated for Pop Artist or Group of the Year at the 2015 Sirius XM Indie Awards.[6] Over the next two years, Virginia to Vegas continued recording new material and released two further singles, which are included on _Utopian_. The album was announced in November 2016 and was released in Canada on December 2, 2016.[7][8]
