Born in Initially a lecturer on criminal and military procedure prior to his appointment as a judge to Chile's Superior Military Court, Cruz's role in the United Nations, as a delegate of the Third Committee and Human Rights Commission, was a formative one.

According to Susan Waltz, although Cruz "held no position of responsibility...his political and substantive contributions were such" that his co-drafter, John Peters Humphrey and author Johannes Morsink, later singled out the important role he played in shaping the Declaration's transition away from "eighteenth century Enlightenment philosophy" towards "socioeconomic rights."[1]

According to the United Nations, in addition to his work on the declaration, Cruz was "actively involved in the establishment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean."[2]
