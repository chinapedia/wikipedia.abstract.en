CD Block HQ

The headquarters of Manbazar II CD Block are located at Boro. The District Census Handbook shows, in its map, Bargorya as headquarters of Manbazar II CD Block, but the website of Manabazar II Block Development Officer mentions Boro as headquarters of the block. The latter appears to be more authentic. District Census Handbooks are the only source showing the headquarters of all CD Blocks throughout West Bengal.[2][3]

Bargorya is on the road from Kuilapal, on State Highway 5 (West Bengal), to Ladda, by the side of Mukutmanipur reservoir.[4]
