PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA ( _Prokópios ho Kaisareús_; ; ) was a prominent late antique Byzantine Greek scholar from Palaestina Prima. Accompanying the Byzantine general Belisarius in Emperor Justinian's wars, Procopius became the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, writing the _History of the Wars_, the _Buildings_, and the _Secret History_. He is commonly classified as the last major historian of the ancient Western world.


Life

Apart from his own writings, the main source for Procopius's life is an entry in the _Suda_,[1] a Greek encyclopaedia written sometime after 975, which discusses his early life. He was a native of Caesarea in the province of _Palaestina Prima_.[2] He would have received a conventional elite education in the Greek classics and rhetoric,[3] perhaps at the famous school at Gaza.[4] He may have attended law school, possibly at Berytus (present-day Beirut) or Constantinople (now Istanbul),[5] and became a lawyer (_rhetor_).[6] He evidently knew Latin, as was natural for a man with legal training. In 527, the first year of the reign of the emperor JustinianI, he became the legal adviser (__) for Belisarius, a general whom Justinian made his chief military commander in a great attempt to restore control over the lost western provinces of the empire.

Procopius was with Belisarius on the eastern front until the latter was defeated at the Battle of Callinicum in 531[7] and recalled to Constantinople.[8] Procopius witnessed the Nika riots of January, 532, which Belisarius and his fellow general Mundus repressed with a massacre in the Hippodrome.[9] In 533, he accompanied Belisarius on his victorious expedition against the Vandal kingdom in North Africa, took part in the capture of Carthage, and remained in Africa with Belisarius's successor Solomon the Eunuch when Belisarius returned east to the capital. Procopius recorded a few of the extreme weather events of 535–536, although these were presented as a backdrop to Byzantine military activities, such as a mutiny in and around Carthage.[10] He rejoined Belisarius for his campaign against the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy and experienced the Gothic siege of Rome that lasted a year and nine days, ending in mid-March 538. He witnessed Belisarius's entry into the Gothic capital, Ravenna, in 540. Both the _Wars_[11] and the _Secret History_ suggest that his relationship with Belisarius cooled thereafter. When Belisarius was sent back to Italy in 544 to cope with a renewal of the war with the Goths, now led by the able king Totila, Procopius appears to have no longer been on Belisarius's staff.

As _magister militum_, Belisarius was an "illustrious man" (; , _illoústrios_); being his __, Procopius must therefore have had at least the rank of a "visible man" (_vir spectabilis_). He thus belonged to the mid-ranking group of the senatorial order (__). However, the _Suda_, which is usually well informed in such matters, also describes Procopius himself as one of the __. Should this information be correct, Procopius would have had a seat in the Constantinople's senate, which was restricted to the __ under Justinian.

It is not certain when Procopius died. Many historiansincluding Howard-Johnson, Cameron, and Greatrexdate his death to 554, but there was an urban prefect of Constantinople (__) called Procopius in 562. In that year, Belisarius was implicated in a conspiracy and was brought before this urban prefect. In fact, evidence shows that Procopius died at least a few years after 565 as he unequivocally states in the beginning of his Secret History that he wrote it AFTER the death of Justinian for fear he would be tortured and killed by the emperor (or even by general Belisarius) if the emperor (or the general) learned about what Procopius wrote (his scathing criticism of the emperor, of his wife, of Belisarius, of the general's wife, Antonia: calling the former "demons in human form" and the latter incompetent and treacherous) in this later history. Surely, the book took some years to write so it is likely he died at the minimum a few years after 565 and perhaps even much later as there is no mention of his death we know of and it would be only sheer speculation to mention any date after 565.


Writings

The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the emperor JustinianI. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books on the wars prosecuted by Justinian, a panegyric on the emperor's public works projects throughout the empire, and a book (written after 565) known as the _Secret History_ that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his officially sanctioned history for fear of angering the emperor, his wife, Belisarius, and the general's wife and had to wait until all of them were dead to avoid retaliation.

_History of the Wars_

Procopius's _Wars_ or _History of the Wars_ (, _Hypèr tōn Polémon Lógoi_, "Words on the Wars"; , "On the Wars") is his most important work, although less well known than the _Secret History_. The first seven books seem to have been largely completed by 545 and may have been published as a unit. They were, however, updated to mid-century before publication, with the latest mentioned event occurring in early 551. The eighth and final book brings the history to 553.

The first two booksoften known as _The Persian War_ ()deal with the conflict between the Romans and Sassanid Persia in Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, Lazica, and Iberia (present-day Georgia). It details the campaigns of the Sassaniad shah KavadhI, the 532 'Nika' revolt, the war by Kavadh's successor KhosrauI in 540, his destruction of Antioch and deportation of its inhabitants to Mesopotamia, and the great plague that devastated the empire from 542. The _Persian War_ also covers the early career of Procopius's patron Belisarius in some detail.

The _Wars_’ next two booksknown as _The Vandal_ or _Vandalic War_ (__)cover Belisarius's successful campaign against the Vandal kingdom that had occupied Rome's provinces in northwest Africa for the last century.

The final four booksknown as _The Gothic War_ (__)cover the Italian campaigns by Belisarius and others against the Ostrogoths. It includes accounts of the 1st and 2nd sieges of Naples and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sieges of Rome. The last book describes the eunuch Narses's successful conclusion of the Italian campaign and includes some coverage of campaigns along the empire's eastern borders as well.

The _Wars_ was influential on later Byzantine historiography.[12] _Histories_, a continuation of Procopius's work in a similar style, was undertaken by Agathias in the 570s.

_Secret History_

in the mosaic in the Church of San Vitale, Ravenna, which celebrates the reconquest of Italy by the Roman army under the skillful leadership of Belisarius.]] Procopius's now famous _Anecdota_ also known as _Secret History_ (, _Apókryphe Historía_; ) was discovered centuries later at the Vatican Library in Rome[13] and published in Lyon by Niccolò Alamanni in 1623. Its existence was already known from the _Suda_, which referred to it as Procopius's "unpublished works" (, _Anékdota_; __). The _Secret History_ covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of _The History of the Wars_ and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, although others set it as late as 562.

In the eyes of many scholars, the _Secret History_ reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned with Emperor Justinian, his wife Theodora, the general Belisarius, and his wife Antonina. The work claims to expose the secret springs of their public actions, as well as the private lives of the emperor and his entourage. Justinian is portrayed as cruel, venal, prodigal, and incompetent. In one passage, it is even claimed that he was possessed by demonic spirits or was himself a demon:

Similarly, the Theodora of the _Secret History_ is a garish portrait of vulgarity and insatiable lust juxtaposed with cold-blooded self-interest, shrewishness, and envious and fearful mean-spiritedness. Among the more titillating (and dubious) revelations in the _Secret History_ is Procopius's account of Theodora's thespian accomplishments:

On the other hand, it has been argued that Procopius prepared the _Secret History_ as an exaggerated document out of fear that a conspiracy might overthrow Justinian's regime, whichas a kind of court historianmight be reckoned to include him. The unpublished manuscript would then have been a kind of insurance, which could be offered to the new ruler as a way to avoid execution or exile after the coup. If this hypothesis were correct, the _Secret History_ would not be proof that Procopius hated Justinian or Theodora.[14]

_The Buildings_

]]

_The Buildings_ (, _Perì Ktismáton_; , "On Buildings") is a panegyric on Justinian's public works projects throughout the empire.[15] The first book may date to before the collapse of the first dome of Hagia Sophia in 557, but some scholars think that it is possible that the work postdates the building of the bridge over the Sangarius in the late 550s.[16] Historians consider _Buildings_ to be an incomplete work due to evidence of the surviving version being a draft with two possible redactions.[17][18]

_Buildings_ was likely written at Justinian's behest, and it is doubtful that its sentiments expressed are sincere. It tells us nothing further about Belisarius, and it takes a sharply different attitude towards Justinian. He is presented as an idealised Christian emperor who built churches for the glory of God and defenses for the safety of his subjects. He is depicted showing particular concern for the water supply, building new aqueducts and restoring those that had fallen into disuse. Theodora, who was dead when this panegyric was written, is mentioned only briefly, but Procopius's praise of her beauty is fulsome.

Due to the panegyrical nature of Procopius's _Buildings_, historians have discovered several discrepancies between claims made by Procopius and accounts in other primary sources. A prime example is Procopius's starting the reign of Justinian in 518, which was actually the start of the reign of his uncle and predecessor By treating the uncle's reign as part of his nephew's, Procopius was able to credit Justinian with buildings erected or begun under Justin's administration. Such works include renovation of the walls of Edessa after its 525 flood and consecration of several churches in the region. Similarly, Procopius falsely credits Justinian for the extensive refortification of the cities of Tomis and Histria in Scythia Minor. This had actually been carried out under who reigned before Justin.[19]


Style

Procopius belongs to the school of late antique historians who continued the traditions of the Second Sophistic. They wrote in Attic Greek; their models were Herodotus, Polybius andparticularlyThucydides; and their subject matter was secular history. They avoided vocabulary unknown to Attic Greek and inserted an explanation when they had to use contemporary words. Thus Procopius includes glosses of monks ("the most temperate of Christians") and churches (as equivalent to a "temple" or "shrine"), since monasticism was unknown to the ancient Athenians and their _ekklesía_ had been a popular assembly.[20]

The secular historians eschewed the history of the Christian church; ecclesiastical history was left to a separate genre after Eusebius. However, Cameron has argued convincingly that Procopius's works reflect the tensions between the classical and Christian models of history in 6th-century Constantinople. This is supported by Whitby's analysis of Procopius's depiction of the capital and its cathedral in comparison to contemporary pagan panegyrics.[21] Procopius can be seen as depicting Justinian as essentially God's vicegerent, making the case for buildings being a primarily religious panegyric.[22] Procopius indicates that he planned to write an ecclesiastical history himself[23] and, if he had, he would probably have followed the rules of that genre. As far as known, however, such an ecclesiastical history was never written.


Legacy

A number of historical novels based on Procopius's works (along with other sources) have been written. _Count Belisarius_ was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938. Procopius himself appears as a minor character in Felix Dahn's _A Struggle for Rome_ and in L. Sprague de Camp's alternate history novel _Lest Darkness Fall_. The novel's main character, archaeologist Martin Padway, derives most of his knowledge of historical events from the _Secret History_.[24]
