Background

Construction of the pulp and paper mill began with groundbreaking on August 18, 1934.[3] The mill was built as part of the industrialization efforts during the early years of modern Turkey.[4][5][6] The first domestic paper was produced on April 18, 1936.[7][8] Named _Sümerbank İzmit Kağıt ve Karton Fabrikası_ (Sümerbank İzmit Paper and Cardboard Mill), it officially went into production, with an annual capacity of 12,000 tons, on November 6, 1936.[9][10][11] Turkey's first paper engineer, Mehmet Ali Kağıtçı, played a major role in the foundation of the paper mill.[12][13] On June 21, 1955, it was renamed _Türkiye Sellükoz ve Kağıt Fabrikaları_ (Turkish Cellulose and Paper Mills).[14] In 1997, the state-owned mill was listed for privatization and investment ceased. Paper production came to a halt in 2005, and it was transferred to the Metropolitan Municipality of Kocaeli.[15][16] The word _SEKA_ is a portmanteau of _SEllüloz_ (for cellulose or pulp) and _KAğıt_ (paper).[17]
