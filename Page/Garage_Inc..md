_GARAGE INC._ is a compilation album of cover songs by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on November 24, 1998, through Elektra Records. Over 2.5 million copies have been sold in the U.S. as certified by the RIAA. It includes cover songs, B-side covers, and _The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited_, which had gone out of print since its original release in 1987. The title is a combination of _Garage Days Revisited_ and their song "Damage, Inc.", from _Master of Puppets_, and the album's graphical cover draws heavily from the 1987 EP. The album features songs by artists that have influenced Metallica, including many bands from the new wave of British heavy metal movement, hardcore punk bands and popular songs. As of August 2013, the album has sold more than 6 million copies worldwide. It marks the last album to feature bassist Jason Newsted who would quit the band three years later in 2001.


Production

The day after Metallica finished the North American leg of the Poor Re-Touring Me Tour in San Diego's Coors Amphitheatre, they hit the studio to start recording a new album of cover versions.[1] As Lars Ulrich explained, the band wanted to do something different after "three pretty serious albums in a row, starting with the Black album and then _Load_ and _ReLoad_", and the process would be easier by working with covers, especially as the band had a tradition of taking other people's songs and "turn them into something very Metallica, different from what the original artist did".[2] Given the band had recorded many covers that were spread across various releases, such as B-sides of their singles and the 1987 EP _The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited_, the band would "put them all in a nice little packaging for easy listening" along with the newly recorded cover versions, chosen through a group decision.[3][4] Only one of the eleven songs in the "New Recordings '98" disk was not done in the three-week sessions, a version of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Tuesday's Gone" the band recorded for a radio broadcast along with friends such as Les Claypool, John Popper and Gary Rossington.[5]


Packaging

The cover for _Garage Inc._ had a Ross Halfin photograph of Metallica dressed as mechanics. The band wanted the booklet to hold a detailed account of the contents of the project, and designer Andy Airfix was allowed to search through Ulrich's catalogue of Metallica memorabilia in San Francisco to create a 32-page booklet. Airfix also did the back cover, where the front of _Garage Days Re-Revisited_ was modified with headshots of Metallica in 1998 and the track list written on tracing paper.[6]


Reception

-   _Rolling Stone_ (12/10/98, print edition, p. 122) – 4 Stars (out of 5) – "Gloriously hard as the album is, you can't miss Metallica's good natured side coming through."[7]
-   _Entertainment Weekly_ (12/18/98, p. 84) – "We'll have to wait until Metallica's next 'proper' album to find out if this trip to the garage recharges their batteries. Still, all things considered, Garage Inc. is an intermittently exhilarating joyride." – Rating: B−[8]
-   _CMJ_ (12/21/98, p. 29) – "Those who still relate to the adolescent angst of the 'Metallicas' earliest days will find plenty to like on Garage Inc."
-   In 2005, the album was ranked number 500 in Rock Hard magazine's book of _The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time_.[9]


Track listing

Disc one

These tracks were recorded in September–October 1998 for the _Garage Inc._ album.

-   "Sabbra Cadabra" also covers part of the Black Sabbath song "A National Acrobat".
-   "Mercyful Fate" is a medley of the songs "Satan's Fall", "Curse of the Pharaohs", "A Corpse Without Soul", "Into the Coven" and "Evil".
-   "Tuesday's Gone" was recorded December 18, 1997, during the "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" radio broadcast on KSJO.[10]

Disc two

These tracks are a collection of B-sides from artists Metallica were inspired by, throughout the early years of the band.
