Castle_of_San_Luis_de_Bocachica.jpg The CASTLE OF SAN LUIS DE BOCACHICA, was a military fortress that defended Cartagena, Colombia. The Spanish built it in the 17th century. After it suffered war damage in the 18th century, they erected a new coastal fortification, the Castle of San Fernando on the same site.

The site on the Island of Tierra Bomba controlled deep-water access to Cartagena's harbour by the channel of Bocachica (or "small entrance" as opposed to Bocagrande, the "big entrance").


History

Work on the fort started in 1646 by the engineer Juan de Somovilla and its name was related with the governor Luis Fernandez de Cordoba.[1]

The Castle was attacked several times being the most famous, the French Raid on Cartagena in 1697 and the British Attack on Cartagena in 1741.

-   1697 attack

During the War of the League of Augsburg, French troops and pirates, attacked the castle 13 April 1697 and took it 15 April 1697, but the castle was not destroyed because of the heroic defense of Don Sancho Jimeno and because of the strategic position.

-   1741 attack

During the War of Jenkins' Ear, Cartagena was sieged by English troops. On 13 March 1741 the British navy damaged severely the castle and landed troops took it and put it on fire, destroying it completely, during the retreat.[2]

Castle of San Fernando de Bocachica, built over the ruins of the old castle In 1753, building of a new fortress started, the Castle of San Fernando de Bocachica, by the engineer Antonio de Ar√©valo, over the ruins of the old castle.[3] The fortress was completed in 1759.[4] It continues today as an important tourist attraction.
