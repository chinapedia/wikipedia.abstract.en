Etymology

"Tu" means "you" in several languages.[1][2][3] According to the Tu Books website, "tu" means "many" in Ainu, and their focus is to "reach the 'you' in every reader".[4]


History

Tu Publishing was founded in Orem, Utah, by Stacy Whitman as an independent young adult and middle grade fiction science fiction and fantasy book publisher through a Kickstarter campaign in December 2009.[5][6] Whitman stated she wanted to increase the diversity in young adult and middle grade fiction works—including both works containing diverse characters and works written by diverse authors—and market them to a broad audience.[7][8] After being laid off from Mirrorstone Books, and having many discussions regarding under-representation of people of color in published works, Whitman founded it to be "a small press dedicated to YA fantasy and science fiction featuring characters of color."[9][10]

After the Kickstarter successfully funded the startup, Lee & Low Books acquired the company in March 2010, changed its name to Tu Books, and moved operations to the Lee & Low offices in New York City.[11][12] They initially focused on only science fiction and fantasy, but have since expanded to include all genres.[13]

In 2012, Tu Books established the New Visions Award.[14]


New Visions Award

Tu created the New Visions Award in 2012 for "a debut novel by a new writer of color".[15][16] Past winners include _Ink and Ashes_ by Valynne Maetani (published 2015),[17] _Rebel Seoul_ by Axie Oh (published 2017, originally titled _The Amaterasu Project_),[18] and _Ahimsa_ by Supriya Kelkar (published 2017).[19]


Awards

A number of works published by Tu Books have won or been nominated for awards. _Summer of the Mariposas_, by Guadalupe Garcia McCall, was nominated for the Andre Norton Award in 2013.[20] Joseph Bruchac's _Killer of Enemies_ was nominated for the 2014 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award.[21]
