SEABUBBLES is a startup created by Alain Thébault and Anders Bringdal in 2016. They design and manufacture electric boats, called hydrofoils the size of small cars It is proposed they could be used as water taxis in cities.[1][2] Seabubbles_prototype.jpg


History

Founded by Alain Thébault, designer of the world record breaking Hydroptère, who conceived the idea and Anders Bringdal, they brought together a team in France, with skills in hydrodynamic designing. Finalizing a design in 2016 for a five-person SeaBubbles water taxi.[3][4][5]

After testing a ⅛ scale prototype, in July 2016 they raised capital of €500,000 to fund the next stage.[6] Full size prototypes are being built and five will be tested on the Seine in Paris in 2017, operating between two landing stages.[7][8][9]


Design

Designed to operate in a no-wake zone, the SeaBubbles rises after a few meters and reaches a speed of , on four skids. This reduces water drag by 40% and increases efficiency,[10] allowing speeds of up to a potential .[11]

The SeaBubble is powered by two electrically driven propellers attached to the rear skids. The electric power is replenished at the landing stage by using a mixture of solar panels and turbines to charge the batteries.

A full size prototype was tested in March 2017 Prototype test.


Eco friendly

The Bubble is silent and as it makes no wake, it will not erode river banks. It uses electricity thus it has no emission on the trip.[12]
