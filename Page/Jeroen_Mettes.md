JEROEN METTES (Eindhoven, March 24, 1978 - The Hague, September 21, 2006) was a Dutch poet, essayist and blogger.[1]


Life

Jeroen Mettes grew up in Valkenswaard, studied philosophy in Utrecht, and literary studies at Leiden University, where he worked on his thesis on poetic rhythm until his death in 2006.[2]

In 1999, he began writing the long prose-poem he called _N30_. This was the code-name of the 1999 Seattle protests organised during the WTO negotiations. The protesters were demanding a global recognition of fair trade, trade unions and environmental legislation. Seven years later, in 2006, Mettes had written a poem, 60,000 words long.

In 2005, Jeroen Mettes started the blog _Poëzienotities_ (Poetry Notes).[3] An important part of that blog was Poet Alphabet, in which Mettes discussed—in alphabetical order—the poetry he found in Verwjis Bookstore, in his hometown of The Hague. He started with the A (Anne van Amstel), and would end with the G (Goudeseune). As a poet, Jeroen Mettes debuted in the journal _Parmentier_. In his early twenties, he had already contributed prose to, among other magazines, _Zoetermeer_ and _Passionate_. In 2006, Mettes joined the editorial staff of the magazine _yang_,[4] while continuing to write for _Parmentier_.

On September 21, 2006, he published an empty post on his blog. That same day, he chose to end his life. He left behind his poems, essays and his blog.[5]


Work

In 2011, Jeroen Mettes’ _Nagelaten werk_ (_Posthumous Works_), consisting of two parts, was published by Wereldbibliotheek. His poetry was collected in the volume _N30 +_. This volume is mostly filled with the long prose poem _N30_, which consists of 32 chapters. A selection of blog entries and the surviving essays were bundled under the title _Resistance Policy_. The Flemish poet and literary scholar Geert Buelens wrote the afterword.[6] The two parts of _Nagelaten werk_ were compiled by Piet Joosten, Frans-Willem Korsten and Daniel Rovers.


Critical reception

Mettes was initially known for his blog, and is since gaining recognition for his work through the publication of _N30_.[7] Mettes received critical recognition for his work from Samuel Vriezen,[8] Eva Cox, J. H. De Roder, and later Jos Joosten, Geert Buelens and Marc Kregting. Excerpts from N30 were translated into English by Vincent W. J. van Gerven Oie, and published in _continent. journal_ in 2012.

Mettes was posthumously nominated for the C. Buddingh prize for _N30_[9]
