KRISTAPS ZOMMERS (born 7 January 1997) is a Latvian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper, most recently for Liepāja.[1][2]


Club career

In the 2015-16 Serie D, Kristaps made 25 appearances and kept 17 clean sheets.[3]

Local journalists were deterred by the fact that he can't speak Italian fluently so his interviews were conducted in English.[4]

In an interview with the Italian show "Sports Bar" he said that "In football, you know, things may not always go smoothly; it only affects work and will continue to give my best in training. I am convinced, that our quality, in the long run, will come out."[5]

On 17 January 2019 he was released from his Parma contract by mutual consent.[6]


International

Zommers made his Latvia U-21 debut versus Estonia in the Baltic Cup and is deemed the highest prospect in Latvian goalkeeping.[7]
