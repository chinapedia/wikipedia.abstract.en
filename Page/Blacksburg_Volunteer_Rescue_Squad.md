History

Blacksburg Volunteer Life Saving and First Aid Crew, Inc. was organized in the spring of 1950, with 25 active members. The first vehicle was a Chevrolet Panel Truck purchased from Blacksburg Motor Company at a cost of $1,740. The vehicle was housed at the Blacksburg ESSO Station until a shed could be built near the old two-bay Fire Station behind the old Town Hall. The first activity report submitted to the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads dated September 1, 1951, to September 1, 1952 listed 96 calls for that year. In 1953, due to most members also serving on the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire Department, the two groups merged becoming the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire Department and First Aid Crew. The group stayed together until January 1, 1986. At that time, due to the growth of the area and the time and training required, they split into two separate organizations.

In 1957, Blacksburg Town Council provided funds for the construction of a building to house the equipment of the Blacksburg Volunteer Fire and First Aid Crew. The building on Progress Street was designed to provide space for four vehicles, a meeting hall and a storage room. In 1958, the town annexed a portion of the county, thus doubling the population and adding a considerable number of residences and business establishments. All this new territory became the responsibility of the crew. In 1969 due to state regulations, most of the area funeral homes discontinued ambulance service, placing an extra burden on the rescue crew. In 1971, the crew bought its first custom-built ambulance at a cost of about $12,000 (modern ambulances cost ~ $150,000). The crew completed its first Emergency Medical Technician's course in 1972. This growth required some expansion of the crew and of the crew hall. In 1981 the Progress Street station was expanded and the crew purchased its first Advanced Life Support ambulance.

In 1986 the BVRS became an independent organization. In 1989, for the first time in its 39-year history, the squad brought home its first two trophies from the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squad's annual convention held at Virginia Beach. The squad continues to grow at a phenomenal rate to keep up with the growth of Blacksburg. With no end in site for the town’s growth, the squad will continue to adapt and implement the latest in life saving techniques and equipment.

Summer of 2016 saw BVRS move into a new purpose built station, Station 5, on the corner of Progress and Patrick Henry.
