JANE ELLEN IBUR (born 1950) is an American poet and arts educator living in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. She has been chosen to serve as the Poet Laureate for the City of St. Louis from April 1, 2019, until March 31, 2021.


Early life and education

Jane Ellen (Janie) Ibur was born October 21, 1950, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Leslie L. Ibur and Betty Harris Ibur. She was the second of six children and the first girl. After graduating from high school in 1968, she attended Webster College in Webster Groves, Missouri, obtaining, in 1972, a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a lifetime teaching certificate in secondary English. Ibur taught middle school children for two years, at which point she interrupted her career to become the primary caretaker for her friend and mentor, Mary R. Woodard, a woman who had been in the Ibur family's employ for forty years. Her 33-year bond with Woodard became the subject of Ibur's poetic memoir, _Both Wings Flappin', Still Not Flyin_'.[1][2]


Professional career

Ibur established the habit of writing in elementary school by keeping a journal; she began writing poetry in middle school. Although she pursued a course of independent study in creative writing during college, she regards herself as virtually self-taught in the forms of poetry, knowledge that she acquired through reading and practice.

When Ibur resumed teaching, her goal was to make creative writing an outreach medium. While she has continued, over the course of a 35-year career, to teach writing and poetry to elementary and secondary students in public and private schools throughout the St. Louis area, to work as an outreach educator in numerous residential schools, and to work at multiple school sites in reading supplement programs, she has sought to expand the settings in which she teaches and to vary the groups with whom she works.[3]

She has taught creative writing to seniors enrolled in a lifelong learning program, to adults and children participating in St. Louis museum-sponsored writing workshops, and to women enrolled in YMCA writing classes. As a consequence of her involvement with the YMCA, she began teaching women and juvenile males at the county jail. She is a pioneer in creative education with prisoners and, for more than 30 years, has been teaching adult males on the maximum security floor of the St. Louis County Jail. In recent years, her teaching has focused primarily on formal poetry with all her students. She uses poetry as one way to process thoughts and to problem solve, to form community and to learn negotiation skills.[4]

Ibur has encouraged literacy through creative writing in multiple low-income housing projects in St. Louis and neighboring towns in Missouri, and she has taught in job readiness programs for the junior colleges in St. Louis. For ten years she taught writing to men who were homeless, creating a performance piece entitled Footsteps from the Margins, and she worked with older women who were being served by a neighborhood settlement house. Her work as a teacher of poetry has been funded by many mental health grants for organizations serving homeless, pregnant teens; mentally ill adults; women recovering from domestic violence; and veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

For 19 years Ibur co-produced and co-anchored _Literature for the Halibut_, a literary radio show on community radio in St. Louis.[5] She is the founding poet educator of the innovative Community Arts Training (CAT) Institute at the Regional Arts Commission of St. Louis. Through the CAT Institute she has, since 1997, prepared more than three hundred artists of all disciplines and community activists to collaborate in developing arts programs aimed at effecting social change, primarily in under-resourced community settings such as neighborhood organizations, social service agencies, development initiatives, and education programs. The CAT Institute is a national model that has received recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Kresge Foundation, and the Nathan Cummings Foundation among others.[6][7][8]

Currently Ibur runs _Poets and Writers Ink_ for emerging young writers, especially those in middle and high school. For more than 20 years, young writers—many of whom go on to major in creative writing in college—have studied with Ibur in this program. She has continued her work with prisoners and with veterans, and she has conducted a private writing workshop for adults for the past 20 years.


Personal life

Ibur and her spouse, Sondra M. Seiler, live in St. Louis, Missouri.

Ibur has been recognized twice by the Missouri Scholars Academy. She received a World of Difference Award from the Anti-Defamation League; a St. Louis Visionary Award for Outstanding Arts Educator;[9] the Warrior Poet Award from Word in Motion;[10][11] an Author Recognition Award from the Missouri Center for the Book; and a Loretto Award for humanitarian and social justice service from Webster University. Her poetry, published in literary journals and anthologies since 1972, has garnered numerous awards.
