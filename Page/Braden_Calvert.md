BRADEN CALVERT (born July 16, 1995) is a Canadian curler from Carberry, Manitoba.[1] He is a former World Junior curling champion and two-time Canadian junior champion.


Junior career

Calvert, originally from Winnipeg[2], won his first provincial junior title in 2014, and skipped Manitoba at the 2014 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. There, his team of Kyle Kurz, Lucas Van Den Bosch and Brendan Wilson lost one game, en route to their first national junior title. In the final, they defeated New Brunswick's René Comeau to earn the right to represent Canada at the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships. At the Worlds, they had less success, finishing the round robin with a 6–3 record. This put the team into the playoffs, but they lost to Switzerland in the 3 vs. 4 game, and then lost to Norway in the bronze medal game, settling for fourth place.

The team won their second-straight provincial junior crown in 2015, and represented Manitoba again at that year's Canadian Juniors. Again the team just lost one game in the round robin, and again won the national title. This time they had to beat Saskatchewan's Jacob Hersikorn rink to earn the right to represent Canada at the 2015 World Junior Curling Championships. They would fare much better at the 2015 World Juniors, losing just one game in the round robin. In the playoffs, they beat Switzerland's Yannick Schwaller twice to claim the gold medal.

Despite being the reigning World Junior champions, the Calvert rink failed to win the 2016 Manitoba Junior championship, which was Calvert's last year of junior eligibility. The team lost to Derek Oryniak in their first page playoff game.


Men's career

Calvert's junior rink played in their first men's provincial championship in 2015. Despite just being a junior team, the rink posted a 5-1 record in the knockout tournament, making it to the championship round, where they lost to former World Champion Jeff Stoughton in the 3 vs. 4 game.

Calvert played as an alternate for the Trevor Loreth team at the 2016 Manitoba men's championship, but the team won just two games. Calvert skipped his own team at the 2017 Manitoba men's championship, but won just one game.

On the World Curling Tour, Calvert won his first event at the inaugural 2016 Man Curl Tour Classic. He won his second tour event at the 2017 Icebreaker at The Granite. Calvert skipped a team at the 2018 provincial championship, losing both games they played in. Beginning the 2018-19 curling season, Calvert won his third tour title defending the Icebreaker at The Granite.
