_SUPER MARIO KART_ is a 1992 kart racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. The first game of the _Mario Kart_ series, it was released in Japan and North America in 1992, and in Europe the following year.[1] Selling 8.76 million copies worldwide, the game went on to become the fourth best selling SNES game of all time.[2] _Super Mario Kart_ was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2009,[3][4][5] and on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2013. Nintendo re-released _Super Mario Kart_ in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition.[6]

In _Super Mario Kart_, the player takes control of one of eight _Mario_ series characters, each with differing capabilities.[7] In single player mode players can race against computer-controlled characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups can be used to gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode.[8] In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode.[9] In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.[10]

_Super Mario Kart_ received positive reviews and was praised for its presentation, innovation and use of Mode 7 graphics.[11][12] It has been ranked among the greatest video games of all time by several organizations including _Edge_, IGN, _The Age_ and GameSpot, while _Guinness World Records_ has named it as the top console game ever.[13][14][15][16][17][18] It is often credited with creating the kart-racing subgenre of video games, leading other developers to try to duplicate its success. The game is also seen as having been key to expanding the _Mario_ series into non-platforming games. This diversity has led to it becoming the best-selling game franchise of all time.[19][20] Several sequels to _Super Mario Kart_ have been released, for consoles, handhelds and in arcades, each enjoying critical and commercial success. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from _Super Mario Kart_ has remained intact.[21]


Gameplay

_Super Mario Kart_ is a kart racing game featuring several single and multiplayer modes. During the game, players take control of one of eight _Mario_ franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a _Mario_ franchise theme. In order for them to begin driving, Lakitu will appear with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole, which starts the countdown. When the light turns green, the race or battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart.[22][23] The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time.[24] There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.

Tiles marked with question marks are arrayed on the race tracks; they give special abilities (power-ups) to a player's kart if the vehicle passes over them. Power-ups, such as the ability to throw shells and bananas, allow racers to hit others with the objects, causing them to spin and lose control. A kart that obtains the star power-up is temporarily invulnerable to attack.[25] Computer players have specific special powers associated with each character, that they are able to use throughout the race. Lines of coins are found on the tracks in competitive race modes. By running over these coins, a kart collects them and increases its top speed. Having coins also helps players when their kart is hit by another: instead of spinning and losing control, they lose a coin.[26] Coins are also lost when karts are struck by power-ups or fall off the tracks.[27]

The game features advanced maneuvers such as power sliding and hopping. Power sliding allows a kart to maintain its speed while turning, although executing the maneuver for too long causes the kart to spin. Hopping helps a kart execute tighter turns: the kart makes a short hop and turns in the air, speeding off in the new direction when it lands.[28] Reviewers praised _Super Mario Kart_{{'}}s gameplay, describing the battle mode as "addictive" and the single player gameplay as "incredible".[29][30] IGN stated that the gameplay mechanics defined the genre.[31]

Modes

_Super_Mario_Kart_screen_shot.jpg _Super Mario Kart_ has two single-player modes, Mario Kart GP (which stands for Grand Prix) and Time Trial. In Mario Kart GP, one player is required to race against seven computer-controlled characters in a series of five races which are called cups. Initially, there are three cups available – the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, and Star Cup – at two difficulty levels, 50cc and 100cc. By winning all three of the cups at the 100cc level, a fourth cup – the Special Cup – is unlocked.[32] Winning all four cups at 100cc unlocks a new difficulty level, 150cc.[33][34] Each cup consists of five five-lap races, each taking place on a distinct track.[35] In order to continue through a cup, a position of fourth or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in the fifth to eighth position, they are "ranked out" and the race must be replayed – at the cost of one of a limited number of lives – until a placing of fourth or above is achieved. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over.[36] Points are accrued by finishing in the top four positions in a race; first to fourth place receive nine, six, three and one points.[37] If a player finished in the same position three times in a row, then an extra life is awarded. The racer with the highest number of points after all five races have been completed wins the cup. In time trial mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Mario Kart GP mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.[38]

_Super Mario Kart_ also has three multiplayer modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race, and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two players and the second player uses the bottom half of the screen which is used as a map in the single-player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single-player, the only difference being that there are now two human-controlled and six computer-controlled drivers.[39] Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents.[40] In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses.[41] Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.

Characters

_Super Mario Kart_ features eight playable characters from the _Mario_ series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad.[42] Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling.[43] Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned in all of the subsequent _Mario Kart_ games starting with _Mario Kart 64_. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use.[44] These powers are specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.[45]

The characters are rendered as sprites portrayed from sixteen different angles.[46] The sprites were described as "detailed" by Nintendo Magazine System when the game was first reviewed and were thought to contribute to the "spectacular" graphics of the game as a whole.[47] More recently, Nintendojo called the sprites "not-so-pretty" when they are rendered at a distance, and IGN has commented on the dated look of the game.[48][49] _Super Mario Kart_ was the first game to feature playable characters from the _Mario_ series other than Mario or Luigi in a non-platforming game and the selection and different attributes of the characters is regarded as one of the game's strengths, IGN describing a well-balanced "all-star cast".[50][51] All of the characters present in _Super Mario Kart_ have gone on to appear in all of the later games in the series, except for Koopa Troopa, who has only appeared intermittently after being replaced by Wario in _Mario Kart 64_.[52] Donkey Kong Jr. was replaced by Donkey Kong, who has appeared in every _Mario Kart_ game since. This was Donkey Kong Jr.'s last appearance as a playable character, except for the _Mario Tennis_ sub-series, including installments on the Nintendo 64 and Virtual Boy.

Tracks

The tracks in _Super Mario Kart_ are based on locations in _Super Mario World_ such as Donut Plains.[53] Each of the four cups contains five different tracks for a total of twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses.[54][55] The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around.[56] Numerous obstacles themed from the _Mario_ series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from _Super Mario World_ in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks.[57] Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks.[58] Each single player track is littered with coins and power-up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.[59]

The tracks have received positive commentary with GameSpy describing them as wonderfully designed and IGN calling them perfect.[60][61] When naming its top five _Mario Kart_ tracks of all time in 2008, 1UP.com named Battle Mode Course 4 at number three and Rainbow Road – along with its subsequent versions in the series – at number one.[62] The track themes in _Super Mario Kart_ influenced later games in the series; recurring themes that first appeared in _Super Mario Kart_ include haunted tracks, Bowser's castle and Rainbow Road.[63] Some of the tracks from _Super Mario Kart_ have been duplicated in later games. All twenty of the original tracks are unlockable as an extra feature in the Game Boy Advance sequel _Mario Kart: Super Circuit_.[64] Remakes of Mario Circuit 1, Donut Plains 1, Koopa Beach 2 and Choco Island 2 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix series in _Mario Kart DS_, remakes of Ghost Valley 2, Mario Circuit 3, and Battle Course 4 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in _Mario Kart Wii_, remakes of Mario Circuit 2 and Rainbow Road appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix in _Mario Kart 7_, a remake of Donut Plains 3 appears as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in _Mario Kart 8_, a second remake of Rainbow Road appears in Mario Kart 8's first downloadable content pack, and a remake of Battle Course 1 appear as a Retro Battle Course in _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_.[65][66][67][68]


Development

Shigeru_Miyamoto_2015_(cropped).jpg, the producer for _Super Mario Kart_, has been involved in the development of every _Mario Kart_ console game.]] _Super Mario Kart_ was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Tadashi Sugiyama and Hideki Konno.[69] In an interview Miyamoto has said that the development team originally set out to produce a game capable of displaying two players on the same game screen simultaneously.[70] In the same interview Konno stated that development started with a desire to create a two player racing game in contrast to the single player gameplay of SNES launch title _F-Zero_.[71] The team found that due to limitations of the SNES hardware, the strong focus on multiplayer prevented the inclusions of tracks as elaborate as those found in _F-Zero_.[72] Computer and Video Games suggest that this initial emphasis on creating a two player experience is the reason for the game's horizontal split-screen during single player modes.[73]

The intention to create the racing modes of the game had been present from the start of the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank.[74] The game did not start out as a _Mario_ series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts.[75] They did not decide on incorporating _Mario_ series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development.[76] The choice was made after the development team when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart.[77] Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.[78]

Notable in the development of _Super Mario Kart_ was its use of Mode 7 graphics.[79] First seen in _F-Zero_, Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a plane to be rotated and scaled freely, achieving a pseudo-three-dimensional appearance.[80][81] 1UP.com have credited the use of Mode 7 with giving the game graphics which at the time of release were considered to be "breathtaking".[82] Retrospective reflection on the Mode 7 visuals was mixed, with IGN stating that the once revolutionary technology now looks "crude and flickery".[83] _Super Mario Kart_ featured a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chip; DSPs were used in SNES games as they provided a better handling of floating point calculations to assist with three-dimensional maths.[84] The DSP-1 chip that was used in _Super Mario Kart_ went on to be the most popular DSP chip to be used in SNES games.[85] The music for the title was created by composer Soyo Oka.[86]


Reception

_Super Mario Kart_ received critical acclaim and proved to be a commercial success; it received a Player's Choice release after selling one million copies and went on to sell 8.76 million copies, becoming the fourth best selling game ever for the SNES.[87][88][89] Aggregate scoring sites GameRankings and MobyGames both give an average of more than 90 percent.[90][91] Critics praised the game's Mode 7 graphics; in 1992 _Nintendo Magazine System_ described them as superb and the graphics have since been described as among the best ever seen on the SNES.[92][93] Another aspect of the game to have been praised is its gameplay, which Thunderbolt has described as the "deepest [and] most addictive... to be found on the SNES console".[94] _Nintendo Magazine System_ showed a preference for the multiplayer modes of the game and stated that while the "single player mode becomes dull quickly" the "two-player mode won't lose appeal". Retrospective reviews of the game have been positive with perfect scores given by review sites including Thunderbolt and HonestGamers. The use of the style and characters from the _Mario_ franchise was also praised as well as the individual characteristics of each racer.[95][96][97] Mean Machines describes the game as having "struck gold" in a way that no other – not even its sequels – has matched and GameSpot named the game as one of the greatest games of all time for its innovation, gameplay and visual style.[98][99] _Entertainment Weekly_ wrote that although the game might appear to be a "cynical attempt by Nintendo to cash in on its Super Mario franchise" the review concluded that "plunking the familiar characters down in souped-up go-carts actually makes for a delightful racing game."[100]

Since being released _Super Mario Kart_ has been listed among the best games ever made several times. In 1996, _Next Generation_ listed it as number 37 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", commenting that the controls are elegantly designed to offer "supreme fun."[101] IGN ranked it as the 15th best game ever in 2005, describing it as "the original karting masterpiece" and as the 23rd best game ever in 2007, discussing its originality at time of release.[102][103] _The Age_ placed it at number 19 on their list of the 50 best games in 2005 and in 2007 _Edge_ ranked _Super Mario Kart_ at number 14 on a list of their 100 best games, noting its continued influence on video game design.[104][105] The game is also included in Yahoo! Games UK's list of the hundred greatest games of all time which praises the appealing characters and power ups and 1UP.com's "Essential 50", a list of the fifty most important games ever made.[106][107] The game placed 13th in _Official Nintendo Magazine_'s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.[108] _Guinness World Records_ ranked it at number 1 on a list of the top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[109]


Legacy

_Super Mario Kart_ has been credited with inventing the "kart racing" subgenre of video gaming and soon after its release several other developers attempted to duplicate its success.[110][111][112][113] In 1994, less than two years after the release of _Super Mario Kart_, Sega released _Sonic Drift_; a kart racing game featuring characters from the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series.[114] Also in 1994 Ubisoft released _Street Racer_, a kart racing game for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis which included a four player mode not present in _Super Mario Kart_.[115] Apogee Software released _Wacky Wheels_ for PC and Atari Corporation released _Atari Karts_ for the Atari Jaguar in 1995. Future games that followed in the mould of _Super Mario Kart_ include _South Park Rally_, _Konami Krazy Racers_, _Diddy Kong Racing_, _Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing_ and several racing games in the _Crash Bandicoot_ series.[116][117] Response to the karting games released since _Super Mario Kart_ has been mixed, with GameSpot describing them as tending to be bad while 1UP.com notes that countless developers have tried to improve upon the Mario Kart formula without success.[118][119]

_Super Mario Kart_ is also credited as being the first non-platforming game to feature multiple playable characters from the _Mario_ franchise.[120] As well as several sequels Nintendo has released numerous other sporting and non-sporting Mario spin-offs since _Super Mario Kart_; a trend in part accredited to the commercial and critical success of the game.[121] The _Mario_ characters have appeared in many sports games including those relating to basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and soccer.[122] Non-sporting franchises using the _Mario_ characters have also been created, including the _Super Smash Bros._ series of fighting games and the _Mario Party_ series of board game based, party games. _Mario_ series characters have also made cameos in games from other series such as _SSX on Tour_ and _NBA Street V3_, both published by EA Sports.[123] The genre-spanning nature of the Mario series that was sparked off by the success of _Super Mario Kart_ has been described as key to the success and longevity of the franchise; keeping fans interested despite the infrequency of traditional Mario platforming games.[124] Following this model the _Mario_ series has gone on to become the best selling video game franchise of all time with 193 million units sold as of January 2007, almost 40 million units ahead of second-ranked franchise (_Pokémon_, also by Nintendo).[125]

_Super Mario Kart_ was re-released on the Japanese Virtual Console on June 9, 2009, and later in North America on November 23, 2009.[126] Previously, when naming it as one of the most wanted games for the platform in November 2008, Eurogamer stated that problems emulating the Mode 7 graphics were responsible for its absence.[127]

The game was also released for the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan during June 2013, and in Europe on March 27, 2014.[128] In addition, North America users was able to get the game starting from August 6, 2014 to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the game, which also includes the new game update of _Mario Kart 8_ on August 27, 2014.

_Super Mario 3D World_ has a stage with a look based on the Mario Circuit racetracks from _Super Mario Kart_. A remixed version of the music can also be heard. _Super Mario Odyssey_ also has a remix, when racing an RC car around a track in New Donk City in the Metro Kingdom.

Sequels

Several sequels to _Super Mario Kart_ have been brought out for successive generations of Nintendo consoles, each receiving commercial success and critical acclaim.[129] The first of these, _Mario Kart 64_ was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 and was the first _Mario Kart_ game to feature fully 3D graphics.[130] Although reviewers including IGN and GameSpot felt that the single player gameplay was lacking compared to its predecessor, the simultaneous four-person multiplayer modes – a first for the Nintendo 64 – were praised.[131][132] The second sequel, _Mario Kart: Super Circuit_, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It was described by GameSpot as more of a remake of _Super Mario Kart_ than a sequel to _Mario Kart 64_ and featured a return to the graphical style of the original.[133][134] As well as featuring all new tracks, players are able to unlock the original SNES tracks if certain achievements are completed.[135] _Mario Kart: Double Dash_ was released for the GameCube in 2003. Unlike any other _Mario Kart_ game before or since, it features two riders in each kart, allowing for a new form of cooperative multiplayer where one player controls the kart's movement and the other fires weapons.[136] _Mario Kart DS_, released for the Nintendo DS in 2005, was the first _Mario Kart_ game to include online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.[137] It went on to become the best selling hand-held racing game of all time, selling 7.83 million units.[138] The game also marks the debut of tracks appearing in previous games. _Mario Kart Wii_ was released for the Wii in 2008 and incorporates motion controls and 12-player racing. Like _Mario Kart DS_, it includes on-line play; it also allows racers to play as user-created Miis (after unlocking the Mii character)[139] as well as _Mario_ series characters and comes packaged with the Wii Wheel peripheral, which can act as the game's primary control mechanism when coupled with a Wii Remote.[140][141] _Mario Kart Wii_ went on to be the worldwide best-selling game of 2008 ahead of another Nintendo game – _Wii Fit_ – and the critically acclaimed _Grand Theft Auto IV_.[142][143] _Mario Kart 7_ for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011, which features racing on land, sea, and air. Also in _Mario Kart 7_ is the ability to customize your kart and to race in first-person mode. Three _Mario Kart_ arcade games have also been released, _Mario Kart Arcade GP_ in 2005, _Mario Kart Arcade GP 2_ in 2007, and _Mario Kart Arcade GP DX_ in 2013. All of them were developed jointly by Nintendo and Namco and feature classic Namco characters including Pac-Man and Blinky.[144] The most recent entry in the series is _Mario Kart 8_ for the Wii U, which was released at the end of May 2014, which brings back gliders and propellers from _Mario Kart 7_ as well as 12-player racing in _Mario Kart Wii_. _Mario Kart 8_ also includes a new feature called Mario Kart TV, where players can watch highlights of previous races and uploading them to YouTube. Another new feature is anti-gravity racing, where players can race on walls and ceilings.

As the series has progressed, many aspects included in _Super Mario Kart_ have been developed and altered. The power-up boxes which are flat against the track in _Super Mario Kart_ due to the technical limitations of the SNES became floating boxes in later games.[145] The roster of racers has expanded in recent games to include a greater selection of Nintendo characters including some which had not been created at the time of _Super Mario Kart's_ release – such as Petey Piranha from _Super Mario Sunshine_ who appeared in _Mario Kart: Double Dash!!_. Multiplayer has remained a key feature of the series and has expanded from the two-player modes available in _Super Mario Kart_; first to allow up to four simultaneous players in _Mario Kart 64_ and eventually up to twelve simultaneous online players in _Mario Kart Wii_.[146][147] Many of the track themes have been retained throughout the series, including Rainbow Road – the final track of the Special Cup – which has appeared in every _Mario Kart_ console game.[148][149] Other features present in _Super Mario Kart_ have disappeared from the series. These include the "super-powers" of the computer characters, the feather power-up which allows players to jump high into the air and having a restricted number of lives.[150] The only other _Mario Kart_ games to feature the coin collecting of the original are _Mario Kart: Super Circuit_, _Mario Kart 7_, and _Mario Kart 8_.[151] The aspects of style and gameplay from _Super Mario Kart_ that have been retained throughout the series have led Nintendo to face criticism for a lack of originality but the franchise is still considered to be a beloved household name by many, known for its familiar core gameplay.[152][153][154][155]
