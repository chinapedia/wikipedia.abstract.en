The BANTING RESEARCH FOUNDATION is a registered charity whose object is to fund health and biomedical research in Canada. It was established to support the ongoing research of Frederick Banting and his associates.


History

The Banting Research Foundation was created in 1925 to commemorate the discovery of insulin and to support further medical research by Banting and other scientists in Canada, in the hopes of finding additional medical discoveries of equal importance. A fundraising campaign in 1925, led by Sir William Mulock, Chancellor of the University of Toronto, raised $500,000 from individual and corporate donors to establish an endowment.[1] A large bequest in 1948 from the estate of Kate E Taylor of Toronto added to the endowment.[2] From its inception, the intent was to create a fund for researchers with "good ideas but no money",[3] as was the situation for Banting when he approached JJR Macleod in 1921 with a request for facilities and resources to pursue his ideas about insulin. The Foundation continues that tradition by making grant funds available only to investigators whose research funding is limited. The Foundation was the first and virtually the only organization funding medical research in Canada until 1938[4] when the National Research Council included medical research in its funding programs.
