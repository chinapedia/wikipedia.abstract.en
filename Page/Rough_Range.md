ROUGH RANGE is a location in Western Australia where oil was discovered during an exploration drilling programme in 1953.

WEST AUSTRALIAN PETROLEUM WAPET, drilled its first well at Rough Range near North West Cape in 1953.[1][2]

This well produced at a rate of 550 barrels per day (87 m3/d), and was the first working well of Australia's commercial petroleum industry.[3][4][5]

Despite being abandoned as non-commercial in the mid 1950s, consideration was given in the 2000s to re-work the find[6][7][8]
