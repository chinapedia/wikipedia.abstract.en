CEDAR ISLAND is a horseshoe-shaped island in the Willamette River in Clackamas County, Oregon. It is located within the city limits of West Linn, Oregon, and is a West Linn city park. The island is accessible by floating bridge during the spring, summer, and fall months.[1] About half of Cedar Island was dredged in order to mine gravel, creating a large lagoon in the center of the island. The island is primarily used for recreational purposes such as fishing, hiking, and wildlife viewing.[2][3]
