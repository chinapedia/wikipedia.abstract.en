History

There have been several myths related to the history of Mmaku.

One legend is that Anekemmadu was a hunter, and he came to a land that was favourable to him and produced a good yield, and decided to live there with his wife Udumeogwee_._ His wife gave birth to three sons: Nnaka, now known as Achi, the first son; Ezianu, now known as Mmaku, the second son ; and Ogwunafor, now known as Agwu, the third son. The eldest, Achi-nnaka, decided to move to the north, while Mmaku-Eziani remained on his father's land and Ogwunafor moved southward. The name Mmaku, meaning _welcomer_ or _embracer_, came into existence when as a little boy Ezianu, due to his welcoming heart, embraced a spirit in human form. From then on, the name was given to him in addition to his birth name. Mmaku-Ezianu, as he was now called, got married and had two sons, MMaku-Ukwu and Mmaku-Nta. Mmaku-Nta in his turn had five sons: Enugu-Afam, Eziama, Mkpurumkpu, Awo, and Agboneri. Mmaku-Ukwu had seven sons: Amanato, Ezioha, Amegu, Enugu-Agu, Okwuluofia, Otokwu, and Ifite.

The other legend is as follows: (this is not legend but facts as true Igbo Scholars have evidently proven this line of history) The literal English meaning of the name, Mmaku, is the beauty of wealth. According to historical and oral evidences, Mmaku was a 4th generation descendant of Nri (the son of Eri, the son of Gad, the son of Jacob (Genesis Chapter 30:9; 46: 16 and Numbers chapter 26:15-19)), the acclaimed ancestor of the Igbo Race of the South East Nigeria who migrated southward after the Jewish Exodus from Egypt and migrated towards south of Sudan.

Eri had two wives, Nneamaku and Oboli. Nneamaku had five children: Nri-ifikwuanịm-Menri, his first son; Agụlụ, Ogbodudu, Onogu, and Iguedo, her only daughter. Nri-Ifikwuanịm begot Agụkwu Nri, Enugwu-Ukwu, Enugwu-Agidi, Nọfịa, and Amọbia. Nri-Ifikwuanim was a priest like his father Eri. Eri had continued the Jewish traditional worship even as he settled at Ezunaoamambala (now Anambra).

Nri-Ifikwuanim, being the first son of Eri, continued to establish and strengthen the kingdom of his father. He was the custodian of the family tradition and the Royal Priest. Having five children from his first wife, he continued to have more children from his other wives and concubines. His kingdom was quick to expand.

By the time he passed on to his ancestors, his family was so large that some of the sons left with their families and migrated to the east and south, but none migrated north or west. Those that left continued with their father's traditions, the 'Igu-Aro' (observing the yearly calendar), child circumcision, and other rites.

Ezianu, a grandchild of Eri-Ifikwuanim, the son of Nneamaku, begot Mmaku, a twist of the suffix in his great grand mother's name, Nneamaku (Mother of the place of wealth). Ezianu (good land) arrived at the green belt after Awka (Oji/Awgu location) and he became so rich that he blessed the god of his ancestors for bringing him to the place and named it 'Ezi-anu'. He founded a dynasty after his name, named his first son Mma-Aku (beauty of wealth) and believed strongly that the name of his great-grandmother, Nneamaku, had influenced him to become wealthy. Ezianu settled and beget other children including Mmaku as the first son, Achi, Mgbowo, Nkwe, Ezere, Mgbidi, Awgu, and Awgu-nta. It has been confirmed that Ezianu migrated from the present day Amoli. The possibility of a blood link with Amoli is still being investigated.

When Ezianu passed on, Mmaku remained ancestral and spiritual custodian of the Ezi-anu Clan. Achi, who migrated northward of the Mmaku home, became friendly with other migrated descendants of Eri located at the west of Oji River hence the high influence of the cultures of the neighbours on its original cultures as can be observed today.

Mmaku, the first son of Ezi-anu, begot twelve children from two wives. The first wife begot Afam (Enugu Afam, the traditional and spiritual custodian of Ezi-anu deity), Eziama, Ibite, Mkpulukpu, Awo while the second wife begot Amanato (acestral custodian on his mothers side of the family), Ezioha, Otokwu, Okwulofia, Amegu, Ezi Ajanu (Enugwu-Mmaku) and Ifite-Ohanta. Some of the descendants of Mmaku migrated to Arochukwu, today called Mmaku-Aro. Some of the descendants of Ezioha and Amanato migrated to Mgbowo to become part of today called Amanato and Ezioha Mgbowo while some descendants of Okwulofia migrated to Ogwugwu now known as Okwulofia Ogwugwu (Ebo-Ogwuwgu).

The chief ancestral shrine of Mmaku is the family house of Ezi-anu, the Ezi-anu Shrine located at Enugwu Affam. Kings are crowned at this location, considered the sacred spot of Mmaku. Until today, the dialect of Mmaku has never changed throughout the land of his grand-cousins and brothers in Nofia, Amobia, Enugwu-Agidi, Enugu-Ukwu and Agukwu-Nri, because according to Eri, first sons must keep to the original traditions, including their language.
