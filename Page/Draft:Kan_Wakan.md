Immediately upon release the single was picked up by KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic which featured the track every day for a week, calling it "an ambient, slightly psychedelic trip."[2] The initial success of the single lead to a record deal with Verve Records, who released Kan Wakan's first full-length album, 'Moving On,' in 2014.[3]

in 2014 Kan Wakan released the debut 13 track album 'Moving On' on Verve Records. The album was praise by Rolling Stone who called the it "exceptionally interesting... dreamy, intricate stuff worth repeated re-hearings."[4] Upon release, 'Moving On' peaked at #37 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart.

Following the release, Kan Wakan performed the album live on KCRW's Morning Becomes Ecclectic on June 20, 2014.[5]

Yahoo! Music listed Kan Wakan as one of the "11 Best New Artists of 2014" and the success of 'Moving On' lead to Gueorgui Linev being named one of "The 10 Best Young L.A. Songwriters" by LA Weekly in 2014.[6][7]

In 2015, Kan Wakan released a 24 track remix album, 'Moving On Remixed' included Wet's version of "Like I Need You" which EARMILK called "absolutely stunning...and absolutely addicting."[8] Moving On Remixed was released on Noisetrade.

In August of 2016, Kan Wakan released 'Molasses,' which was named "Today's Top Tune"[9] by Los Angeles based radio station KCRW, and premiered in Nylon Magazine[10]. Followed by positive reviews from notable music blogs, including Indie Shuffle,[11] the track hit #2 on Hype Machine.[12] Following the successful momentum of 'Molasses,' Phantasmagoria's second single 'I Would' reached #2 on Hype Machine after Clash Magazine premiered the track, calling it "Absorbing"[13] and was later placed in Indie Shuffle's "Best of October" Playlist.[14]

2 months later in January 2017, Kan Wakan's 3rd single "I Had To Laugh," featuring Rachel Fannan, premiered on Consequence of Sound along with the announcement that 'Phantasmagoria' will be released in May 2017.[15] The album is currently available for pre-order on PledgeMusic. [16]

In February 2017, Kan Wakan performed 3 headlining shows across California. Buzzbands LA called the show at The Bootleg in Los Angeles, "a 90-minute spell... jaw-dropping on a lot of levels" continuing to comment "When was the last time the headliner at a club show played all-new material for more than 90 minutes?."[17]

On April 4, 2017, Pigeons and Planes premiered Phantasmagoria's 4th single "Still Feather" featuring Saigo.[18] The song subsequently reached #1 on Hype Machine and was named "Best New Track" by High Clouds.[19] [20] The track also garnered radio play by DJ Jamz Supernova on BBC Radio 1 and on KCRW.
