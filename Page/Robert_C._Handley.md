ROBERT C. HANDLEY (1881 â€“ 4 February 1940) was a British politician and trade unionist.

Based in Preston, Lancashire, Handley began working in a cotton mill as a half-timer at the age of ten. He eventually became a spinner, and joined the Preston Operative Cotton Spinners' Association, later being elected as its secretary.[1]

Handley was also active in the Labour Party, and was elected to Preston Borough Council in 1923. In 1934/5, he served as Mayor of Preston, the third Labour mayor of the town.[2] In 1936, he was elected as vice-chairman of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, and in 1938 he was also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.[3]

Handley was also active internationally, attending the conferences of the International Labour Organization, at which he was particularly well known for his campaign for a maximum forty-hour working week.[4]
