_CRUSTODONTIA_ is a fungal genus of uncertain familial placement in the order Polyporales. The genus was circumscribed in 2005 to contain the crust fungus _CRUSTODONTIA CHRYSOCREAS_.[1] This species was originally described as _Corticium chrysocreas_ by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873. Their description was as follows: "Subiculum bright yellow, thin; hymenium immarginate pallid, or yellow tinged with tawny."[2] _Crustodontia_ has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning it contains only generative hyphae, and these hyphae have clamp connections.[3]

_Crustodontia chrysocreas_ has a pantropical distribution. It has been widely collected, including the United States, Costa Rica, Caribbean Islands, Venezuela, equatorial Africa, Sri Lanka, China, Taiwan, Japan, Hawaii, Brunei, western Australia, and New Zealand. It is rare in Europe; its northernmost recorded collection location (51.7Â°N) is in Belarus.[4] The fungus causes a white rot in the woody debris of live oak and other hardwoods; it also causes white heart rot in living trees.[5]

_Crustodontia_ is closely related to _Phlebia_. Molecular analysis places it in the Meruliaceae, in the phlebioid clade.[6][7]
