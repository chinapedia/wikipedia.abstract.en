Critical reception

The song was well received by critics. Rap-Up stated in a review "Sevyn Streeter is set to release her debut album next year, but before 2016 is over, she’s giving fans another taste of Girl Disrupted with “Before I Do.” The stripped-down R&B jam finds the Haines City songstress ready to take her relationship to the next level, but before she does, she wants to make sure her man is the right one."[9] HotNewHipHop said in a review "Sevyn Streeter has a voice of velvet, and on her new single "Before I Do," she lets those uniquely soothing vocals loose. Over an old school 90's R&B beat, she investigates a potential lover before allowing him to smash."[10] Singersroom stated in a review "Sevyn Streeter continues to heighten anticipation around her forthcoming debut album, Girl Disrupted, with the release of the new record, Before I Do. On the stripped-down tune, the R&B songstress finds herself in the gray area of love: she’s trying to figure out if her boo is real or if he’s unfaithful.[11]
