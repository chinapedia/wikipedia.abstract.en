LAURA BRUNEAU is a Canadian actress, best known for her lead roles in the television series _Material World_[1] and _Wind at My Back_.[2]

Originally from North Vancouver, British Columbia,[3] she studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years before returning to Canada, where she acted on stage in Vancouver and had guest roles in _Hangin' In_ and _The Beachcombers_.[4] In 1983, she was cast in the American prime time soap opera _Bare Essence_, which was cancelled after twelve episodes.[5] She remained in the United States for a few more years, appearing in an episode of _Knight Rider_ and working with a comedy troupe which produced several sketches for the syndicated series _PM Magazine_,[6] before returning to Canada again when she was cast in a pilot created by Louis Del Grande which did not make it to series.[7] She then had guest roles in _Street Legal_, _Counterstrike_ and _Katts and Dog_, and the television film _Love and Hate: The Story of Colin and Joanne Thatcher_, before being cast as Kitty, the lead character, in _Material World_.[8]

After _Material World_ was cancelled in 1993, Bruneau had guest roles in the television series _Matrix_, _The Outer Limits_ and _Two_ before being cast in _Wind at My Back_ as Honey Bailey, following the departure of Cynthia Belliveau from the series.[9] She played the role for the final season of the series and in the follow-up television film _A Wind at My Back Christmas_.[10]
