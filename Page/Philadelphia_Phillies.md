The PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES are a professional baseball team based in Philadelphia, USA. The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. Since 2004, the team's home has been Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philadelphia.

The Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in and the Tampa Bay Rays in ) and seven National League pennants, the first of which came in 1915. Since the first modern World Series was played in , the Phillies played 77 consecutive seasons (and 97 seasons from the club's establishment) before they won their first World Series—longer than any other of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues for the first half of the 20th century. They are one of the more successful franchises since the start of the Divisional Era in Major League Baseball. The Phillies have won their division 11 times, which ranks 6th among all teams and 4th in the National League, including five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011.

The franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park and continuing at Baker Bowl; Shibe Park, which was later renamed Connie Mack Stadium in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager; Veterans Stadium, and now Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies have had a long-running rivalry with the New York Mets.

The team's spring training facilities are located in Clearwater, Florida, where its Class-A minor league affiliate Clearwater Threshers plays at Spectrum Field. Its Double-A affiliate is the Reading Fightin Phils, which plays in Reading, Pennsylvania. The Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, which plays in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Its Low Class-A affiliate the Lakewood BlueClaws play in Lakewood, New Jersey.


History

Early history (1883–1942)

1890Phillies.jpg]] In 1883, sporting goods manufacturer Al Reach (a pioneering professional baseball player) and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League franchise for Philadelphia, one of what are now known as the "Classic Eight" of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester Brown Stockings, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the "Quakers", and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which is still the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester[6] ended up with the 1883 Quakers.[7]

In 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes. Also in 1884, the team changed its name to the "Philadelphias", as it was common for baseball teams in that era to be named after their cities (for instance, the "Bostons" and "New Yorks"). However, as "Philadelphias" was somewhat hard to fit in newspaper headlines, some writers still continued to call them the "Quakers" while others began shortening the name to "Phillies."[8] The nickname "Phillies" first appeared in the Philadelphia _Inquirer_ for April 3, 1883, in the paper's coverage of an exhibition game by the new National League club. At some point in the 1880s, the team accepted the shorter nickname "Phillies" as an official nickname. "Quakers" continued to be used interchangeably with "Phillies" until 1890, when the team officially became known as the "Phillies." This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.[9]

Baker_Bowl_and_Huntingdon_Street_station,_1928.jpg, home of the Phillies from 1887–1938|alt=]] In 1887, they began play at the stadium eventually known as Baker Bowl. Despite a general improvement from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title. The standout players of the franchise in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by several others) with 4 home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.[10] 1904_Philadelphia_Phillies.jpg]] With the birth of the more lucrative American League (AL) in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902—the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. To add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing twelve and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.[11]

GCAlexander.jpg, Phillies pitcher from 1911 to 1917 and 1930]] The Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the major-league single-season record for home runs with 24. However, by 1917 Alexander had been traded away when owner William Baker refused to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; for instance, during much of his tenure there was only one scout in the entire organization.

The effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, thirteen games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record (78–76 in 1932), only finished higher than sixth twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished last a total of 17 times and next to last seven times. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, who won the Triple Crown in 1933.

Baker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married leather goods and shoe dealer Gerald Nugent. With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. Baker's widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control.[12] Unlike Baker, Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team. However, he didn't have the financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial methods to even field a team at all.[13]

Grand_Stand_Entrance_of_Shibe_Park.jpg/Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938–1970|alt=]] Philadelphia's cozy Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record still standing today. Once considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925 the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein's home runs hit girders. The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's Shibe Park (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927.

The Phillies tried to move to Shibe Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A's. However, Baker Bowl's owner, Charles W. Murphy, refused to let the Phillies out of their lease at first. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game.

The lowest point came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 43–111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training. Nugent realized he didn't have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale.

"Whiz Kids" (1943–1969)

After lumber baron William D. Cox purchased the team in 1943, the Phillies rose out of last place for the first time in five years. As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball. The new owner, Bob Carpenter, Jr., scion of the Delaware-based DuPont family, tried to polish the team's image by unofficially changing its name to the "Bluejays." However, the new moniker did not take, and it was quietly dropped by 1949.[14]

Robin_Roberts.jpg, Phillies pitcher from 1948 to 1961|248x248px]] Like Cox, Bob Carpenter, Jr. wasn't afraid to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system. The Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players, known as the "Whiz Kids", that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an "A's town" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most of the time since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.

Richie_Ashburn.jpg, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959]] Things started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81–73 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter, Sr., who had died in June and left Bob, Jr. in full control of the team.

Although the Phillies led the National League standings for most of the 1950 season, a late-season tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung onto a one-game lead when Dick Sisler's dramatic tenth-inning, three-run home run against the Dodgers clinched the Phils' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team. Phils_1950.PNG In contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics finished last in 1950, and longtime manager Connie Mack retired. The team struggled on for four more years with only one winning season before abandoning Philadelphia under the Johnson brothers, who bought out Mack. They began play in Kansas City in 1955.[15] As part of the deal selling that team to the Johnson brothers, the Phillies bought Shibe Park, where both teams had played since 1938.[16] Many thought that the "Whiz Kids", with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come.[17][18] However, the team finished with a 73–81 record in 1951, and, except for a second-place tie in 1964, did not finish higher than third place again until 1975.[19] Their competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900.

The Phold of '64

1964_Philadelphia_Phillies_team_photo.jpg]] Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Richie Allen. The team was 90–60 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. However, the Phillies lost 10 games in a row and finished one game out of first, losing the pennant to the St. Louis Cardinals. The "Phold of '64" is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse in sports history.[20]

One highlight of the 1964 season occurred on Father's Day, when Jim Bunning pitched a perfect game against the New York Mets, the first in Phillies history.[21] For the rest of the decade the team would finish no higher than fourth place in the NL standings which came during the 1966 season. For the 1969 season, the Phillies would finish fourth in the newly created NL East Division, with a record of 63-99.

Rebranding a winning team (1970–1983)

VeteransStadium1986-2a.jpg, home of the Phillies from 1971–2003|250x250px]] By the late 1950s, Carpenter decided that the Phillies needed a new home. He never wanted to buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could make money playing there. He sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier.

The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1. The Phillies opened the new Veterans Stadium in 1971, wearing new maroon uniforms to accentuate the change. In their first season there, pitcher Rick Wise hurled a no-hitter. That same season, Harry Kalas joined the Phillies broadcasting team. Mike_Schmidt_-_Philadelphia_Phillies_-_1983.jpg, Phillies third baseman from 1972 to 1989|283x283px|alt=]] In 1972, the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins) and was awarded his first NL Cy Young Award and won it again in 1977. Bob Carpenter retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. The Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With such players as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top.

1980 World Series Champions

The Phillies won the NL East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they would have to defeat the Houston Astros. In a memorable NLCS, with 4 of the 5 games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a tenth-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years.[22] The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3–1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.

Steve_Carlton_-_Philadelphia_Phillies_-_1983.jpg, Phillies pitcher from 1972 to 1986|210x210px|alt=|left]]Facing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who was the National League MVP that 1980 season, also won the World Series MVP award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. This final game was also significant because it remains "the most-watched game in World Series history" with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.[23] Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1961 to win a World Series.[24] Carlton captured his third NL Cy Young Award with a record of 24–9. Tug_McGraw_Phillies.JPG, Phillies closer from 1975 to 1984|249x249px]]

After their series win, Ruly Carpenter, who was given control of the team in 1972 when his father stepped down as team president, sold the team for $32.5 million in 1981 to a group that was headed by longtime Phillies executive Bill Giles.

The Phillies would return to the playoffs in 1981, which was split in half due to a players' strike. In five games, they were defeated in the first ever National League Division Series by the Montreal Expos. Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL MVP award that year. In 1982, the team finished three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the East Division, narrowly missing the playoffs. Steve Carlton would capture his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins.

For the 1983 season, the Phillies returned to the playoffs and beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, Philadelphia Daily News sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the Wheeze Kids.[25]Philadelphia_Phillies_Cap_(1970_-_1991).png

Fall from grace (1984–1991)

Following their loss to the Orioles in the 1983 World Series the Phillies struggled for most of the rest of the 1980s. Aside from a distant second-place finish in 1986 (21 1⁄2 games behind the Mets), they were not a serious factor in a pennant race for the rest of the decade. During this stretch, the 1984 team was the only other one that even managed to get to the .500 mark. During this time, the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 people). Even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment.

Steve Carlton was plagued by injuries in 1985 and was released in the middle of the 1986 season by the team. In 1989 Mike Schmidt retired from baseball and thus the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone. In 1987 closer Steve Bedrosian was named the NL Cy Young Award winner.

On August 15, 1990, Terry Mulholland lost a perfect game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants' batter reached base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter.[26]

Near miss and continued struggles (1992–2002)

John_Kruk_1992.jpg, Phillies first baseman from 1989 to 1994]]In 1992 the organization decided to shed the maroon uniform and logo and use colors similar to those used during the days of the "Whiz Kids". The 1992 season would end with the Phillies at the bottom of the standings, at last place in the National League East. However, their fortunes were about to change.

The 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was often described as "shaggy", "unkempt", and "dirty." This team was known as a bunch of throw back, whatever it takes kind of players. Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. 2012_08_10_023_Phillies_Darren_Daulton.JPG, Phillies catcher from 1983, 1985 to 1997]]The team powered their way to a 97–65 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17–5. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.

They beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[27] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies loss.[28]

The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike was a blow to the Phillies' attendance and on-field success, as was the arrival of the Braves in the division due to league realignment. Several players from the 1993 team were either traded or left the team soon after. The team drafted third baseman Scott Rolen in the second round of the 1993 amateur draft. He had reached the majors by 1996 and was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1997. After becoming frustrated with management he demanded a trade and was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2002. Philadelphia_Phillies_Insignia.svg cap insignia used since 1992]] Between 1996 and 2003 the team drafted players that would soon become the core of the team such as Jimmy Rollins, Pat Burrell, Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Cole Hamels.

Former Phillie Larry Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to an 86–76 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first, the Braves' tightest division race in years. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year.

The Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80–81 season in 2002. On December 6, 2002, Jim Thome, who was a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract[29] with the team.

The Golden era (2003–2013)

Phillies_2014_Opening_Day_Citizens_Bank_Park_Panorama.jpg has been the home of the Phillies since 2003]] The Phillies win-loss record only dipped below .500 once between the years 2003 and 2013; the team was 73-89 in 2013.[30] In 2004, the Phillies moved to their new home, Citizens Bank Park,[31] across the street from Veterans Stadium.

Charlie Manuel took over the reins of the club from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, bringing in players such as Shane Victorino, Jayson Werth, and Jamie Moyer.

Ryan Howard was named NL MVP for the 2006 season and Jimmy Rollins followed up the next year as the 2007 NL MVP. After the franchise lost its 10,000th game in 2007,[32] its core of young players responded by winning the National League East division title, but they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the Division Series.[33] After the 2007 season, they acquired closer Brad Lidge through a trade with the Houston Astros.Baseball_jimmy_rollins_2004.jpg, Phillies shortstop from 2000 to 2014]]

2008 World Series Champions

Though the Phillies were named in some publications as the favorites to repeat as division champions, they did not get off to the blazing April start that many had hoped for. Still, they managed their first winning opening month since 2003, and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance.

Chase_Utley_on_March_11,_2007.jpg, Phillies second baseman from 2003 to 2015|alt=|left]]With a batting average of .360 and his MLB-leading 11 home runs, Chase Utley paced the team's offense, followed closely by a resurgent Pat Burrell and his 25 runs batted in. Though team speed was hampered by the loss of Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins to the disabled list, the latter for the first time in his career, the Phillies still pushed forward to a 15–13 record.

June was a tale of two halves for the Phillies, as they ended May and started June with a strong run of offense and excellent pitching. From May 26 to June 13, the Phillies posted a 14–4 record, starting their run with a 15–6 win over the Astros and ending with a 20–2 win over the Cardinals. However, the offense took a downturn as the Phillies pitchers began to sacrifice more runs in the latter part of the month. The Phillies went 3–11 over the remainder of June, with the pitchers allowing an average of 4.79 runs per game, to the offense's 3.36 runs scored per game. July began with the announcement that Chase Utley and Brad Lidge would represent the team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game,[34] with Utley garnering the most votes of all National League players.[35]

The Phillies went 8–4 in July before the All-Star break, compiling a four-game win streak, a four-game losing streak, and winning four of their last five. In a move to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race, the Phillies traded three minor league players to the Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17.[36]

On September 27, the Phillies clinched the National League East for the second year in a row, once again helped by a late September slump from the New York Mets. The Phillies redeemed their previous year's playoff performance by winning the NLDS three games to one against the Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4–1.

As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays. After a power outage by the offense in which they went 1 for 33 with runners in scoring position and the first-ever suspended postseason game in World Series history in game five, the Phillies rode their pitching rotation to a 4–1 victory in the Fall Classic; Hamels was named the series MVP for both the NLCS and the World Series.

Gillick retired as general manager after the 2008 season and was succeeded by one of his assistants, Rubén Amaro, Jr. After adding outfielder Raúl Ibañez to replace the departed Pat Burrell, the Phillies retained the majority of their core players for the 2009 season. In July, they signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martínez and acquired 2008 American League Cy Young winner Cliff Lee before the trade deadline. On September 30, 2009, they clinched a third consecutive National League East Division title for the first time since the 1976–78 seasons. The team continued this run of success with wins over the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS (3 games to 1) and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS (4 games to 1), to become the first Phillies team to win back-to-back pennants and the first National League team since the 1996 Atlanta Braves to have an opportunity to defend their World Series title. The Phillies were unable to repeat the 2008 World Series victory; they were defeated in the 2009 series by the New York Yankees, 4 games to 2. In recognition of the team's recent accomplishments, _Baseball America_ named the Phillies as its Organization of the Year.[37]Ryan_Howard_(18878856955).jpg, Phillies first baseman from 2004 to 2016]]

On December 16, 2009, they acquired starting pitcher Roy Halladay from the Toronto Blue Jays for three minor-league prospects,[38] and traded Cliff Lee to the Seattle Mariners for three prospects.[39] On May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins. In June 2010, the team's scheduled 2010 series against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre was moved to Philadelphia, because of security concerns for the G-20 Summit. The Blue Jays wore their home white uniforms and batted last as the home team, and the designated hitter was used.[40] The game was the first occasion of the use of a designated hitter in a National League ballpark in a regular-season game; Ryan Howard was the first player to fill the role.[41]

IMG_7472_Roy_Halladay.jpg, Phillies pitcher from 2010 to 2013|306x306px]]The 2010 Phillies won their fourth consecutive NL East Division championship[42][43] despite a rash of significant injuries to key players.[44] After dropping seven games behind the Atlanta Braves on July 21, Philadelphia finished with an MLB-best record of 97–65.[45] The streak included a 20–5 record in September, the Phillies' best September since winning 22 games that month in 1983,[46] and an 11–0 run in the middle of the month.[47] The acquisition of pitcher Roy Oswalt in early August was a key step, as Oswalt won seven consecutive games in just over five weeks from August 11 through September 17.[48] The Phillies clinched the division on September 27, behind a two-hit shutout by Halladay.[49]

In Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series, Halladay threw the second no-hitter in Major League baseball postseason history, leading the Phillies over the Cincinnati Reds, 4–0. (The first was New York Yankee pitcher Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.[50]) Halladay's no-hitter was the fifth time a pitcher has thrown two no-hitters in the same season, and was also the first time that one of the two occurred in the postseason. The Phillies went on to sweep the Reds in three straight games.

In the 2010 National League Championship Series, the Phillies fell to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in six games. Halladay was named the 2010 NL Cy Young Award winner.

Before the start of the 2011 season the Philles signed pitcher Cliff Lee to a five-year deal, bringing him back to the team and forming a formidable rotation of Halladay, Lee, Hamels, Oswalt, and Blanton. Including Vance Worley, who replaced Joe Blanton due to injury. The rotation combined for a win-loss record of 71-38. and an ERA of 2.86; the best in the majors that year. Commentators called it one of the best rotations ever assembled.[51][52][53][54] Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed the '_Phantastic Phour_' by fans and the media.[55] On September 17, 2011, the Phillies won their fifth consecutive East Division championship,[56] and on September 28, during the final game of the season, the team set a franchise record for victories in a season with 102 by beating the Atlanta Braves in 13 innings, denying their division rivals a potential wild card berth.[57] Yet the Phillies lost in the NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals – the team that won the National League Wild Card as a result of the Phillies beating the Braves. The Cardinals subsequently beat the Brewers in the NLCS and won the 2011 World Series in 7 games over the Texas Rangers.

They played .500 ball through the first two months, but then slumped through a 9–19 stretch in June where they ended up at the bottom of the NL East by midseason. With any hope dimming, the Phillies traded key players Shane Victorino and Joe Blanton to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Hunter Pence to the San Francisco Giants before the trade deadline. A hot start in the second half of the season put the Phillies back on the postseason hunt, but any hope was eventually extinguished with a loss to the Washington Nationals on September 28, costing the Phillies the postseason for the first time since 2006.

During the 2013 season, the team struggled again, and was unable to consistently play well for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team's record at 53-68, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the team since 2005,[58] and promoted third-base coach Ryne Sandberg to Interim Manager. Manuel had spent over nine years as manager, leading Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years and amassing an overall record of 780-636 to become the manager with the most wins in the franchise's history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record of 73-89, their first losing season since 2002. In the off season pitcher Roy Halladay retired from baseball.

Rebuilding years and The Harper Era (2014–Present)

In the 2014 season, one of the few bright spots was the September 1 game against a division rival, the Atlanta Braves, when starter Cole Hamels and relievers Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon combined for a no-hitter in Turner Field and a 7-0 victory over Atlanta. In the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft the Phillies selected pitcher Aaron Nola with the seventh overall pick. The team could not gain momentum during the season and finished last in the NL East, the first time they had done so since 2000. During the off season Jimmy Rollins waived his no-trade clause and was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Cliff Lee would have pitched his last game and was sidelined for the entire 2015 season due to injury.

In 2015, attendance began to drop as the team showed little improvement and it was clear that the remnants of the 2008 World Series team would soon be departing. Sandberg resigned as manager and bench coach Pete Mackanin was brought in as interim manager. Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5–0 at Wrigley Field, on July 25, striking out 13 and only giving up two walks, on August 30 of that season.[59] It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972.[60] Hamels was dealt to the Texas Rangers, six days later.[61][62] The following month would also see the departure of Chase Utley who was traded to the Dodgers. In September general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. was fired and Andy MacPhail was brought in as the interim GM.[63] The team once again finished last in the NL East with a record of 63-99. McPhail would be officially named President of Baseball Operations of the organization during the off season.[64] The team then hired Matt Klentak as the new GM.

in 2016 the team finished fourth in the NL East, only winning eight more games than they had the previous year, with a 71-91 record. The 2016 season would also be the last for both Ryan Howard and Carlos Ruiz in a Phillies uniform. Ruiz was traded to the Dodgers in late August, reuniting him with Chase Utley, and the team decided to not exercise their club option on Howard, thus making him a free agent.

On September 29, 2017, Pete Mackannin was fired as manager of the Phillies. With only 3 games left, Mackannin would go on to finish managing the team until October 1, 2017.

On October 30, 2017, the Phillies announced Gabe Kapler as their new manager to succeed Mackanin. From November 2014 to the date he was hired as Phillies manager, Kapler was the Director of Player Development for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Bryce_Harper_(33639746228)_(cropped).jpg was signed by the team in 2019.|266x266px]] During the 2018 offseason, the Phillies added a number of all-star players to the team in hopes of bringing a championship back to Philadelphia. The Phillies signed all star outfielder Bryce Harper to a 13-year, $330 million deal. The team also added Jean Segura, Andrew McCutchen, David Robertson and J. T. Realmuto.


Team uniform

    _See footnotes_[65][66]

Current uniform

The current team colors, uniform, and logo date to 1992. The main team colors are red and white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the "i"s, and blue piping is often found in Phillies branded apparel and materials. The team's home uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered "Phillies" logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the "i"s across the chest, and the player name and number on the back. The uniform's front script has undergone minor changes over the years.[67] Hats are red with a single stylized "P".[68] The uniforms and logo are very similar to those used during the "Whiz Kids" era from 1950 to 1969.

The Phillies and their National League compadres the St. Louis Cardinals are the only teams in Major League baseball to utilize chain stitching in their chest emblem.

In 2008, the Phillies introduced an alternate, cream-colored uniform during home day games in tribute to their 125th anniversary. The uniforms are similar to those worn from 1946 through 1949, featuring red lettering bordered with blue piping and lacking pinstripes.[69] The accompanying cap is blue with a red bill and a red stylized "P." The uniforms were announced on November 29, 2007, when Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, pitcher Cole Hamels, and Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts modeled the new uniforms.[70]

For the 2009 season the Phillies added black, circular "HK" patches to their uniforms over their hearts in honor of broadcaster Harry Kalas, who died April 13, 2009, just before he was to broadcast a Phillies game. From Opening Day through July 26, 2009, the Phillies wore 2008 World Champions patches on the right sleeve of their home uniforms. After the death of Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts on May 6 2010, the Phillies added a black patch with a white "36" on the sleeves of their jerseys in memory of Roberts for the remainder of the 2010 season. No. 36 had been previously retired by the team in 1962 to honor Roberts. For the 2011 season, the Phillies added a black circular patch with a "B" in honor of minority owners Alexander and John Buck, who died in late 2010. For the 2015 season, the Phillies added a black circular patch with a white "SLB" in memory of minority owner Sara L. Buck, who died on August 23, 2014. Following the death of former chairman, minority-owner, and president David Montgomery on May 8, 2019, the Phillies added a black circular patch with white "DPM" letters in memory of Montgomery for the remainder of the 2019 season.

In 2016, the Phillies added a red alternate uniform, similar to their spring training uniforms, to be used for mid-week afternoon games. It was unofficially retired following the 2017 season, after which the Phillies revived their powder blue throwbacks as an alternate uniform to be used on select Thursday home games.

The Phillies are one of four teams in Major League Baseball that do not display the name of their city, state, or region on their road jerseys, joining the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, St. Louis Cardinals, and the Tampa Bay Rays. The Phillies are the only team that also displays the player's number on one sleeve except on the alternate jersey, in addition to the usual placement on the back of the jersey.

Batting practice

The Phillies were an early adopter of the batting practice jersey in 1977, wearing a maroon v-necked top with the "Phillies" script name across the chest, as well as the player name and number on the back and a player number on the left sleeve, all in white. Larry Bowa, Pete Rose, and Mike Schmidt wore this maroon batting jersey in place of their road jersey during the 1979 All-Star Game in Seattle. Currently, during spring training, the Phillies wear solid red practice jerseys with pinstriped pants for Grapefruit League home games. The red jerseys are worn with grey pants on the road.

Former uniforms

From 1970 to 1991, the Phillies sported colors, uniforms, and a logo that were noticeably different from what had come before, or since, but that were widely embraced by even traditionally minded fans. A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies "P" that, thanks to its unique shape and "baseball stitched" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983.[71] Its continued popularity with fans is still evident, as even today Phillies home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic "P" and burgundy color scheme. The current Phillies team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era.

Controversial uniform changes

In 1979, the Phillies front office modified the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, to be worn for Saturday games.[72] They were called "Saturday Night Specials" and were worn for the first and last time on May 19, 1979,[73] a 10–5 loss to the Expos.[74] The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. As such, the idea was hastily abandoned.[75] Mike Schmidt did wear the uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. The final appearance on field (to date) of this uniform was during the closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003. There was a rather large procession of players during the post game ceremony, most in uniform. Former pitcher Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the original game, came out wearing this old burgundy uniform, and was the only one to do so.

Another uniform controversy arose in 1994 when the Phillies introduced blue caps on Opening Day which were to be worn for home day games only.[76] The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well among fans. A compromise was reached as the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games.[77] In all, the Phillies wore the "unlucky" blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5–2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29).[78] A different blue cap was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.


Rivalries

New York Mets

The rivalry between the New York Mets and the Phillies was said to be among the "hottest" rivalries in the National League.[79][80] The two National League East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and wild card races.

Philadelphia_Phillies_versus_New_York_Mets_at_Citizens_Bank_Park_9-29-17.jpg Aside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season,[81] as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011.[82] The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with seventeen games remaining.

Atlanta Braves

Although the rivalry lacks the hatred of the Mets, it has been the more important one in the last decade. Since the realignment of the divisions, the Phillies and Braves have been the most consistent champions of the National League East. While rivalries are generally characterized by mutual hatred, the Braves and Phillies deeply respect each other. Each game played (18 games in 2011) is vastly important between these two NL East giants, but at the end of the day, they are very similar organizations.[83] Overall, the Braves and the Phillies have the most National League East division titles, with the Braves having won 12 times, and the Phillies having won 11 times each since 1969, with the Braves holding it for eleven consecutive years from 1995 through 2005.

Pittsburgh Pirates

The rivalry between the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League.[84][85][86] The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered National League play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.[87]

The Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969 to 1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s,[88][89] the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[90]

After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[91] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.[92] The rivalry between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League is also fiercely contested.[93][94]

Historical rivalries

City Series: Philadelphia Athletics

The City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at O.Co Coliseum, the Athletics didn't bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.[95]

The first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American Association's Athletics.[96] When the Athletics first joined the American League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the National and American Leagues.

Team records


Achievements

Awards

Five Phillies have won MVP awards during their career with the team. Mike Schmidt leads with three wins, with back-to-back MVPs in 1980 and 1981, and in 1986 as well. Chuck Klein (1932), Jim Konstanty (1950), Ryan Howard (2006), and Jimmy Rollins (2007) all have one.[97] Pitcher Steve Carlton leads the team in Cy Young Award wins with four (1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982), while John Denny (1983), Steve Bedrosian (1987), and Roy Halladay (2010) each have one.[98] Four Phillies have won Rookie of the Year honors as well. Jack Sanford won in 1957, and Dick Allen won in 1964. Third baseman Scott Rolen brought home the honors in 1997, while Howard was the most recent Phillies winner in 2005.[99] In doing so, Howard became only the second player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in consecutive years, Cal Ripken, Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles being the first.[100]

Of the 15 players who have hit four home runs in one game, three were Phillies at the time (more than any other team).[101] Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting his four in Chicago's West Side Park on July 13, 1896. Chuck Klein repeated the feat nearly 40 years later to the day, on July 10, 1936, at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. Forty years later, on April 17, 1976, Mike Schmidt became the third, also hitting his in Chicago, these coming at Wrigley Field.

Wall of Fame

Tugger45.JPG From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one former Phillie and one former member of the Philadelphia Athletics per year. Since 2004 they have inducted one Phillie annually. Players must be retired and must have played at least four years with the Phillies or Athletics. The last ten years' inductees to the Wall of Fame are listed below (note that there was no inductee for the 2017 season, as Pete Rose was intended to be inducted, but was not due to controversial allegations):

The Wall of Fame was located in Ashburn Alley at Citizens Bank Park from 2004 to 2017, until the 2018 season when it was relocated to a more spacious location behind the left field scoreboard. ConnieMackIn1938.jpg, legendary Philadelphia A's manager and owner, 1978 Wall of Fame inductee]]

Retired numbers and other honors

The Phillies have retired six numbers, and honored two additional players with the letter "P."[103] Grover Cleveland Alexander played with the team in the era before Major League Baseball used uniform numbers, and Chuck Klein wore a variety of numbers with the team during his career. Of the six players with retired numbers, five were retired for their play with the Phillies and one, 42, was universally retired by Major League Baseball when they honored the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier. 34, once worn by pitcher Roy Halladay, was confirmed to be in the process of being retired upon the signing of Bryce Harper, who chose to wear the number 3 out of respect to Halladay.

Manuel and Dallas Green are the only Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980 against the Kansas City Royals; and Manuel in 2008 against the Tampa Bay Rays.[106] Charlie Manuel is the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, with 1,416 games of service in parts of nine seasons (2005–2013).[107] The records and accomplishments of Phillies' managers since 1991 are shown below.

Radio and television

Phillies-Parade_Harry-K_crop.jpg]]

As of 2018, the Phillies' flagship radio stations is WIP-FM (94.1 FM), formerly owned by CBS Radio but since November 2017, owned by Philadelphia-area company Entercom. The broadcasts were discontinued on the former AM flagship station WPHT 1210 in 2016.[108] Scott Franzke and Jim Jackson provide play-by-play on the radio, with Larry Andersen and Kevin Frandsen as color commentators. Meanwhile, NBCUniversal (a unit of Philadelphia-based Comcast) handles local television broadcasts through its properties NBC Sports Philadelphia and WCAU (NBC10). Tom McCarthy calls play-by-play for the television broadcasts, with Ben Davis, Mike Schmidt, Jimmy Rollins[109] and John Kruk providing color commentary and Gregg Murphy providing field reports and occasional play-by-play.

Spanish language broadcasts are on WTTM (1680 AM)[110] with Danny Martinez on play-by-play, and Bill Kulik and Rickie Ricardo on color commentary.

Other popular Phillies broadcasters through the years include By Saam (1939–1975), Bill Campbell (1962–1970), Richie Ashburn (1963–1997), and Harry Kalas (1971–2009).[111] Kalas, a 2002 recipient of the Ford Frick Award and an icon in the Philadelphia area, called play-by-play in the first three and last three innings on television and the fourth inning on the radio until his death on April 13, 2009.

At Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named "Harry the K's" in Kalas's honor. After Kalas's death, the Phillies' TV-broadcast booth was renamed "The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth". It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named "The Richie 'Whitey' Ashburn Broadcast Booth". When the Phillies win at home, Kalas' rendition of the song "High Hopes", which he would sing when the Phillies had clinched a playoff berth or advanced in the playoffs, is played as fans file out of the stadium. In addition, when a Phillies player hits a home run a recording of Kalas' famous "That ball is outta here!" home run call is played. The sole exception is Chase Utley, once the subject of another famous Kalas call, "Chase Utley, you are The Man!", which is played when Utley hits a homer.

In 2011, the Phillies unveiled a statue of Harry Kalas at Citizens Bank Park. The statue was funded by Phillies fans and designed and constructed by a Phillies fan.

The Phillies' public-address (PA) announcer is Dan Baker, who started in the 1972 season.[112][113]

In 2011, the Phillies spent $10 million to upgrade the video system at Citizens Bank Park, including a new display screen in left field, the largest in the National League.[114][115]


Community

Charitable contributions

The Phillies have supported amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) with the "Phillies Phestival" since 1984.[116] The team raised over US$750,000 for ALS research at their 2008 festival, compared with approximately $4,500 at the inaugural event in 1984;[117] the event has raised a total of over $10 million in its history.[118] The ALS Association of Philadelphia is the Phillies' primary charity,[119] and the hospitals they support include Pennsylvania Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and Hahnemann University Hospital.[120] Former Phillies pitchers Geoff Geary, who lost a friend to the disease,[121] and Curt Schilling, who retired with the Boston Red Sox,[122] are both still involved with the Phillies' cause.

PHANATIC ABOUT EDUCATION

The Philadelphia Phillies have shown themselves to be a big supporter of reading and overall education, using baseball in a positive way to help support education for students. The Phillies have a reading incentive program called Phanatic About Reading, which is designed to encourage students from kindergarten to eighth grade to read for a minimum of 15 minutes a night. This reading program is to help students with their literacy skills and comprehension. Phillies Phundamentals is another educational program, offered through after-school and summer camps, that is designed to make learning fun and support academic skills by using baseball.

The Phillies celebrate teachers during their annual Teacher Appreciation Night.[123]

Fan support and reputation

"Full_House_at_Citizens_Bank_Park".jpg, May 2, 2009 at Citizens Bank Park|link=File:%22Full_House_at_Citizens_Bank_Park%22.jpg]]

    _See footnote_[124]

Phillies fans have earned a reputation over the years for their occasional unruly behavior. In the 1960s, radio announcers for visiting teams would frequently report on the numerous fights breaking out in Connie Mack Stadium.[125] Immediately after the final game at the old park, many fans ran onto the field or dislodged parts of the ballpark to take home with them.[126] Later, at Veterans Stadium, the 700 Level gained a reputation for its "hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness."[127] Phillies fans famously are known for their reputation of being the "Meanest Fans in America".[128]

Phillies fans are known for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year Richie Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. The fans, however, are just as well known for heckling the visiting team. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton's poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS[129] has often been attributed to the crowd's taunting.[130] J. D. Drew, the Phillies' first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997, never signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team, instead re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.[131] Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris, including two D batteries, at Drew during an August 1999 game.[132] Subsequent visits by Drew to Philadelphia continue to be met with sustained booing from the Phillies fans.

Vet_Homeplatemarker.jpg, the Phillies' home from 1971 to 2003.]] Many sportswriters have noted the passionate presence of Phillies fans. Allen Barra wrote that the biggest roar he ever heard from Philadelphia fans was in 1980 when Tug McGraw, in the victory parade after the World Series, told New York fans they could "take this championship and shove it."[133]

When the Phillies moved to Veteran's Stadium, they hired a group of young ladies to serve as ushers. These women wore maroon-colored outfits featuring hot pants and were called the Hot Pants Patrol.[134] The team also introduced a pair of mascots attired in colonial garb, named Philadelphia Phil and Phyllis. In addition to costumed characters, animated Phil and Phyllis figures mounted on the center field facade would "hit" the Liberty Bell after a Phillie home run. This pair of mascots never achieved any significant level of popularity with fans and were eventually discontinued.[135] In 1978, the team introduced a new mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, who has been called "baseball's best mascot", which has been much more successful and has become closely associated with the marketing of the team.[136]

In Phillies fan culture, it is also not unusual to replace an "f" with a "ph" in words, such as the Phillie Phanatic.[137]

The club surpassed 100 consecutive sellouts on August 19, 2010, selling out over 50% of their home games and averaging an annual attendance of over 3.1 million fans since moving to Citizens Bank Park;[138] on April 3, 2011, the team broke the three-game series attendance record at the ballpark, having 136,254 fans attend the opening weekend against the Houston Astros.[139]

In 2011 and 2012, the Phillies led the league in attendance with 3,680,718 and 3,565,718 fans, respectively, coming out to watch Phillies baseball.[140][141][142][143][144]

French Quarter at Citizens Bank Park

The former Veterans Stadium featured separate fan sections for each of the team's players, making the Phillies a pioneer in that effort to encourage the team's fans who were coming to the home games there to cheer the players on.

Effective September 2, 2018, the Phillies became the first ever NL team and 3rd team overall in the MLB (2nd in the East Coast) to have a separate fans cheering section for the first time in years, when the team management set apart Sections 108 and 109 of Citizens Bank Park as a cheer section for rising pitcher Aaron Nola, named after the district of the same name in Philadelphia, but honors his Louisiana heritage.[145][146] Fans having tickets to this section wear violet shirts with Mardi Gras style beads and are served with the best jambalaya featuring shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage and hurricane cocktails at the Section 109 concession stand.

Footnotes

Article

-   In 1981, a mid-season players' strike split the season. Philadelphia, with the best record in the East Division when play was halted, was declared the first-half division winner. They would, however, lose to the second half-winning Montréal Expos in the NLDS, losing the overall division title. The Phillies' record over the entire season was third-best in the division, 2½ games behind St. Louis and Montréal.

-   The Phillies are the only National League team with two perfect games. Four American League teams have accomplished the feat: New York Yankees (3), Chicago White Sox (2), Cleveland Indians (2), and Oakland Athletics (2).

Retired numbers

-   Grover Cleveland Alexander played in the era before Major League players wore numbers; the Phillies have honored him with the "P" logo from the 1915 season, their first World Series appearance.[147]

-   Chuck Klein wore many numbers while with the Phillies, including 1, 3, 8, 26, 29, and 36. The Phillies wore the Old English "P" during his first six seasons; thus, they chose to use it to honor Klein.[148]

Season records

-   The Finish column lists regular season results and excludes postseason play.

-   The Wins and Losses columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.

-   The GB column lists "Games Back" from the team that finished in first place that season. It is determined by finding the difference in wins plus the difference in losses divided by two.

Team managers

-   #: running total of the number of Phillies' managers. Thus, any manager who has two or more separate terms is only counted once.

-   #49: Larry Bowa won the Manager of the Year Award in 2001.[149]
