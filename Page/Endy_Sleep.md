ENDY SLEEP (also known as just Endy) is a Canadian-based, e-commerce company that sells sleep products online.[1][2] Endy primarily operates as an online storefront, with their main headquarters in Toronto.[3][4] Endy is Canada's largest direct online-only mattress store.[5]

In November 2018, Endy Sleep was acquired by Sleep Country Canada and will continue to operate as an independent subsidiary.[6]


History

Endy was founded in 2015 by CEO Mike Gettis and Chairman Rajen Ruparell (previously of Groupon International).[7][8][9][10] In its start up year, Endy made $1 million in sales, $10 million in 2016, and $20 million in 2017.[11] In June of 2016, Endy received the Techweek100 Top Innovators Award.[12]

In 2017, Endy appeared on CBC Dragons' Den.[13] Dragons Michele Romanow, Arlene Dickinson, and Joe Mimran jointly offered a $1 million investment in exchange for 7.5% of the company.[14]

In August 2018, Endy opened a new distribution centre in Langley, British Columbia. The company also operates a distribution centre in Mississauga, Ontario.[15]

In 2018, Dominican baseball player José Bautista, formerly of the Toronto Blue Jays, became an investor for Endy after meeting with Gettis and Ruparell earlier in 2016.[16]

On November 29, 2018, Endy Sleep announced it would be acquired by Sleep Country Canada for $89 million CAD. [17]


Products

Endy mattresses are fully manufactured in Canada and are made with three layers of foam. The top layer is made with Endy’s Comfort Foam which incorporates open air cell technology to increase breathability, comfort and cooling.[18] The middle (medium/transition) and base (support) layers are designed to support the spine and eliminate pressure points.[19] Endy’s foam mattress is CertiPUR-US certified.[20]

Endy mattresses come in six standard sizes.[21] Each mattress is sold with a 100 Night Trial period and a 10-year warranty. Returned mattresses are donated or recycled where possible.[22][23]

The next product launched by Endy was an adjustable memory foam pillow. The three-layer pillow incorporates a 100% cotton and machine washable cover with hypoallergenic microfiber fill, and an inner core filled with shredded bamboo charcoal memory foam.[24]

The bedding set includes a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and two standard pillowcases. They are 100% sateen weave, long staple cotton and have a certified 480 thread count.[25]

The Endy mattress protector is the company’s newest addition.[26]

Endy mattresses and products are in showrooms across Canada including the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.[27]
