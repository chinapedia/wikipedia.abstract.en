History

Suedbremse_1924.JPG building, 1924]] Lerchenauerstr53_Muenchen-01.jpg]] 1800 was the 1764 first _Schwaige_ named _St. Georgenschwaige_ (1568 St. Georgen, 1620 at St. Georgen) sold to four Upper Palatinate settlers. On the property which was uncovered after the destruction, the settlement with the name _Riesenfeld_, which today is known as _altes Riesenfeld_ (old giant field), was built at the curve of the _Nymphenburg-Biedersteiner Kanal_ at the today's corner Petuelring / Belgradstraße. This area was in 1818, part of the then community Schwabing and was together incorporated into Munich in November 1890.[9]

The today's area Am Riesenfeld was named _Risenfeld_ for the first time on 8 January 1800. It goes back to the couple Andrä von Riß, _Hofkammerrat_ (Council of the Court Chamber) in Freising and Theresia, which on 12 June 1796 bought the bleacher based on a Dutch (English) system, operated since 1790 at the canal curve, from the brothers Franz Xaver and Joseph Lunglmayr. Andrä von Riß died already in 1798. His widow and the children then again sold the possession called _izt Risenfeld_, on 8 January 1800. The Restoration _Bad Georgenschwaige_ was later set up in the former bleach house.[10]

North of the channel was later a new settlement Riesenfeld, but which was on Milbertshofener area and was incorporated with Milbertshofen in 1913.[11] In 1941, the above ground bunkers Lerchenauer Straße and _Anhalter Platz_ were built.[12] Before the site in the period from 1966 to 1972 was completely redesigned due to the games of XX. Olympia 1972, it was called Oberwiesenfeld and housed only a large airfield in addition to its use as a military site, on which the first commercial airport of Munich was located from 1929 to 1939 and the aircraft engines manufactured in the neighboring factory of BMW were tested until 1945 and from 1957 to 1968 the general aviation harbored. The area south of today's Georg-Brauchle-Ring, which is characterized by the sports venues, the _Olympia-Parkharfe_ and the large _Olympiaberg_, belonged to the district Neuhausen-Oberwiesenfeld until 1992 and came part of the district Am Riesenfeld during the redivision of the dirstricts in 1996.
