In all, four different titles were contested: men's and women's individual and team championships.[1][2]

Held on November 25, 2002, the combined meet was hosted by Indiana State University at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Indiana. The distance for the men's race was 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) while the distance for the women's race was 6 kilometers (3.73 miles).

The men's team championship was won by Stanford (90 points), the Cardinal's third. The women's team championship was won by BYU (85 points), the Cougars' second consecutive, fourth overall, and fourth in six years.

The two individual champions were, for the men, Jorge Torres (Colorado, 29:04.7) and, for the women, Shalane Flanagan (North Carolina, 19:36.0).[3][4]
