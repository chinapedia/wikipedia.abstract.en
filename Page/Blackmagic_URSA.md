The BLACKMAGIC URSA is a digital movie camera developed and manufactured by Blackmagic Design, released on August 8, 2014. It is the first camera to be user-upgradeable for additional equipment manufactured by Blackmagic and other third-party makers.


History

At the NAB Show in April 2014, Blackmagic Design announced the URSA digital movie camera, which was the first movie camera to be user-upgradeable for additional equipment, alongside the Studio Camera, the television-oriented version of the Cinema Camera.[1] In November, a firmware update maxed the frame rate to 80p and added a new 3:1 compression ratio for RAW files.[2]

In April 2015, the URSA Mini was announced and all URSA models and variants received another update that upgraded the maximum frame rate for the windowed 1080p resolution to 150 fps and added support for Apple ProRes 444 XQ and updated the models with a second-generation sensor.[3][4] A B4 lens mount was added to the Mini in September.[5] The 4.6K version of the Mini was then released in March 2016, controversially without global shutter.[6] In August, a public beta of the redesigned Camera Utility 4.0 for URSA Mini was released.[7]

Specifications and hardware

The camera can come in both 4K and 4.6K specifications, with max resolutions being 4608 x 2592 for the 4.6K spec and 4000 x 2160 for the 4K. All models and variants include DaVince Resolve. The camera comprises two displays; the main 10.1" flip-out TFT-LCD display that is controlled using physical buttons and a 5" LCD capacitive touchscreen that can show recording status and can be used to access features by another operator. The camera records lossless CinemaDNG RAW, RAW 3:1 and 4:1 and Apple ProRes.[8]

Software

The URSA uses Camera Utility, the proprietary software developed by Blackmagic also in use for the Cinema Cameras. The software allows the user to add metadata about a single file, including - but not limited to: shot, take and scene numbers, as well as filenames. However, the system must be updated through a computer using USB instead of other technologies like firmware over the air.


Models and variants

The URSA is available in four different models: EF, PL, HDMI and BROADCAST. The EF and PL mounts are interchangeable and can work with any compatible lenses. However, the HDMI model doesn't have a lens system at all and a separate camera must be connected to the camera via HDMI to record. It has a threaded camera mount to mount a camera onto the URSA.[9] The Broadcast model uses an optimized sensor for broadcasting in Ultra HD, as well as a specialized B4 lens mount and a neutral-density filter wheel on the body.[10]

URSA Mini

The BLACKMAGIC URSA MINI is a variant of the URSA camera. The 4.6k variant was released on March 17, 2016.[11] It has a smaller form factor and loses some functionality and features over the URSA, losing the secondary 5" touchscreen, global shutter on the 4.6k variant and other features. However, it does ship in 4K and 4.6K specifications, and ships in EF and PL mounts.

URSA Mini Pro

The BLACKMAGIC URSA MINI PRO, the most recent variant of the URSA camera, was released on March 2, 2017.[12] Compared to the URSA Mini, it adds an internal neutral density wheel, shoulder-accessible controls, and a secondary 4" touchscreen, and ships only in a 4.6K specification. Its most unique feature is a user-interchangeable lens mount. The camera ships with an EF mount, and at release time, PL and B4 mount modules were available for purchase.

URSA Mini 4.6K Pro G2

The BLACKMAGIC URSA MINI PRO, the most recent variant of the URSA camera, was announced in March 2019. URSA Mini Pro 4.6K G2, is a professional digital film camera that combines 4.6K resolution with the traditional features and controls broadcast camera. The second generation URSA Mini Pro features fully redesigned internal electronics and a Super 35mm 4.6K HDR image sensor for much higher frame rate shooting. The camera also features built-in neutral density filters, an interchangeable lens mount, Blackmagic RAW support, and both dual CFast and SD UHS‑II card recorders. It can record video up to 300 frames per second. The Pro version also has a USB‑C expansion port that allows users to record directly to flash drives or SSD disks.

URSA Broadcast

The BLACKMAGIC URSA BROADCAST, the most recent variant of the URSA camera, was released on February 1, 2018.[13] While not an URSA "Mini", the Broadcast uses the same platform as the URSA Mini Pro. The camera features a 4K sensor, 2/3" style B4 lens mount, traditional external controls (like on the Mini Pro), built in optical ND filters, and dual CFast and dual SD card recorders. While the Broadcast ships with a B4 sensor, the camera is compatible with EF, PL and F mounts, sold separately by Blackmagic.
