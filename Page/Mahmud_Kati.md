AL HAJJ MAHMUD KATI (or MAHMOUD KATI) (1468? - 1552 or 1593) was an African Muslim scholar. He is traditionally held to be the author of the West African chronicle _Tarikh al-fattash_, though the authorship is contested.[1]

Kati grew up in Kurmina but lived most of his adult life in Timbuktu. His tomb is the second largest in Timbuktu, after that of Mohammed Bagayogo, and is a site of pilgrimage.[2]
