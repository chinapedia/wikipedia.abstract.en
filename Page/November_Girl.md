_NOVEMBER GIRL_ is an album by vocalist Carmen McRae and the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band recorded in London in 1970 and originally released on the Black Lion label in 1975.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden stated "The Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band didn't record too often with vocalists, so this meeting with Carmen McRae had a lot of potential. McRae was likely seeing most of these songs for the first take at the recording sessions, since almost all are originals written by the bandmembers. She's game and does her best, but several tracks are badly dated by Boland's insistence upon using an inferior electric piano, whereas no piano at all on these performances would have sounded far better. ...This is a good session that could have been far better without the cheesy electronics".[4]
