A RETRONYM is a newer name for an existing thing that differentiates the original form or version from a more recent one. It is thus a word or phrase created to differentiate between two types, whereas previously (before there were two types) no clarification was required.[1][2]

Advances in technology are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms. For example, the term "acoustic guitar" was coined at the advent of electric guitars[3] and analog watches were thus renamed to distinguish them from digital watches once the latter were invented.[4]


Examples

Trucks_and_cars_in_Popular_Mechanics_1914_v22_n5_p699.png'' in 1914 was written when the word _truck_ did not necessarily connote a motor truck and the word _car_ did not necessarily connote a motor car. The same topics today would most likely be talked about with the terms _hand trucks_ and _railroad cars_. Those terms existed in 1914 as well, but they were not required for clarity, as they would be today.]]

The first bicycles with two wheels of equal size were called "safety bicycles" because they were easier to handle than the then-dominant style that had one large wheel and one small wheel, which then became known as an "ordinary" bicycle.[5] Since the end of the 19th century, most bicycles have been expected to have two equal sized wheels, and the other type has been renamed "penny-farthing" or "high-wheeler" bicycle.[6]

The Atari Video Computer System platform was rebranded the "Atari 2600" (after its product code, CX-2600) in 1982 following the launch of its successor, the Atari 5200, and all hardware and software related to the platform were released under this new branding from that point on.

The original Game Boy was referred to as "Game Boy Classic" after the release of Game Boy Color. Another gaming example is the original Xbox being referred to as the Xbox 1 prior to the release of the Xbox One, similarly today it is commonly referred to as the "original Xbox".


Word history

The term _retronym_, a neologism composed of the combining forms _retro-_ + _-nym_, was coined by Frank Mankiewicz in 1980 and popularized by William Safire in _The New York Times Magazine_.[7][8][9]

In 2000 _The American Heritage Dictionary_ (4th edition) became the first major dictionary to include the word _retronym_.[10]
