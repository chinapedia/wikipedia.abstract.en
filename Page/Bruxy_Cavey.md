He is also the author of _The End of Religion_ and "(re)union".

Early life

Frederick Taylor Cavey (July 12, 1924) married Lois G. Mulligan (July 12, 1924), the couple had four children. Beverley born 1949. Stephen who was born 1952 but died at age 12 from cancer, Cathryn born 1956, and Timothy Bruce in Montreal, 1965. After his family moved to Scarborough, he was enrolled in People's Church Christian Academy. In the 1980s, Cavey participated in street evangelism. Preaching, acting out a skit, break dancing and performing art. Cavey started his own performing group, "4 Crying Out Loud!" with similar style to his street evangelism days.[2] During that time Bruxy was also pastoring Upper Oaks Community Church, which is now called The Meeting House.[3]


Education and work experience

Cavey attended York University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. At Ontario Theological Seminary, now Tyndale University College and Seminary, he obtained a master's degree in theological studies. After seminary he worked for World Vision as a speaker, promoting and fundraising for the organization. In 1991, Cavey became the pastor of Heritage Fellowship Baptist Church in Ancaster after he had spoken there while promoting World Vision.[4] The church grew from under 200 to over 1100 attendees during his tenure.


The Meeting House

In 1997, Cavey became the senior pastor at Upper Oaks Community Church. The church grew over 35% annually and hired more pastoral staff, so Cavey transitioned into a teaching pastor role.[5] During that time the church's name was changed to The Meeting House to reflect the denomination's anabaptist roots. By 2002, The Meeting House was overcrowded, and they had to set up an overflow area with a screen. Church members who traveled from neighbouring cities requested support to watch the service on a screen in their home town. A plan was set in motion to create The Meeting House's first regional site in Hamilton, Ontario. The Meeting House now has 19 regional sites throughout Ontario, each with their own staff and live music, showing Cavey's sermon from the week before at the main site in Oakville.[6] Cavey and the Meeting House have a broad international following through Cavey's Twitter, blog, and the church's free sermon resources including podcasts and downloadable videos of sermons and content.
