GEVOLT is an Israeli metal band, founded in 2001. The band is known as the pioneers of Yiddish metal. They were the first band who combined traditional Yiddish music with metal.[1]


History

The band was formed in Israel in 2001 by Anatholy Bonder (vocals), Yevgeny Kushnir (guitars), Oleg Szumski (drums) and Max Mann (bass guitars). In 2005 Marina Klionski (violins) joined.

In 2006, Gevolt self-released their debut full-length album _Sidur_ in Russian language. After the release Oleg Szumski left the band and was replaced by Vadim Weinstein, and Dmitry Lifshitz (synths) joined the band.

Gevolt started recording of their second album in 2005, and released the 2-track promo single "Yiddish Metal" in 2007. In this single the band changed their concept and started singing in Yiddish, covering classic Yiddish songs.

In 2008 _Sidur_ had a US/Canadian re-release by Renaissance Records/Koch Entertainment Distribution. At the same time Marina Klionski left the band and Gevolt had two violinists, Anna Agre and Eva Yefremov. Anna Agre left the band after a year.
