The 2010 AFC U-16 Championship was an international under-16 age group football tournament held in Uzbekistan from 24 October until 7 November 2010. The sixteen national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of maximum 23 players; only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.

The age listed for each player is on 24 October 2010, the first day of the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated. A flag is included for coaches that are of a different nationality than their own national team. Players in BOLDFACE have been capped at full international level at some point in their career.
