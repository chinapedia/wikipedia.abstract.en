The NATO G BAND is the obsolete designation given to the radio frequencies from 4 000 to 6 000 MHz (equivalent to wavelengths between 7.5 and 5Â cm) during the cold war period. Since 1992 frequency allocations, allotment and assignments are in line to NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).[1] However, in order to identify military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for crises management planning, training, Electronic warfare activities, or in military operations, this system is still in use.
