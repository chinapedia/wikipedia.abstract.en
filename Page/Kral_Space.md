_KRAL SPACE_ is an album by vocalist Irene Kral recorded in 1977 for the Catalyst label.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "Kral is heard throughout at the peak of her powers on this haunting session ... Her basic but heartfelt style and her ability to swing at the slowest tempos make Irene Kral one of jazz's great ballad singers".[4] On All About Jazz Mathew Bahl said "Always impeccably in tune, Irene Kral had a dry, resonant alto which she deployed to devastating effect. Her art was in her phrasing, which was aided by perfect diction and marked by her tendency to elongate her vowels. She could swing with the best of them, but no matter how fast the tempo, the lyrics always remained intact and their meaning driven home. Yet, it is the quiet intensity of her ballads that lingers most in the mind ... All of Irene Kral’s talents are wonderfully displayed on _Kral Space_ and the music is recommended without hesitation"[5]
