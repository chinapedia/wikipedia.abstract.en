_SURF RIDE_ is an album by saxophonist Art Pepper featuring sessions from 1952-54 which was originally released as a 12 inch LP on the Savoy label in 1956.[1][2]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow observed: "The music on this Savoy LP is quite brilliant, but the packaging leaves something to be desired ... The somewhat random nature of this set is unfortunate, for Pepper is in superior form throughout".[3]
