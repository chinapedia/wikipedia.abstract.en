WILLIAM "BILL" G. KAELIN JR. (born 1957 in New York City) is a professor of medicine at Harvard University. Kaelin is a 2016 recipient of the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. He also has won the 2016 ASCO Science of Oncology Award, and 2016 AACR Princess Takamatsu Award.[1][2] His laboratory studies tumor suppressor proteins.

He became Assistant Director of Basic Science at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in 2008. His research at Dana-Farber has focused on understanding the role of mutations in tumor suppressor genes in cancer development. His major work has been on the retinoblastoma, von Hippel-Lindau, and p53 tumor suppressor genes.

His work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and others.[3]

Kaelin earned his bachelor's in math and chemistry at Duke University, and remained for his MD, graduating in 1982. He did his residency in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins and oncology fellowship at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. After deciding as an undergraduate that research was not a strength of his, at DFCI he did research in the lab of David Livingston, where he found success in the study of retinoblastoma.[4] In 1992, he set up his own lab at DFCI down the hall from Livingston's where he researched hereditary forms of cancer such as von Hippel-Lindau. He became a professor at Harvard Medical School in 2002.[5]

He is a member of the board of directors at Eli Lilly[6] and the Stand Up to Cancer scientific advisory committee.[7]

He was married to breast cancer surgeon Dr. Carolyn Kaelin (Scerbo) from 1988 until her death from cancer in 2015. They have two children.[8]
