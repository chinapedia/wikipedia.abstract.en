PUEBLO NUEVO is a Panama Metro station on Line 1. It was one of the first 11 stations when the metro began operations on 6 April 2014.[1] It is the second of six elevated stations when travelling towards the terminus of San Isidro.[2]

The station is located in the district of the same name, in one of the city's more important industrial zones.[3] It is the least used station on the network, carrying 1% of the network's passengers at peak times.[4] In June 2016, the station was used by 1,679 people per day on average, in contrast to the stations before and after it on the line, 12 de Octubre and San Miguelito, which were used by over 34,000 people daily.[5] Architect √Ålvaro Uribe justified the station's creation on the basis that it would encourage future development in the area.[6]
