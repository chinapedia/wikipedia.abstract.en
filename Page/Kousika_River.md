William Lambton surveyed of Indian land to determine the shape of the Earth. To honor him, one peak was named Lambton's Peak. The name Kousika River is derived from two sources. The first is that a sage called "Kousika Munivar" lived on the river's shore. The second is that king Kavanagan, who later became Kousikan, ruled this area. Kousika River is also called Vannathan Karai or Perumpallam.
