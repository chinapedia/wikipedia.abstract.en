HENRI BRÉGI (1888–1917) was a French pioneer aviator. He was the first person to fly an aeroplane in Argentina.


Argentinian flights

Brégi was invited by Jorge Newbery to come to Argentina to make the first flight in that country as part of the centenary celebrations of Argentine Independence.[1] On 6 February 1910, Brégi piloted the first aeroplane flight in Argentina. He had sailed on the steamship Parana from France, arriving on 8 Jan 1910. He brought with him two aeroplanes: both Voisin Biplanes, one with a ENV 60 hp engine and the other with a 50 hp air cooled rotary Gnôme (Octavie III).[2]
