_PONG_ is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created _Pong_ as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey; Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement. Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.

_Pong_ was the first commercially successful video game, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied its gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels which built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of _Pong_ exclusively through Sears retail stores. It also was a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. _Pong_ is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. due to its cultural impact.


Gameplay

Pong_Game_Test2.gif _Pong_ is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.[1][2][3]


Development and history

AlAlcorn-Cropped.jpg designed and built _Pong_ as a training exercise.]]

_Pong_ was the first game developed by Atari.[4][5] After producing _Computer Space_, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game.[6][7] Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games.[8] To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up exercise.[9][10] Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping.[11] In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college.[12] However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game.[13] In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game.[14][15] Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.[16]

Alcorn first examined Bushnell's schematics for _Computer Space_, but found them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed.[17] Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of the screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.[18]

Three months into development, Bushnell told Alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd.[19][20] Dabney wanted the game to "boo" and "hiss" when a player lost a round. Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with digital circuits. After inspecting the sync generator, he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the game's sound effects.[21][22] To construct the prototype, Alcorn purchased a $75 Hitachi black-and-white television set from a local store, placed it into a wooden cabinet, and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry. The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability.[23]

In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn installed the _Pong_ prototype at a local bar, _Andy Capp's Tavern_.[24][25][26][27] They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's owner and manager, Bill Gaddis;[28] Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis.[29] Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype on one of the tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and _Computer Space_. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate _Pong_ to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing;[30] he intended to use _Pong_ to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game.[31][32] A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.[33]

After hearing about the game's success, Bushnell decided there would be more profit for Atari to manufacture the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued.[34][35] Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer.[36] Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for _Pong_; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line.[37] The company announced _Pong_ on 29 November 1972.[38][39] Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities.[40] By 1973, they began shipping _Pong_ to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.[41]

Home version

The system began development under the codename _Darlene_, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.[44]

Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's vice-president of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell _Home Pong_, but were rejected. Retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers.[45] Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed the game with a representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a _Home Pong_ booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due to the fact that they did not know that they needed a private showing.[46][47]

While at the show, they met Quinn again, and, a few days later, set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order. In order to gain approval from the Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the Sears Tower and, despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75,000 units in time for the Christmas season; however, Quinn requested double the amount. Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000 units, he agreed.[48] Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by venture capitalist Don Valentine. Supervised by Jimm Tubb, the factory fulfilled the Sears order.[49] The first units manufactured were branded with Sears' "Tele-Games" name. Atari later released a version under its own brand in 1976.[50]

Lawsuit from Magnavox

Magnavox-Odyssey-Console-Set.jpg, invented by Ralph H. Baer, inspired _Pong_{{'}}s development.]] The success of _Pong_ attracted the attention of Ralph Baer, the inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey, and his employer, Sanders Associates. Sanders had an agreement with Magnavox to handle the Odyssey's sublicensing, which included dealing with infringement on its exclusive rights. However, Magnavox had not pursued legal action against Atari and numerous other companies that released _Pong_ clones.[51] Sanders continued to apply pressure, and in April 1974 Magnavox filed suit against Atari, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway and Chicago Dynamics.[52] Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Baer's patents and his concept of electronic ping-pong based on detailed records Sanders kept of the Odyssey's design process dating back to 1966. Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odyssey's table tennis game prior to releasing _Pong_.[53][54] In response to claims that he saw the Odyssey, Bushnell later stated that, "The fact is that I absolutely did see the Odyssey game and I didn't think it was very clever."[55]

After considering his options, Bushnell decided to settle with Magnavox out of court. Bushnell's lawyer felt they could win; however, he estimated legal costs of US$1.5 million, which would have exceeded Atari's funds. Magnavox offered Atari an agreement to become a licensee for US$700,000. Other companies producing "_Pong_ clones"—Atari's competitors—would have to pay royalties. In addition, Magnavox would obtain the rights to Atari products developed over the next year.[56][57] Magnavox continued to pursue legal action against the other companies, and proceedings began shortly after Atari's settlement in June 1976. The first case took place at the district court in Chicago, with Judge John Grady presiding.[58][59][60] To avoid Magnavox obtaining rights to its products, Atari decided to delay the release of its products for a year, and withheld information from Magnavox's attorneys during visits to Atari facilities.[61]


Impact and legacy

The _Pong_ arcade games manufactured by Atari were a great success. The prototype was well received by Andy Capp's Tavern patrons; people came to the bar solely to play the game.[62][63] Following its release, _Pong_ consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin-operated machines.[64] Bushnell estimated that the game earned US$35–40 per day, which he described as nothing he'd ever seen before in the coin-operated entertainment industry at the time.[65] The game's earning power resulted in an increase in the number of orders Atari received. This provided Atari with a steady source of income; the company sold the machines at three times the cost of production. By 1973, the company had filled 2,500 orders, and, at the end of 1974, sold more than 8,000 units.[66] The arcade cabinets have since become collector's items with the cocktail-table version being the rarest.[67] Soon after the game's successful testing at Andy Capp's Tavern, other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it. Similar games appeared on the market three months later, produced by companies like Ramtek and Nutting Associates.[68] Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the solid state technology used in the game. When the company did file for patents, complications delayed the process. As a result, the market consisted primarily of "_Pong_ clones"; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines.[69] Bushnell referred to the competitors as "Jackals" because he felt they had an unfair advantage. His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts.[70][71]

_Home Pong_ was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000 units were sold that holiday season.[72][73] The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award.[74] Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three _Pong_ variants and was also succeeded by newer models.[75] Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey.[76] The dedicated _Pong_ consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's _Pong_ consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare.[77] Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.[78]

Several publications consider _Pong_ the game that launched the video game industry as a lucrative enterprise.[79][80][81] Video game author David Ellis sees the game as the cornerstone of the video game industry's success, and called the arcade game "one of the most historically significant" titles.[82][83] Kent attributes the "arcade phenomenon" to _Pong_ and Atari's games that followed it, and considers the release of the home version the successful beginning of home video game consoles.[84][85] Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra referred to the game's release as the start of a new entertainment medium, and commented that its simple, intuitive gameplay made it a success.[86] In 1996 _Next Generation_ named it one of the "Top 100 Games of All Time", recounting that "_Next Generation_ staff ignor[ed] hundreds of thousands of dollars of 32-bit software to play _Pong_ for hours when the Genesis version was released."[87] _Entertainment Weekly_ named _Pong_ one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013.[88] Many of the companies that produced their own versions of _Pong_ eventually became well-known within the industry. Nintendo entered the video game market with clones of _Home Pong_. The revenue generated from them—each system sold over a million units—helped the company survive a difficult financial time, and spurred them to pursue video games further.[89] After seeing the success of _Pong_, Konami decided to break into the arcade game market and released its first title, _Maze_. Its moderate success drove the company to develop more titles.[90]

Bushnell felt that _Pong_ was especially significant in its role as a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play _Pong_ and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing _Pong_,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved."[91]

Sequels and remakes

Pong_iv.jpg Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original's release: _Pong Doubles_, _Super Pong_, _Ultra Pong_, _Quadrapong_, and _Pin-Pong_.[92] The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new gameplay elements; for example, _Pong Doubles_ allows four players to compete in pairs, while _Quadrapong_—also released by Kee Games as _Elimination_—has them compete against each other in a four way field.[93][94] Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of _Pong_ to entertain children in a Doctor's office. He initially titled it _Snoopy Pong_ and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy's doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to _Puppy Pong_ and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants.[95][96][97][98][99] In 1976, Atari released _Breakout_, a single-player variation of _Pong_ where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball.[100] Like _Pong_, _Breakout_ was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay, such as _Arkanoid_, _Alleyway_, and _Break 'Em All_.[101]

Atari remade the game on numerous platforms. In 1977, _Pong_ and several variants of the game were featured in _Video Olympics_, one of the original release titles for the Atari 2600. _Pong_ has also been included in several Atari compilations on platforms including the Sega Genesis, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and personal computer.[102][103][104][105][106] Through an agreement with Atari, Bally Gaming and Systems developed a slot machine version of the game.[107] The Atari published _TD Overdrive_ includes _Pong_ as an extra game which is played during the loading screen.[108][109] A 3D platform game with puzzle and shooter elements was reportedly in development by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar in September 1995 under the title _Pong 2000_, as part of their series of arcade game updates for the system and was set to have an original storyline for it,[110][111] but it was never released. In 1999, the game was remade for home computers and the PlayStation with 3D graphics and power-ups.[112][113] In 2012, Atari celebrated the 40th anniversary of _Pong_ by releasing _Pong World_.[114]

In popular culture

The game is featured in episodes of television series including _That '70s Show_,[115] _King of the Hill_[116] and _Saturday Night Live_.[117] In 2006, an American Express commercial featured Andy Roddick in a tennis match against the white, in-game paddle.[118] Other video games have also referenced and parodied _Pong_; for example _Neuromancer_ for the Commodore 64 and _Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts_ for the Xbox 360.[119][120] The concert event Video Games Live has performed audio from _Pong_ as part of a special retro "Classic Arcade Medley".[121] Frank Black's song "Whatever Happened to Pong?" on the album _Teenager of the Year_ references the game's elements.[122]

Dutch design studio Buro Vormkrijgers created a _Pong_-themed clock as a fun project within their offices. After the studio decided to manufacture it for retail, Atari took legal action in February 2006. The two companies eventually reached an agreement in which Buro Vormkrijgers could produce a limited number under license.[123] In 1999, French artist Pierre Huyghe created an installation titled "Atari Light", in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play _Pong_ on an illuminated ceiling. The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León in 2007.[124] The game was included in the London Barbican Art Gallery's 2002 Game On exhibition meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.[125]
