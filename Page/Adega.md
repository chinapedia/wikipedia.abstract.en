The chefs are their daughter Jessica Carreira, a patissier, and her fianc√© David Costa, who met while working at Eleven, a two Michelin star restaurant in Lisbon.[4][5] The restaurant serves traditional Portuguese food.

Michelin star

In October 2016 Adega was awarded a Michelin star,[6] the first for a restaurant in San Jose and the second for a Portuguese restaurant in the US;[7][8][9] Carreira, 23 years old, is also one of the youngest chefs to receive the award, and one of few women.[10]
