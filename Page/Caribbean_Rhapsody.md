_CARIBBEAN RHAPSODY_ is an album by saxophonist James Carter composed and orchestrated by Roberto Sierra which was released on the EmArcy label in 2011.[1]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Matt Collar says, "A bold, adventurous performer with a titanic facility on the saxophone, Carter is perfectly suited for performing with large ensembles, and the orchestrations here are gorgeously rendered landscapes for Carter to play against. In fact, composer Sierra purposely left certain cadenzas and other areas of the scores on _Caribbean Rhapsody_ open for Carter to improvise, and the results are nothing short of thrilling".[2] In _JazzTimes_ Bill Beuttler said, "It’s unusual, and remarkable, in that it’s a full-fledged orchestral work penned with Carter’s improvisational genius firmly in mind, and it manages to successfully blend rhythmic nods to Sierra’s native Puerto Rico".[3] On _All About Jazz_ C. Michael Bailey noted, "In a field populated by "good" and even "exceptional" recordings, it is nice to hear a _Caribbean Rhapsody_ that is truly outstanding".[4] _The Guardian_ critic John Fordham wrote, "It's a stylish success in a crossover territory often fraught with pitfalls".[5]
