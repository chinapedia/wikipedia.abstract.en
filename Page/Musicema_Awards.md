MUSICEMA AWARDS is an Iranian annual music awards ceremony based in Tehran, Iran.[1][2]

The ceremony was founded by the news and analytics website of Musicema, and is supported by the Music Office of the Ministry of Ershad. It has been taking place annually since 2013, held at the Roudaki Hall of Tehran.

Annually, the officially sanctioned musical activities of the country are examined in two stages—the jury's review and the popular choice[3]—and the winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette that is the symbol of the ceremony.[4]

Several music genres are considered at the ceremony, including pop music, rock music, Iranian classical and regional music, western classical music, fusion and experimental music, and world music.
