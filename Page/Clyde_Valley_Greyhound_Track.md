CLYDE VALLEY GREYHOUND TRACK was a greyhound racing track on Airbles Road, Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland.

The racecourse was situated between Airbles Road and Hamilton Road on the edge of Logans Plantation (now Strathclyde Country Park).[1] The sports ground opened to greyhound racing on 22 July 1932 and was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). Boxing events and Speedway also took place here at various times. The final meeting took place in December 1959.[2] It competed for many years with another independent track called the Parkneuk Sports Stadium on Milton Street.

The site became a bus depot which has since been demolished and is due to be replaced by a housing development.[3]
