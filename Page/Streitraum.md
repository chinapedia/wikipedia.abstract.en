__ (Conflict Room)[1] is a series of public panel discussions held at the Schaubühne in Berlin since January 2000.[2] Each season focuses on a different theme from the areas of politics and society. In moderated discussions held every four to six weeks before an audience of international guests, invited experts discuss topics from the areas of politics, culture, technology, media, and the human and natural sciences. The series has been organised and moderated by Carolin Emcke since 2004. Emcke states at the opening of each event that _Streitraum_ is not a forum for arguments and conflict but rather an opportunity to watch people think.[3] Each session ends with questions from the audience.

Jason Farago of BBC Culture has regarded _Streitraum_ as "an intelligent and aggressive public lecture series".[4]
