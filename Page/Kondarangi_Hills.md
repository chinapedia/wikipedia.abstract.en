LORD MALLIGARJUNA SWAMY TEMPLE also referred as KONDARANGI HILLS which is situated in Kondarangi Keeranur, which has a bolt upright setup and resembles in the form of conical shape and it is about 1165.86 METERS (3825 FEET) HIGH. An astonishing Rock cut Temple is situated on the top where we can get a pure divine sanction and blessings from Lord Shiva in the name of Malligarjuneswarar. The sculpture present in the temple is a Swayambhu Lingam. Swayambhu is a Sanskrit word which means,” something created by its own agreeing”.

And finally, it may honestly be observed that this mountain looks like a Huge Linga (phallus symbol) which forms one of the most attractive features. Lord Shiva and Vishu are mostly known by name HARI-HARAN, in which Hari means Vishnu and Haran means Shiva.

History

According to the reference from the ancient history, the duration of the lives in the world are categorized under four period of Yugas such as Satya yuga, Treta yuga, Dvapara yuga and finally the kali yuga ,in which at end of each period all the lives on the earth will be demolished. Some vedhas also gives some reference that the energy of good vibes which is considered as a god in those days, will demolish himself and again will give a rebirth to himself once again to build up the lives`in the earth. During this period, vedhas says that two of a saint among the Sabtharishis, who is named as Kagabajendra and Ganapathy had rebirthed themselves as a crow and stayed alive as an ambassador to a god to regenerate the new world because of the former demolishment. There is also a small cave temple situated in the top of the hill for Kagabajendran sage.

As like to hear something straight from the horse’s mouth, there is also a proof that the Saint Kagabajendra will visit the temple to worship the god in the form of a mild storm during the dusk. This storm starts from the foot board that is from the bottom of the hill and ends when it enters the temple and lasts for two seconds and leaves by.


Architecture

Rock-cut architecture is the creation of structures, buildings, and sculptures, by excavating solid rock where it naturally occurs. Here the temple steps are in a rock-cut framework. It takes two hours to reach the top of the hill for pleasant and cordial worship. If there is a rain or high winds it will be difficult to ascend or descend. So, priorly before visiting the temple precautions must be taken as per the obstacle. There is a perennial spring on the top.


Specialities

One of the most heart wondering secret is that during British rule in our country, they came into the decision to develop a blueprint to resolve back the original borders of a place when if it was distorted by an earthquake, and here one of the considerable phenomena is that the blueprint consists of three access point to detect the distorted places and these are located at Kodaikanal hills, another one in Tirumala hills and finishing point is at Kondarangi hills .Which is locally named as Malliswar hills. This framework done by British is named as Triangle survey. This survey is found to be useful to make a report for the measurements of newland in TamilNadu if it was affected by severe Earthquake.

Then the next foremost speciality is that, by joining two hands together we will get good earth’s vibration. Therefore for that reason we used to pray god by joining the hands in pyramid format, as this as a reference our hill Kondarangi is also in pyramid form naturally, which resembles that it will surely shower us with infinite number of positive vibes and this was scientifically proved.

This place features as a preeminent site for bare-skinned meditation which is mostly undertaken by maharishis.This place has also had badged as a point which had been carved by Pancha Pandavas to worship Lord Shiva. This place gives more than thousands of vibrations that we can receive through the meditation done in Haridwar. The temple has a Cave where Sidhhars and Thavasis have done meditation. There is also another temple located in the foothills known as Ketti Malleswarar Sri Bhramaramba Temple.
