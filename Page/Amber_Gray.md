AMBER GRAY is an American actress and singer best known for portraying Hélène Kuragina in the 2016 Broadway musical _Natasha, Pierre, & the Great Comet of 1812._[1] Gray also played Persephone in the 2016 Off-Broadway musical _Hadestown_ and reprised her role for the Broadway transfer, for which she received favorable reviews and a Tony Award nomination.[2]


Early life and education

Gray is an Army brat and spent her early childhood across Europe and The United States.[3] She later settled in Massachusetts and attended Wayland High School.

She attended Boston University where she received a BFA in Acting and New York University where she received an MFA in Acting.[4]


Career

In 2012, Gray first became involved with _Natasha, Pierre, & the Great Comet of 1812_, an electro-pop opera based on _War and Peace_. Gray portrayed Countess Hélène Bezukhova in the musical's performances at the Off-Off-Broadway Ars Nova Theater.[5] Gray continued with _Great Comet_ when it moved to Kazino Meatpacking in 2013, Kazino Times Square in 2014, and when it opened on Broadway in late 2016. Gray was awarded a 2017 Theatre World Award for her performance as Hélène.[6]

In 2014, Gray reprised her leading role as Zoe in _An Octoroon_ at Soho Repertory Theatre (she had previously performed as Zoe in 2010 at P.S.122).[7] _An Octoroon_ utilized the plot of _The Octoroon_, an 1859 melodrama, but turned it into a contemporary new play that discusses America's slave history and both past and present racism. In an interview with the New York Times, Gray spoke of the part's difficulty due to many intense racial scenes, saying it, "seems like an impossible role".[8] Gray remained with the production when it went on to play at Theatre for a New Audience in 2015.

In 2016, Gray portrayed Persephone in New York Theatre Workshop's production of the new musical _Hadestown_, based on Anaïs Mitchell's album of the same name.[9] Gray was again directed by Rachel Chavkin, whom she collaborated with during _Great Comet_.[10] Gray was praised by critics, who were impressed by her "vocal dexterity,"[11] "charisma," and "powerhouse voice".[12] She reprised this role in the Edmonton Citadel Theatre, London National Theatre, and Broadway productions. For the Broadway production, she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.
