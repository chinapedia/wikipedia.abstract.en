The RILEY H. ANDES HOUSE is a historic house in Sevierville, Tennessee, U.S..


History

The house was built in 1867 for Riley H. Andes, his wife, Rebecca Rimel, and their daughter Sallie.[1] The Italianate and Queen Anne woodcarving was designed by Lewis Buckner, an African-American carpenter, in 1890.[2][3] After Riley Andes's death in 1917, their daughter Sallie, who was married to J. W. Trotter, rented the house, until she sold it to John Denton in 1942.[4] It is now home to the Robert A. Tino Gallery, named after a local painter.[5][6]

The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 8, 1980.[7]
