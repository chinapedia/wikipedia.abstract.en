CATALAN CENTRE () was a Spanish political party of the Catalan region born during the Spanish transition to democracy in 1976.[1]

It was created in Barcelona by the initiative of young entrepreneurs and professionals linked to the Circle of Economy of Barcelona and the _Jove Cambra_ (chamber of young entrepreneurs). Its president was Joan Mas, Joaquim Molins as general secretary, and other entrepreneurs like Carlos Ferrer Salat, Carles Güell de Sentmenat, Jordi Planasdemunt, Figa and Vicenç Lluís Oller were also linked to the party. Although they were not linked to Francoism, neither were they part of the democratic opposition.[2][3]

Its program was defined as "catalanista", federalist, pro-European and advocating a free market economy. Influenced by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and related to the thesis of Council of Political Forces of Catalonia (), it aimed to occupy a centre-right democratic, progressive space. It presented to the general elections of 1977 forming the coalition named Union of the Centre and Christian Democracy of Catalonia with the Democratic Union of Catalonia, obtaining a bench (of the two who obtained the coalition) for Güell Sentmentat, who joined the Mixed Group throughout the term. Centre Català in 1978 was one of the parties that joined the Centre Union of Catalonia (, UCC).[4]
