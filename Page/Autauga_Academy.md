AUTAUGA ACADEMY is a private coed PK-12 school in Prattville, Alabama, the seat of Autauga County.


History

Autauga Private Academy was founded in 1969 as a segregation academy.[1] It is distinct from a seminary of the same name founded in 1888.[2]

Autauga attracted the attention of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, prompting an inspection tour in 1982, along with eight other schools in Alabama[3]

In 2011, a black student, O. J. Howard, was told by the headmaster of the school he could not bring a girl to the prom because she was white.[4]
