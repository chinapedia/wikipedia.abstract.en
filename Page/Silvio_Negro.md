SILVIO NEGRO (15 April 1897 â€“ 3 November 1959) was an Italian essayist and journalist.

Born in Chiampo, the son of a humble farmer, Negro was a mountain artillery officer during World War I, and also received several decorations. After the war, he started composing poems under the pseudonym "Orsobruno" and graduated in letters at the University of Padua in 1922.[1]

Thanks to a post-graduation scholarship, Negro moved to Rome, where he started collaborating with the Vatican newspaper _L'Osservatore Romano_. In 1923, he moved to Milan, where he first collaborated with the catholic publication _L'Italia_, and in 1926 he was enrolled at the newspaper _Corriere della Sera_, of which he was the Vaticanist since 1931 till his death.[2]

In 1937, Negro won the Bagutta Prize for the book _Vaticano Minore_. He was also a collector of vintage pictures, of which he organized several exhibitions; the pictures are now held by the foundation Fondo Negro.[3]
