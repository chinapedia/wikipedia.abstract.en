The 2016 INTERSTATE 10 TOUR BUS CRASH was a vehicle accident that occurred on Interstate 10 (I-10) in California on October 23, 2016, when a tour bus collided with the back of a semi-trailer truck. The accident killed 13 and injured 31 others.


Incident

The tour bus was heading westbound, returning to Los Angeles with 42 adult passengers from an excursion to a casino in Thermal, when it impacted the rear of the stationary truck[1] soon after 5Â a.m.,[2] at an estimated .[3] The speed caused the trailer to penetrate approximately into the bus. The bus driver, Teodulo Elias Vides, who owned the tour bus company, and twelve passengers were killed.[4][5] The remaining thirty passengers were injured, as was the truck driver, Bruce Guilford.[6][7][8]


Investigation and trial

Immediately following the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board sent a disaster crew to investigate the crash. The report established that both drivers had been seriously sleep-deprived and that Guilford had falsified his driver logs to conceal his having driven more than the maximum number of hours without rest. He had fallen asleep and his truck had remained stationary after the highway reopened following a temporary closure; Vides, an undiagnosed diabetic who had also had very little sleep in the days before the accident, had not reacted in time to avoid colliding with the truck.[9][10] The bus also had two substandard tires and was not equipped with seat belts.[11]

Guilford was arrested in October 2017 and the following month was extradited from the state of Georgia and charged with 13 counts of felony vehicular manslaughter and other related charges.[12][13][14] After a preliminary hearing, he was ordered held on $500,000 bail before his trial.[15]
