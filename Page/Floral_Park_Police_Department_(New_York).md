FLORAL PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT is a community-oriented police department in Floral Park, New York. Its jurisdiction covers approximately and over 16,000 residents. The Department employs two lieutenants, six sergeants, two detectives and 25 officers and is commanded by a Police Commissioner.[1]


History

The Department was established in 1918 when Al Surprise and James Peterson were appointed as full-time police officers. The original headquarters was a booth located at the southeast corner of South Tyson Avenue and Jericho Turnpike.

In 1926 Robert Ferris became the first police chief. In 1927 the headquarters was moved to a vacant store at 160 Jericho Turnpike in the Pickenpack Building, including a desk and jail cells.

Surprise acted as the department's mounted (riding a horse) police officer. Mechanical transportation in the form of a one-cylinder motorcycle was added to replace the station's lone horse when it was killed by a train.
