NEW COELN (also called NEW KOELN and NEW KÖLN) is a neighborhood, formerly a rural hamlet in the Town of Lake of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, but now part of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was settled by a group of German immigrants from the area around Cologne (German _Köln_) in the 1840s. By 1847, there were about fifty settlers, and a new Catholic parish, St. Stephen's, was formed.[1][2] The portion of the former settlement west of Howell Avenue is now part of the grounds of General Mitchell International Airport, but the inn known variously as Deuster's Saloon, New Coeln House, and the New Coeln House Dancehall is still open (currently branded as the Landmark 1850 Inn), and is on the National Register of Historic Places.[3]
