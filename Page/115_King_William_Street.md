History

115 King William Street has historically been an address associated with commercial offices. In the nineteenth century it was the office and home of a solicitor, George Michell.[2] In the early twentieth century, it was the site of Commercial Union Chambers, which hosted a range of commercial offices, including its main tenant the Commercial Union Assurance Company.[3] From the 1930s onwards, it became associated with the premises of Scrymgour & Sons, a printing business.[4]

115 King William Street was approved by the Development Assessment Commission on 12 July 2010,[5] with its original design only being 64 metres and 16 storeys tall.[6] Later on, the building was approved to be 25 floors high and in August 2015 was granted permission to have another 1 storey making it 26 storeys high.
