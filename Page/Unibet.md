History

Unibet was originally founded in 1997 by Anders Ström, with the company initially operating out of Ström's home in Earl's Court, London. It secured a licence to operate a betting business and from 1998, Unibet began taking bets over the phone. The following year, Unibet launched their first ever online betting website. It later became Unibet Group PLC, Pontus Lesse was appointed as the new CEO and the company were granted their first international gambling licence in Malta.

Over the next few years, Unibet Group PLC expanded quickly. Its Unibet website diversified to support 12 different languages and by 2004, the company boasted over 300,000 registered customers in more than 100 countries. It was also in that year that the company was first listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange.[4]

The following years saw a number of other acquisitions by the company, including most notably those of Betchoice in Australia and of Stan James Online.[5] In order to better support their new multi-brand strategy, Unibet Group Plc became the Kindred Group in 2016.[6] Since that time, the company have passed one million registered customers and launched a range of further betting and gambling brands around the world.
