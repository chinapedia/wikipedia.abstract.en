Plot

Bertie Wooster is determined to propose to Roberta Wickham ("Bobbie"). When Barmy Fotheringay Phipps defeats him at golf, Roberta ("Bobbie") recommends an idea for a practical joke by sneaking into Barmy's bedroom at night and puncturing the hot-water bottle with a darning needle attached to a stick. At 2:30 in the morning, Bertie goes to the bedroom with the stick and needle. In the darkened room, he successfully punctures the hot-water bottle. But, when the door slams and wakes the person sleeping there, Bertie realises that it is Prof Cluj and his wife, instead of Barmy. Bertie punctured the hot-water bottle of Aneta Cluj. Bertie tries to escape from the room, but his dressing gown catches on the door, and Prof Cluj catches him. Bertie explains that he was looking for Barmy, and Prof Cluj tells Bertie that he had switched rooms with Barmy. Prof Cluj's wife Aneta discovers the punctured hot-water bottle and they are furious with Bertie. They go to Bertie's room to spend the rest of the night, leaving their room to Bertie. Bertie spends the night in an armchair.

Bertie Wooster is made to watch Aunt Agatha's over-pampered dog McIntosh and is horrified when Roberta ("Bobbie") gives the dog to the spoilt son of a Broadway producer. Tuppy Glossop is infatuated with an opera singer, Cora Bellinger, and has dropped Bertie's cousin Angela. Her mother, Aunt Dahlia, wants this affair over with, and Jeeves produces a plan which involves Bertie singing in public.
