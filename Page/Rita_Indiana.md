Biography

Born in Santo Domingo in 1977, Rita Indiana is the grand-niece of the soprano Ivonne Haza and great-great-great-granddaughter of the poet and hero of the Restoration War, Manuel Rodríguez Objío. She is also second cousin of the journalist Óscar Haza and of the politician Víctor Bisonó. She was baptized in honor of her great-grandmother Rita Indiana del Castillo y Rodríguez-Objío.[2][3]

Indiana began her writing career with novels such as _La estrategia de Chochueca_ and _Papi_, fueling her creativity with Dominican slang and colloquialisms.

Later, she decided to explore Dominican popular music, reinventing merengue dancing through her compositions and interpretations with the group Los Misterios. With her band, Rita appeared at the celebrated venue SOB's in New York.[4] NPR included her _El Juidero_ in their list "Top 10 Latin American Albums of 2010".[5]

The topics of her songs range from social issues to divergent sexuality. She is in a relationship with her frequent artistic collaborator, filmmaker Noelia Quintero.[6][7]

Some of her songs have been written for such influential Latin American musicians as Julieta Venegas and Calle 13.[8][9]

In 2017 her novel _La mucama de Omicunlé_ became the first Spanish-language work to receive the Grand Prize of the Association of Caribbean Writers.[10] In 2019, the same book, translated to English, was published as _Tentacle_.[11] Her sixth novel, _Made in Saturn,_ will be published by And Other Stories in 2020.
