CRAIG JOSEPH CHARLES (born 11 July 1964) is a British actor, comedian, author, poet, television presenter and DJ. He is best known for playing Dave Lister in the science fiction sitcom _Red Dwarf_ and Lloyd Mullaney in the soap opera _Coronation Street_, as a funk and soul DJ on BBC Radio 6 Music and BBC Radio 2, and as the presenter of the gladiator-style game show _Robot Wars_ from 1998 to 2004.

Charles first appeared on television as a performance poet, which led to minor presenting roles. After finding fame in _Red Dwarf_, he regularly featured on national television with celebrity appearances on many popular shows while he continued to host a wide variety of programmes.

Charles is also known for narrating the comedy endurance show _Takeshi's Castle_. From 2017, he has hosted _The Gadget Show_ for Channel 5. His acting credits include playing inmate Eugene Buffy in the ITV drama _The Governor_, and leading roles in the British films _Fated_ and _Clubbing to Death_. He has toured the UK extensively as a stand-up comedian.

Charles has hosted _The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show_ on BBC radio since 2002, and performs DJ sets at numerous clubs and festivals, nationally and internationally. In September 2015, he left _Coronation Street_ after ten years, to film new episodes of _Red Dwarf_.


Early life

Charles was born in Liverpool to a Guyanese father[1] and Irish mother.[2][3] He grew up on the Cantril Farm housing estate[4] with his older brother, Dean (who died in 2014) and his 2 other brothers Jimmy and Emile. He attended West Derby Comprehensive School followed by Childwall Hall College of Further Education, studying A-levels in History, Government and Politics, English Literature and General Studies.[5] Charles won a national competition, run by _The Guardian_ newspaper, for a poem he wrote when he was 12 years old.[6] On leaving school Charles spent time working in a studio at Central Hall, Renshaw Street, Liverpool. His eloquence in conversation and in his poetry (which he shared with colleagues) was something new at the time. With his gradual flowering as a poet emerged a certain boldness and self-confidence.


Early career

Charles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British cabaret circuit. His performances were considered original, with Charles described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to talent scouts. In 1981, Charles climbed on stage at a Teardrop Explodes concert and recited a humorous, but derogatory, poem about the band's singer, Julian Cope. He was invited to open subsequent gigs for the group and went on to perform as a support act in pubs and clubs for the following three years,[7] and at events such as the _Larks in the Park_ music festival at Sefton Park (1982). He performed poetry at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre (1983) with such poets as Roger McGough and Adrian Henri.

Charles was involved in the Liverpool music scene, writing and singing lyrics for a number of local rock bands.[8] In 1980, he played keyboards, bass and provided voice in the rock band _Watt 4_.[9] He performed his political rap lyrics as a 'Wordsmith'. In 1983, Charles was invited to record a session on the John Peel BBC Radio show, performing his poems backed by a band. This was his first professional engagement.[10] He recorded a further Peel Session in 1984.[11]

Charles realised he was using poetry as a vehicle for his sense of humour and progressed into stand-up comedy. He was part of the _Red Wedge_ comedy tour in 1986, which aimed to raise awareness of the social problems of the time, in support of the Labour Party. He also performed his first one-man show in 1986,[12] which premiered in Edinburgh, and then toured internationally.[13] Charles was a guest on programmes including Janice Long's Radio 1 show,[14] and was a regular panellist on Ned Sherrin's chat show _Loose Ends_ (1987–88) on BBC Radio 4.[15]


Television career

Performance poetry

Charles first appeared on television as the resident poet on the arts programme _Riverside_ on BBC2 and on the day-time BBC1 chat show _Pebble Mill at One_.[16] Charles was the resident poet on the Channel 4 programme _Black on Black_ (1985)[17] and its entertainment-based successor _Club Mix_ (1986), and he appeared, weekly, as a John Cooper Clarke-style 'punk poet' on the BBC2 pop music programme _Oxford Road Show_ (ORS). Charles performed his political poems as stand-up comedy on the late-night show _Saturday Live_ (1985–87) and on the prime-time BBC1 chat show _Wogan_ (1986–87), where he performed a topical poem in a weekly feature. He also appeared as a guest on shows including _Open Air_ (1988). Charles included significant acting in his performance style, enabling him to put the emotion across.[18] In September 2015, Charles performed his "epic" poem _Scary Fairy and the Tales of the Dark Wood_ live with the BBC Philharmonic orchestra, in a concert to be broadcast on BBC Radio 2's _Friday Night is Music Night_ at Halloween.

_Red Dwarf_

Charles acquired cult status in 1988 in his first television acting role as the Liverpudlian slob Dave Lister in science fiction comedy series _Red Dwarf_. Charles has appeared in all twelve series. Charles' younger brother, Emile Charles, guest-starred in the Series III episode "Timeslides", and the songs "Bad News" and "Cash" in this episode were written by Charles and performed by his band.[19] The role has involved Charles playing a variety of alternative characters, including a gangster, a cowboy and angelic and evil versions of Lister,[20] and in him carrying out a wide range of stunts, and acting involving special effects. All series, except VII and IX, were recorded in front of a studio audience. Along with Danny John-Jules [Cat], Charles is one of only two cast members to appear in every episode of _Red Dwarf_ to date.

Charles reads the audiobook editions of both the _Red Dwarf_ novel _Last Human_ and his book _The Log: A Dwarfer's Guide to Everything_, and he regularly attends sci-fi, comedy and memorabilia conventions in connection with the _Red Dwarf_ franchise. During _Back to Earth_, Lister visits the set of _Coronation Street_, where he meets the actor Craig Charles.[21]

_Robot Wars_

Charles presented _Robot Wars_ on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–04), from series 2 until series 7, which included two _Extreme_ series and numerous 'specials'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short _Robot Wars_-themed poem. Charles' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on "Team Nemesis" during series 4. Charles also hosted the _Robot Wars Live_ UK tour, in 2001 and shows performed at the Wembley Arena.

On 13 January 2016, the BBC announced that the show would be rebooted with 6 episodes in the year. On 14 January 2016, Charles posted a tweet on his Twitter page saying that he would love to present the new series, however he received no reply from the BBC. On 3 February 2016, Dara Ó Briain was announced as Charles' replacement as the presenter. The BBC also stated that they had denied Charles' request to reprise his role by stating that they don't comment on individual casting enquiries.

_Takeshi's Castle_

Charles provided the English voice-over commentary for the Challenge (2002–04) rebroadcast of the popular game show _Takeshi's Castle_, originally by Tokyo Broadcasting System in Japan. In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against a Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano for a chance to win large cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the programme and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and also some special and "best of" episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term "Keshi Heads" to describe fans of the show.

Charles' commentary was so well received that the 2013 reboot featuring Dick and Dom on the voice-overs did not fare as well because he wasn't there, according to complaints that Challenge received via social media. To this day, the Challenge rebroadcasts of _Takeshi's Castle_ regularly place in the weekly top 10 for ratings with an average of 130,000 viewers per episode.

_Coronation Street_

In 2005, Charles joined the main cast of _Coronation Street_,[22] playing philandering taxicab driver, Lloyd Mullaney.[23] Charles introduced aspects of the character himself, making Lloyd a Northern Soul DJ and record collector, and funk music enthusiast. Charles has chosen funk and soul songs playing as backing tracks during scenes,[24] and posters for The Craig Charles Funk & Soul Club and Red Dwarf have appeared in the background.

Charles portrayed Lloyd as tough, but kind hearted and romantic, and the character was popular with viewers. Charles added a comedy element to the role, but was also involved in traumatic and emotional scenes with intricate storylines. In 2010, his character was involved in the show's dramatic 50th anniversary tram crash storyline, which was broadcast live. Charles presented documentaries for the show, including _50 Years of Corrie Stunts_ (2010), which is included on the _Tram Crash_ DVD. In November 2011, Charles took time off from _Coronation Street_ to film a new series of _Red Dwarf_, returning in April 2012.[25] In February 2014 an online mini-series, _Steve & Lloyd's Streetcar Stories_, ran alongside the television show's storyline.[26]

In May 2015, Craig announced he would be leaving _Coronation Street_ for _Red Dwarf._ [27] Lloyd left in a red Cadillac during the live episode on 23 September, although his final pre-recorded farewell scenes with Steve were shown during the following episode.

In 1997, Charles and Bell wrote Charles' _Red Dwarf_ character's book _The Log_, in which Lister decides to leave a log detailing mankind's greatest achievements. In 1998, Charles published _No Other Blue_, a collection of his poetry, with illustrations by Philippa Drakeford, on diverse personal subjects including prison, his mother's final illness, love and politics at home and abroad.

Personal life

Legal issues and acquittal

In July 1994, Charles and a friend were arrested and remanded in custody for three months on a rape charge.[40] In March 1995, both men were acquitted in their trial. After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that "the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called 'victim' has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed."[41] While in prison, Charles was attacked by a man wielding a makeshift knife.[42]

Drug use

In June 2006, newspaper allegations of crack cocaine use resulted in Charles being suspended from both _Coronation Street_[43] and BBC Radio 6 Music. In August, Charles was arrested and released on bail pending further enquiries, and in September he accepted a caution for possession of a Class A drug.[44] Charles returned to hosting his 6 Music show from November 2006 and filming _Coronation Street_ from January 2007.
