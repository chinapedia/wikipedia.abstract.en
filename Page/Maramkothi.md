Plot

The film is centered around a group of common people who fight hard for land and nature. After the withdrawal of British powers from India, a sizeable portion of land came under the possession of landlords which made the conditions of local folks pity. When the cruelty of landlords increased, many tenants were forced to leave their land, which included a five-year-old boy (Sreejith Ravi) along with his family. But unnatural incidents were awaiting when he returned to his own land after a long time. He had to face difficult situations and circumstances which led him to raise his voice against the prevailing social evils.
