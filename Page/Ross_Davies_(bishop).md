ROSS OWEN DAVIES (born 4 February 1955) is an Australian former Anglican bishop. From 2002 to 2010, he was the bishop of the Diocese of The Murray in the Anglican Church of Australia.[1] In September 2010, he resigned and was found guilty by a church tribunal of "disgraceful conduct and wilful violation of church ordinances".[2][3][4]

Davies had belonged to the traditionalist Anglo-Catholic wing of the Anglicanism.[5] On 27 September 2010, three days after resigning as the Bishop of The Murray, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church as a layman by Philip Wilson, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide.[6]
