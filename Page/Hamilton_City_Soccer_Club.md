In May, 2016, Andrew Crowe, the owner of London City, sold his share to his partner Zoran Kliseric, and relocated the club to Hamilton, Ontario marking the return of professional soccer to the city since Hamilton Croatia competed in the Canadian Soccer League in 2010.[1][2][3][4] The organizations territory was located at Stoney Creek with Cardinal Newman Secondary School multi-sport athletic field as their home venue.[5] Former London City manager Josip Dzale assumed the responsibilities of head coach, and assembled a roster of players with European and CSL experience. Dzale brought in Drazen Vukovic, Nikola Stanojević, Josip Keran, Miroslav Čabrilo, Igor Krmar, Haris Fazlagić, and Zdenko Jurcevic.[6]

In the first round of the playoffs they faced Scarborough SC, where Hamilton advanced to the next round by a score of 3-0 with goals coming from Timotej Zakrajsek, Jurcevic, and Frane Grbesa.[8] Hamilton faced the regular league champions York Region Shooters and reached the CSL Championship final after a 4-1 victory in a penalty shootout.[9] Their opponents in the final were the Serbian White Eagles, where Domagoj Zubac recorded the first goal with Serbia tying the match later and scoring the final goal at the last minutes of the match to win the championship.[10] On February 20, 2017 it was announced that the owners of Hamilton SC decided not to field a team for the 2017 season.[11]
