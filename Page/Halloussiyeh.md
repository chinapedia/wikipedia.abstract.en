HALLOUSSIYEH () is a village in Tyre District in Southern Lebanon, located just south of the Litani river.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer, the name could possibly come from the word for "abundant herbage".[1]


History

In 1875, Victor Guérin noted: "This village is divided into two quarters, the lower of which is called Hallusiyeh et Thata, and the upper Hallusiyeh el Foka. The latter occupies the summit of a high hill. The houses of both quarters are rudely built: they may contain about 500 Metawileh."[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A village, built of stone, divided into two quarters, east and west, with [a] Moslem holy place."[3] They further noted: "The only tradition which connects this village with the past is that a wely consecrated to Neby Mohammed is said to have succeeded an ancient church."[4]

Modern era

On 24 July 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, 11 civilians, aged 6 to 86 years of age, were killed by Israeli air-strikes. There were no Hezbollah fighters in the village at the time.[5]
