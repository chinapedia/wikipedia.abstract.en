The ninth season of the reality competition series _American Ninja Warrior_ premiered on June 12, 2017 on NBC. Hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila returned for their respective eighth and fifth seasons, alongside sideline reporter Kristine Leahy who returned for her third season. In addition prior to the ninth-season premiere, NBC aired a special _ANW_ Celebrity, Red Nose Day edition featuring nine celebrities, each coached by nine elite ninjas on May 25 before airing USA vs. The World III on June 4.

This year for the first time, the top five women in each city qualifying course qualified for the city finals course, and the top two women in each city finals qualify for national finals, regardless of their placement overall. Beginning in Season 9, wildcard invitations will no longer be allowed for the National Finals in Vegas as only competitors who finish their city finals or those in the top 15 will advance. Also, the show introduces _ANW Obstacle Design Challenge_, where from over 2500 fan-submitted obstacles, seven chosen obstacles are introduced in the show.

Cleveland Finals

The Cleveland City finals round introduced a new obstacle, the Nail Clipper, which defeated all but two competitors. "Captain NBC" Jamie Rahn was the first to hit the buzzer, earning the "_POM Wonderful_ Run of the Night" with a time of 8:39.85. Weatherman Joe Moravsky finished the course even faster, at 7:24.10. James McGrath's streak of six Nationals appearances ended when he fell on the dismount from the Nail Clipper; he finished the Salmon Ladder with a time just outside the Top 15. Michelle Warnky made it farther than all but 6 other women in the city finals of ANW 9, but her slow time prevented her from going to Vegas with a talented field of women in Cleveland.

National Finals

The National Finals were held along the Las Vegas Strip, as has been the case since the series set up its own finals course instead of sending competitors to Japan.

Stage 1

All competitors must complete the eight obstacles on Stage 1 with a time limit of 2:35.00. Highlights included school teacher Allyssa Beird who made _ANW_ history by becoming only the second woman (also the third worldwide, the first two being Chie Tanabe in _Sasuke_ 2 and Jessie Graff) to complete Stage One, earning her the _POM Wonderful_ "Crazy Healthy Run of the Night". Also, at only 5 foot, gymnastics coach Barclay Stockett, became the second woman to get past the Warped Wall on Stage One. Later, NBC sports announcer Mike Tirico joined _ANW_ announcers Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbajabuamila for a few play-by-plays of the competitors. During the second half, "Real Life Ninja" Drew Drechsel earned the _POM Wonderful_ "Crazy Healthy Run of the Night" with the fastest run on Stage One of the competition with a speedy time of 1:33.71. This season broke the previous record of most Stage 1 finishers with 41, beating the previous record of 38 from Season 7.

Competitors who completed Stage 1 are listed below. △ denotes female competitors.
