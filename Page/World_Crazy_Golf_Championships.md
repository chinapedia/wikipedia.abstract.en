The World Crazy Golf Championships is open to everyone with no age restriction.[5] There are also categories for women, juniors and novices each having their own dedicated trophies. The World Championship Crazy Golf courses at Hastings Adventure Golf on the town’s seafront contain many hazards and obstacles over the 18-holes including a water wheel,a windmill, an obelisk, lighthouse, ramps, bends, twists and bunkers.[6] The World Crazy Golf Championships is a miniature golf tournament which has its own unique playing rules, such as every player using the same type of ball,[7] thus able to have a world championship competition of its own.[8] Up to 102 competitors (in 2005) play six qualifying rounds, four on the Saturday and two on Sunday, with just the lowest scoring 18 players making the cut to participate in the final round. Since 2010, the championship has been played on one course, the crazy golf, an Arnold Palmer type course with obstacles. Prior to this, it was played on two different 18 hole courses, the crazy golf and the former mini golf course. The winner also receives £1000 in prize money, and a further £2000 is distributed to the placed players.[9] In 2013 Czech teenager Olivia Prokopová became the first female winner and also the youngest ever champion at the age of 18.[10] The World Crazy Golf Championships part of the tour of the British Minigolf Association (BMGA) which is the governing body for minigolf sport, including crazy golf.[11] The final is played on Sunday afternoon, in front of enthusiastic spectators, in 2007 the mayor of Hastings watched the final and then presented the prizes and trophies to the winning players.[12]
