WOODBURY is a small township in the Canterbury Region in the South Island of New Zealand. It is about inland from Geraldine and is the gateway to the nearby Waihi and Orari River Gorges and the Four Peaks. The township is home to various small local businesses.


History

The early history of Woodbury is centered around the timber industry and farming. The town was first established by Robert Taylor and Frederick Flatman in 1866 as a saw milling and farming settlement.[1] The town enjoyed rapid growth in its early years and was home to a large general store, two butchers shops, a shoemaker, a creamery, a blacksmith and a two-storeyed wooden hotel, that would later blow down in a gale.[2]

The settlement was originally known as Waihi Bush, however, was renamed Woodbury after the birthplace Elizabeth Flatman (Frederick Flatman's wife) in Gloucestershire, England.[3]


Education

The original Waihi Bush school was opened on 13 June 1873, the school would later be moved to its currently location and renamed in 1881.[4] The school continues to operate today as a four teacher primary school with a roll of just under 100 students.[5] The school is listed as a decile 8 school and its principal is Claire Haugh.[6]


Buildings

Eleanor Tripp Library

A small wooden library built as a memorial to Eleanor Tripp,is still run by locals today and doubles as a museum. Outside the library is the area War Memorial.

St Thomas's Church

The original wooden church was consecrated in 1879, however population growth in the region ensured that a new, larger church was needed.[7] The church was rebuilt by Oswald Scott and Bert Cooling using Norman styling and stones from the local river, it was completed in 1938.[8] The interior of the church features stained glass windows made by Veronica Whall, Joseph Nuttgens and Stephen Bélanger-Taylor as well as carving by Frederick Gurnsey.[9] The church is still used today for services and is a popular wedding location.

Woodbury Domain

Land was reserved for the domain in 1883[10] and the Woodbury Hall was built in 1911 in celebration of the coronation of King George V.[11] The domain consists of a cricket pavilion, tennis courts, children's playground, public toilets and BBQ. Adjacent to the domain is the cemetery that has been used since 1879.
