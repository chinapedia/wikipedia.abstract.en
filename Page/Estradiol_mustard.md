ESTRADIOL MUSTARD, also known as CHLORPHENACYL ESTRADIOL DIESTER, as well as ESTRADIOL 3,17Β-BIS(4-(BIS(2-CHLOROETHYL)AMINO)PHENYL)ACETATE, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen and cytostatic antineoplastic agent and a chlorphenacyl nitrogen mustard-coupled estrogen ester that was never marketed.[1] It is selectively distributed into estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tissues such as ER-expressing tumors like those seen in breast and prostate cancers.[2] For this reason, estradiol mustard and other cytostatic-linked estrogens like estramustine phosphate have reduced toxicity relative to non-linked nitrogen mustard cytostatic antineoplastic agents.[3] However, they may stimulate breast tumor growth due to their inherent estrogenic activity and are said to be devoid of major therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer,[4] although estramustine phosphate has been approved for and is used (almost exclusively) in the treatment of prostate cancer.[5]
