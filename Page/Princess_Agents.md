Soundtrack


Reception

On June 26, the drama reached a rating of 2.01% with an audience share of 14.88% according to National Average ratings.[53] This broke the record for a drama airing on a non-primetime timeslot on a non-holiday weekday.[54] The series is also the first Chinese drama to break 40 billion views while still airing.[55] It is also popular in overseas countries,[56][57][58] _Princess Agents_ received praise for its unique storyline and stellar performance of the actors,[59] as well as the complex twist and picturesque landscapes.[60]

Despite its success and initial positive reviews, the series was later criticized for various issues in regards to its production quality - such as its inappropriate use of photoshop/green screen, excessively bright palette and the inconsistent dubbing of actors.[61] The writing was lambasted for several reasons - such as making the female character another "mary-sue" underneath a strong and independent facade; and including unnecessary story-lines and screen-time for unimportant supporting characters; which makes the plot inconsistent and draggy.[62] Additionally, there was controversy about the extortionate amount of focus on the second male lead's storyline, with some viewers sarcastically calling the drama "Yan Xun's revenge story". The drama was also criticized for ending in a cliffhanger.

A week before the drama finished airing, Hunan changed its airing schedule to Sunday-Tuesday at 23:00 CST to promote their upcoming drama during Princess Agents' timeslot. This greatly impacted ratings due to audience not knowing of the new time slot and the drama airing an hour later than usual.

Plagiarism allegations

The source novel _11 Chu Te Gong Huang Fei_ (11处特工皇妃) was alleged to be plagiarized from several novels including _Hu Zhu Fu Ren_ (斛珠夫人) by Xiao Ruqin, _Jiu Zhou Piao Miao Lu_ (九州缥缈录) by Jiang Nan and _Kun Lun_ (昆仑) by Feng Ge etc. In August 2015, the author Xia Xiang Dong'er admitted the allegations of plagiarism.[68] In her announcement, she promised to provide a "clean" version in which all the plagiarized parts would be deleted so that the adapted TV series would not infringe the copyrights of the original authors. When the TV series was first released in June 2017, the original authors still alleged that the TV series contained plots and lines plagiarized from their works. Xiao Ruqin, the author of _Hu Zhu Fu Ren_ (斛珠夫人), posted on Weibo that she would be taking legal actions to protect their copyrighted works.[69][70]
