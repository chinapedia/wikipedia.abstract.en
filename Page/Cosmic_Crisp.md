COSMIC CRISP is an American apple with the variety designation WA 38.[1] Breeding began in 1997 at the Washington State University (WSU) Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center in Wenatchee, Washington, overseen by Bruce Barritt. Cosmic Crisp combines the best features of the existing Honeycrisp and Enterprise apples—the texture and juiciness of the Honeycrisp, and the late-ripening behavior and long storage of the Enterprise. In breeding the variety, the focus was not on the appearance, but on durability and shelf life. Cosmic Crisp is characterized mainly by uniformly colored dark red skin, dense firm flesh, and an improved shelf life.[2] The look of the apple's light lenticels against its wine-red skin reminded focus groups of a galaxy against a night sky—thus the name Cosmic Crisp.[3] It is the first widely-grown apple variety developed in Washington.[4]

The variety was first planted for commercial use in spring 2017, with 12 million trees pre-ordered by Washington state orchards.[5] The variety is initially only available to Washington-based growers, and will remain limited to them for at least ten years. Growers pay a royalty for each tree purchased and for each box of apples sold. Interest was so high the seedlings initially had to be distributed to apple farmers in a lottery held in 2014—WSU had planned to provide 300,000 saplings but were met with requests for 4 million.[6][7] Within three years, over 13 million Cosmic Crisp trees had been planted. Lawsuits emerged between WSU and a Seattle spinoff that the university claimed distributed over 100,000 seedlings improperly.[8][9] WSU owns the Cosmic Crisp patent.

The apple ripens at the same time as Red Delicious and is expected to replace a large part of the Red Delicious stocks. Cosmic Crisp will be available to consumers in 2019,[10] after 20 years of development.[11][12] Industry watchers expect Cosmic Crisp production to outpace Pink Lady and Honeycrisp apples in five years.

The _New York Times_ described the apple as "dramatically dark, richly flavored and explosively crisp and juicy", making it "the most promising and important apple of the future".[13] _Food Republic_ called it "firmer than the Honeycrisp, but not too firm. And it is high in both sugar and acidity, making it far superior to the Red Delicious, Gala and Fuji varieties as well."[14] _Northwest Public Radio_ notes that Washington state, which produces 70% of America's apples, is betting that the apple will "conquer" the market when it reaches supermarket shelves in 2019.[15]

A $10 million consumer launch of the product is funded by Washington State agriculture promotion funds through the Washington Apple Commission and other agencies.[16] The two taglines for the apple will be "Imagine the Possibilities" and "The Apple of Big Dreams".[17] It is said to be the largest campaign in apple industry history,[18] and will include payments to social media influencers and a partnership with a touring children's production of _Johnny Appleseed_.[19] The term "Cosmic Crisp" is trademarked.[20]
