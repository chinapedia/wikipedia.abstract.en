In abstract algebra, a field extension _L_/_K_ is called ALGEBRAIC if every element of _L_ is algebraic over _K_, i.e. if every element of _L_ is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in _K_. Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements, are called TRANSCENDENTAL.

For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q()/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers.

All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.[1] The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If _a_ is algebraic over _K_, then _K_[_a_], the set of all polynomials in _a_ with coefficients in _K_, is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of _K_ which has finite degree over _K_. The converse is true as well, if _K_[_a_] is a field, then _a_ is algebraic over _K_. In the special case where _K_ = Q is the field of rational numbers, Q[_a_] is an example of an algebraic number field.

A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed. An example is the field of complex numbers. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.

An extension _L_/_K_ is algebraic if and only if every sub _K_-algebra of _L_ is a field.


Properties

The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions, that is, the following three properties hold:[2]

1.  If _E_ is an algebraic extension of _F_ and _F_ is an algebraic extension of _K_ then _E_ is an algebraic extension of _K_.
2.  If _E_ and _F_ are algebraic extensions of _K_ in a common overfield _C_, then the compositum _EF_ is an algebraic extension of _K_.
3.  If _E_ is an algebraic extension of _F_ and _E_>_K_>_F_ then _E_ is an algebraic extension of _K_.

These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:

This fact, together with Zorn's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.


Generalizations

Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of _M_ into _N_ is called an ALGEBRAIC EXTENSION if for every _x_ in _N_ there is a formula _p_ with parameters in _M_, such that _p_(_x_) is true and the set

{_y_∈_N_|_p_(_y_)}

is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The Galois group of _N_ over _M_ can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.
