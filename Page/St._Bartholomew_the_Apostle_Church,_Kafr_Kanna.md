The ST. BARTHOLOMEW THE APOSTLE CHURCH[1] ( ) is the name given to a Catholic church administered by the Franciscan order in Kafr Kanna[2] in Israel, built in honor of Cana, the place where Scripture says was the hometown of the apostle St. Bartholomew.[3] The church was founded in 1885.[4] Bartholomew is one of the apostles who according to the Bible were present at the miracle of the fish: "Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way: Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together" (John 21: 1-2)

The front of the church features four pillars and a round window above the main doorway. In the center is a Latin inscription: _"DOM S NATHANAELIS BARTHOLOMAEI APOSTOLI"_ (which means The apostle Nathanael Bartholomew). The altar stands on a raised platform, and in front, two pairs of small-sized columns have Corinthian capitals, and a bas-relief depicting the meeting of Nathanael and Philip the Apostle. Nearby is a small cemetery.
