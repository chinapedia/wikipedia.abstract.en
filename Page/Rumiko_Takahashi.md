is a Japanese manga artist. With a career of several commercially successful works, beginning with _Urusei Yatsura_ in 1978, Takahashi is one of Japan's most affluent manga artists.[1][2] Her works are popular worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 200 million copies in circulation.[3] She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for _Urusei Yatsura_ and again in 2001 for _Inuyasha_,[4] and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for _Urusei Yatsura_ and again in 1989 for _Mermaid Saga_.[5] She also received the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême in 2019, becoming the second woman and second Japanese to win the prize.[6]


Career

Rumiko Takahashi was born in Niigata, Japan.[7] Although she showed little interest in manga during her childhood, she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Chūō High School. Takahashi's interest in manga did not start until later.[8] In an interview in 2000, Takahashi said that she had always wanted to become a professional comic author since she was a child.[9] During her university years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, author of _Crying Freeman_ and _Lone Wolf and Cub_. Under his guidance Takahashi began to publish her first _dōjinshi_ creations in 1975, such as _Bye-Bye Road_ and _Star of Futile Dust_. Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi's works throughout her career.[10]

Takahashi's professional career began in 1978. Her first published work was the one-shot _Katte na Yatsura_ (_Those Selfish Aliens_), which garnered her an honorable mention at that year's Shogakukan New Comics Contest.[11] Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_; _Urusei Yatsura_, a comedic science fiction story. She had difficulty meeting deadlines to begin with, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During the run of the series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet due to a lack of space.[12] During the same year, she published _Time Warp Trouble_, _Shake Your Buddha_, and the _Golden Gods of Poverty_ in _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_ magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.

During 1980, Takahashi started her second major series, _Maison Ikkoku_, in _Big Comic Spirits_ magazine. Written for an older audience, _Maison Ikkoku_ is a romantic comedy, and Takahashi used her own experience living in an apartment complex to create the series. Takahashi managed to work on the series on and off simultaneously with _Urusei Yatsura_. She concluded both series in 1987, with _Urusei Yatsura_ ending at 34 volumes, and _Maison Ikkoku_ at 15.

During the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga. Her stories _Laughing Target_, _Maris the Chojo_, and _Fire Tripper_ all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, during the writing of _Urusei Yatsura_ and _Maison Ikkoku_, Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre _Mermaid Saga_. This series of short segments was published sporadically until 1994.

Another short work of Takahashi's to be published sporadically was _One-Pound Gospel_. Takahashi concluded the series in 2007 after publishing chapters in 1998, 2001 and 2006.[13] One-Pound Gospel was adapted into a live-action TV drama.

Later, in 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, _Ranma ½_. Following the late 1980s and early 1990s trend of _shōnen_ martial arts manga, _Ranma ½_ features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. _Ranma ½_ and its anime adaption are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.[14]

During the latter half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of _Mermaid Saga_ and _One-Pound Gospel_ until beginning her fourth major work, _Inuyasha_. Unlike the majority of her works, _Inuyasha_ has a darker tone more akin to _Mermaid Saga_ and, having been serialized in _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_ from 1996 to 2008, is her longest to date. On March 5, 2009, Rumiko Takahashi released her one-shot _Unmei No Tori_. On March 16, 2009, she collaborated with Mitsuru Adachi, creator of _Touch_ and _Cross Game_, to release a one-shot called _My Sweet Sunday_. Her latest manga series, _Kyōkai no Rinne_ started on April 22, 2009. This is Rumiko Takahashi's first new manga series since her previous manga series _Inuyasha_ ended in June 2008. Takahashi will start her new series _MAO_ in the issue #23 of _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_ on May 8, 2019.[15]

_Urusei Yatsura_, _Maison Ikkoku_, _Ranma ½_, and _Inuyasha_ manga were all published in English in the United States by Viz Comics. Their 1989 release of _Urusei Yatsura_ halted after only a few volumes were translated, but will see a re-print in 2019.[16]

Rumiko Takahashi started a new manga series entitled _MAO_ in _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_ issue #23 released on May 8, 2019.[17]


Animation

In 1981, _Urusei Yatsura_ became the first of Takahashi's works to be animated. This series first aired on Japanese television on October 14, and went through multiple director changes during its run. Though the 195-episode TV series ended in March 1986, _Urusei Yatsura_ was kept alive in anime form through OVA and movie releases through 1991. Most notable of the series directors was Mamoru Oshii, who made _Beautiful Dreamer_, the second _Urusei Yatsura_ movie. AnimEigo has released the entire TV series and all of the OVAs and movies except for _Beautiful Dreamer_ (which was released by Central Park Media in the U.S.) in the United States in English-subtitled format, with English dubs also made for the first two TV episodes (as _Those Obnoxious Aliens_) and for all of the movies.

Kitty Films, the studio that produced _Urusei Yatsura_ with animation assistance from Studio Pierrot and then Studio Deen, continued their cooperation and adapted Rumiko Takahashi's second work, _Maison Ikkoku_ in 1986; it debuted the week after the final TV episode of _UY_. The TV series ran for 96 episodes, 3 OVAs, a movie and also a live-action movie. Studio Deen also provided animation duties on _Maison Ikkoku_ and _Ranma_.

_Maris the Chojo_, _Fire Tripper_, and _Laughing Target_ were all made into OVAs during the mid-80s. Her stories _Mermaid's Forest_ and _Mermaid's Scar_ were also made as OVAs in Japan on 1991. They were all released, subtitled in English, in the U.S.

In 1989, Kitty Animation produced its last major series, _Ranma ½_. The series went through ups and downs in ratings until Kitty Animation finally went out of business. _Ranma ½_ was never concluded in animated form despite being 161 episodes and two movies in length. The TV series ended in 1992 amid internal turmoil within Kitty; Kitty and Studio Deen continued to produce _Ranma_ OVAs until 1996.

Sunrise was the first studio after Kitty Animation to adapt a major Rumiko Takahashi series. _Inuyasha_ debuted in 2000 and ended in 2004. The TV series went on for 167 episodes and spawned four major films. The first anime ended before the manga did, thus wrapping up inconclusively. However, a second Inuyasha anime series called _Inuyasha the Final Act_ debuted in Japan in the fall of 2009 and ended in March 2010, finishing the series.

Viz Communications has released the anime of _Maison Ikkoku_, _Ranma_ and _Inuyasha_ in English, in both subtitled and dubbed formats.

The year 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of _Weekly Shōnen Sunday_ and the 30th anniversary of the first publication of _Urusei Yatsura_, and Rumiko Takahashi's manga work was honoured in _It's a Rumic World_, a special exhibition held from July 30 to August 11 at the Matsuya Ginza department store in Tokyo. Several new pieces of animation accompanied the exhibit, including new half-hour _Ranma ½_ and _Inuyasha_ (_Black Tetsusaiga_) OVAs and an introductory sequence featuring characters from _Urusei Yatsura_, _Ranma_ and _Inuyasha_ (starring the characters' original anime voice talents), which has become a popular video on YouTube. The _It's a Rumic World_ exhibit was scheduled to re-open in Sendai in December 2008, at which time a new half-hour _Urusei Yatsura_ OVA was scheduled to premiere. A special DVD release containing all three new OVAs was announced as coming out on January 29, 2010, with a trailer posted in September 2009. However, it is not known whether any of the new episodes will ever be released outside Japan.

_Rumiko Takahashi Anthology_, animated by TMS Entertainment adapts many of her short stories from the 80s. It features her stories _The Tragedy of P_, _The Merchant of Romance_, _Middle-Aged Teen_, _Hidden in the Pottery_, _Aberrant Family F_, _As Long As You Are Here_, _One Hundred Years of Love_, _In Lieu of Thanks_, _Living Room Lovesong_, _House of Garbage_, _One Day Dream_, _Extra-Large Size Happiness_, and _The Executive's Dog_. Also, a TV series of _Mermaid Saga_ was produced in 2003, animating 8 of her stories.


Popularity and impact in the West

Many of Takahashi's works have been translated into English, as well as other European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can have a lot of fun reading them."[18]

Artists that have cited Takahashi and her work as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley on his series _Scott Pilgrim_,[19] American Colleen Coover on her erotic series _Small Favors_,[20] Japanese Chihiro Tamaki on her manga _Walkin' Butterfly_,[21] Chinese-Australian Queenie Chan,[22] and Thai Wisut Ponnimit.[23] Scottish rock band Urusei Yatsura named themselves after her first work.[24] Matt Bozon, creator of the _Shantae_ video game series, cited _Ranma ½_ as a big influence on his work.[25]

Takahashi was one of the recipients of the Inkpot Award at the 1994 San Diego Comic-Con.[26]

In 2016, ComicsAlliance listed Takahashi as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition, stating that "Any one of her projects would be the career highlight of another talent."[27] In 2017, Takahashi was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame as part of the 2016 class.[28]

In July 2018, Takahashi was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame.[29] She was previously nominated for entry in 2014, 2016 and 2017.[30][31]

In January 2019, Takahashi won the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême, becoming the second woman and second manga artist to win the award at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.[32][33]
