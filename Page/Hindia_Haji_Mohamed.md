Context

Somalia is a dangerous country for journalists. Reporters Without Borders rank Somalia on the "Press Freedom Index" as 172 out of 180 countries for press freedom. Mohamed was the 38th journalist to be killed there since 2010. Journalists in Somalia are subject to frequent attacks, kidnappings and intimidation. Somalia also has strict media restrictions, as well as heavy fines for violations. Some journalists in Somalia have been forced to flee the country. There are limited resources devoted to ensuring the safety of journalists safe, which makes them targets during the civil war.[24]


Impact

There have been many deaths over the course of the year that Mohamed was killed. Mustafa Abdi Noor was killed in an hotel attack. Daud Ali Moalin worked at Radio Baidoa and was assassinated and Mohamed A. Moalin Universal TV and was killed in a suicide attack at the Jazeera Hotel. The Al-Shabaab have been active in Mogadishu since 2006 and the government has been trying to push them out of their country. They have been part of numerous terrorist attacks for many years.[25]


Reactions

Irina Bokova, the director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, said, "I condemn the killing of Hindiya Haji Mohamed. Pluralistic and independent media are vital to freedom of expression and cannot operate without the dedicated work of journalists. It is essential for Somali society as a whole that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice."[26]

Omar Frank Osman, secretary of NUSOJ, said, "We all mourn this disastrous assassination of Hindiyo Haji Mohamed which is another reminder of the risks Somali journalists continue to face regularly. This was targeted killing, deliberately meant to eliminate Hindiyo. Those who deliberately seek to harm unsuspecting members of the public, including journalists, need to be condemned and hunted down to answer for their actions."[27]
