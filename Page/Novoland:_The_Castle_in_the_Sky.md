Synopsis

In ancient times, because of their ability to fly, the Yu Tribe is regarded as gods by all. They live away from the people high up in the mountains, busy constructing a castle in the sky, much to the envy of others. One day, the castle explodes, causing an uproar among the Yu Tribe. A human girl, Yi Fuling (Guan Xiaotong) who came to observe the castle, was being mistakenly pointed as the suspect. The king of Yu Tribe, Feng Tianyi (Zhang Ruoyun) tries his best to save and protect her, truly believing that she's innocent of the accusation. As it turned out, it was a faction of the Yu Tribe trying to start a war with the humans in order to expand their control. When Tianyi understands the source of resentment, he and Fuling set out to defuse the growing hostility and impending war.
