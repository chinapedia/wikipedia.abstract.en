SANTO GIORGIO is a Neoclassical-style, Roman Catholic church located on Piazza XXX Aprile, in the town Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.[1]


History

A church at the site was present since the 13th century, but the present structure was erected in 1792-1798 by Cosimo Morelli. The classic fa√ßade (1842) with giant order pilasters and a triangular tympanum was designed by Agostino Benedettelli. The church is dedicated to Saints George, Stefano, and Martin of Tours. The interior houses a 16th-century wooden crucifix and a venerated icon of a _Madonna della Salute_ attributed to Giovanni Battista Salvi, known as Sassoferrato, donated to the church in 1666.[2]
