For 2017, Shwartzman stayed in Formula Renault 2.0, but decided to switch to the R-ace GP team.[4] He lost thirteen points to his teammate Will Palmer and finished in the third place in the driver standings, but was able to win seven races, having podium finish at all rounds excepting Red Bull Ring.

Shwartzman made his Toyota Racing Series debut during the 2018 off-season, competing for M2 Competition.[6] He finished all fifteen races in the top-five and was the only driver in the season to do so. He won the Denny Hulme Memorial Trophy and the series title, ahead of the M2 teammates Richard Verschoor and Marcus Armstrong, who have raced in the series in 2017.[7][8]

FIA Formula 3 European Championship

In September 2017, Shwartzman tested the European Formula 3 machinery with Prema Powerteam.[9] After his tests with Prema he was included into the Ferrari Driver Academy.[10] In December 2017, it was confirmed that he will race for Prema in 2018 FIA Formula 3 European Championship.[11] Shwartzman took his first European Formula 3 win in the third Spielberg race.[12] With his second win in the season finale he outscored another Ferrari Driver Academy member Marcus Armstrong in the drivers' standings, completing the top-three with claiming the rookie title.[13]

FIA Formula 3 Championship

Following the merger of the FIA Formula 3 European Championship and GP3 Series into the new FIA Formula 3 Championship in 2019, Prema announced Shwartzman as one of its drivers for the inaugural season.[14] Shwartzman qualified on pole for the first Barcelona race and initially finished the race in second before being promoted to race winner following a time penalty to Christian Lundgaard. [15][16] Following day, Shwartzman finished fourth, and take the third place at qualifying in Circuit Paul Ricard and finished second in the first race, losing only to his team-mate Jehan Daruvala. After starting from seventh in the grid, at the sprint race, he took second victory. At the Red Bull Ring he qualified only twelfth, after technical issues. He up to 5th in the first race, and in second race he was battled with Marcus Armstrong for the victory, but at the final lap made contact. Armstrong later retired, as Shwartzman took the victory, but was given a five-second time penalty for causing a collision, and down to third, behind race winner HWA Racelab driver Jake Hughes, who took victory here last year, and Jehan Daruvala. At Silverstone he qualified sixth. It looked like he would finish in the same position, but with 3 laps remaining he overtook Christian Lundgaard. Later, Pedro Piquet also overtook him. On Sunday, he finished second with the fastest lap, behind Hitech Grand Prix and race winner Leonardo Pulcini who took two victories in the 2018 GP3 Series – at Sochi and Abu Dhabi – all victories for the Italian were at the feature races.
