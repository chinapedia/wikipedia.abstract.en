CHINESE INDONESIANS have lived in Bangka Belitung Islands, Indonesia for centuries.[1][2] Bangka Belitung is one of the regions with the largest Chinese population in Indonesia besides Java, Riau, Eastern Sumatra and West Borneo.[3]

Chinese came to Bangka-Belitung Islands in several waves during 1700-1800s. Many Hakkas from various parts of Guangdong came to the islands to work as tin miners.

Bangka Island Chinese is quite different from Belitung Island Chinese because the first Chinese generation who were entirely male arrived in Bangka Island left China without women, they took local women as wives, so many Chinese in Bangka had mixed blood (_Indonesian_:"Peranakan"), especially those who lived in the Eastern part of the island. Bangka Island Chinese language is a creole language mixed together Malay and Hakka words. Belitung Chinese is considered purer (_Indonesian_: "totok") because they were the first generation who arrived on the island, and they did so with chinese wives after 1800's. Although some town in Bangka Island, purer degree of Hakka can be heard as well, the Hakka-Malay mixture language is uniquely of Bangka Island Chinese. In Belitung, Chinese people adapted well with local culture. They changed their clothes and would like to wear Malay baju kurung with kebaya, pants with sarong.[4] Hakka language is spoken among majority Chinese with few Hokkien.
