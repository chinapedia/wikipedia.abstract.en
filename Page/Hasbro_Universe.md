The HASBRO UNIVERSE refers to several shared fictional universes featuring characters from several franchises owned by toy company Hasbro.[1]


List of continuities

Marvel Comics (1979–2004)

Since 1979, Marvel Comics has published its own comic books based on _G.I. Joe_, _Micronauts_, _Rom_ and _Transformers_, set in Earth-616, known as the Marvel Universe. However, the _Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_ series were later established non-canon (they are set on Earth-91274). Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were _The X-Men and the Micronauts_ (guest starring the X-Men) and _New Avengers/Transformers_ (guest starring the New Avengers). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to _Rom_ and _Micronauts_ have occurred since.

Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions (1983–1987)

From 1983 to 1987, Sunbow Productions andMarvel Productions developed the series _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_, _The Transformers_, _Jem_ and _Inhumanoids_. These series had been hinted to share the same universe, mostly due to the appearance of the character named Hector Ramirez.

Dreamwave Productions (2004)

On 2004, Dreamwave Productions published _Transformers/G.I. Joe_, another crossover set in the time of World War I, and including a one-shot titled _Transformers/G.I. Joe: Divided Front_. This series only lasted six issues, due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.

IDW Publishing / Hasbro Comic Book Universe (2005–2018)

Between 2005 and 2008, IDW Publishing acquired the license to make comics based on _Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_, but neither have ever shared the same continuity before. On 2016, IDW announced the Hasbro Reconstruction branding along with the crossover event _Revolution_, which officially set _Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_ to co-exist within one same universe, with the addition of _Micronauts_, _Rom_, _Action Man_ and _M.A.S.K._[2][3] On 2017, _Visionaries_ debuted on the aftermath of the event series _First Strike_.[4] This comic book continuity will be rebooted for March 2019 after the miniseries _Transformers: Unicron_.[5]

Hasbro's HasLab (2011)

Hasbro's former comic book imprint HasLab published for 2011's San Diego Comic-Con the one-shot issue "Unit:E", where characters from various franchises joined forces into a new adventure. This project would be rebooted as IDW's _Revolution_.

Hasbro's Allspark / Transformers Aligned Continuity (2010–2017)

The Transformers Aligned Continuity (comprising the animated series _Transformers: Prime_ and _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_; currently owned by Hasbro's Allspark) features a reference to M.A.S.K. as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle.[6][7]

Grey Global Group / HasCon (2017–present)

Grey Global Group published a special one-shot titled "When Worlds Collide" to celebrate 2017's HasCon, the first convention exclusively for Hasbro brands.


Possible continuities

_Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_ film series

On March 28, 2014, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura announced that he is open to doing a crossover film between the _Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_ film series (Paramount Pictures and MGM).[8] On June 23, di Bonaventura stated that a crossover was not likely to happen,[9] but on July 9, he reassured there would still be a possibility.[10] On October 23, 2015, Chu confirmed his intentions to make a crossover film between _Jem_ (Universal Pictures) with _Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_.[11] On October 29, he hinted about _Transformers_ possibly doing crossover with other Hasbro products.[12] On January 18, 2017, D. J. Caruso has stated that when he was in talks to be _GI Joe 3_'s director, the discussion included a Transformers and G.I. Joe meeting. However, Paramount did not think the time was right to do so because they did not want to infringing on Michael Bay's running of the _Transformers_ films.[13]

Five-property cinematic universe

On December 15, 2015, Hasbro agreed with Paramount to a deal creating a five-property movie universe by financing unit Allspark Pictures and distributed by Paramount Pictures. This new universe will consist of the current _G.I. Joe_ film series alongside future film adaptations based on _M.A.S.K._, _Micronauts_, _Rom_ and _Visionaries_.[14] On April 21, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Lindsey Beer, Michael Chabon, Cheo Hodari Coker, Joe Robert Cole, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Perlman, Nicole Riegel, Geneva Robertson and Brian K. Vaughan have joined the writers' room for the cinematic universe.[15]
