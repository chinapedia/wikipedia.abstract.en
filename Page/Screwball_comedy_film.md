BabyPoster2.jpg'' (1938) is a screwball comedy from the genre's classic period.]] Clip_from_My_Man_Godfrey.ogg'']] SCREWBALL COMEDY is a subgenre of the romantic comedy genre that became popular during the Great Depression, originating in the early 1930s and thriving until the early 1940s. It is widely known for satirizing the traditional love story. Many secondary characteristics of this genre are similar to film noir, but it distinguishes itself for being characterized by a female that dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged.[1] The two engage in a humorous battle of the sexes, which was a new theme for Hollywood and audiences at the time.[2] What sets the screwball comedy apart from the generic romantic comedy is that "screwball comedy puts its emphasis on a funny spoofing of love, while the more traditional romantic ultimately accents love."[3] Other elements of the screwball comedy include fast-paced, overlapping repartee, farcical situations, escapist themes, physical battle of the sexes, disguise and masquerade, and plot lines involving courtship and marriage.[4] Screwball comedies often depict social classes in conflict, as in _It Happened One Night_ (1934) and _My Man Godfrey_ (1936).[5] Some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies.


History

Screwball comedy has proved to be one of the most popular and enduring film genres. _It Happened One Night_ (1934),[6] is often credited as the first true screwball, though _Bombshell_ starring Jean Harlow preceded it by a year. Although many film scholars agree that its classic period had effectively ended by 1942,[7] elements of the genre have persisted or have been paid homage to in contemporary films. Still more, other film scholars argue that the screwball comedy lives on.

During the Great Depression, there was a general demand for films with a strong social class critique and hopeful, escapist-oriented themes. The screwball format arose largely as a result of the major film studios' desire to avoid censorship by the increasingly enforced Hays Code. In order to incorporate prohibited risqué elements into their plots, filmmakers resorted to handling these elements covertly. Verbal sparring between the sexes served as a stand-in for physical, sexual tension.[8] Though some film scholars, such as William K. Everson argue "screwball comedies were not so much rebelling against the Production Code as they were attacking–and ridiculing– the dull, lifeless respectability that the Code insisted on for family viewing.[9]

The screwball comedy has close links with the theatrical genre of farce,[10] and some comic plays are also described as screwball comedies. Many elements of the screwball genre can be traced back to such stage plays as _Lysistrata_ by Aristophanes, William Shakespeare's _Much Ado About Nothing_, _As You Like It_ and _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ and Oscar Wilde's _The Importance of Being Earnest_. Other genres with which screwball comedy is associated include slapstick, situation comedy, romantic comedy and bedroom farce.


Characteristics

They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship and marriage or remarriage. These traits can be seen in both _It Happened One Night_ and _My Man Godfrey_ (1936). The film critic Andrew Sarris has defined the screwball comedy as "a sex comedy without the sex."[11]

Like farce, screwball comedies often involve masquerade and disguise in which a character or characters resort to secrecy. Sometimes screwball comedies feature male characters cross-dressing, further contributing to elements of masquerade (_Bringing Up Baby_ (1938) _I Was a Male War Bride_ (1949), and _Some Like It Hot_ (1959)). At first, the couple seem mismatched and even hostile to each other but eventually overcome their differences in an amusing or entertaining way that leads to romance. Often this mismatch comes about when the man is of a lower social class than the woman (_Bringing Up Baby_, _Holiday_, both 1938). The final romantic union is often planned by the woman from the outset, and the man is seemingly oblivious to this. In _Bringing Up Baby,_ the woman says to a third party: "He's the man I'm going to marry. He doesn't know it, but I am."

The-Lady-Eve.jpg'', Jean (center, played by Barbara Stanwyck) passes herself off as an upper-class woman.]] These pictures also offered a kind of cultural escape valve: a safe battleground on which to explore serious issues such as class under a comedic and non-threatening framework.[12] Class issues are a strong component of screwball comedies: the upper class are represented as idle, pampered, and having difficulty coping with the real world. Some critics believe that the portrayal of the upper class in _It Happened One Night_ was brought about by the Great Depression, and the financially struggling moviegoing public's desire to see the rich upper class taught a lesson in humanity. (See also _My Man Godfrey_, 1936.) By contrast, when lower-class people attempt to pass themselves off as upper-class, they are able to do so with relative ease (_The Lady Eve_, 1941).

Another common element of the screwball comedy is fast-talking, witty repartee (_You Can't Take It With You_ (1937) and _His Girl Friday_ (1940)). This stylistic device did not originate in the genre (although it may be argued to have reached its zenith there): it is also found in many of the old Hollywood cycles, including gangster films and romantic comedies.

Screwball comedies also tend to contain ridiculous, farcical situations, such as in _Bringing Up Baby_, where a couple must take care of a pet leopard during much of the film. Slapstick elements are also frequently present, such as the numerous pratfalls Henry Fonda takes in _The Lady Eve_ (1941).

One subgenre of screwball is known as the comedy of remarriage, in which characters divorce and then remarry one another (_The Awful Truth_ (1937), _The Philadelphia Story_ (1940)). Some scholars point to this frequent device as evidence of the shift in the American moral code, as it showed freer attitudes toward divorce (though the divorce always turns out to have been a mistake).

Another subgenre of screwball comedy has the woman chasing a man who is oblivious to or disinterested in her. Examples include Barbara Stanwyck chasing Henry Fonda (_The Lady Eve_ (1941), Marion Davies chasing Antonio Moreno (_The Cardboard Lover_ (1928), Marion Davies chasing Bing Crosby (_Going Hollywood_ (1933), and Carole Lombard chasing William Powell (_My Man Godfrey_ (1936).

The philosopher Stanley Cavell has noted that many classic screwball comedies turn on an interlude in the state of Connecticut (_Bringing Up Baby_, _The Lady Eve_, _The Awful Truth_).[13] In _Christmas in Connecticut_ (1945), the action moves to Connecticut and remains there for the duration of the film.

Many of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s also feature screwball comedy plots, notably _The Gay Divorcee_ (1934) and _Top Hat_ (1935). The Eddie Cantor musicals _Whoopee!_ (1930) and _Roman Scandals_ (1933), and slapstick road movies such as _Six of a Kind_ (1934) include screwball elements. Some of the Joe E Brown comedies also fall into this category, particularly _Broadminded_ (1931) and _Earthworm Tractors_ (1936).

Elements of classic screwball comedy often found in more recent films which might otherwise simply be classified as romantic comedies include the "battle of the sexes" (_Down with Love_, _How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_), witty repartee (_Down with Love_), and the contrast between the wealthy and the middle class (_You've Got Mail_, _Two Weeks Notice_). Many of Elvis Presley's films from the 1960s had drawn, consciously or unconsciously, the many characteristics of the screwball comedy genre. Some examples are _Double Trouble_, _Tickle Me_, _Girl Happy_ and _Live A Little, Love A Little_. Modern updates on screwball comedy also sometimes are categorized as black comedy (_Intolerable Cruelty_, which also features a twist on the classic screwball element of divorce and remarriage). The Coen Brothers often include screwball elements in a film which may not otherwise be considered screwball or even a comedy.

The Golmaal movies, a series of Hindi-language Indian films, have been described as a screwball comedy franchise.[33][34]


Screwball comedy elements in other genres

In his 2008 production of the classic Beaumarchais comedy _The Marriage of Figaro_, author William James Royce trimmed the five-act play down to three acts and labeled it a "classic screwball comedy". The playwright made Suzanne the central character, endowing her with all the feisty comedic strengths of her classic film counterparts. In his adaptation, entitled _One Mad Day!_ (a play on Beaumarchais' original French title) Royce underscored all of the elements of the classic screwball comedy, suggesting that Beaumarchais may have had a hand in the origins of the genre.

The television series _Moonlighting_ (1985–1989), _Married... with Children_ (1987–1997), _NewsRadio_ (1995–1999), _Gilmore Girls_ (2000–2007), _The O.C._ (2003–2007), _Standoff_ (2006–2007), and _Gossip Girl_ (2007–2012) have also adapted elements of the screwball comedy genre for the small screen.

The second part of the 1978 film _Superman_, set in fictional Metropolis, takes on a screwball tone after the seriousness of the original story.

_The Adventures of Tintin_ comic _The Castafiore Emerald_ contains settings, plots, comic devices, and character types that share many similarities to screwball comedies.

The plot of _Corrupting Dr. Nice_, a science fiction novel by John Kessel involving time travel, is modeled on films such as _The Lady Eve_ and _Bringing Up Baby_.[35]
