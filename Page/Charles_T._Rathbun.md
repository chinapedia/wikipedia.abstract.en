Congregational_Church_of_West_Stockbridge_MA.jpg, West Stockbridge, 1881.]] CHARLES T. RATHBUN was an American architect who practiced in Pittsfield, Massachusetts during the second half of the nineteenth century.


Life and career

Rathbun was born in Pittsfield in 1828.[1] His early life is unknown, but it is probable that he first trained as a carpenter. In the 1850s he went to New York, where he worked for ecclesiastical architect John W. Priest.[2] Priest is known to have worked in the Pittsfield area, possibly explaining the connection.[3] He had returned to Pittsfield by January 1858,[4] a year before Priest's death. At that time he established himself as an architect, practicing alone. He worked as such until 1894, when he established a partnership with George C. Harding, Rathbun & Harding. The two remained together until 1899, when Rathbun retired. At this time, he was noted as probably being the oldest architect in Berkshire County.[5] Harding practiced alone until 1901, when he established the notable local firm of Harding & Seaver.[6]

On February 14, 1848, Rathbun married Mary Sharp in Pittsfield. He died there on July 22, 1908.[7]


Legacy

As least two buildings designed by Rathbun have been individually placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and several others contribute to listed historic districts.
