BRENDA WEBB is an indigenous Australian singer.[1] Her debut single "Little Black Girl" was nominated for an ARIA Award in 1994 for Best Independent Release.

"Little Black Girl" was released in 1993 and received radio airplay all over the country. Another song "Melting Pot" (a cover a Blue Mink song) was used by NSW Aboriginal Land Council for an anti-racism campaign. She went on to act in _A Country Practice_ and _Neighbours_.[2][3]

"Little Black Girl" was originally credited as being written by Webb and Wendy May Dempster but was actually written primarily by Dempster and Christopher Lloyd Bowen who took legal action soon after the songs release. The issue was settled in 1996 and Webb publicly acknowledged that she was not the main writer.[4]

Webb also wrote Puff the Playful Rabbit.
