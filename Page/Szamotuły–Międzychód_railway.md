The SZAMOTUŁY–MIĘDZYCHÓD RAILWAY is a former Polish 57-kilometre long railway line, that connected Szamotuły with Międzychód.


Opening

The line was opened in four stages:[1][2]

-   October 1907: Szamotuły - Binino, Chrzypsko Wielkie - Międzychód
-   April 1908: Binino - Nojewo, Nojewo - Chrzypsko Wielkie


Modernisation

In 1977-1978 a major overhaul of the line took place, including stabilising embankments, replacement of wooden sleepers with concrete sleepers and replacement of the track.[3]

In 2004, the first plans to take over the line from PKP PLK and launch passenger services were announced, but this did not lead to anything.[4] In 2012, a proposal was made to build a cycle route along the course of the railway, but this met negative feedback from residents.[5]


Closure

In 1995, passenger traffic was suspended along the route. Freight services were supsended from 3 May 1996 between Sieraków Wielkopolski and Szamotuły.[6] In later years, freight trains only ran between Sieraków Wielkopolski and Międzychód.[7]

Despite the suspension of traffic on the line in 1996, the railway line remained in the list of railway lines of national importance until 2000.[8][9]


Usage

In the 1970s, passenger traffic from the station in Sierakowie was about 4,800 people per month, but this steadily decreased to 3,200 people in 1990.[10] Since 2000, the line has occasionally been used for tourist trains using steam engines.[11]

In August 2016, the section between Sieraków Wielkopolski and Lesionkami was used for manual trolley rides.
