HARRY KIVIJÄRVI (1931-2010) was a sculptor from Finland.

Kivijärvi’s most famous works, such as the monument to the memory of president Paasikivi, consist of non-representational forms, sculpted from black stone, whose carefully worked surfaces alternate between smoothly polished areas and sections that have been left rough.[1][2]

Kivijärvi was born in Turku and studied in Turku Drawing School 1947-1950 and in Academy of Arts 1950-1952.[3] Kivijärvi started his career in art as a painter. He took up sculpture after spending time in Rome 1955-1956. His first sculptures were small, figurative metal sculptures.[4] The first non-figurative sculpture was monument to Uno Cygnaeus in Hämeenlinna in middle of 1960s. During his career Kivijärvi made many public memorials and monuments.[5]
