AILI ELINA KARJALAINEN (née. SARASTE, 3 June 1927 Viipuri – 14 August 2006 Kuopio) was a journalist and author from Finland. She is best known for books for children.[1]

The protagonist of many of Karjalainen's books is Uppo-Nalle, a teddybear who loves poetry. The first Uppo-Nalle book was published in 1977. It was followed by 21 other Uppo-Nalle books. Karjalainen wrote also biographies, a crime novel and other books, in total around 40 books.[2]

As a journalist Karjalainen worked for Savon Sanomat and Suomen Kuvalehti as well as a freelancer. She was interested in people, and wrote many reportages about life of ordinary people outside of big cities.[3]

Karjalainen got the passion to read from her childhood home in Viipuri. Her need to write emerged from series of crisis she encountered in age of eleven: First her mother died, then Winter war started and all Finns had to leave Viipuri.[4]
