Reception

Jim McLennan from "Girls with Guns", wrote: "The action here seems restrained; a little gunplay and some minor martial arts, but nothing particularly memorable. The sexual scenes make the made-for-TV origins painfully clear, with sheets that appear to be velcro’d to Phillips’ breasts, when she doesn't have her elbows elegantly positioned in front of them. Still, there's enough here in the central character to make me want to see more...and lo, what's this coming along?"[1] Charles Tatum from "Tatum Reviews Archive" gave the film two out of five stars and stated: "The story has been done to death, and the film makers cannot decide which audience they want to go for- switching sex scenes with cutesy scenes between the killer cyborg and the adorable kid that are lifted right out of "Terminator 2." Space Maggot applauds Phillips, and shoots a vote of 3."[2] Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club said: "For better or worse, but mainly for worse, Chameleon pounces upon virtually every futuristic-android cliché known to humanity. But what's even more damaging than the film's lack of originality is its moribund pace, which robs it of what little energy it possesses. Even as leering masturbation fodder, Chameleon is a dud, as Cooper's main contribution as a director seems to be his incredible ability to film sex scenes in a way that titillates no one and covers more flesh than a convent in Alaska."[3] Robert Pardi from TV Guide, gave the film two out four stars.[4]

Chameleon was nominated for two awards. One "OFTA Television Award" for "Best Makeup/Hairstyling in a Motion Picture or Miniseries"[5] and one Young Artist Award for "Best Performance in a TV Movie/Pilot/Mini-Series or Series - Supporting Young Actor" for Eric Lloyd.[6]
