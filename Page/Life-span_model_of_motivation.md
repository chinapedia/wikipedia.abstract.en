According to the LIFE-SPAN MODEL OF MOTIVATION the personal goals that individuals set are a function of the opportunities and challenges that are present in their social environment. Personal goals are an important determinant to the way individuals direct their development.[1] The model introduces four key processes; channeling, choice, co-agency and compensation.[2]


The 4 C's

Developmental trajectories are _channeled_ by the social environment, which represents the "opportunity space" for development.[3] In addition, individuals are active agents in constructing their development, and hence make _choices_ regarding their goals and commitments. Given that development occurs in a social context, others in the environment such as peers, family members or teachers have a role in _co-regulation_ of development. And last, success and failures in personal goals and tasks serve as feedback and basis for _compensation_ in order to optimize development.[4]
