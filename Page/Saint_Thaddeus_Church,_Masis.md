The foundations of the church were laid in 1991. Its construction,initiated and financed by the philanthropist Hrant Vardanyan,started in 2005. In 2015 the construction works were completed by his sons Mikayel and Karen Vardanyans.[1] The St. Thaddeus Church was consecrated by His Holiness Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin II on October 4, 2015, who blessed the church and named it in honor of Apostle St. Thaddeus. At the entrance to the church, a spacious facility for candle burning is situated. In the courtyard of the church, a water fountain commemorating Hrant Vardanyan is located.

The cross-stone was hewn out of a single stone (Artak Hambartsumyan[2])


Architecture

The architects of the St. Thaddeus Church are Arthur and Anahit Tarkhanyans.[3] The church combines the traditions of Armenian church construction and contemporary architectural and civil-engineering solutions. The church consists of three tiers, and is notable for its design and massing solutions.The interior is shaped by two superimposedsquares to form anoctahedronsymbolizing Eternity and Pure Faith,which determine the entire structural system of the edifice. The dome is resting on crisscrossing arches. The church has original wall-facing both outside and inside. From the center to edges, the coloring is getting lighter, whereas from the foundations to the dome, the coloring is getting darker. 33 commandments of the Bible are carved on the walls of the church.
