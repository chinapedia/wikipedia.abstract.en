(MEM) proposed in a NASA study in 1963, a manned mission to Mars concept that failed to pan out.]] Fictional representations of Mars have been popular for over a century. Interest in Mars has been stimulated by the planet's dramatic red color, by early scientific speculations that its surface conditions might be capable of supporting life, and by the possibility that Mars could be colonized by humans in the future. Almost as popular as stories about Mars are stories about Martians engaging in activity (frequently invasions) away from their home planet.

In the 20th century, actual spaceflights to the planet Mars, including seminal events such as the first man-made object to impact the surface of Mars in 1971, and then later the first landing of "the first mechanized device to successfully operate on Mars" in 1976 (in the Viking program by the United States), inspired a great deal of interest in Mars-related fiction. Exploration of the planet has continued in the 21st century on to the present day.


Mars in fiction before Mariner

Before the Mariner 4 spacecraft arrived at Mars in July 1965 and dispelled some of the more exotic theories about the planet, the conventional image of Mars was shaped by the observations of the astronomers Giovanni Schiaparelli, Camille Flammarion and Percival Lowell. Flammarion assumed its red surface came from red-colored vegetation,[1] and Schiaparelli observed what he took to be linear features on the face of Mars, which he thought might be water channels. Because the Italian for channels is _canali_, English translations tended to render the word as "canals", implying artificial construction. Lowell's books on Mars expanded on this notion of Martian canals, and a standard model of Mars as a drying, cooling, dying world was established. It was frequently speculated that ancient Martian civilizations had constructed irrigation works that spanned the planet in an attempt at saving their dying world. This concept spawned a large number of science fiction scenarios.

The following works of fiction deal with the planet itself, with any assumed Martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape.

Novels and short stories

First ventures

Several early modern writers, including Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) and Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), hypothesized contact with Mars. Early science fiction about Mars often involved the first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more often for the purposes of exploration.

Early works to 1910

-   _Across the Zodiac_ (1880) by Percy Greg. The narrator flies his craft, the "Astronaut," to visit diminutive beings on Mars.
-   _Uranie_ (1889, translated as Urania in 1890) by Camille Flammarion. A young astronomer and his fiancée are killed in a ballooning accident, and are reincarnated in new bodies on Mars.
-   _Melbourne and Mars: My Mysterious Life on Two Planets_ (1889) by Joseph Fraser. A sick man named Jacobs starts having visions in his sleep, which turns out to be a telepathic link between him and a child called Charlie Frankston, his other self on Mars, who lives in a technological utopia.
-   _Mr. Stranger's Sealed Packet_ (1889) by Hugh MacColl. People from Earth travel to Mars in a flying machine, and find peaceful Martians that are technologically inferior to humans with a few exceptions like voice-recording devices and electric lighting.
-   _A Plunge into Space_ (1890) by Robert Cromie. Dedicated to Jules Verne, the character Henry Barnett learns how to control the ethereal force which combines electricity and gravity and "which permeates all material things, all immaterial space", and secretly builds a globular spaceship called the "Steel Globe". Barnett and some friends travel to Mars and find a society where there is no need for politicians, and Martians who travel in airships or flying through levitation.
-   _Unveiling a Parallel_ (1893) by Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant. The authors use a journey to Mars as the frame for a utopian feminist novel.
-   _Journey to Mars_ (1894) by Gustavus W. Pope. An adventure story that may have influenced Edgar Rice Burroughs's later books.
-   _A Prophetic Romance_ (1896) by John McCoy. Reversing the usual pattern, the book brings a Martian visitor to Earth for a utopian novel.
-   _Auf zwei Planeten_ (1897) by Kurd Lasswitz. A Martian expedition to Earth takes Earthmen back to visit Mars; interplanetary war follows the initially peaceful contact. Lasswitz's Martians are human in appearance, but with much larger eyes.
-   _The War of the Worlds_ (1898) by H. G. Wells. Features an attack on England by cephalopod-like Martians and their advanced technology to employ fighting machines to decimate the world.
-   _Edison's Conquest of Mars_ (1898) by Garrett P. Serviss. In this Edisonade, Earthmen respond to an attack from Mars with a successful genocide of the Martian race.
-   _A Honeymoon in Space_ (1900), by _George Griffith_. A young couple on a journey through the solar system are captured by hostile Martians.
-   _Gullivar of Mars_ (1905) by Edwin Lester Arnold. An Edwardian fantasy in which Gullivar Jones travels to Mars on a magic carpet and interacts with the slothful but innocent Hithers and the brutish but honorable Thithers.
-   _Doctor Omega_ (1906) by Arnould Galopin. A crew of explorers from Earth visit a Mars inhabited by reptilian mermen, savage dwarf-like beings with long, tentacled arms, bat-men and a race of civilized macrocephalic gnomes.
-   _Le prisonnier de la planète Mars_ [Vampires of Mars] (1908) and its sequel _La guerre des vampires_ [War of the Vampires] (1909) by Gustave Le Rouge. French engineer Robert Darvel is dispatched to Mars by the psychic powers of Hindu Brahmins. On the Red Planet, he runs afoul of hostile, bat-winged, blood-sucking natives, a once-powerful civilization now ruled by the Great Brain.
-   _Red Star_ (1908) by Alexander Bogdanov. The narrator is taken to Mars, which is imagined as a socialist utopia.

1910s and 1920s

-   _Le Mystère des XV_ (1911) by Jean de La Hire. De la Hire's hero, the Nyctalope helps a group of fifteen Earth scientists establish a permanent settlement on Mars.
-   _To Mars via the Moon_ (1911) by Mark Wicks. Telepathic Martians have developed advanced canal-building technology and live in an Utopian socialist society.[2]
-   _A Princess of Mars_ and another 10 Mars stories (1912–1943) by Edgar Rice Burroughs. These stories feature Virginia gentleman John Carter mysteriously transported to a Mars (called Barsoom by the natives) distinguished by fierce warriors and maidens of several species, exotic animals, and mixtures of antique with advanced technology. Burroughs has had many imitators and inspired many nostalgic references.
-   _Aelita_ (1922) by A.N. Tolstoy, among the first Soviet science fiction novels. Describes a Soviet expedition to Mars headed by the engineer Los, who falls in love with the beautiful Aelita, daughter of the Martian Supreme Ruler. Los' companion tries to organize a communist revolution to bring happiness and progress to the ancient, stagnating civilization. The 1924 movie (_Aelita_) followed.
-   ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini '' (1925) by J.-H. Rosny aîné. Humans travel to Mars in a spaceship named Stellarium, and meet two competing races on the planet.

1930s

-   _Last and First Men_ by Olaf Stapledon (1930) has the Second Men in a far future Earth invaded by the utterly alien Martians, who seek our water and air. Parts 8 and 9 detail this protracted and ultimately ruinous war.
-   ''A Conquest of Two Worlds ''by Edmond Hamilton (1932), published in Wonder Stories, reverses the usual kind of contact between the two worlds, with Earth launching a bloody colonial war against the primitive Martians for the planet's resources. Later in the story, they do the same on Jupiter. Martians and Jovians are never depicted as individuals, but several Earth military officers, including one who switches sides to fight for the Jovians, are.
-   _Cat Country_ (1932), by Lao She. A satirical novel about early Communist China, set in a fictional country of catlike people on Mars.[3]
-   _The Swordsman of Mars_ and _Outlaws of Mars_ (both 1933) by Otis Adelbert Kline. Voyages to Mars in the Burroughs style, but set on a Mars of the past. (In Kline's original work, his Mars and Venus stories were set in contemporary [1920s and 1930s] times. Only the reprints from the 1960s state the tales are set in the distant past.)
-   "A Martian Odyssey" (1934), a short story by Stanley G. Weinbaum. A Martian named Tweel (one of several species encountered) is depicted as a sympathetic, intelligent being who thinks as well as or better than a human, but in a convincingly alien manner (a rare feat at any time, but especially striking for pulp science fiction of that era). The story was included in the _Science Fiction Hall of Fame_. Weinbaum also wrote a sequel called "Valley of Dreams" (1934).
-   _Out of the Silent Planet_, by C. S. Lewis (1938), was written as a conscious answer and antithesis to the works of H. G. Wells and Olaf Stapledon. The first book of Lewis's Space Trilogy, a rare example of theological science fiction, it features a philologist named Ransom who arrives by accident on Mars (called Malacandra by the natives). Ransom is at first fearful of being killed in a barbaric rite; but discovers three highly sympathetic, intelligent Martian species, completely different from each other but living in harmony. As in the other books, Lewis' Mars is a dying world; large parts of it are already dead, and various species - such as an intelligent winged species - have become extinct. At the end of the book, it is disclosed that the Martians' ancestors had possessed the technology to build spaceships and invade Earth, but renounced that possibility and stoically resigned themselves to dying out.

1940s

-   _What Mad Universe_ (1949) by Fredric Brown depicts an alternate history where humans discovered anti-gravity in 1903 and launched a war to conquer Mars, which is inhabited by creatures with a culture equal to that of Earth, but militarily weaker. The Martians are decimated and finally accept human colonization. H.G. Wells writes a book denouncing the war and conquest of Mars as an act of unjustified aggression. Later, Martians are drawn into Earth's war with Arcturus.

1950s

-   _The Martian Chronicles_ (1950) by Ray Bradbury. Features human-like Martians with copper-colored skin, human emotions, and telepathic abilities. They have an advanced culture, but the human explorers are greeted with incomprehension. Bradbury wrote many other short stories set on Mars.
-   _Marooned on Mars_ (1952) by Lester del Rey. A young adult novel in which a teenager stows away on the first ship to Mars, causing it to crash during landing. He discovers the underground remains of a native Martian civilization.
-   _Star of Ill-Omen_ (1952) by Dennis Wheatley. Creatures from a dying Mars kidnap humans and take them to the planet so that the Martians can learn how to make nuclear weapons, which they plan to use to invade Earth.
-   _Martians, Go Home_ (1955) by Fredric Brown. An satirical novel about a Martian "invasion" of Earth by proxy.[4] Martians are mischievous loud-mouthed tricksters who take all the fun out of life. They have a special relish for disclosing secrets of any kind, at any level. Therefore, people stop gambling, voting, and buying newspapers. They can materialize anywhere, including in darkened bedrooms, and they see in the dark; offering malicious comments on mating couples in order to depopulate the planet.
-   _No Man Friday_ (1956) by Rex Gordon. A secret British Mars expedition crashes on Mars leaving one survivor who struggles to provide his basic needs from a hostile planet and is eventually discovered by intelligent natives. Inspired the 1964 movie _Robinson Crusoe on Mars_.
-   _Phobos, the Robot Planet_ (aka _Lost: A Moon_) (1955) by Paul Capon. Four humans are abducted and brought to the moon Phobos by an A.I. to study human emotions. During the stay, a young couple ends up on Mars by accident, where they encounter the local fauna and ruins of buildings built by the long gone Martians.
-   _A World's Revival_ (Hebrew: תבל בתחיתה Tevel Be-Thiatah) (1955) by Tzvi Livneh.[5] Takes place some 500 years in the future. This story describes an expedition from a Utopian Socialist Earth arriving at a Mars which is divided between two oppressive, warring empires. The Earth people eventually succeed in fomenting a Martian revolution and overthrowing both empires. The Earth expedition is headed by an Israeli scientist while a leading role among the revolutionaries is played by the "Yunodins", members of a dispersed and persecuted minority explicitly described as "The Jews of Mars". Livneh may have been influenced by _Aelita_; his story also involves interplanetary love.
-   _The Outward Urge_ (1959) by John Wyndham. Describes a comparatively realistic Mars landing, without any Martians.

Living on Mars

By the 1930s, stories about reaching Mars had become somewhat trite, and the focus shifted to Mars as an alien landscape. In the following stories, human contact and basic exploration had taken place sometime in the past; Mars is a setting rather than a goal.

1930s

-   _Dweller in the Gulf_ (1932), _The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis_ (1932) and _Vulthoom_ (1935) by Clark Ashton Smith. Weird tales of horror set on Mars.
-   The _Northwest Smith_ stories (1933–1936) by C. L. Moore. Many of these stories take place on a Mars populated by intelligent, humanoid Martians - and other, more Lovecraftian things.
-   _Legion of Space Series_ (1934–1982) by Jack Williamson. In this future history, humans conquer and colonise Mars in a long series of wars with its inhabitants. All that is long in the past of the series' 30th century plot, where Mars is an established human-settled planet, humans living mainly "in the fertile canal areas" while most of the planet is desert.

1940s

-   _The Secret of Sinharat_, _People of the Talisman_ and another eleven stories published between 1940 and 1964 by Leigh Brackett. These planetary romances describe a desert Mars populated by barbarian warriors and citizens of decadent city-states, coming into explosive contact with Terran civilization. Brackett's _The Sword of Rhiannon_ (1953) shows an oceanic Mars of the distant past, and comes close to pure fantasy.
-   In "Heredity" (1941), a short story by Isaac Asimov, twin brothers who have been raised separately on Earth and Ganymede must work together to operate a Martian fungus farm.
-   Robert A. Heinlein repeatedly used Mars as a setting for his novels and short stories, including:
    -   _The Green Hills of Earth_ (1947). The space poet Rhysling cries out against fellow-humans who had torn down "the slender, fairy-like towers" of the native Martians and replaced them with ugly factories which pollute the Martian canals.
    -   _Red Planet_ (1949). Young adult novel. Includes some very intelligent Martians similar to those mentioned in _Stranger in a Strange Land_, who help human colonists free themselves of tyrannical Earth authorities.
    -   _The Rolling Stones_ (1952). Mars has a major role in the carefree adventures of a space-roving family.
    -   _Podkayne of Mars_ (1962). A teenage girl named Podkayne "Poddy" Fries and her younger brother Clark leave their home on Mars to visit Earth, accompanied by their uncle.
-   _Seetee Ship_ (1949) and _Seetee Shock_ (1950) by Jack Williamson. Mars is colonized by European Fascists and Neo-Nazis, and its main holiday is "Hitler Day", celebration of which often entails bloody riots. The Fascist Mars is one of the main powers contending for control of the mineral wealth of the Asteroid Belt.

1950s and early 1960s

-   _Genesis_ (1951) by H. Beam Piper - The last survivors of the ancient humanoid culture on Mars flee their dying planet about at 100,000 B.C. Near Earth most of the ship's 1500 passengers are killed by meteors, and only two men and six women land in a lifeboat and become the ancestors of humanity. Later Piper "paratime" stories introduce timelines where more Martians survived, resulting in far more technologically advanced Earths by the 20th Century (see 1,[6]).
-   _Omnilingual_ (1957) by H. Beam Piper. Short story in which archaeologists from Earth (returning to the Mars of their distant ancestors; see _Genesis_ above, although the stories are not explicitly related save through the author's Paratime stories), excavating the remains of a humanoid Martian civilization find an entire library they at first cannot read, but then come upon a Rosetta Stone of sorts, giving the story its title.
-   _The Sands of Mars_ (1951) by Arthur C. Clarke involves a reporter who makes the long voyage to a desert Mars to write about the human colonists and discovers native life on Mars.
-   _David Starr, Space Ranger_ (1952) by Isaac Asimov writing as Paul French. A juvenile novel set in the distant future whose title character discovers an unsuspected Martian civilization deep beneath the Red Planet's surface.
-   _The Martian Way_ (1952) by Isaac Asimov. Earth people are scornful of the Martian colonists, who survive by salvaging "space junk", yet their way of life suits the Martian colonists for further space exploration, reaching Saturn first and eventually (Asimov implies) leading the way to the stars.
-   _The Old Martians_ (March 1952) by Rog Phillips. Short story in which Mars is habitable and the ruined cities of the Old Martians have been opened to tourism. The Old Martians still exist in some form and are inimical to the human inhabitants, influencing week minded people to dig up their old and sometimes dangerous artifacts.
-   In Jerome Bixby's 1954 story, _The Holes Around Mars_ puzzle the first astronauts on the planet.
-   _One in Three Hundred_ (1954) by J. T. McIntosh relates the discovery there will be a great increase in the Sun's solar output causing the Earth's oceans to boil away. There being no doubt, and the exact hour and minute of "Boil Away" being confirmed daily, the world's leaders decide to commit themselves to a massive building program for the creation of as many spaceships as possible, more or less suitable for rescuing a small percentage of Earth's population. If enough spaceships can be built in time, the human race might be able to make it to Mars and eke out a living there.
-   In November 1955, Martian Manhunter of DC Comics first appears in _Detective Comics_ #225.
-   _The Badge of Infamy_ (1957) by Lester Del Rey. This novelette describes a colonized Mars run by earth lobbies, including a military-industrial lobby and a health lobby similar to the American Medical Association. A humanitarian doctor seeks to cure a disease that afflicts humans whose metabolisms been chemically altered for Mars adaptation.
-   In _The Sirens of Titan_ by Kurt Vonnegut (1959), previously uninhabited Mars is populated by brainwashed transplants from Earth, leading to the invasion of Earth by the newly created Martian army.
-   In the _Perry Rhodan_ series (1961- ), Mars is the site of an ancient gateway to the "negative side" of the universe. Through this gateway, the planet becomes infested with death crystals whose life-destroying radiation threatens to spread to the Earth.
-   _A Rose for Ecclesiastes_ (1963) by Roger Zelazny. One of the last stories of this type, describing an Earth poet's study of Martian language and literature. The story is deliberately written as an elegiac farewell to the old conception of Mars, complete with canals and an ancient, dying Martian race, as "The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth" (1965) was his farewell to the Venus of earlier science fiction.
-   In Philip K. Dick's fiction, Mars is an almost empty, dry land, with isolated communities and individuals, most of whom do not want to be there. (_Martian Time Slip_ (1964), _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_ (1965)). The characters in these stories could be in small communities in the Arizona desert, but placing them on Mars emphasises their isolation, both from one another and from Earth. In _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ (1968) humans leave radioactive Earth for Mars with Androids illegally escaping from Mars in return with one Android saying "We came back [from Mars] because nobody should have to live there. It wasn't conceived for habitation, at least not within the last billion years. It's so old. You feel it in the stones, the terrible old age". Furthermore, "pre-colonial fiction" is smuggled to Mars by amateur rockets - "To read about cities and huge industrial enterprises, and really successful colonization. You can imagine what it might have been like. What Mars ought to be like".
-   _Destination Mars_ (1963), Hugh Walters' sixth book in the Chris Godfrey of UNEXA series. The first astronaut to explore the planet has been driven mad, and a crew is launched to investigate.
-   _Arm of the Law_ (1958), by Harry Harrison. On Mars, in a backwater burg run by gangsters, the local police constabulary is sent the latest in crime fighting gadgets, an incorruptible and unpredictable robot.

Radio, film and television

-   ''A Trip to Mars '' is a silent film created by Thomas Edison in 1910. Its plot follows a scientist who discovers reverse gravity in his lab. He then, accidentally, applies the dust to himself and flies up to Mars where he makes absurd discoveries before returning home.
-   Marvin the Martian (1948) is one of Looney Tunes' most prominent characters, a soft-spoken villain, whose mission throughout his appearances is to destroy Earth because it "obstructs his view of Venus". In one episode 'Instant Martians' appear, who resemble giant flightless birds, which in another episode are implied to be from Jupiter.
-   The second series of the British radio science fiction program _Journey Into Space_ (1954–1955) deals with a trip to Mars and what the astronauts find there.
-   _The Angry Red Planet_ (1959) – A low-budget horror/science fiction film.
-   The serial '' Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars '' shows Mars being inhabited by intelligent life. Queen Azura rules Mars and turns those who oppose her into Clay Men. At the end of the serial the Clay Men are restored.
-   Several episodes of _Space Patrol_, a 1962 puppet television series, dealt with Mars.
-   _Robinson Crusoe on Mars_ (1964) – A pastiche of the classic Daniel Defoe novel.
-   _Santa Claus Conquers the Martians_ (1964) – Known as one of the worst movies ever made, as such it was made fun of on the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000.
-   _Thunderbirds Are GO_ (1966) - followed the first manned mission to Mars aboard the Zero-X. This is a notable depiction, which displays a pre-exploration idea of how Mars would look - rocky and desert-like. The crew encounter "rock snakes", which can live without water.
-   In _Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons_, a global security agency, Spectrum, fights the Mysterons, a formerly Mars-based alien species who evacuated the planet several millennia ago and has the ability to 'retro-metabolise' deceased organic matter.
-   _The Twilight Zone_ featured several episodes that focused on Mars and/or Martians including "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up", "People Are Alike All Over" and "Mr. Dingle the Strong".


Mars in fiction after Mariner

Novels and short stories

Mariner 4 in July 1965 found that Mars—contrary to expectations—is heavily cratered, with a very thin atmosphere. No canals were found; while scientists did not believe that Mars was a moist planet, the lack of surface water surprised them.[7] Science fiction had so influenced real explorations of the planet, however—Carl Sagan was among the many fans who became scientists—that after Mariner 9 in 1971-1972, craters were named after Wells, Burroughs, and other authors.[8] The Mariner and Viking space probes confirmed that the Martian environment is extremely hostile to life. By the 1970s, the ideas of canals and ancient civilizations had to be abandoned.

Authors soon began writing stories based on the new Mars (frequently treating it as a desert planet). Most of these works feature humans struggling to tame the planet, and some of them refer to terraforming (using technology to transform a planet's environment to be Earthlike).

A common theme, particularly among American writers, is that of a Martian colony fighting for independence from Earth. It appeared already in Heinlein's _Red Planet_ and is a major plot element in Greg Bear's _Moving Mars_ and Kim Stanley Robinson's _Mars_ trilogy. It is also part of the plot of the movie _Total Recall_ and the television series _Babylon 5_. Many video games also use this concept, such as the _Red Faction_ and _Zone of the Enders_ series, and _Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare_. A historical rebellion of Mars against Earth is also mentioned in the _Star Trek_ series of novels, which are not considered canon.

In the decades following Mariner and Apollo, the once-popular subgenre of realistic stories about a first expedition to Mars fell out of fashion, possibly due to the failure of the Apollo Program to continue on to Mars. The early 1990s saw a revival and re-envisioning of realistic novels about Mars expeditions. Early novels in this renaissance were Jack Williamson's novel _Beachhead_ and Ben Bova's novel _Mars_ (both 1992), which envisioned large-scale expeditions to Mars according to the thinking of the 1990s. These were followed by Gregory Benford's _The Martian Race_ (1999), Geoffrey A. Landis's _Mars Crossing_ (2000), and Robert Zubrin's _First Landing_ (2002), which took as their starting points the smaller and more focused expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s, mostly building on the concepts of Mars Direct.

Late 1960s and the 1970s

-   In Larry Niven's harsh Known Space stories (1964- ) Mars is a backwater bypassed by humans in their rush to the mineral wealth of the Asteroid Belt. A single attempt to colonise Mars ended disastrously, due to the combination of violent conflict between the would-be colonists and a confrontation with the native Martians—a shadowy race spending most of their time swimming under the surface of the Martian dust, and to whom water is a deadly poison. They are neither able nor interested in going into space, and humans are not really interested in Mars, so there seems no reason for conflict. Still, in the book _Protector_ (1973), the Martians are brutally exterminated by a large water asteroid deliberately hurled at the planet, raising the water content in the atmosphere to a degree deadly to them, by Jack Brennan, a human who had turned into a Pak Protector—a creature completely devoted to protecting its descendants, or sometimes his entire species, and is unreasonably xenophobic towards anybody else. This act of interplanetary genocide in effect ties Niven's Mars with the older Wells/Stapledon tradition. Some of these Martians are thought to have survived on the Ringworld, however. See Ringworld Engineers, Ringworld Throne, and Ringworld's Children. Various Protectors set up traps against Niven Martians.
-   In _Die Erde ist nah: die Marsexpedition_ (1970), by Ludek Pesek, published in English as _The Earth is Near_ (1973), a crew of twenty men undertake the first manned mission to Mars, and after landing in the wrong area due to computer malfunction and/or human error, have to cope with vicious sand storms, and a long trek undertaken in vehicles to their original intended area of exploration. The story is told from the viewpoint of the expedition's psychologist, and tries to be (based on the knowledge then known about Mars when written) accurate and realistic as to the problems encountered due to the Martian environment, the technology they have, and the human emotional response to their situation.
-   In the junior fiction novel _Journey Between Worlds_ (1970) by Sylvia Engdahl, eighteen-year-old Melinda Ashley never wanted to go to Mars but when she meets Alex Preston, a second-generation Martian colonist, she finds herself on a surprising new path.
-   In _Police Your Planet_ (1975) by Lester Del Rey, a disgraced, embittered Earth cop is exiled to a Mars that has been thoroughly corrupted by domed city life - he who controls the air machinery, makes the rules. The local police and city government are utterly corrupt, Chicago style. At first he tries to fit in, then his contact with other downtrodden outsiders renews his old idealism.
-   _Birth of Fire_ (1976) by Jerry Pournelle. The story of a troubled youth transported to Mars as a convict laborer who becomes involved with a rebellion by independent farmers and tradesmen who want to terraform Mars and break the stranglehold by the corporations and domed cities sponsored by Earth governments.
-   In _Man Plus_ (1976) by Frederik Pohl, an astronaut is transformed into a cyborg capable of living on Mars.
-   _The Far Call_ (1978) by Gordon R. Dickson describes a first international mission to Mars featuring a redundant architecture where two spacecraft are sent at once to Mars. It also provides illuminating insight to the culture at NASA.

1980s

-   "Ananke" (1982) by Stanisław Lem (a story in _More Tales of Pirx the Pilot_)
-   _Icehenge_ (1984) by Kim Stanley Robinson. A multiple narratives novel including a doomed political revolution on Mars and its subsequent investigation by an archaeologist working centuries later.

-   _Desolation Road_ (1988) by Ian McDonald is a magic-realist science fiction novel set on a terraformed planet that's explicitly named only in the last sentence of the book (though the name "Ares" makes frequent appearances in various contexts).
-   _Draka_ series (1989-), a dystopian alternate history by S. M. Stirling. Mars is colonised by the harsh Draka who create a slave society. To control their slaves there, they breed a special kind of artificial horrendous beast, the ghouloon, out of baboons.
-   _Lobster Man from Mars_ (1989) is a parody of 1950s science fiction films, and tells of a race of Martians who are dying due to a rapidly thinning atmosphere, and send an anthropomorphic lobster to investigate the possible colonisation of Earth.
-   _Venus Prime_ (1989) The third book of the series: _Hide & Seek_ is set on Mars.

1990s

-   In Terry Bisson's _Voyage to the Red Planet_ (1990), the first expedition to Mars is organized by a Hollywood producer so he can film a science fiction movie on location.
-   Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (_Red Mars_, _Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_, 1992–1996) is concerned with a centuries-long program of terraforming the planet. In Robinson's companion book _The Martians_, the escarpment is the scene of an epic multi-pitched rock climb. His _Icehenge_ (1984) also features a Mars in process of terraforming. Olympus Mons features as the site of an annual festival. Mars is also one of the terraformed worlds visited during the course of Robinson's _The Memory of Whiteness_ (1985).

Nostalgic Mars fiction

Several post-Mariner works are homages to the older phase of Mars fiction, circumventing the scientific picture of a dry and lifeless Mars with an unbreathable atmosphere through such science fiction generic staples as positing its future terraforming, or creating alternate history versions of Mars, where Burroughs' Barsoom, Bradbury's _Martian Chronicles_ or _The War of the Worlds_ are literal truth.

-   Philip José Farmer's World of Tiers series (1965–1993) contains a nostalgic and ironic reminder of the Barsoom stories. Kickaha, the series' adventurer protagonist, asks his friend The Creator of Universes to create for him a Barsoom. The latter agrees only to make an empty world, since "It would go too far for me to create all these fabulous creatures only for you to amuse yourself by running your sword through them". Kickaha visits from time to time the empty Barsoom, complete with beautiful palaces in which nobody ever lived, but goes away frustrated.
-   Some Sword and planet series, such as Michael Moorcock's _Kane of Old Mars_ trilogy (1965) and Lin Carter's _Mysteries of Mars_ (1973–1984) are deliberately anachronistic homages to earlier visions of Mars, particularly Burroughs'.
-   In one of Robert A. Heinlein's last novels, _The Number of the Beast_ (1980), the heroes flee Earth in a car capable of flight in six dimensions and find several alternate versions of Mars, one which had been colonised by the British and another which is an improbable combination of Burroughs' fabulous Barsoom with the home planet of the vicious Martians whose invasion of Earth was described by Wells.
-   _A World Of Difference_ (1990) by Harry Turtledove. In this alternate history, the fourth planet of our solar system - named Minerva instead of Mars - is larger, nearer to Earth and has conditions congenial to the existence of life, including intelligent creatures with their well-defined biology and culture (and wars with each other). Until the 1970s this makes no substantial difference to human history, beyond some minor differences in myths. But when a Viking space probe sends back the picture of an alien creature swinging a stick, a joint US/USSR mission is sent in a hurry to explore the planet, and things develop fast from there.
-   S. M. Stirling's Lords of Creation series includes _In the Courts of the Crimson Kings_, in which Mars (as well as Venus) have been terraformed by unknown aliens over the course of hundreds of millions of years and seeded with all kinds of terrestrial life. Terran explorers arrive in the latter part of the 20th century to discover that Mars is home to a decaying but still highly advanced culture that was creating technological marvels back when Earthlings were still living in caves.
-   The title of Larry Niven's _Rainbow Mars_ (1999) alludes to Robinson's three-colored Mars trilogy, and the plot concerns a time machine that is used to visit ancient Mars. The only problem is that time travel is impossible, and the machine actually travels back to a _fictitious_/alternate-universe Mars. The protagonist meets a wide variety of different Martians, including most of those from the pre-Mariner novels listed above.
-   "Larklight" (2006), a story by Phillip Reeve is set in the 18th century, where Mars is inhabited by an elven race, which formerly commanded great space empires. Humans are thought to be their descendants. They are described as purple haired and russet skinned. Mars and most other planets have a breathable atmosphere for humanity in Larklight.
-   _Old Mars_ (2013) is a Mars-themed anthology edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois[12][13]

Nostalgia for the older Mars also frequently appears in comics and role-playing games, particularly of the steampunk genre:

-   The role-playing game _Space: 1889_ (1988) features an alternate history in which a heroic Mars, complete with natives, is being colonized by the European empires of the 19th century.
-   The wargame _Sky Galleons of Mars_ (1988) is set in the same alternate history as _Space:1889_.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ (1999-) takes place in a world where characters from various literary sources interact. A scene taking place on Mars features the Hithers from _Gullivar of Mars_, the Green Martians from Barsoom, and the Séroni from _Out of the Silent Planet_, with references to _Kane of Old Mars_. In the world of The League, the Martians from _The War of the Worlds_ are not originally from Mars, but were invading aliens who moved on to try to conquer Earth.
-   In the graphic novels _Scarlet Traces_ (2002) and _Scarlet Traces: The Great Game_ (2006), Olympus Mons is the main base of the British Mars Expeditionary Force. The _Scarlet Traces_ saga is intended as a sequel to H. G. Wells' _The War of the Worlds_ and centers on a counter-invasion of Mars, beginning about 1908 and continuing over the next three decades.

During the subsequent expansion of humanity across the solar system using advanced technology provided by the Traveler, humanity creates the city of Freehold. During the game's back story, a massive near extinction event occurs as the solar system is invaded by numerous alien species and Mars is abandoned, later being conquered by an alien faction called the Cabal, who alter the orbits of both Phobos and Deimos to bring them closer to the planet. During the game's story, the player establishes a foothold on Mars and begins to strike back at the Cabal, and later the Vex, who have established their own stronghold on the planet. The game's sequel, Destiny 2, also features the Hellas Basin of Mars as an in-game location, although only accessible through the Warmind DLC. New enemies present around the location are the Cabal Red Legion and Hive.

Role-playing games

-   In Palladium Games' post-apocalyptic role-playing game _Rifts_, the Martian canals are mystical ley lines, magical tunnels of energy that create portals through space, time and dimension wherever they cross. In Palladium's _After The Bomb Sourcebook 6: Mutants in Orbit_, there is a section pertaining to _Rifts_ that also says that there were several points where the ley lines create dimensional pockets (similar to the Bermuda Triangle) in which full-fledged jungles grow within the borders of three nearby Rifts.
-   In the GURPS role-playing game _Transhuman Space_, Mars is in the process of being terraformed, while several million people live in colonies. China, the first nation to land on Mars and the leader of the most extensive colonies, has built a space elevator on Mars to speed colonization. The Transhuman Space sourcebook _In The Well_ places a University town, "Nix Olympia" and a ski resort "Zeus Tourist Resort" on Olympus Mons.
-   In the RPG _Mutant Chronicles_, Mars is the homeworld of Capitol Megacorporation.
-   _Space: 1889_ portrays an arid, aging Mars on the Lowellian model. Its native civilization is decadent and the various city-states and desert tribes squabble as the canal system slowly falls apart and Earthmen arrive to carve out colonial holdings.

Wargames

-   In the tabletop wargame _Warhammer 40,000_ (set 38,000 years in the future), Mars is a vast, heavily colonized 'Forge World,' home to the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Tech-Priests of Mars. They are the engineers and technicians of the Imperium, who create most of the Imperium's more advanced technology. The planet is almost as well defended as Holy Terra (Earth) itself and home to those who worship the 'Machine Spirit.' Mars is also suspected to be the lair of the Void Dragon, an ancient C'tan imprisoned there by the God-Emperor of Mankind at some point between 1300 AD and 1600 AD (how the Emperor accomplished this has never been described in detail). It is also mentioned that the planet was once terraformed, but the terraforming was undone due to rampant industrialism.
-   In the tabletop wargame and fictional universe of BattleTech, Mars is the location of a military academy. Mars was held by the Terran Hegemony and the Star League before its collapse. Afterward it was controlled by the interstellar communication order known as ComStar. After ComStar split into two factions Mars was claimed along with Terra by the Word of Blake during Operation Odysseus. During the Word of Blake's jihad against the rest of the Inner Sphere the mercenary command Wolf's Dragoons launched a failed assault on Mars which resulted in the nuclear scouring of their base planet of Outreach.

Music

-   In the second verse of the hit song "Rocket Man" (1972), Elton John sings "Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids/In fact it's cold as hell/And there's no one there to raise them/If you did".
-   The cult American rock band the Pixies have an album track on their 1991 album _Trompe le Monde_ named "Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons", on an album filled with references to space, aliens and other 'out of this world' subjects.
-   Rock band The Flaming Lips perform the song "Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)" on their 2002 release _Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots_. The song won the 2002 Grammy for Best Instrumental Rock Performance.
-   Progressive rock band Ayreon's 2000 album _Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer_ tells the story of the last surviving human living on a Mars colony, many years after a war wiped out all life on Earth, leaving the Mars colony berift of supplies. He spends his last days in the "dream sequencer", re-living the memories of his life, and memories of past lives, back to pre-historic times.
-   The title of the song "Knights of Cydonia" by the band Muse references a region of Mars containing the famous "Face".
-   There is a reference to Mars in David Bowie's single "Life on Mars?" (1973) also released on the album _Hunky Dory_ (1971) which has been described as having 'one of the strangest lyrics ever'.[15] The chorus contains the lyrics "Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know/He's in the best selling show/Is there life on Mars" and was summed up by Bowie as being 'a sensitive young girl's reaction to the media'. It has been described as Bowie's signature song.[16] In June 2015 it ranked as no. 1 in The Daily Telegraph's "100 greatest songs of all time" by Neil McCormick.[17]


Martians in fiction

The Martian is a favorite character of classical science fiction; he was frequently found away from his home planet, often invading Earth, but sometimes simply a lonely character representing alienness from his surroundings. Martians, other than human beings transplanted to Mars, became rare in fiction after Mariner, except in exercises of deliberate nostalgia – more frequently in some genres, such as comics and animation, than in written literature.
