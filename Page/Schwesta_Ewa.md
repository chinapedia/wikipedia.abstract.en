When was three years old, her mother left Poland and headed for West Berlin, with the aim of seeking asylum in the United States. Her mother was approved for a Green Card but was then convicted of theft.[8] The Green Card was withdrawn, leaving the family stranded in Germany.[9] grew up in a refugee home, and later a women's shelter, in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, at the time in West Germany.[10][11] Her mother married a German man, and took her stepfather's surname, Müller.[12] has two brothers born in Germany, who know that she worked as a prostitute.[13] 's mother does not know about her career, and she is no longer in contact with her birth father.[14]

In December 2009, Xatar and seven accomplices robbed €1.7 million of gold from a transporter lorry. Xatar fled to Iraq, where he was caught and arrested in February 2010.[20][21] Xatar's flight and subsequent arrest impacted 's career – she found herself "twiddling her thumbs", unable to share her tracks with him. However, she also decided that she would not go back to prostitution – her promotion as a rapper meant that she was now famous, and she was worried about returning to drugs.[22] She has described rap as a form of music therapy, helping her work through her past.[23]

With Xatar running his record label from prison, eventually managed to appear on the song "Beifall" from Xatar's album _415_ and on "Frauen" on _Hinterhofjargon_ by . Her first mixtape, ("_Reality_") was released on 5 October 2012.[24] No tracks from _Realität_ charted, but her first music video, ("Small Talker") received over six million views on YouTube.[25] After the release of the video in 2011, Ewa gave up prostitution to become a full-time artist.[26]

has described herself as uncomfortable on stage and sometimes suffers stage fright. She therefore prefers to rap straight through, without banter or comic routines. However, she is accompanied on tour by strip dancers who perform as she sings.[31]


Bar and arrest

Alongside her rap career, opened a bar in Central Frankfurt, . The bar was raided by police on suspicion that it was an illegal brothel, prompting an angry response from Ewa who wrote on Facebook "This is a bar, not a brothel! [...] I will open a legal brothel in two months. It will pay taxes etc. Don't worry!"[32]

At 8:30 AM on 16 November 2016, Ewa was arrested by a SEK police tactical unit in , a district of Arnsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia where she was recording her new album.[33] She was detained at on charges of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, pimping, bodily harm and offenses against the German tax code.[34] had been under investigation by the organised crime department of Frankfurt Police for several months, and was alleged to have brought young female fans, between the ages of 17 and 19, to a hotel room and offered to lend them money for costs such as rent, clothing, cosmetics and petrol, then forced them into prostitution to repay this debt.[35] Following the arrest, Ewa's record label released a statement that her surname had been changed to Malanda.[36] On 20 June 2017, Malanda was found guilty of 35 counts of bodily harm, tax violations and the abuse of minors, and was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months.
