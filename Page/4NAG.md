4NAG is an Australian community radio station located in Yeppoon, Queensland.[1]

The station has been broadcasting to communities along the Capricorn Coast on 91.3 FM since 1998. 4NAG also live streams its programs on its website.

Programming broadcast by 4NAG consists predominantly of live and pre-recorded local shows which are presented by a diverse team of volunteer announcers who vary in age and cultural backgrounds.[2]

Originally broadcasting as "Radio NAG", the station underwent a relaunch in 2014 when it began branding itself with its official callsign, 4NAG.

The NAG acronym is an homage to the station's founders, Nick Saunders, Andre Soarez and Graham Channells who first discussed the viability of establishing a community radio station in Yeppoon during a game of darts.[3]

The station used its annual open day in 2014 as an opportunity to officially unveil its name and revamped programming line-up. Special guests included Livingstone Shire mayor Bill Ludwig and television personality Peter Byrne who cut a ceremonial ribbon with president of Capricorn Coast Community Radio, Cherie Furness.[4]

During National Volunteers Week in 2016, it was revealed 4NAG would be one of thirty-six local Central Queensland community organisations to receive a share in $150,000 of Federal Government funding. It was announced the station would be receiving $5,000.[5]

The station was nominated in the Excellence in Ethnic and Multicultural Engagement category at the 2016 CBAA Awards,[6] but lost to Brisbane's 4EB.[7]
