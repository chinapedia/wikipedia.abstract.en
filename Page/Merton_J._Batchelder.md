During his service there, he was commissioned second lieutenant in August 1918. Batchelder returned to the United States in July 1919 and was assigned to the Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia. He subsequently sailed for Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic as a member of the Second Brigade of Marines in December 1919. Batchelder was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in March 1921.


World War II

Batchelder reported at Camp Pendleton, California, in August 1943, where new 4th Marine Division was activated under the command of Major General Harry Schmidt. He was appointed division personnel officer at the same time and was responsible for the essential administrative liaison between the subordinate units and the headquarters.

He sailed with the division to the Pacific in January 1944 and participated in the subsequent Battle of Kwajalein. Batchelder was appointed commanding officer of the 25th Marine Regiment in April 1944, relieving Colonel Samuel C. Cumming, who was promoted and appointed assistant division commander. He subsequently commanded the regiment during the Saipan operation.

During the following Battle of Tinian at the end of July 1944, Batchelder landed on the beachhead with first waves under heavy enemy fire and was able to repel counterattacks and establish defense line. For his leadership and gallantry in action, he was decorated with the Navy Cross. Batchelder also received the Navy Presidential Unit Citation.
