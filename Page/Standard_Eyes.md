_STANDARD EYES_ is a compilation album by American jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal featuring performances recorded from 1958 to 1961 for the Argo label, and was released in 1967. It draws its selections from the original Argo albums Ahmad Jamal Trio Volume IV, Portfolio of Ahmad Jamal, Happy Moods, At the Pershing, Vol. 2, Ahmad Jamal's Alhambra, and All of You.[1]


Critical reception

The AllMusic review, giving the album 3 out of 5 stars, has Ken Dryden observing "One of Ahmad Jamal's most popular trios, with bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier, is featured in this Cadet LP anthology of live recordings made between 1958 and 1961 for Argo. Even though the pianist sticks almost exclusively to very familiar standards, his fresh approach to each of them makes his interpretations very distinctive."[2]
