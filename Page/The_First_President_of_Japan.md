Publication

The writer Yoshiki Hidaka, a famous political analyst of Japan–United States relations,[1] worked along with illustrator Ryuji Tsugihara in _The First President of Japan_.[2] The _seinen_[3] manga was published on _Bart_ magazine of the publisher Shueisha between 1998 and 2000.[4][5] In Japan it was first published in _tankōbon_ format through a single omnibus edition in December 1998.[6] Then a new edition of three volumes was published through the _Super Playboy Comics_ label from December 1999 to April 2000.[7][8][9] An American edition was published by Gutsoon! Entertainment on its magazine _Raijin Comics_, starting from the second issue in January 2003.[10] The graphic novel version had four volumes that were published between July 9, 2003 and January 6, 2004.[11][12]

A spin-off series, also written by Hidaka, but this time illustrated by Kenji Yoshida, was published under the name . Serialized in Shinchosha's magazine _Weekly Comic Bunch_, it spawned sixteen _tankōbon_ published between November 9, 2003 and September 8, 2006.[13]


Reception

John Jakala from Anime News Network (ANN) was surprised by its first chapter because of the absence of on-screen appearance of the main character on it. He considered it "a daring move" but said "it pays off: I found myself anxious to meet Sakuragi, and curious to see how he will deal with all of the political crises erupting around him."[14] However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi probably would be more impactful if his face had not been shown on a Jumbotron at the end of the chapter. "Still, it was a cute bit", he said.[15] The third chapter had "a very powerful" scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend. Jakala deemed it "inspirational without becoming overly sentimental". On the other hand, he criticized the "'excited' word balloons" in uppercase that seem to be shouting at him as "painfully purple".[16] In the end, Jakala said that "certain situations or lines seem a bit too melodramatic, but overall the series maintains an engaging tone".[17] About its tone, Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics stated it "feature[s] overly dramatic theatrics in the forms of speeches and actions by the protagonist" — which led to a comparison to _Eagle: The Making of an Asian-American President_.[18]

Overall, Jakala said "the series has grown on [him] over time. Part of the reason is that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry political systems in the abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book."[19] Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as "handsome, suave, and poised" (Jakala),[20] "decisive, smart, and charismatic" (McElhatton), "Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, it just makes him all the more likable" (McElhatton).[21] In Jakala's opinion, "One of the strongest things about this series is Sakuragi's character" because "Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect".[22] In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of "a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable."[23]

Jakala commended the art because "Tsugihara helps distinguish characters by giving everyone distinctive looks."[24] Further, he appreciated how the detailing on body language and facial expressions, saying, "In one scene, I could almost feel the intensity of Sakuragi's gaze coming off the page."[25] RAC's commentator also asserted there are "lots of careful shots of people's faces to show their reactions", and deemed Tsugihara's art very suitable to the series, calling it "a solid, straight-forward style" and comparing it to storyboards for a television show or a film.[26]

Patrick King of _Animefringe_ labeled it "a frighteningly realistic political thriller for the sophisticated reader" and said fans of _The West Wing_ would probably "find this series appealing".[27] A similar comparison was done by RAC's critic who affirmed that "If this was a television show, it would be the Japanese equivalent of _The West Wing_, able to make politics interesting to a wide audience though characters and situations that draw its viewers in."[28] King considered it "A very good series", while McElhatton declared, "One of the consistently best serials in the _Raijin Comics_ anthology, _The First President of Japan_ is one of those series that I think almost anyone who likes 'real world' stories would appreciate."[29] In a 2015 list, Matt White of _Publishers Weekly_ ranked it among the "12 Great Comics On Presidential Politics".[30] On the other hand, Thompson, said "It's sort of like a faltering unintentional prototype for _The Legend of Koizumi_" and that "it ends very abruptly".[31]
