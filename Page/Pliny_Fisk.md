PLINY FISK (born in Shelburne, Massachusetts, 24 June 1792; died in Beirut, Syria, 23 October 1825) was an American Congregationalist missionary to Europe and the Middle East.


Biography

He graduated from Middlebury College in 1814, and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1818. He was appointed, with Levi Parsons, by the American Board, to the Palestine mission in 1818, and sailed from Boston for Smyrna, 3 November 1819. After travelling extensively in Greece, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, in May 1825, he joined a mission already established at Beirut. He died there of fever in the following October. A niece of his, Fidelia Fisk, was also a noted missionary.


Work

Fisk's ability to preach in Italian, French, Greek, and Arabic eminently fitted him to be a missionary. On the day of his death he completed an “English and Arabic Dictionary.” He wrote numerous papers for the _Missionary Herald_.
