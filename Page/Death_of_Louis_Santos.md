Fabian Núñez's Influence

One of the men convicted in his death was Esteban Núñez, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.[2][3] Núñez’s father, then California Assembly Speaker of the House, Fabian Núñez, was a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.[4][5][6]

When Esteban Núñez was first arrested, his father's political influence was evident as many letters pleading for a reduction in his son's $2-million bail were sent to the San Diego County Superior Court.[7] One letter, on official stationery, came from Núñez's longtime friend, then Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; one letter came on official stationery from Maria Elena Durazo, head of the L.A. County Federation of Labor; one came from California Assembly Republican Leader Michael Villines, and was sent by California State Assemblyman Kevin de León.[8][9] Ultimately, his bail was reduced to $1 million.[10]

Commutation by Schwarzenegger

As a personal favor to “a friend”, just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted Núñez’s sentence by more than half, to seven years.[11][12][13] Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos’ family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.[14]

The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, "Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state." However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.[15]

In April 2016, Esteban Núñez was released from Mule Creek State Prison, serving less than six years of his original 16-year sentence.[16][17]


Legacy

In October 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that requires that the offender's victims and their families receive at least 10 days notice for any commutations.[18]
