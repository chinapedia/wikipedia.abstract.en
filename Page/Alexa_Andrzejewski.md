Biography

Andrzejewski (n√©e Weber) had an interest in technology from a young age, learning to reprogram her childhood computer at eight years old and design websites for local businesses by the time she was in junior high school.[1]

After graduating from college, Andrzejewski joined a design firm called Adaptive Path in San Francisco, California.[2] In 2009, Andrzejewski was inspired to launch Foodspotting, an app that allows users to socially share their food photographs, after being unable to find the Japanese dish okonomiyaki in San Francisco.[3][4] She began the project alongside programmer Ted Grubb and social media strategist Soraya Darabi.[5] Billed as a "visual guide to food," the app allows users to enter their city and a type of food to get photos showing local restaurants that carry the dish.[6] Since its launch, the service has been named to _Time's_ list of 50 Best Websites of 2010[7] and featured at Facebook's f8 conference.[8]

Foodspotting was acquired by OpenTable in 2013 for $10 million.[9] As part of the acquisition, Andrzejewski joined the online reservation platform as a lead user interface designer.[10]

She was named to _Inc._'s 2011 list of "30 Under 30" and to _Forbes_' 2012 "30 Under 30: Food and Wine" list.[11][12]
