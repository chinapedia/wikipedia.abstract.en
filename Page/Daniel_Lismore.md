Early life

He studied photography and fashion design at the Butts College Coventry[4] he moved to London aged 17, where he worked as a photographer and model.

He took various jobs in fashion, including wardrobe assistant roles at Vogue and Pop magazine. When the fashion label 'Sorapol' launched in 2012, Sorapol Chawaphatnakul appointed him as Creative Director, leading to its critical success.[7] _“I had a dream about this beautiful Maasai jacket with a nod to Marie Antoinette. We wanted to juxtapose the richness in the two cultures, so we went to Versailles and I took out my photos from Africa and we came up with this whole collection,” he says. “Working on the collection was very unlike dressing myself. I wanted to dress beautiful women, beautifully.”_[8] Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey, Rita Ora, Debbie Harry and Cara Delevingne are among the label’s famous clientele.[9]


Living Sculpture

He is known for living his life as art by wearing elaborate and extravagant ensembles that combine haute couture with vintage fabrics, found objects, chainmail, ethnic jewellery, millinery and more, in an expression of eccentric, creative energy. Inspired by art in all its forms - he has received comparisons to the British perormance artist Leigh Bowery[10] and Gilbert & George - history and his travels, Lismore constantly combines and amalgamates multiple inspirations from around the world into vibrant expressions of cultural appreciation.


Exhibitions

In 2013, Lismore presented his first self-portrait exhibition at the Tate Modern followed by another show at the Tate Britain in 2014. [11]

His first solo exhibition, curated by SCAD director of fashion exhibitions Rafael Gomes - _"Be yourself, Everyone else is already taken"_ opened at Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta on 22 January 2016.[12] The exhibition featured 32 sculptures, each styled individually and installed in an imperial regiment, inspired by the Terracotta Warriors of China. The traveling exhibition has received over 10,000 visitors worldwide and was ranked by WGSN as the 2nd most significant global fashion exhibitions of 2016:[13]

He has worked closely with Vivienne Westwood on her Climate Revolution projects[17] and also undertook voluntary work for the charity Icross and NWI in Kenya where he lived with Maasai people, and in Samburu to the north.[18] In 2016, he was the face of H&M's _"Close the Loop"_ Campaign to help encourage recycling of clothes. Lismore's personal wardrobe archive spans highlight his commitment to sustainable fashion.

In 2018, The Connaught Hotel removed its dress code from the company website after Lismore was approached by a member of staff and asked to leave. He campaigned on Twitter, 'I went for a cup of tea and a man came over and said, "You need to leave because your outfit doesn't go with our dress code" sparking a media backlash, with the Daily Mail publishing an article titled: "TALK OF THE TOWN: Hotel issues a grovelling apology to a flamboyant designer after he 'felt discriminated against' when told he 'breached their dress code' and was kicked out."

In 2016, he caused a stir when a controversial photograph of him, taken beside the British UKIP politician Nigel Farage was published on The Evening Standard. In the photo, Lismore can be seen with a "four little letters" (_beginning with 'c_') written on his right hand, which is pointing at the politician.[19]
