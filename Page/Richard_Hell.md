RICHARD LESTER MEYERS (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name RICHARD HELL, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer.

Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins.[1]

Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex.[2] Hell was in several important, early punk bands, including Neon Boys, Television and the Heartbreakers, after which he formed Richard Hell & the Voidoids. Their 1977 album _Blank Generation_ influenced many other punk bands. Its title track was named "One of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock" by music writers in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listing[3] and is ranked as one of the all-time Top 10 punk songs by a 2006 poll of original British punk figures, as reported in the _Rough Guide to Punk_.[4]

Since the late 1980s, Hell has devoted himself primarily to writing, publishing two novels and several other books. He was the film critic for _BlackBook_ magazine from 2004 to 2006.


Biography

Early life and career

Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew,[5][6] was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry.[7] After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor.

Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine.[8] They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism.

Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded _Genesis:Grasp_. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.

Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from _Rolling Stone_ to the New Directions _Annual_s. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity.[9] A book of poems credited to "Stern", _Wanna Go Out?_, was released by Dot in 1973.[10]

The Neon Boys, Television and the Heartbreakers

In 1972, Verlaine joined Hell in New York and formed the Neon Boys. In 1974, the band added a second guitarist, Richard Lloyd, and changed their name to Television.

Television's performances at CBGB helped kick-start the first wave of punk bands, inspiring a number of different artists including Patti Smith, who wrote the first press review of Television for the _SoHo Weekly News_ in June 1974. She formed a highly successful band of her own, the Patti Smith Group. Television was one of the early bands to play at CBGB because their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded owner Hilly Kristal to book them alongside the Ramones. They also built the club's first stage. Hell started playing his punk rock anthem "Blank Generation" during his time in Television. In early 1975, Hell parted ways with Television after a dispute over creative control. Hell claimed that he and Verlaine had originally divided the songwriting evenly but that later Verlaine sometimes refused to play Hell's songs. Verlaine remained silent on the subject.

Hell left Television the same week that Jerry Nolan and Johnny Thunders quit the New York Dolls. In May 1975, the three of them formed the Heartbreakers (not to be confused with Tom Petty's band, which adopted the same name the following year). After one show, Walter Lure joined the Heartbreakers as a second guitarist. Four Heartbreakers demo tracks, recorded while Hell was still in the band, were later released on that band's _L.A.M.F. Definitive Edition_ reissue. A live album recorded with Hell in 1975 was released as _What Goes Around..._ in 1991.

Richard Hell and the Voidoids

In early 1976, Hell quit the Heartbreakers and started Richard Hell and the Voidoids with Robert Quine, Ivan Julian and Marc Bell. The band released two albums, though the second, _Destiny Street_, retained only Quine from the original group, with Naux (Juan Maciel) on guitar and Fred Maher on drums. Hell's best known songs with the Voidoids included "Blank Generation", "Love Comes in Spurts", "The Kid With the Replaceable Head" and "Time". In 2009, the guitar tracks on _Destiny Street_ were re-recorded and released as _Destiny Street Repaired_, with guitarists Julian, Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell playing to the original rhythm tracks.[11] Also in 2009, Hell gave his blessing to the public access program Pancake Mountain to create an animated music video for "The Kid with the Replaceable Head".[12] It was the Voidoids' first and only official music video. The cut used for the animation appears on Hell's 2005 retrospective album, _Spurts, The Richard Hell Story_.

Dim Stars and other collaborations

Hell's only other album release was as part of the band Dim Stars, for which he came out of retirement for a month in the early 1990s. Dim Stars featured guitarist Thurston Moore and drummer Steve Shelley from Sonic Youth, Gumball's guitarist Don Fleming, and Quine. They formed only to record a 1991 EP and a 1992 album, both titled _Dim Stars_, and played one show in public, a WFMU benefit at The Ritz in Manhattan. Hell played bass, sang lead vocals and wrote the lyrics for the album.

Hell also guested on the 1993 _Roller Coaster_ album by Shotgun Rationale, and co-wrote and sang lead vocals on the song "Never Mind" by the Heads, a 1996 collaborative effort between three former members of Talking Heads.

Books

_The Voidoid_, a novella written in 1973, was finally published by CodeX in 1993.[13] It was reissued in 2009 by 38th Street Publishers with illustrations by Kier Cooke Sandvik.[14]

Early poetry collections by Hell include _I Was a Spiral on the Floor_ (1988) and _Across the Years_ (1992), both published by Soyo Publications.[15]

_Artifact: Notebooks from Hell 1974–1980_, a collection of Hell's punk-era journals, was released in 1990 by Hanuman Books.[16][17]

In 1996, Scribner published Hell's first full-length novel, _Go Now_, set in 1980 and drawn largely from his own experiences.[18]

Hell released a collection of short pieces (poems, essays and drawings) called _Hot and Cold_ in 2001.[19] His second novel, _Godlike_, was published in 2005 by Akashic Books as part of Dennis Cooper's Little House on the Bowery Series.[20][21] Also published in 2005 was _Rabbit Duck_, a book of 13 poems written in collaboration with David Shapiro. More recent works include _Psychopts_ (2008), a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, as well as _Disgusting_ (2010) and _I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp_ (2013).[22]

Hell's nonfiction has been widely anthologized, including a number of appearances in "best music writing"[23] collections. _The Toilet Paper Columns_ (2007) compiled his columns for the Colorado alternative magazine _Toilet Paper_,[24] while _Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001-2014_ was issued by Soft Skull Press in 2015.

Hell's archive of his manuscripts, tapes, correspondence (written and email), journals and other documents of his life was purchased for $50,000 by New York University's Fales Library in 2003.

A mural, created by students from Lexington Montessori High School, in Hell’s hometown of Lexington, KY was completed in June 2019. The mural has three parts, two profiles of Hell, and a quote from his autobiography, _I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp_.[25] “This was in Lexington, Ky. when everybody was a kid. I looked for caves and birds and ran away from home. My favorite thing to do was to run away. The words ‘let’s run away’ still sounds magical to me.” The mural is located in the city’s North Limestone neighborhood.[26]

Films

Hell has appeared in several low-budget films, most notably Susan Seidelman's _Smithereens_. Other acting appearances include Ulli Lommel's _Blank Generation_, Nick Zedd's _Geek Maggot Bingo_, Rachel Amadeo's _What About Me?_ and Rachid Kerdouche's _Final Reward_. Hell had a non-speaking cameo role as Madonna's murdered boyfriend in Seidelman's 1985 _Desperately Seeking Susan_.

Personal life

Hell was married to Scandal's Patty Smyth for two years during 1985–86, and they had a daughter, Ruby. Hell married Sheelagh Bevan in 2002.

"He [Richard Hell] even gave an artistic spin to his torn shirt and cropped hair look, soon to be imported to England as the emblem of punk." -- _Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde_ By Bernard Gendron, University of Chicago Press (2002), pg. 252. Extensive documentation of Hell's ripped and drawn-on and safety-pinned clothing, spiky short hair, and "punk" musical style as it existed in 1974–1975 (one-two years before English punk existed), with descriptions of Hell by Debby Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie, and Richard Lloyd of Television as well as the book's author --_From the Velvets to the Voidoids_ by Clinton Heylin, Penguin Books (1993), pp. 120–25.

[2] "I came back to England determined. I had these images I came back with, it was like Marco Polo or Walter Raleigh. I brought back the image of this distressed, strange thing called Richard Hell. And this phrase, 'the blank generation'. [...] Richard Hell was a definite, 100 percent inspiration, and, in fact, I remember telling the Sex Pistols, 'Write a song like Blank Generation, but write your own bloody version, and their own version was 'Pretty Vacant'." --Malcolm McLaren in an interview in _Please Kill Me, the Uncensored Oral History of Punk_ by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain, Grove Press (1996), p. 199.

[4] These British punk-scene figures were as follows: Glen Matlock, original Sex Pistols bassist and composer of most of their music; Mark Perry, founder and editor of the first British punk fanzine, _Sniffin' Glue_, as well as founder of punk group Alternative TV; Geoff Travis, founder of Rough Trade, the main British punk record shop and early label; and Kris Needs, editor of _ZigZag_ magazine and its famous Rock Family Trees. "Blank Generation" was the only American song listed by all four polled.

I'd been sent there because I'd been getting in trouble in school since I was fourteen, and things were looking pretty dire...I arrived a little after the start of the school year of 1965–1966, when I was in the 11th grade." --Richard Hell (describing how he and Tom Verlaine met) in the first chapter of Hell's autobiography-in-progress, as published in _Vanitas_ magazine No. 2, 2006, p. 153.
