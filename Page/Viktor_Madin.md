VIKTOR MADIN, originally _Viktor Madincea_, (20 December 1876 – 19 March 1968) was an Austrian opera singer (baritone) of Hungarian descent. He was a member of the ensemble of the Vienna State Opera for more than fifty years.


Leben

Madin stems from Lugoj, a city in Timiș County, Banat, belonging today to Romania.

He is one of the longest serving singers of the Vienna State Opera. In the years 1908 to 1959 he sung more than 250 roles in more than 7.000 performances, mainly in smaller and medium parts. He is regarded as the singer with the highest number of performances ever in any opera house. He was named Kammersänger, a honorific title for distinguished State Opera singers. He was especially successful in the Da Ponte/Mozart roles Masetto in _Don Giovanni_ and Antonio in _Le nozze di Figaro_ as well as Faninal in _Der Rosenkavalier_ by Hofmannsthal and Strauss. Sometimes he also sung major parts such as Klingsor in _Parsifal_, Alberich in _Ring des Nibelungen_ or Don Alfonso in _Così fan tutte_. In _Der Rosenkavalier_ within forty-five years (1911-1956) he switched between five roles - 89 times Lakai der Marschallin, once the notario, 265 times Haushofmeister bei der Feldmarschallin, 201 times Polizeikommissär and 52 times Faninal. In 1955 he was awarded with the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria, in 1966 he was appointed Honorary Member of the Vienna State Opera.

From 1922 zu 1946 he was a regular guest at the Salzburg Festival. In the first opera performance of the Festival – _Don Giovanni_, conducted by Richard Strauss on August 14th, 1922 – he sung Masetto. Despite all system chances – from First Republic, Ständestaat, Third Reich and Second Republic – he always performed the gardener Antonio in all Salzburg productions of _Le nozze di Figaro_ from 1922 to 1946.

Madin died in Vienna.
