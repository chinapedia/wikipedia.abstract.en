SOUTHERN TIER BREWING COMPANY is a craft brewing company in Lakewood, NY, in the southwestern section of NY state known as the Southern Tier.


History

The company was founded in 2001 by Phineas DeMink and Allen "Skip" Yahn. They purchased old equipment from the Old Saddleback Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. By 2003, the brewery had expanded to multiple varieties of small batch ales distributed locally. By 2005, the company had expanded its distribution to cover the majority of New York State and Pennsylvania. In 2009, a new 20,000-sq-ft building was built to accommodate the company's expansion nationally and internationally.[1]

In 2010, 800 barrels of fermentation vessels were built, as well as a 7,500 square-foot addition to the conditioning room. The brew house expanded from 20 BBL to a 50 BBL system. The company also added a new bottling line that fills, caps and labels over 10,000 bottles per hour at full speed. They also added a cellar to add another 7,200 BBL of fermentation space.

In 2012, a new brewhouse installation began of a 110-barrel Steinecker brewhouse imported from Germany. A new tasting room was installed as the ending point of Saturday afternoon tours with 14 draught lines. In 2013, a 45,000 sq. ft. warehouse, wastewater treatment facility, and distribution center were built.[2]

On February 16, 2016, Southern Tier allied with Victory Brewing Company to become part of the Artisanal Brewing Ventures holding company.[3]

In January 2017, Southern Tier opened its first satellite brewpub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with thirty different beers on tap.[4]

In September 2018, its second satellite location opened in Cleveland, Ohio with 30+ draft offerings.[5][6]
