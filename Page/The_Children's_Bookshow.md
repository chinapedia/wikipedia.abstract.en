THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHOW is an annual children's literature roadshow which visits theatres and schools across the United Kingdom in the autumn.[1]

Established in 2003, The Children's Bookshow is directed by Si√¢n Williams, and includes theatre performances by children's writers, workshops in schools, and competitions.[2] The 2016 Children's Bookshow consisted of sixteen separate events, with authors from the UK and overseas, including Michael Rosen, Valerie Bloom and Fabio Geda.[3]

In other years the tour has featured Judith Kerr, Quentin Blake, Kevin Crossley-Holland, Eva Ibbotson, Francesca Simon and Martin Waddell. [4][5]
