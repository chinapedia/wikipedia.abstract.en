_ECTROPIS OBLIQUA_ is a species of moth in the family Geometridae first described by Prout in 1915.[1]


Description

The larva body surface is smooth, with only six abdominal and hip section on foot, trunk when a flexor stretching, commonly known as back arched bug or gauge.


Infestation of tea plants

_E. obliqua_ is one of the most destructive pest insects on tea plants throughout growing areas of this crop in southern China, causing widespread damage in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces.[2] Larvae feed solely on shoots and leaves of _C. sinensis_ and occur in six or seven overlapping generations throughout the growing season of tea plants.

Infestations of tea plants may be treated by removing the pupa stage of the _E. obliqua_ life cycle, through predation by chickens, manual removal of larvae, chemical treatments, or biological control (e.g. with tea looper karyotype virus).


Associated viruses

The Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoPV) has been isolated from _E. obliqua_ larvae.[3]
