_STAR TREK: THE ANIMATED SERIES'' (_TAS''), originally aired as _STAR TREK_ and as _THE ANIMATED ADVENTURES OF GENE RODDENBERRY'S STAR TREK_, is an American animated science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. It originally aired from September 8, 1973 to October 12, 1974 on NBC, spanning 22 episodes over two seasons. The second series in the _Star Trek_ franchise, it is the first sequel to _Star Trek: The Original Series_. Set in the 23rd century, when Earth is part of a United Federation of Planets, it follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS _Enterprise_ as it explores the Milky Way galaxy.

After the cancellation of _The Original Series_ in 1969, the live action show proved popular in syndication and generated significant fan enthusiasm. This resulted in Roddenberry's decision to continue the series in animated form. Much of the original cast returned to provide voice-overs for their characters. Show writers David Gerrold and D. C. Fontana characterized _The Animated Series_ as effectively being a fourth season of _The Original Series_. The adventures of the characters were continued in cinematic form, the first being the 1979 film _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_.

_The Animated Series_ was the original cast's last episodic portrayal of the characters until the "cartoon-like" graphics of the _Star Trek: 25th Anniversary_ computer game in 1992[1] as well as its sequel _Star Trek: Judgment Rites_ in 1993. Both appeared after the cast's final film together, _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_, released in December 1991. _The Animated Series_ was critically acclaimed and was the first _Star Trek_ series to win an Emmy Award when its second season won the 1975 Emmy for Outstanding Entertainment – Children's Series.[2]


Initial proposal

Lou Scheimer of Filmation was in talks with _Star Trek_ producer Paramount Television, TV network NBC, and creator Gene Roddenberry to create an animated spin-off series while _The Original Series_ was still on the air, during its third season (1968-69).[3] Paramount's director of special programming Philip Mayer and Filmation writer/animator Don R. Christensen worked together to create a proposal for a series which would target a young audience and have an educational spin. The main cast of _Star Trek: The Original Series_ would train the teenage crew of a ship called _Excalibur_ about space exploration; the new teenage crew included a Vulcan named Steve, an African-American boy named Bob, and a Chinese boy named Stick.[4]

However, due to the bitter relationship between Roddenberry and Paramount at the time, Scheimer was not able to get the two parties talking to each other in order to agree on a deal for several years. During this time, the project in its original form was phased out.[5]


Production

A deal was finally reached in early 1973, and publicly announced in early March 1973. Because of NBC's strong interest in the series, Roddenberry and Filmation were allotted very generous terms: a guaranteed minimum of two seasons with a combined 22 episodes, a budget of $75,000 per episode, and full creative control in Gene Roddenberry's hands.[6]

Roddenberry and Filmation agreed that the series should be for all ages, rather than the children-oriented approach of the original proposal, and at Roddenberry's suggestion _The Original Series_ script editor D. C. Fontana was hired as the series' story editor and associate producer.[7] Despite the meager payment for writers ($1,300 per script, with no residuals), the opportunity to write a _Star Trek_ episode without the special effects limitations of live action proved appealing, and many _The Original Series_ writers joined the staff.[8] Fontana steered the series away from the romantic and sexual elements of _The Original Series_, as she felt children would not be interested in them and she wanted _The Animated Series_ to appeal to children as well as adults.[9]

_The Animated Series_ featured most of the original cast voicing their characters. The major exception was the character of Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), who did not appear in the series because the series' budget could not afford the complete cast.[10] He was replaced by Lieutenant Arex, whose Edosian species had three arms and three legs; Lieutenant M'Ress, a female Caitian, sometimes stood in for Uhura as communications officer. Besides performing their characters Montgomery Scott and Christine Chapel, James Doohan and Majel Barrett also performed the voices of Arex and M'Ress, respectively.

Initially, Filmation was only going to use the voices of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Doohan and Barrett. Doohan and Barrett would also perform the voices of Sulu and Uhura. Nimoy refused to voice Spock in the series unless Nichelle Nichols and George Takei were added to the cast, claiming that Sulu and Uhura were proof of the ethnic diversity of the 23rd century and should not be recast. Nimoy also took this stand as a matter of principle, as he knew of the financial troubles many of his _Star Trek_ co-stars were facing after cancellation of the series.[11] According to Scheimer, when Nimoy pointed out that the casting would cut the only two minority actors from the series, "We were horrified at our unintended slight, made all the worse because we were the one studio who had been championing diversity in its output."[12] Koenig was not forgotten, but Filmation were able to assuage Nimoy's complaints on his account by buying a script from Koenig for one episode ("The Infinite Vulcan").[13]

Voice recording began in June 1973, with the first three episodes recorded as an ensemble, i.e. all the voice actors for the episode in the room at the same time.[14] Later episodes used the more typical model of recording the voice actors separately to work around their other commitments. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, who were both touring in plays at the time, recorded their lines in whatever city they happened to be performing in and had the tapes shipped to the studio.[15] Doohan and Barrett, besides providing the voices of their _Original Series_ characters and newcomers Arex and M'Ress, performed virtually all of the "guest star" characters in the series, with exceptions such as Sarek, Cyrano Jones and Harry Mudd, who were performed by the original actors from _The Original Series_. Other guest voice actors included Ed Bishop, who voiced the Megan Prosecutor in "The Magicks of Megas-tu", and Ted Knight, who voiced Carter Winston in "The Survivor". Nichelle Nichols performed character voices in addition to Uhura in several episodes, including "The Time Trap" and "The Lorelei Signal".

Don Christensen, creator of the original proposal, remained involved as art director. Other animation staff included Reuben Timmins (who oversaw all shots involving the _Enterprise_) and a young Bob Kline. The animators rotoscoped the animations for the _Enterprise_ and the original cast from 35 mm film footage of _The Original Series_.[16] The chevrons were enlarged to make them easier to animate, but otherwise the crew's uniforms were unaltered from _The Original Series_.[17] Due to the hiring of nearly the entire regular cast of the original show, little money was left in the budget for the animation, so Filmation cut costs by using stock footage and shortcuts such as having a character put a hand to their mouth while speaking (thus eliminating the need to animate the lips) and silhouetting characters in action.[18]

The animated series dispensed with the original series' theme music, composed by Alexander Courage, in favor of a new theme credited to Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael, but actually written by Filmation composer Ray Ellis. Ellis used the pseudonym Yvette Blais (the maiden name of his wife) due to complications with royalties and publishing companies, while Jeff Michael is a pseudonym for producer Norm Prescott, who received a pseudonymous credit and a cut of the royalties on all of Filmation's music as part of a standard deal for the time.[19]

Reception

In 1975, _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ won an Emmy.[20] The series is noted for the voice acting of actress Majel Barret, who voiced various characters and the main computer.[21] Majel also had roles in the live-action series for voice acting, but also as Number One, Nurse Christine Chapel, and Lwaxanna Troi.

Through both seasons, _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ faced the reverse situation of _The Original Series_ with regard to its popularity: ratings were high, but skewed away from the young children which Saturday morning advertisers were trying to reach, being more popular with adults and older children.[22]

_Star Trek: The Animated Series_ was named the 96th best animated series by IGN. They declared that although the series suffered from technical limitations, its format allowed the writers far greater freedom and creativity than was possible in the original live-action series.[23] In 2019, CBR ranked all 31 seasons _Star Trek_ television shows, placing Season 1 of TAS at 23, and season 2 at 24. Similarly to IGN, they commented that "The animation is definitely limited by today's standards, but the idea of an animated Star Trek makes perfect sense, since concerns over budget and scope would be very different. Although only two seasons long, we were given some memorable moments."[24]

The comic _Star Trek vs Transformers_ was inspired by the animated series, and takes place in a similar universe.[25]

In 2016, in a listing that included each _Star Trek_ film and TV series separately, the animated series was ranked 11th by the _L.A. Times_.[26]

In 2019, Moviefone ranked the animated series seventh best out of seven Star Trek TV series.[27]
