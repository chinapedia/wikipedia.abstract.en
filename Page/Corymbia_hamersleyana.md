_CORYMBIA HAMERSLEYANA_, commonly known as the HAMERSLEY BLOODWOOD, BUNANGURU[1] or the PILBARA BLOODWOOD,[2] is a bloodwood native to Western Australia.[3]

The tree typically grows to a height of and has rough tessellated bark[4] that is persistent around the trunk and larger branches. The bark is a dull pale brown to red brown in colour and grey to cream underneath, shedding in small polygonal flakes. The adult leaves are disjunct with a narrow lanceolate to lanceolate shape. They are basally tapered with a dull, green to yellow-green colour, long and wide.[5]

It blooms between May and August[6] and produces compound, terminal conflorescences with regular seven flowered umbellasters. The flowers are white-cream and later produce ovoid to urceolate and pedicellate fruits.[7]

The range of the tree is in the north west of Western Australia in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions. It grows in sand or red sandy loams and is found on plains, hillsides and drainage lines.[8]
