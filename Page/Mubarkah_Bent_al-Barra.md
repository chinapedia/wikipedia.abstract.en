MUBARKAH BENT AL-BARRA (first name sometimes given as BATTA; sometimes MBARKA MINT AL-BARRA') (born 1957) is a Mauritanian poet and translator.

Al-Barra was born in al-Madhardhara, and studied in public schools before graduating with a degree in education from the Teachers High Institute of Nouakchott in 1983. In 1987 she received an MA in Maghrebi and Andalusian literatures from Mohammed V University. She teaches in the Teachers High Institute. Al-Barra is bilingual in Arabic and French, but writes mainly in the former.[1]

Al-Barra has extensively researched the oral poetry of Mauritania; more specifically, she has studied the _tibra_, a form of love poem whose recitation is restricted to all-female gatherings. Some of these she has translated into French. Her collection _Taranimli-Watanin Wahid_ (_Songs for a Country for All_) was published in 1992, and _Al-Shi'r al-Muritani al-Hadith, min 1970 ila 1995_ (_Modern Mauritanian Poetry, 1970-1995_) was published in 1998. Some of her poetry has been anthologized in English.[2] She also published a children's book, _Hikayat Jaddati_ (_My Grandmother's Tales_), in 1997, and was co-editor of a volume of folktales as well.[3] Al-Barra is prominent in Mauritanian cultural life, and has frequently attended literary festivals elsewhere in the Arab world.[4]
