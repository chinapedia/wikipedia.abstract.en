The West Indies cricket team toured Zimbabwe in October and November 2017 to play two Tests matches for the Clive Lloyd Trophy.[1] The teams last played a Test match against each other in March 2013.[2] Ahead of the Test series, the two teams also played a three-day warm-up fixture.[3] The series marked the international comebacks of Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis, after their resignation from their Kolpak deals.[4] West Indies won the series 1–0, after the final match finished in a draw.[5] It was the first Test series win for the West Indies with Jason Holder as captain, and the first time that Zimbabwe had drawn a Test match since playing Bangladesh in January 2005.[6]
