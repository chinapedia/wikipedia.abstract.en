In Alaska, THE BUSH typically refers to any region of the state not connected to the North American road network[1] or ready access to the state's ferry system. A large proportion of Alaska's native populations live in the bush, often substantially depending on subsistence hunting and fishing.[2][3]

Geographically, the bush comprises the Alaska North Slope; Northwest Arctic; West, including the Baldwin and Seward Peninsulas; the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Southwest Alaska; Bristol Bay; Alaska Peninsula; and remote areas of the Alaska Panhandle and Interior.

Some of the larger, hub communities in the bush, which typically can be reached by larger, commercial airplanes, include Bethel,[4] Dillingham,[5] King Salmon,[6] Nome,[7][8] Utqiagvik,[9][10] Kodiak Island,[11] Kotzebue,[12] and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.[13]

Most parts of Alaska that are off the road or ferry system can be reached by small bush airplanes.[14] Travel between smaller communities or to and from hub communities is typically accomplished by snow machines, boats, or ATVs.[15]
