Products

CloudBerry Lab develops software to help Managed Service Providers, businesses, and consumers manage backup and disaster recovery and perform cloud file management and synchronization. The company's main products include CloudBerry Managed Backup, CloudBerry Backup, CloudBerry Explorer, and CloudBerry Drive.

CloudBerry Backup

CloudBerry Backup and Managed Backup are solutions to automate the backup and recovery of files, folders, and system images. CloudBerry Backup is a standalone solution, while Managed Backup, a subscription SaaS offering for managed service providers and businesses, adds centralized administration, management, and reporting. The products were designed for backup to the cloud, but do support backups to local disk or network shares. The latest product versions can back up data to more than 20 different cloud storage providers, including Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, OpenStack, S3 Compatible, and others.[15]

CloudBerry Backup and Managed Backup employ a storage-agnostic model. Customers license the software from CloudBerry, but contract directly with the cloud providers of their choice for backup storage. Customers get to choose the cloud storage provider that offers the features and pricing that best suits their needs. Customers can change storage vendors at any time without having to change backup vendors. In this way, CloudBerry Lab can support customers of varying size and need. The products provide end-to-end encryption of data.

CloudBerry Explorer

CloudBerry Explorer is a Windows solution with free and paid licensing options for managing files between local storage and remote online storage. Versions are available for Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and OpenStack.[16][17]

CloudBerry Drive

CloudBerry Drive is a solution that mounts cloud storage on a Windows desktop or server. The product allows customers to work with cloud storage as though it were local storage.[18][19]

CloudBerry Remote Assistant

CloudBerry Remote Assistant is a solution for remote control and desktop sharing. The software is currently in beta and is available for Microsoft Windows for free. Remote Assistant encrypts connections and includes text and voice chat.[20][21]
