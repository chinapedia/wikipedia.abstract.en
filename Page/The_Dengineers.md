_THE DENGINEERS_ is a British children's DIY television series hosted by Lauren Layfield and Joe Tracini and airs on CBBC. The series was previously hosted by Mark Wright. The designers are currently Sege Rosella, Olga Skumial, Tony Broomhead, Satwinder Samra, Maral Rahmantalab and formerly Dee Saigal. Series 1 began on 21 November 2015 and ended on 30 January 2016. A special one-off episode will air on 12 November 2016, featuring the best bits from the previous series with series 2 starting on 19 November 2016.[1] The series is similar to DIY SOS, with the help of expert designers and builders and the youngsters themselves, the Dengineers team will then construct an extraordinary den, either completely from scratch or by transforming an existing space in the home, like a cellar or attic.

As of early 2017, _The Dengineers_ is also airing in the United States on the Discovery Family cable network. In 2017, a special in partnership with Children in Need and _Blue Peter_ aired with guests Naomi Wilkinson, Ayshah Tull, Katie Thistleton, Ben Shires, Rhys Stephenson and Hacker T. Dog.


Production

_The Dengineers_ was first announced on 16 December 2014, with other CBBC commissions for 2015. On 11 April 2015, it was announced that Mark Wright would host with then-future CBBC HQ host Lauren Layfield. On 7 July 2016, a second series was commissioned. On 11 April 2017, it was announced that Wright was set to leave and be replaced by Joe Tracini.
