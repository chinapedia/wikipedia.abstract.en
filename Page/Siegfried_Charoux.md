SIEGFRIED JOSEPH CHAROUX (15 November 1896 – 26 April 1967) was an artist, primarily a figurative sculptor working in bronze, stone or terracotta. Born in Austria, he moved to England in 1935, where he became naturalised in 1946.


Early and private life

Charoux was born in Vienna. His father Josef Kinich was a civil engineer who had served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. His mother Anna Buchta (née Charous) was a dressmaker. She had Czech ancestry, and was the widow of Johann Buchta. He was given the name Siegfried Buchta at birth, and was renamed Siegfried Charous in 1914 after his mother's maiden name. He changed the spelling to Charoux in 1926, at the time of his marriage to Margarethe Treibl (1895 - 1985). They had no children.

He attended schools in Vienna, and was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in early 1915. His right hand was wounded in the First World War, with nerve damage causing paralysis, and he left the army due to his wounds in 1917. He regained use of his right arm after a successful surgical operation.


Career in Vienna

He studied privately under . He was rejected by the Vienna School of Applied Arts (Hochschule für angewandte Kunst), but attended the Vienna Academy (Akademie der Bildenden Künste), under , from 1922 to 1924.

He was a political cartoonist from about 1923 to about 1933, using the pseudonym "Chat Roux". His cartoons were published in the _Arbeiter-Zeitung_ and other left-wing journals. He shifted to sculpture, opening his own studio in 1926, and made memorials in Vienna to Robert Blum (1927) and Matteotti (1929). In 1930 he won an international competition to create a memorial statue to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, erected in Judenplatz in 1935. (The statue was removed by the Nazi regime after 1939 and destroyed. After the Second World War, Charoux was commissioned to replace the lost memorial with a bronze copy, which was unveiled in 1968, the year after his death, at in Vienna; it was moved back to Judenplatz in 1981.)


Career in England

He did stone carvings for the School of Anatomy and the Engineering Laboratory at Cambridge University in 1948. His terracotta statue _Youth: Standing Boy_ (1948) - built using an Etruscan technique in layers without an armature - was bought by the Tate Gallery in 1948, using funds from the Chantrey Bequest. The Tate also holds his statue of _Civilisation: The Judge_ (1962), made for the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand as part of a series of six sculptures, the others including _Cellist_ for the Royal Festival Hall, _Motorcyclist_ for the Shell Building on the South Bank, _Violinist_, and _Survivor_.[1][2] He also contributed to open-air exhibitions of sculptures held at Battersea Park in 1948, 1951, 1954, and 1960, and at Holland Park in 1957. He also exhibited watercolours at the Piccadilly Gallery in 1958.

His monumental relief work in concrete, _The Islanders_, depicting three figures, man woman and child, was exhibited at the Festival of Britain in 1951 as part of the Sea and Ships Pavilion designed by Basil Spence, but it was destroyed after the exhibition closed. He also made nine monumental figures, tall, embodying Manual and Spiritual Labour, for the new Salters' Hall, also designed by Basil Spence. He created his sculpture _The Neighbours_ for the Quadrant Estate in Highbury (1959) and his sculpture _Man_ for the South Bank in 1960.
