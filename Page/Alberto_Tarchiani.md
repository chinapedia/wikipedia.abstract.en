ALBERTO TARCHIANI (11 November 1885 – 30 November 1964) was an Italian journalist, politician, and diplomat.

Born in Rome, Tarchiani studied at La Sapienza, at the University of Genoa and at the University of Florence, and started working as a journalist in 1903. In 1907 he moved to New York, where he directed the weekly magazine _Il Cittadino_. In 1915 he returned to Italy to serve as a voluntary in the Italian Army in World War I. In 1919 he was employed by _Corriere della Sera_, remaining there until 1925, when because of his opposition to Fascism he was forced to emigrate in France.[1][2]

In Paris, Tarchiani was among the founders of _Giustizia e Libertà_ and collaborated to the newspaper '' La giovine Italia''. Following the 1940 German invasion of France, he moved to New York where he was secretary of the Mazzini Society. With the fall of Fascism, Tarchiani served as Minister of Public Works in the Badoglio cabinet, as head the Office of National Reconstruction in the subsequent Bonomi cabinet, and as ambassador in the United States from 1945 to 1955.[3][4]
