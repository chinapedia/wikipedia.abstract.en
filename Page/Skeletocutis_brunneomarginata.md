_SKELETOCUTIS BRUNNEOMARGINATA_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Found in the United States, it was described as new to science in 2007 by Norwegian mycologist Leif Ryvarden. He collected the type in Bent Creek Experimental Forest, North Carolina in 2004. The fungus is very similar in appearance to _Skeletocutis kühneri_, but with a brown margin and subiculum.[1] _S. brunneomarginata_ is one of 14 _Skeletocutis_ species that occurs in North America.[2]
