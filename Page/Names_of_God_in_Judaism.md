The name of God most often used in the Hebrew Bible is the Tetragrammaton (YHWH ). It is frequently anglicized as Jehovah and Yahweh and written in most English editions of the Bible as "the " owing to the Jewish tradition increasingly viewing the divine name as too sacred to be uttered. It was thus replaced vocally in the synagogue ritual by the Hebrew word _Adonai_ (“My Lords”), which was translated as _Kyrios_ (“Lord”) in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures.[1]

Rabbinic Judaism describes seven names which are so holy that, once written, should not be erased: YHWH and six others which can be categorized as titles are El ("God"), Eloah ("God"), Elohim ("Gods"), Shaddai (“Almighty"), Ehyeh ("I Will Be"), and Tzevaot ("[of] Hosts").[2] Other names are considered mere epithets or titles reflecting different aspects of God, but _chumrah_ sometimes dictates special care such as the writing of "G-d" instead of "God" in English or saying Ṭēt-Vav (,  "9-6") instead of Yōd-Hē (,  "10-5" but also "Jah") for the number fifteen in Hebrew.[3]

The documentary hypothesis proposes that the Torah was compiled from various original sources, two of which (the Jahwist and the Elohist) are named for their usual names for God (Yahweh and Elohim respectively).[4]


Seven Names of God

The seven names of God that, once written, cannot be erased because of their holiness[5] are the Tetragrammaton, El, Elohim, Eloah, Elohai, El Shaddai, and Tzevaot.[6] In addition, the name Jah—because it forms part of the Tetragrammaton—is similarly protected.[7] Rabbi Jose considered "Tzevaot" a common name[8] and Rabbi Ishmael that "Elohim" was.[9] All other names, such as "Merciful", "Gracious" and "Faithful", merely represent attributes that are also common to human beings.[10]

YHWH

Tetragrammaton_scripts.svg}} (  – 500 ), Aramaic (  – 200 ), and modern Hebrew scripts.]] Tehilim_scroll.png can be clearly seen six times in this portion.]] The name of God used most often in the Hebrew Bible is YHWH (), also known as the Tetragrammaton (Greek for "four-letter [word]"). Hebrew is an abjad, so the word's letters Yōd, Hē, Vav, Hē are usually taken for consonants and expanded to Yahweh in English.

In modern Jewish culture, it is accepted as forbidden to pronounce the name the way that it is spelled. In prayers it is pronounced Adonai, and in discussion is usually said as HaShem, meaning “The Name”. The exact pronunciation is uncertain because—although there is nothing in the Torah to prohibit the saying of the name[12] and Ruth shows it was being pronounced as late as the 5th century [13]—it had ceased to be spoken aloud by at least the 3rd century  during Second Temple Judaism[14] and vowel points were not written until the early medieval period. The Masoretic Text uses vowel points of Adonai or Elohim (depending on the context) marking the pronunciation as _Yəhōwāh_ (, ); however, scholarly consensus is that this is not the original pronunciation.[15] (For a discussion of subtle pronunciation changes between what is preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures and what is read, see Qere and Ketiv.)

The Tetragrammaton first appears in Genesis[16] and occurs 6828 times in total in the Stuttgart edition of the Masoretic Text. It is thought to be an archaic third-person singular imperfect tense of the verb "to be" (i.e., "[He] was being"). This agrees with the passage in Exodus where God names Himself as "I Will Be What I Will Be"[17] using the first-person singular imperfect tense.

Rabbinical Judaism teaches that the name is forbidden to all except the High Priest, who should only speak it in the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. He then pronounces the name "just as it is written".[18] As each blessing was made, the people in the courtyard were to prostrate themselves completely as they heard it spoken aloud. As the Temple has not been rebuilt since its destruction in 70 , most modern Jews never pronounce YHWH but instead read Adonai ("My Lord") during prayer and while reading the Torah and as HaShem ("The Name") at other times.[19][20] Similarly, the Vulgate used __ ("The Lord") and most English translations of the Bible write "the " for YHWH and "the God", "the Lord " or "the Sovereign " for Adonai YHWH instead of transcribing the name. The Septuagint may have originally used the Hebrew letters themselves amid its Greek text[21][22] but there is no scholarly consensus on this point. All surviving Christian-era manuscripts use _Kyrios_ [, "Lord") or very occasionally _Theos_ [, "God"] to translate the many thousand occurrences of the Name. (However, given the great preponderance of the anarthrous _Kyrios_ solution for translating YHWH in the Septuagint and some disambiguation efforts by Christian-era copyists involving Kyrios (see especially scribal activity in Acts[23]), _Theos_ should probably not be considered historically as a serious early contender substitute for the divine Name.)

El

El appears in Ugaritic, Phoenician and other 2nd and 1st millennium  texts both as generic "god" and as the head of the divine pantheon.[24] In the Hebrew Bible El (Hebrew: ) appears very occasionally alone (e.g. Genesis 33:20, _el elohe yisrael_, "El the God of Israel",[25] and Genesis 46:3, _ha'el elohe abika_, "El the God of thy father"),[26] but usually with some epithet or attribute attached (e.g. _El Elyon_, "Most High El", _El Shaddai_, "El of _Shaddai_", _El `Olam_ "Everlasting El", _El Hai_, "Living El", _El Ro'i_ "El my Shepherd", and _El Gibbor_ "El of Strength"), in which cases it can be understood as the generic "god". In theophoric names such as Gabriel ("Strength of God"), Michael ("Who is like God?"), Raphael ("God's medicine"), Ariel ("God's lion"), Daniel ("God's Judgment"), Israel ("one who has struggled with God"), Immanuel ("God is with us"), and Ishmael ("God Hears"/"God Listens") it is usually interpreted and translated as "God", but it is not clear whether these "el"s refer to the deity in general or to the god El in particular.[27]

Eloah

Elohim

A common name of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (). Despite the _-im_ ending common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word _Elohim_ when referring to God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular verb in the Hebrew Bible. The word is identical to the usual plural of _el_ meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the _{{'}}lhm_ found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as "Elohim" although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown. When the Hebrew Bible uses _elohim_ not in reference to God, it is plural (for example, Exodus 20:2). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example _Behemoth_. In Modern Hebrew, the singular word _ba'alim_ ("owner") looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.

A number of scholars have traced the etymology to the Semitic root _*yl_, "to be first, powerful", despite some difficulties with this view.[28] _Elohim_ is thus the plural construct "powers". Hebrew grammar allows for this form to mean "He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)", just as the word _Ba'alim_ means "owner" (see above). "He is lord (singular) even over any of those things that he owns that are lordly (plural)."

Theologians who dispute this claim cite the hypothesis that plurals of majesty came about in more modern times. Richard Toporoski, a classics scholar, asserts that plurals of majesty first appeared in the reign of Diocletian ( 284–305).[29] Indeed, Gesenius states in his book _Hebrew Grammar_ the following:[30]

  The Jewish grammarians call such plurals … _plur. virium_ or _virtutum_; later grammarians call them _plur. excellentiae_, _magnitudinis_, or _plur. maiestaticus_.

  This last name may have been suggested by the _we_ used by kings when speaking of themselves (compare 1 Maccabees 10:19 and 11:31); and the plural used by God in Genesis 1:26 and 11:7; Isaiah 6:8 has been incorrectly explained in this way). It is, however, either _communicative_ (including the attendant angels: so at all events in Isaiah 6:8 and Genesis 3:22), or according to others, an indication of _the fullness of power and might_ implied. It is best explained as a plural of _self-deliberation_. The use of the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to Hebrew.

Mark S. Smith has cited the use of plural as possible evidence to suggest an evolution in the formation of early Jewish conceptions of monotheism, wherein references to "the gods" (plural) in earlier accounts of verbal tradition became either interpreted as multiple aspects of a single monotheistic God at the time of writing, or subsumed under a form of monolatry, wherein the god(s) of a certain city would be accepted after the fact as a reference to the God of Israel and the plural deliberately dropped.[31]

The plural form ending in _-im_ can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words _chayyim_ ("life") or _betulim_ ("virginity"). If understood this way, _Elohim_ means "divinity" or "deity". The word _chayyim_ is similarly syntactically singular when used as a name but syntactically plural otherwise.

In many of the passages in which _elohim_ occurs in the Bible it refers to non-Israelite deities, or in some instances to powerful men or judges, and even angels (Exodus 21:6, Psalms 8:5) as a simple plural in those instances.

Elohai

Elohai or Elohei ("My God") is a form of Elohim along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. It appears in the names "God of Abraham" (_Elohai Avraham_); "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (_Elohai Avraham, Elohai Yitzchak ve Elohai Yaʿaqov_); and "God of Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel" (_Elohai Sara, Elohai Rivka, Elohai Leah ve Elohai Rakhel_).

El Shaddai

El Shaddai (, ) is one of the names of God in Judaism, with its etymology coming from the influence of the Ugaritic religion on modern Judaism. El Shaddai is conventionally translated as "God Almighty". While the translation of _El_ as "god" in Ugarit/Canaanite language is straightforward, the literal meaning of _Shaddai_ is the subject of debate.

Tzevaot

Tzevaot, Tsebaoth or Sabaoth (, ,  "Armies") appears in reference to armies or armed hosts of men in Exodus[32] and Isaiah[33][34] but is not used as a divine epithet in the Torah, Joshua, or Judges. In the First Book of Samuel, David uses the name YHWH Tzavaot and immediately glosses it as "the God of the armies of Israel".[35] The same name appears in the prophets along with YHWH Elohe Tzevaot, Elohey Tzevaot, and Adonai YHWH Tzevaot. These are usually translated in the King James Version as the "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord God of Hosts". In its later uses, however, it often denotes God in His role as leader of the heavenly hosts.

The Hebrew word _Sabaoth_ was also absorbed in Ancient Greek (σαβαωθ, sabaoth) and Latin (_Sabaoth_, with no declination). Tertullian and other patristics used it with the meaning of _Army of angels of God_.[36]

Jah

The abbreviated form Jah ()[37] or Yah (; , _Yahu_) appears in the Psalms[38] and Isaiah.[39] It is a common element in Hebrew theophoric names such as Elijah and also appears in the forms _yahu_ ("Jeremiah"), _yeho_ ("Joshua"), and _yo_ ("John", ultimately from the biblical "Yohanan" and Jonathan, "God gives". It also appears 24 times in the Psalms as a part of Hallelujah ("Praise Jah").[40]


Other names and titles

Adonai

Shefa_Tal.png with Adonai inscribed.]] Adonai (,  "My Lords") is the plural form of _adon_ ("Lord") along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. As with Elohim, Adonai's grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Bible, it is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). As pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided in the Hellenistic period, Jews may have begun to drop the Tetragrammaton when presented alongside Adonai and subsequently expand it to cover for the Tetragrammaton in the forms of spoken prayer and written scripture. Owing to the expansion of _chumra_ (the idea of "building a fence around the Torah"), Adonai itself has come to be too holy to say for Orthodox Jews, leading to its replacement by HaShem ("The Name").

The singular forms adon and adoni ("my lord") are used in the Hebrew Bible as royal titles,[41][42] as in the First Book of Samuel,[43] and for distinguished persons. The Phoenicians used it as a title of Tammuz, the origin of the Greek Adonis. It is also used very occasionally in Hebrew texts to refer to God (e.g. Ps 136:3.)[44]

Deuteronomy 10:17 has the proper name _Yahweh_ alongside the superlative constructions "God of gods" _elōhê ha-elōhîm_ and "Lord of lords" ''adōnê ha-adōnîm '' (; KJV: "For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords").

The final syllable of Adonai uses the vowel kamatz, rather than patach which would be expected from the Hebrew for "my lord(s)". Prof. Yoel Elitzur explains this as a normal transformation when a Hebrew word becomes a name, giving as other examples Nathan, Yitzchak, and Yigal.[45]

Adoshem

Up until the mid-twentieth century, the use of the word _Adoshem_, combining the first two syllables of "Adonai" with the last syllable of "Hashem"', was quite common. This was discouraged by Rabbi David HaLevi Segal in his commentary to the Shulchan Aruch. His rationale was that it is disrespectful to combine a Name of God with another word. It took a few centuries for the word to fall into almost complete disuse. Despite being obsolete in most circles, it is used occasionally in conversation in place of _Adonai_ by Jews who do not wish to say _Adonai_ but need to specify the substitution of that particular word. It is also used when quoting from the liturgy in a non-liturgical context, especially as a substitute in musical pieces where a replacement for "Adonai" must have the same number of syllables. For example, Shlomo Carlebach performed his prayer "Shema Yisrael" with the words _Shema Yisrael Adoshem Elokeinu Adoshem Eḥad_ instead of _Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Eḥad_.

Baal

Baal (),[46] properly Baʿal, meant "owner" and, by extension, "lord", "master", and "husband" in Hebrew and the other Northwest Semitic languages. In some early contexts and theophoric names, it and Baali (; "My Lord") were treated as synonyms of Adon and Adonai. After the time of Solomon[47] and particularly after Jezebel's attempt to promote the worship of the Lord of Tyre Melqart, however, the name became particularly associated with the Canaanite storm god Baʿal Haddu and was gradually avoided as a title for Yahweh.[48] Several names that included it were rewritten as _bosheth_ ("shame"). The prophet Hosea in particular reproached the Israelites for continuing to use the term:[49]

Ehyeh asher ehyeh

_Ehyeh asher ehyeh_ (Hebrew: אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה) is the first of three responses given to Moses when he asks for God's name in the Book of Exodus.[50] The King James Version of the Bible translates the Hebrew as "I Am that I Am" and uses it as a proper name for God. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos leaves the phrase untranslated and is so quoted in the Talmud (B. B. 73a.)

The word _ehyeh_ is the first-person singular imperfect form of _hayah_, "to be", usually translated into English as "I will be". Because Classical Hebrew had an aspectual system rather than grammatical tense, in which the imperfect denotes any actions that are not yet completed, the verb form _ehyeh_ can be translated as "I am/I am being/I will be" (e.g. Exodus 3:12, "Certainly I will be [ehyeh] with thee.").[51]

Although _Ehyeh asher ehyeh_ is generally rendered in English "I am that I am", better renderings might be "I will be what I will be" or "I will be who I will be", or "I shall prove to be whatsoever I shall prove to be" or even "I will be because I will be".[52] Other renderings include: Leeser, “I Will Be that I Will Be”; Rotherham, "I Will Become whatsoever I please", New World Translation (2013 Edition): "I Will Become What I Choose to Become."[53][54] Greek, _Ego eimi ho on_ (ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν), "I am The Being" in the Septuagint,[55] and Philo,[56][57] and Revelation[58] or, "I am The Existing One"; Lat., _ego sum qui sum_, "I am Who I am."

The word _asher_ is a relative pronoun whose meaning depends on the immediate context, so that "that", "who", "which", or "where" are all possible translations of that word.[59]

Elah

Elah (Aramaic: אֱלָה; pl. "elim") is the Aramaic word for God. The origin of the word is uncertain and it may be related to a root word, meaning "reverence". Elah is found in the Tanakh in the books of Ezra, Jeremiah (Jer 10:11, the only verse in the entire book written in Aramaic),[60] and Daniel. Elah is used to describe both pagan gods and the Jews' God. The word 'Elah - ' is also an Arabic word which means god. The name is etymologically related to Allah used by Muslims.

-   Elah Yisrael, God of Israel (Ezra 5:1)
-   Elah Yerushelem, God of Jerusalem (Ezra 7:19)
-   Elah Shemaya, God of Heaven (Ezra 7:23)
-   Elah-avahati, God of my fathers, (Daniel 2:23)
-   Elah Elahin, God of gods (Daniel 2:47)

El Roi

In the Book of Genesis, Hagar is said to use this name for God who spoke to her through his angel. In Hebrew, her phrase "El Roi" is taken as an epithet of God ("God of Seeing")[61] although the King James Version translates it as a statement: "Thou God seest me."[62]

Elyon

The name Elyon (Hebrew: עליון) occurs in combination with El, YHWH, Elohim and alone. It appears chiefly in poetic and later Biblical passages. The modern Hebrew adjective "`Elyon" means "supreme" (as in "Supreme Court") or "Most High". _El Elyon_ has been traditionally translated into English as 'God Most High'. The Phoenicians used what appears to be a similar name for God, one that the Greeks wrote as Έλιον. It is cognate to the Arabic _`Aliyy_.

Eternal One

"The Eternal One" is increasingly used, particularly in Reform and Reconstructionist communities seeking to use gender-neutral language.[63] In the Torah, "Hashem Kel Olam" ("the Everlasting God") is used at Genesis 21:33 to refer to God.[64]

HaShem

It is common Jewish practice to restrict the use of the names of God to a liturgical context. In casual conversation some Jews, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God _HaShem_ (), which is Hebrew for "the Name" (cf. Leviticus 24:11 and Deuteronomy 28:58). Likewise, when quoting from the Tanakh or prayers, some pious Jews will replace _Adonai_ with _HaShem_. For example, when making audio recordings of prayer services, _HaShem_[65] will generally be substituted for _Adonai_.

A popular expression containing this phrase is _Baruch HaShem_, meaning "Thank God" (literally, "Blessed be the Name").[66]

Shalom

Talmudic authors,[67] ruling on the basis of Gideon's name for an altar ("YHVH-Shalom", according to Judges 6:24), write that "the name of God is 'Peace'" (_Pereq ha-Shalom_, Shab. 10b); consequently, a Talmudic opinion (_Shabbat_, 10b) asserts that one would greet another with the word __ in order for the word not to be forgotten in the exile. But one is not permitted to greet another with the word __ in unholy places such as a bathroom, because of holiness of the name.

Shekhinah

_Shekhinah_ () is the presence or manifestation of God which has descended to "dwell" among humanity. The term never appears in the Hebrew Bible; later rabbis used the word when speaking of God dwelling either in the Tabernacle or amongst the people of Israel. The root of the word means "dwelling". Of the principal names of God, it is the only one that is of the feminine gender in Hebrew grammar. Some believe that this was the name of a female counterpart of God, but this is unlikely as the name is always mentioned in conjunction with an article (e.g.: "the Shekhina descended and dwelt among them" or "He removed Himself and His Shekhina from their midst"). This kind of usage does not occur in Semitic languages in conjunction with proper names.

The Arabic form of the word "__ " is also mentioned in the Quran. This mention is in the middle of the narrative of the choice of Saul to be king and is mentioned as descending with the Ark of the Covenant, here the word is used to mean "security" and is derived from the root sa-ka-na which means dwell:

    And (further) their Prophet said to them: "A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the Covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a Symbol for you if ye indeed have faith."

Writing divine names

Polyglot_Psalter.png. Manuscript on parchment, 12th century.]] In Jewish tradition the sacredness of the divine name or titles must be recognized by the professional _sofer_ (scribe) who writes Torah scrolls, or tefillin and mezuzah. Before transcribing any of the divine titles or name he prepares mentally to sanctify them. Once he begins a name he does not stop until it is finished, and he must not be interrupted while writing it, even to greet a king. If an error is made in writing it may not be erased, but a line must be drawn round it to show that it is canceled, and the whole page must be put in a _genizah_ (burial place for scripture) and a new page begun.


Kabbalistic use

One of the most important names is that of the Ein Sof ( "Endless"), which first came into use after  1300.[71] The forty-two-lettered name contains the combined names , that when spelled out contains 42 letters. The equivalent in value of YHWH (spelled = 45) is the forty-five-lettered name.

The seventy-two-lettered name is derived from three verses in Exodus (14:19–21) beginning with "Vayyissa", "Vayyabo" and "Vayyet" respectively. Each of the verses contains 72 letters, and when combined they form 72 names, known collectively as the Shemhamphorasch. The kabbalistic book _Sefer Yetzirah_ explains that the creation of the world was achieved by the manipulation of these sacred letters that form the names of God.


English names

The words "God" and "Lord" are written by some Jews as "G-d" and "L-rd" as a way of avoiding writing any name of God in full out of respect. Deuteronomy 12:3–4 reads, "And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God." From this it is understood that one should not erase or blot out the name of God. The general halachic opinion is that this only applies to the sacred Hebrew names of God, but not to other euphemistic references; there is a dispute whether the word "God" in English or other languages may be erased or whether Jewish law and/or Jewish custom forbids doing so, directly or as a precautionary "fence" about the law.[72] The hyphenated version of the English name ("G-d") can be destroyed, so by writing that form, religious Jews prevent documents in their possession with the unhyphenated form from being destroyed later. Alternatively, a euphemistic English reference such as "Hashem" (literally, "the Name") may be substituted, or an abbreviation thereof, such as B{{'}}{{'}}H (B'ezrat Hashem, literally, "By the blessing of the Name").

This issue is most controversial in the context of the United States Motto, "In God We Trust", which has been minted or printed since its first appearance in 1864 without hyphenation. While many Jews will write the name "God" in English, others will not, or only under special circumstances. By comparison, Israel struck down efforts to enshrine an allusive reference to God (ב''ה, literally "B '' H", an abbreviation of the allusion "Blessed by the Name") on modern Israeli currency in 2002, 2003, and 2009. The frequency of currency destruction was considered too high for Israelis to tolerate the name of God being printed or minted on Israeli banknotes or coins and subsequently destroyed. According to Talmudic Tractate Rosh Hashana (18B4), Jews in the times of the Hasmonean Kingdom were "weaned off" the practice of writing the name of Heaven by the Sages, arguing that such documents could be disposed of thoughtlessly. The day the Sages succeeded in weaning the people off the practice was celebrated as a holiday in ancient Israel on the Third of Tishrei, a date now dedicated to the Fast of Gedaliah, which is conceptually related, as it establishes that "the death of the righteous is likened to the burning of the House of our G-d".
