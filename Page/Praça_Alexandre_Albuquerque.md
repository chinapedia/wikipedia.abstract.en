PRAÇA ALEXANDRE ALBUQUERQUE is the main square of the capital city of Praia, Cape Verde. It is located in the southwestern part of the Plateau, the historical city centre of Praia. Formerly known as _Praça do Pelourinho_, it received its current name in 1876 in honour of the Portuguese colonial governor Caetano Alexandre de Almeida e Albuquerque.[1][2] It is lined with several historical public buildings and townhouses, many of which date from the 19th century. The square is surrounded by Rua Patrice Lumumba, Rua Serpa Pinto and Avenida Amílcar Cabral.
