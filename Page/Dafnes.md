Dafnes is an agricultural centre producing sultanas, grapes, wine, spirits, vegetables and olive oil. Since the 13th century it is known for its rich, sweet red "Dafnes" wines made from the Liatiko grape variety.

The central plaza is shaded by large eucalyptus trees and ringed by cafés and kafenia. The plaza is the main location of the widely known Dafnes Wine Festival, normally celebrated during the first ten days of July. Immediately north of the plaza stands the small church Agia Zoni Agios Nikolaos, built in 1685.
