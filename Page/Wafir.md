WĀFIR (, literally 'numerous, abundant, ample, exuberant') is a meter used in classical Arabic poetry. It is among the five most popular metres of classical Arabic poetry, accounting (alongside _ṭawīl_, _basīṭ_, _kāmil_, and _mutaqārib_) for 80-90% of lines and poems in the ancient and classical Arabic corpus.[1]


Form

The metre comprises paired hemistichs of the following form (where "–" represents a long syllable, "u" a short syllable, and "uu" one long or two shorts):[2]

    | u – uu – | u – uu – | u – – |

Thus, unlike most classical Arabic metres, _wāfir_ allows the poet to substitute one long syllable for two shorts, an example of the prosodic element known as a _biceps_. Thus allows _wāfir_ lines to have different numbers of syllables from each other, a characteristic otherwise only found in _kāmil_, _mutadārik_ and some forms of _basīṭ_.[3]

_Wāfir_ is traditionally represented with the mnemonic (_tafāʿīl_) __ ().


History

Historically, _wāfir_ perhaps arose, along with _ṭawīl_ and _mutaqārib_, from _hazaj_.[4] In the analysis of Salma K. Jayyusi, the Umayyad poet Jarir ibn Atiyah used the metre for about a fifth of his work, and at that time "this metre was still fresh and did not carry echoes of great pre-Islamic poets as did _ṭawīl_ and _baṣīt_. _Wāfir_ had therefore a great potential for introducing a diction nearer to the spoken language of the Umayyad period."[5]

The metre, like other Arabic metres, was later borrowed into other poetic traditions. For example, it was adopted in Hebrew, where it is known as _hamerubeh_[6] and became one of the pre-eminent metres of medieval poetry.[7] In the Arabic and Arabic-influenced vernacular poetry of Sub-Saharan Africa it also features,[8] for example in Fula[9] and Hausa.[10] It also underpins some oral poetic traditions in Palestine today.[11] However, it was not used in Urdu, Turkish, or Persian (or perhaps, rather, it can be said to have merged for linguistic reasons with _hazaj_).[12]


Examples

The following Arabic epigram by ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī is in _wāfir_ metre:[13]





      katamtu sma l-ḥabībi mina l-‘ibādī | wa-raddadtu ṣ-ṣabābata fī fu’ādī
      fa-wā-shawqī ’ilā baladin khaliyyin | la‘allī bi-smi man ’ahwā ’unādī

      I have hidden the name of my love from the crowd: | for my passion my heart is the only safe space.
      How I long for an empty and desolate place | in order to call my love's name out aloud.

An example of the metre in Fula is the following poem by Ïsa ɓii Usmānu (1817-?):[14]

      Kulen Allaahu Mawɗo nyalooma jemma, | Mbaɗen ka salaatu, hooti mbaɗen salaama
      He dow ɓurnaaɗo tagle he Aalo’en fuu, | Sahaabo’en he taabi’i, yimɓe himma.
      Nufaare nde am mi yusɓoya gimɗi, anndee, | mi woyra ɗi Naana; ɓernde fu firgitaama
      He yautuki makko, koowa he anndi juulɓe | mbaɗii hasar haqiiqa, cunninaama.

      Let us fear Allah the Great day and night, | let us continually invoke blessing and peace
      Upon the best of creatures and all his kinsfolk, | his companions and followers, men of zeal.
      Know ye, my intention is to compose verses | and with them to lament for Nāna; every heart is startled
      At her passing, everyone knows that the Moslems | have suffered loss indeed, and have been saddened.
