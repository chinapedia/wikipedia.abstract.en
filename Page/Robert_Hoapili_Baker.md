ROBERT HOAPILI KEKAIPUKAʻALA KAHALELAUKOA BAKER (/1847 – April 4, 1900) was an Hawaiian ali'i (noble), military officer, courtesan and politician who served many political posts in the Kingdom of Hawaii, including Governor of Maui, Privy Councillor and Aide-de-camp to King Kalākaua.


Birth and lineage

Robert Hoapili Baker was born sometime between 1845 and 1847, in Waikapu, on the island of Maui[1] to Malie Napuʻupahoehoe, his mother. Hoapili's lineage goes back to the historic ruler of Hawaii Island named Liloa through the House of Moana and a figure named Napuupahoehoe, as per his genealogy publishing in the Ka Makaainana newspaper in 1896, and subsequently reprinted in the compendium of Hawaiian Genealogies by Edith Kawelohea McKinzie in 1983[2][3]. The article states that Napuuahoehoe was the father of Malie who married Ikekeleiaiku and had Robert Hoapili Baker. Elsewhere, Robert Hoapili's father's name is spelled Kekeleeiku.[4][5]

In a letter to the editor of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser on December 11, 1901 addressing an unrelated matter, that name is spelled Ikekeleeiku, who is said to be the father of Robert Hoapili Baker, and a son (together with Kaumuali'i) of Queen Kamakahelei, Ali’i Nui of Kaua’i[6]. This letter is also reproduced by Edith Kawelohea McKinzie in the second volume of her book on Hawaiian Genealogy[7]. Whilst there are no primary sources from the lifetimes of Kamakahelei or Ikekeleiaiku, a number of twentieth century Hawaiian letter writers also assert that Robert Hoapili Baker was the grandson of Kamakahelei.[8][9] This connection to Kamakahelei is also made in another letter published in Ke Aloha Aina on 15 March 1902 where it is claimed that the ʻahu ʻula of Kamakahelei was draped on the coffin of Robert Hoapili Baker at his funeral.[10]

In his book; _Return to Kahiki: Native Hawaiians in Oceania_ by Kealani Cook, the author states that aliʻi wahine, Malie Napuʻupahoehoe had Robert Hoapili Baker with Captain Adam Baker, making him the half brother of John Timoteo Baker.[11] However, in an obituary published at the time of his death it was stated that "Robert Hoapili was the real name of this distinguished native, Baker being added in honor of the white man in whose family he was reared."[12]


Early life, political and military career

Under the auspice of Anglican priest Archdeacon George Mason, Hoapili was educated at the Anglican boarding schools: the Luaehu School in Lahaina, Maui and the St. Alban's College in Honolulu. He was educated alongside Samuel Nowlein and Curtis P. Iaukea.[13]

At a young age, Hoapili showed a strong interest in military affair. He began his service to the Hawaiian monarchy as a royal guard officer and became a lieutenant on the Household Guard of King Kalākaua.[14][15] He was elected to the House of Representative, the lower house of the legislature of the kingdom, for the Kona district of Oahu (around Honolulu). He sat in on the legislative assembly of 1880.[16] During this session, he proposed the creation of a governmentally funded study abroad program which funded the international study of a number of Hawaiian youths from 1880 to 1892 in Italy, Scotland, England, the United States, China and Japan.[17] On August 12, 1884, Kalākaua appointed him as a member of the Privy Council of State.[18][19][20]

From October 4, 1886 to August 23, 1888, Hoapili was appointed to succeed John Owen Dominis as Governor of Maui, and the adjacent islands of Molokai and Lanai. He did not hold the post for long. The royal island governorships were abolished by the legislature after the Bayonet Constitution. The king had vetoed the bill, but the new constitutional changes, which limited the king's executive power, allowed the legislature to override his opposition.[21][22] Hoapili continued serving the king on his Privy Council. On May 15, 1889, he became aide de camp and a member of King Kalākaua's military staff with the military rank of Colonel.[23][24] He continued as a privy councilor and advisor of the king.

Kalakaua_and_aides_aboard_the_U.S.S._Charleston_(PP-96-13-002).jpg with Colonel Macfarlane and Colonel Hoapili Baker aboard the USS _Charleston_ in route to San Francisco, California]] Regarded as a close friend and confidante, Hoapili accompanied the king on his final visit to the United States aboard the USS _Charleston_, on November 1890. Colonel George W. Macfarlane, the King's Chamberlain, was also part of the suite. While visiting Southern California, the king drank excessively and fell ill in January 1891 and had to be returned to San Francisco. The tearful Hoapili and Macfarlane were at his deathbed at San Francisco's Palace Hotel; he sat at the head of the bed clasping the king's left hand. Shortly before he breathed his last, Kalākaua's voice was recorded on a phonograph cylinder. Kalākaua died on January 20, 1891. The recording was given to Hoapili to take back to Honolulu and he reportedly "guarded it as sacredly as his own life". And it is now in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum.[25] Among the chief mourners at King Kalākaua's funeral, Colonel Robert Hoapili Baker stood at the head of the casket and was tasked with carrying the crown, sceptre and sword of the late King during the final procession.

Returning to Honolulu, his military and political commissions were renewed on March 7, 1891, and he remained on the military staff and Privy Council of State of Queen Liliuokalani until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. After the overthrow and the establishment of the Republic of Hawaii, Hoapili took the oath to the new regime. During this period, he served as member of the Board of Registration of Electors for Oahu. Otherwise, he remained outside the political arena and retired to a private life.[26][27]

Hoapili died on April 4, 1900, at his residence in Pawaʻa, Honolulu. He had been ill for a long time before. The cause of the death was heart disease. The Hawaiian community remember favorably his friendship with Kalākaua and lifelong public service to Hawaii and his death was mourned by his family and friends. Local newspapers reported that his death "removes a man of distinguished ancestry and considerable public service". His remains lay in state at the Mililani Hall, his casket draped with the ʻAhu ʻula of his grandmother Kamakahelei[28], and after a royal funeral befitting his rank, conducted under the rites of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, he was buried at the cemetery of the Kawaiahaʻo Church.[29][30]


Personal life

Hoapili was originally a member of the Anglican Church of Hawaii but in his later life he converted and joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.[31] In the 1870s, Hoapili married Ali'i Emma Kamakanoanoa Merseberg (1856–1913) who was a descendant of King Keawe-nui-a-'Umi, the 16th Alii nui of Hawaii through his son Lonoikamakahiki and his descendent chiefs in Ka'u and Puna. Their children were Robert Hoapili Kahakumakalima Baker, Jr. (1874–1935), who served as Bandmaster for the Royal Hawaiian Band,[32] Elizabeth Kahalelaukoa Baker (1877–1960), later Mrs. Charles W. Booth; Vito (Veto) Baker and Emma Baker, Mrs. James B. Nott. His widow Emma Baker was named sole devisee and executrix of his estate which largely consisted of landholdings in town lots and sugarcane fields around Lahaina on the island of Maui.[33][34]
