The _CO-OP MOSAIC_ is a mural in Kingston upon Hull, England, by the artist Alan Boyson.[1] Commissioned by the Co-operative Society ("Co-Op"), for the exterior of the side of their store at 32-38 Jameson Street, it was erected in 1963.[2] Depicting three stylised trawlers, it commemorates Hull's fishing fleet.[3]

The mural is made from 4,224 panels, each square and made in turn from 225 cubes of Italian glass - over one million in all.[4][5] The panels are fixed to a curved, , concrete wall.[6]

The mural was built to Boyson's design, by Richards Tiles Ltd (subsequently part of Johnsons Tiles Ltd).[7]

Included in the mural is the Latin text __ ("the success of industry").[8] It also includes the letters in the ships' masts.

After the Co-Op vacated the building, it was for a time a branch of BHS.[9]

In May 2007 the mural was locally listed by Hull City Council, who described it was a "superb example of modern public art".[10] The council subsequently pledged to retain the mural when the site is developed.[11] In November 2016, a proposal by Hull Civic Society to give the mural statutory protection at a national level was rejected.[12] The society announced its intention to appeal the decision.[13]


Fish mural

An additional mural by Boyson, inside the store on the fourth floor, was rediscovered during refurbishment in 2011.[14] Depicting a shoal of fish, it is over long and is made from ceramic tiles, marble and stone.[15] Located outside the former Skyline Ballroom (later Romeo and Juliet's, a nightclub), it had been hidden behind a false wall.[16] The building's then owners, Manor Property Group, announced plans to feature it in their designs for the building's decor.[17][18] It was made as part of the same commission as the exterior mural.[19]
