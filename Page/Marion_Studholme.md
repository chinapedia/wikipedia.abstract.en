MARION STUDHOLME (27 June 1927 – 6 January 2016) was an English soprano, best known for her performances with Sadler's Wells Opera Company, and as a regular performer on the popular BBC radio programme _Friday Night is Music Night_.[1][2]

Studholme was born in Blackpool; her parents were John Studholme, a water board engineer, and his wife Daisy. She was educated at Childwall Valley High School, and then studied under Rodolfo Mele at the Royal College of Music. After completing her studies, she joined the chorus of Sadler's Wells Opera and was soon taking leading roles,[3] such as Lucinda in _School for Fathers_ by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari=[4] She later became a teacher at the Royal College of Music.[5]

In 1952 she married Andrew Downie, who had been a fellow student at the Royal College of Music. They performed together in several productions of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, directed by Tyrone Guthrie.[6][7] They had two sons.[8]

Marion Studholme made few recordings. One was the 1959 Decca recording of Benjamin Britten's _Peter Grimes_, conducted by the composer himself, in which she sang the role of "Niece 1". Another was as Yum-Yum in _The Mikado_, conducted by Alexander Faris.[9] On television she played Mabel Stanley in _The Pirates of Penzance_, Josephine in _HMS Pinafore_ (1960–62) and as "Molly" in an adaptation of _Die Fledermaus_ (1950). Her husband Andrew Downie had a long career as a television actor, and died in 2009.[10]
