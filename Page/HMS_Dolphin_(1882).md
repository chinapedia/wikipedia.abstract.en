HMS _DOLPHIN_ was a screw sloop-of-war of the Royal Navy launched in 1882, used as school ship, and finally broken up in 1977.


Service history

_Dolphin_ was launched in 1882. In 1884 she was under the command of Sydney Eardley-Wilmot in the Mediterranean where she took part in military operations in eastern Sudan in 1884-85.[1] In 1893, while under the command of Lieutenant Christopher Cradock, she rescued the crew of the Brazilian Navy corvette _Almirante Barroso_, which had wrecked on the coast of the Red Sea near Ras Zeith on 21 January 1893 during an around-the-world cadet cruise.[2]

By 1902 _Dolphin_ had become a seagoing training brig under the command of Lieutenant John Luce. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII.[3] She served as a submarine depot ship in World War I. She foundered in 1925 but was beached and used as a school ship. She was broken up in 1977.
