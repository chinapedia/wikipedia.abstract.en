Production

The film was shot in Buffalo, New York.[5] Make-up effects were created by Arick Szymecki and Stacey Book, while Brett Piper provided stop-motion animation, and chroma key compositing was used.[6] Director Greg Lamberson stated that the film "is a movie for fans of practical effects, although we'll use CGI to enhance what we shot on set. Our DP, Chris Rados, had to do a lot of shooting behind plexiglass".[7][8]


Release and reception

The film premiered at the Scare-A-Con film festival on September 11, 2015, where it won best film,[9] and played dozens of festivals thereafter, including many international, during which it took several awards including a Best Writer Award for Paul McGinnis. The film was released on DVD by Camp Motion Pictures on December 13, 2016.[10]

Amy Seidman of ComingSoon.net called the film "a fun, no-brainer kind of flick".[11] Scott Hallam of the website Dread Central wrote that "you have to overlook a lot of the low-budget pitfalls that often haunt a film like this, but itâ€™s indeed worth looking past the blemishes of the movie to enjoy [its] humor and great spirit".[12]
