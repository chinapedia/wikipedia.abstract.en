AL-NĀBIGHA AL-JA‘DĪ (النابغة الجعدي, d. c. 60/680 or some years later)[1] was an early Islamic poet.


Biography

He first appears in the historical record as part of the deputation by the Banū Ja‘da to the Prophet, which probably took place in 9/630, and which led to his conversion to Islam. He and his tribe migrated to al-Baṣra during the period of conquests. At al-Nukhayla and Ṣiffin he fought on the side of ‘Alī.[2] Correspondingly, he composed poems in praise of ‘Alī and the allied Ibn al-Zubayr.[3] In consequence, Mu‘āwiya confiscated his property in Medina and he went to Iṣfahān. Sometime between 63/683 and 65/685, al-Nābigha reluctantly pledged allegiance to ‘Abdallāh b. al-Zubayr.[4]

His date and place of death are unknown, with various guesses being made by scholars, ranging across 63/683×79/698-99, in Iṣfahān or Kurāsān.[5]


Work

Nābigha is noted for a series of _hijā’_ (satirical verse contests) with Aws b. Maghrā’ and al-Akhṭal c. 40/660, probably in al-Baṣra; and with Sawwār b. Awfā and his wife Laylā al-Akhyaliyya, apparently between 40/660 and 63/683.[6] In the latter case, the flyting began between Sawwār and Nābigha, but Laylā took over her husband's part on account of her greater poetic skill; the context for the flyting was the parties diametrically opposite political affiliations—there are even reports, unlikely to be true, of Laylā planning to hunt Nābigha down and kill him.[7] 'By all accounts, Laylā is considered to have come out victorious and to have shamed al-Nābigha.'[8]

Nābigha's work includes a heartfelt lament for the death of his son Muḥārib and younger brother Waḥwaḥ,[9] and a meditation on the frailty of human life in the face of death.[10]

On the conquest of Khorasan, Nābigha made the following verse: 'O men, do you not see how Persia has been ruined and its inhabitants humiliated? They have become slaves who pasture your sheet, as if their kingdom was a dream'.[11]
