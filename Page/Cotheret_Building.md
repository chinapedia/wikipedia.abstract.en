The COTHERET BUILDING is an historic structure located at 536 4th Avenue in the Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego, in the U.S. state of California.[1]

According to the Gaslamp Quarter historic building marker number 8 which is posted onto the structure's fa√ßade, the Cotheret Building was constructed in 1903 and is the only building currently standing in the Gaslamp Quarter with an original second story balcony. The upstairs of the building has operated as rented rooms under the names of the Cotheret, Ardmore, and Gaslamp Hotel. The Canary Cottage, run by San Diego's most notorious madam, Ida Bailey, was located behind this very structure. The narrow alley found to the right of the building provided Bailey's patrons access to the cottage and the Fan Tan Gambling House.[2]
