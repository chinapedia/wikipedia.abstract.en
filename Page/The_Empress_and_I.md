_THE EMPRESS AND I_ (German: _ICH UND DIE KAISERIN_) is a 1933 German musical comedy film directed by Friedrich Hollaender and starring Lilian Harvey, Mady Christians and Conrad Veidt.[1] It is also known by the alternative title of _THE ONLY GIRL_. The film was produced as a multi-language version. _Moi et l'impératrice_ a separate French-language version was released as well as _The Only Girl_ in English. The multilingual Harvey played the same role in all three films.

It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Robert Herlth and Walter Röhrig. It was made by Erich Pommer's production unit at UFA, several of whom left the country after the film's release due to the Nazi Party's assumption of power.


Synopsis

After a fall from a horse, a wealthy Marquis is believed to be dying. While he lies there, he is comforted by the singing of a beautiful woman. When he unexpectedly recovers he tries to seek out this young woman. Due to series of confusions he believes her to be Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III of France.
