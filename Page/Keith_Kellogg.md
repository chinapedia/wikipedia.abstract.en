Life and career

Early life and military service

Kellogg was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Helen (Costello) and Joseph Keith Kellogg.[2] In 1961, he received his diploma from Long Beach Polytechnic High School.[3] Kellogg was commissioned into the Army through Army Reserve Officers Training Corps (AROTC) at Santa Clara University as an Infantry Officer. During his time in service, Kellogg earned an M.S. in international affairs from the University of Kansas. Kellogg later went on to study senior level management and diplomacy at the United States Army War College.

During the Vietnam War he served in the 101st Airborne Division[4] and, after qualifying as a U.S. Army Special Forces officer, as a special forces adviser to the Cambodian Army.[5]^({not\ found}) It was during his time in Vietnam that Kellogg earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star with "V" Device, and Air Medal with "V" Device. Kellogg also commanded 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division during Operation Just Cause.

In 1980, then LTC Kellogg commanded 1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and became the first light infantry unit to rotate to the Fort Irwin National Training Center (NTC) located in the Mojave Desert. Kellogg's unit was given the mission of a night attack to seize a series of mountain passes. Up to this point, no one had ever defeated the opposing force (OPFOR) Regimental attack. Wesley Clark, the Commander, Operations Group, remarked to Kellogg "it will snow in the desert when the 82nd defeats the Regimental attack." Kellogg's unit went on to defeat the attack and that October night it snowed in the desert.

During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, from 1990 to 1991, Kellogg served as the Chief of Staff of the 82nd Airborne Division and then as its Assistant Division Commander. Kellogg was subsequently selected as the Commander of Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR). In 1996, he took command of the 82nd Airborne Division and retired from the Army in 2003, as a Lieutenant General after serving as the "director of command, control, communications and computers for U.S. forces under the Joint Chiefs of Staff."

Kellogg was in the Pentagon during the attacks on September 11, 2001. Following the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon, Kellogg assumed responsibility of the alternate command post at Raven Rock Mountain Complex with United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.

From December 2003 to 2004, he held a leading position in the Coalition Provisional Authority.[6][7] Kellogg was asked to serve as chief operating officer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, the transition government of Iraq, after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of that country and the signing of Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2 which disbanded the Iraqi Army.[8] During this time, Kellogg, with a reputation as an "expediter" known for cutting through red tape, was tasked with ensuring speed and discipline during the massive reconstruction process.[9] Following his service with the CPA, Kellogg was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.

Private sector

Following Kellogg's retirement from active duty, he joined Oracle Corporation as an adviser to its homeland security division.[10] He was recently employed by Cubic Corporation and earlier by CACI International Inc., since January 2005.[11]

Trump campaign and administration

Kellogg was named a foreign policy advisor to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in March 2016.[12] Trump put Kellogg in charge of the presidential transition agency action team for defense.[13] On December 15, 2016, it was announced that Kellogg would be appointed Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary of the United States National Security Council by President-elect Donald Trump.[14]

On February 13, 2017, following the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Keith Kellogg became the Acting National Security Advisor in the interim of a permanent replacement being appointed.[15][16] President Trump interviewed Kellogg and three others to determine who to permanently fill the position of National Security Advisor.[17][18] The position ultimately went to H. R. McMaster.[19]

In April 2018, Vice President Mike Pence chose Kellogg to serve as his national security advisor.[20][21][22] According to the White House, Kellogg would continue to serve as an assistant to Trump.[23][24]


Personal life

Kellogg is the second oldest of four children. His older brother, Mike Kellogg, is a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge. His sister, Kathy, is a former actress who is now a clinical psychologist and his younger brother, Jeff, is a former Long Beach city councilman, served as President of the Long Beach Community College District Board of Trustees, and now currently works for the California Community College system.[25][26]

Kellogg married his wife, Paige, in 1980. Paige is a former U.S. Army officer and paratrooper who served during the 1983 US invasion of Grenada.[27] Together, they have three children.
