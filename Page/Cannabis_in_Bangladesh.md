Marijuana_Joint.jpg The cultivation, transport, sale, purchase, and possession of all forms of cannabis has been illegal in Bangladesh since the late 1980s, but enforcement efforts are lax and the drug continues to be popular there.


Prohibition

The cultivation of cannabis was banned in 1987, and sale banned in 1989.[1] The current law governing cannabis in Bangladesh is the Narcotics Control Act 1990;[2][3] the Act gives the courts discretionary ability to impose the death sentence for possession of cannabis over two kilograms.[4]


Culture

Cannabis and opium have been traditionally used by Bangladeshi people. Today in Dhaka cannabis can be found through local dealers in underground operations evading law enforcement but if caught the police can be bribed.[5]
