The CALMEYER STREET MISSION HOUSE () was a building located at _Calmeyers gate_ no. 1 in Oslo, Norway. The building served as a religious assembly house for Lutheran gatherings in the Oslo neighborhood around _Hausmanns gate_ (Hausmann Street). [1][2]


History

Calmeyer Street Mission House was a Gothic Revival structure designed by the architect Henrik Nissen.[3] Educator and businessman Otto Treider was largely responsible for the mission house being built in 1891.[4] At the time, it contained Scandinavia's largest assembly hall, capable of accommodating over 5,000 people.[5]

Kristiania Home Mission Society () took over the building in 1898.[6] This provided a venue for a series of large gatherings, including full-scale revivals in 1905 and 1906 that filled the building night after night. Prime Minister Christian Michelsen also delivered a speech there in 1905.[7] The building was also the location of the Calmeyer Street Meeting (_Calmeyergatemøtet_) from February 15th to 18th, 1920 during debates between liberal and orthodox theologians within the Church of Norway.[8]

During the German occupation (1940–45), the building was requisitioned by the German military.[9] Until the 1950s, the building was frequently used for concerts and as a warehouse until it was razed in 1972. The lot was used as a parking lot, among other purposes, until the Church City Mission (_Kirkens Bymisjon_) built an office building with rental housing there. After the new building was completed in 1987, the office space was leased to Norwegian Board of Health Supervision (_Statens helsetilsyn_).[10] [11]
