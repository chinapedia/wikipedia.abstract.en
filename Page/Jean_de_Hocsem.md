Jan_v_Hocksem,_Digitus_florum_utriusque_iuris,_1341_(RHCL_Maastricht).jpg JEAN DE HOCSEM or JAN VAN HOCSEM, Latinized _Johannes Hocsemius_ (1278–1348), was a canon and scholaster of Saint Lambert's Cathedral, Liège.

He was the author of the _Gesta episcoporum Leodiensium_, a history of the bishops of Liège from 1247 to 1347, the original manuscript of which is now in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels.[1] It is one of the major sources for the history of the War of the Cow. A second manuscript survives in the library of Averbode Abbey.[2] A critical edition of the chronicle by Godefroid Kurth was published in 1927 under the title _La chronique de Jean de Hocsem_.[3]

In 1341 he wrote a book about canon law, _Digitus florum utriusque iuris_, one copy of which, in the National Archives (RHCL) in Maastricht, is partly in his own hand.[4]
