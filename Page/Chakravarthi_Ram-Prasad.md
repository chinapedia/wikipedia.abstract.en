Ram-prasad is an alumni of Sri Sathya Sai Institute, and earned a masters and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Oxford.[4]


Career and Work

Ram-prasad is the Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy in the Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at the Lancaster University.

He has been a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4's _Beyond Belief and Sunday Programme_ in the United Kingdom.[5]

Ram-prasad has published eight books and some fifty peer-reviewed articles on Indian religions, comparative religions (Hindu-Christian, Buddhism in India and China), contemporary Indian politics and religion, multiculturalism and British society, and comparative political philosophy.[6] His studies have included religious literature in Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil.[7]

In a review of Ram-prasad's award-winning book _Divine Self, Human Self_ based on the _Bhagavad Gita_, the Cambridge University scholar Ankur Barua states, "Ram-Prasad skilfully engages Śaṁkara and Rāmānuja in conversations over classical Vedantic themes of selfhood, being, and agency" to exegetically and hermeneutically explain how these two influential Hindu scholars interpreted the same text to reach two views of _Self_ (Atman) in Hindu philosophy.[8]


Honours

His book _"Divine Self, Human Self"_ was the winner of the Best Book 2011-15, by the Society for Hindu Christian Studies.

In July 2017, Ram-Prasad was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[9]
