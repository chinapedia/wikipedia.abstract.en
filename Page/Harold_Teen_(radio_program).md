_HAROLD TEEN_ is a teenage comedy old-time radio program in the United States. It was broadcast initially on WGN in Chicago, Illinois, and a decade later was heard nationally on the Mutual Broadcasting System.


Format

Based on the _Harold Teen_ comic strip, the program's episodes centered around the adventures of the title character and his friends. Other characters included best friend Shadow Smart, girlfriend Lillums Lovewell and Cynthia (who had a crush on Harold). Harold's and Beezie's fathers were the adult characters, while Beezie and Josie were two of Harold's friends.[1]

The WGN version was broadcast in 1931-1932, and the Mutual version in 1941-1942.[2] (Although the preceding reference lists 1931-1932 for the initial run of the program, an article in the October 19, 1930, issue of the _Chicago Tribune_ says, "... the radio audience has taken the broadcast version of Harold Teen as closely to its heart as the dashing cartoon creation of Carl Ed ...")[3] The Harold Teen character appeared on radio again in 1948 in two genres.

_The Teen-Agers Quiz Club_

In 1948, WGN broadcast _The Teen-Agers Quiz Club_, a program that featured competition between a team of three boys and a team of three girls, all chosen from the teenage audience. Harold Teen headed the boys' team, and Sheila John Daly (a teenage columnist for the _Chicago Tribune_) headed the girls' team.[4]

_Swinging at the Sugar Bowl_

_Swinging at the Sugar Bowl_ featured Harold Teen as a disc jockey with music "expertly selected for 'teen-age taste'". Other characters from the comic strip also occasionally appeared on the program. Fred Reynolds (son-in-law of Teen's creator, Carl Ed)[5] portrayed Harold Teen on the disc-jockey program.[6] The program's debut occurred on April 3, 1948, the same day that the comic strip had Teen begin a new adventure as a disc jockey, "paralleling Harold's grafic [sic] adventures".[7]
