The ST. BERNARD CATHEDRAL[1] () Also SAN BERNARDO CATHEDRAL Is the main Catholic temple and seat of the Bishopric of San Bernardo,[2] located to one side of the Plaza de Armas de San Bernardo,[3] in the metropolitan area of Santiago in Chile.

The original cathedral was built in 1820 as the seat of the city's parish. It worked in this way until 1987, when it was elevated to the cathedral of the new Diocese of San Bernardo. The earthquakes that she had to endure and some structural deficiencies led to the destruction of the temple, building a new one in its place, which was finally inaugurated on November 25, 2000, being consecrated by Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, Pontifical Legate for the celebration of the Jubilee Of 2000 in Chile.
