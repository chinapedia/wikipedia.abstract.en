SERAVEK is a sans-serif typeface family designed by Eric Olson and released in 2007.[1] Olson described Seravek as having a neutral design of "near silence".[2][3] Seravek is a member of the humanist style of sans-serifs, with features such as a true italic inspired by handwriting.[4][5]

Sold commercially by the Process Type Foundry, Seravek is included as a system font in Apple's macOS operating system and as a default font in its iBooks e-books application.[6][7][8]
