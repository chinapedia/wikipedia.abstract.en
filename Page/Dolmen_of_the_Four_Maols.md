The DOLMEN OF THE FOUR MAOLS is a cist and National Monument located in County Mayo, Ireland.[1][2][3]


Location

The Dolmen of the Four Maols is located on Primrose Hill overlooking the River Moy, southwest of Ballina, outside the Road Safety Authority office.[4]


History

This cist was erected c. 2000 BC.[5]

According to Irish legend, in the early 7th century Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin was King of Connacht. The rightful king, Cellach of Killala, had become a priest and later bishop of Kilmoremoy (Ballina). Four of Guaire Aidne's brothers murdered him; they are known as the four Maols from the Irish word _maol_, "bald", referring to their tonsures – they were students of Cellach's (Mael Mac Deoraidh, Maelcroin, Maeldalua, and Maelseanaigh).[6] The four Maols were quartered at Ardnaree and then, supposedly, buried on Primrose Hill under the Dolmen of the Four Maols.[7][8]


Description

The massive capstone rests on three stones forming three sides of the square chamber. A fourth stone (probably the fourth side) lies nearby.[9][10]
