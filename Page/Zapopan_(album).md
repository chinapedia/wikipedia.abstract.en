_ZAPOPAN_ is the thirty-sixth studio album by Omar Rodríguez-López as a solo artist, released on 18 November 2016. It is his tenth release in the 12 album series initiated by Ipecac Recordings.[1]

Zapopan features reworked/remixed and re-titled versions of songs which were originally released on _Saber, Querer, Osar y Callar_ (2012) and _Unicorn Skeleton Mask_ (2013). The album title refers to the city Rodríguez-López lived in at the time of recording. Most of the remaining songs from _Unicorn Skeleton Mask_ appeared on _Zen Thrills_ in 2017.

"Spell Broken Hearts" was uploaded in advance as the album's single. It then appeared alongside "Tentáculos de fé" on the 2017 live album _Chocolate Tumor Hormone Parade_.
