He concluded by stating, "NGK is Suriya trying to deliver a _Selvaraghavan_-ish performance when the director himself is trying to deliver a Shankar/Murugadoss-ish film. The results aren't extremely pleasing."[22] S. Subakeerthana of Indian Express rated the film 2.5/5 and stated "Works to some extent, elevated by Suriya's performance...
