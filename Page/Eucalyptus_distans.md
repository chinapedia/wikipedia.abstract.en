Description

_Eucalyptus distans_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, finely fissured grey bark with white patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull, light green to grey-green colour on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a thin, branched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are cylindrical to oval, long and about wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between March and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel up to long. The valves extend well beyond the rim and the seeds are blackish brown.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus distans_ was first formally described in 1980 by Ian Brooker, Douglas Boland and David Kleinig from samples gathered near Katherine Gorge by Clyde Dunlop in 1977 and the description was published in _Australalian Forest Research_.[5][6] _Eucalyptus epruinata_ was described in 2000 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal _Telopea_ from specimens colllected in Queensland but the name is listed as a synonym by the Australian Plant Census.[7] The specific epithet (_distans_) is a Latin word meaning "remote", "far apart" or "distant"[8] indicating that this species is separated from the similar _E. microtheca_.[9]


Distribution and habitat

Katherine box grows on low stony ridges. There are scattered populations through the Northern Territory between Katherine and Gove with disjunct populations near Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia and near Croydon in Queensland.[10][11][12]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus distans_ is classified as "Priority One" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife,[13] meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.[14]
