ST BARNABAS' CHURCH, WEST SILVERTOWN was a Church of England church in Silvertown, east London. It was opened in 1882 on Eastwood Road as a mission church of St Mark's Church, Silvertown. In the 1917 Silvertown explosion its chancel and iron hall were destroyed, leaving the church to use temporary buildings until the completion of a new church and the formation of a separate parish for it, both in 1926. The new parish was mainly drawn from St Mark's, though it also took a small part of the parish of St Luke's Church, Canning Town. The vicar of St John's Church, North Woolwich administered it after 1945.[1] The parishes of St John, St Mark and St Barnabas were merged in 1974 to form the parish of North Woolwich with Silvertown.[2]
