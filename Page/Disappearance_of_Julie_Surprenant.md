JULIE SURPRENANT (born March 31, 1983)[1] is a missing Canadian girl who disappeared in Terrebonne, Quebec on November 15, 1999.[2]


Disappearance

Julie Surprenant was last seen getting off a bus near her home in Terrebonne, Quebec, north of Montreal on November 15, 1999. She was wearing a floral skirt, with a blue petticoat, navy blue socks over black tights, a blue scarf with a fish pattern, a green wool jacket and a dark brown leather coat. She was also carrying a black canvas backpack on which she had drawn a peace symbol.


Investigation and aftermath

At the time of Surprenant's disappearance, the family's neighbour, Richard Bouillon, was considered a prime suspect. Bouillon was a convicted sexual predator. In 2011 it was revealed that he had made a deathbed confession to two hospital employees in Laval in 2006, admitting that he had murdered Surprenant.[3] He told a nurse that he had killed her, stuffed her body into a sports bag with some bricks, and thrown it into the Rivière des Mille Îles across the way from a church in Terrebonne.[4][5] The coroner's report, released in 2012, concluded that Bouillon likely raped and killed her.[6] He was never charged as the authorities had insufficient evidence to do so. In 2014, Surpernant's family and friends created a monument in her memory.[7] Her remains have not been found.
