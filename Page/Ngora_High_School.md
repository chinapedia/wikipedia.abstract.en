NGORA HIGH SCHOOL is a secondary boarding school for boys and girls in the Ngora institutional complex, Ngora District, Uganda. As of 2015, the school had 1357 students enrolled in class.[1] It is one of the oldest educational establishments in Uganda, founded in 1914 by Anglican missionaries.[2] Ngora High school provides a wide variety of classes at both O and A levels. It is one of the most academically distinguished schools in the region.[3]


Purpose

The school's mission is to inculcate in its students a strict moral conscience and the values of commitment, competence, responsibility, discipline, truthfulness, self-motivation, and respect. The school motto is "Iponesio Ka Akukuranut", meaning "Discipline and Hard Work." [4]


History

Ngora High School was founded on July 13, 1914 by the Anglican Church of Uganda to educate high-minded professionals. It recently celebrated its 100-year anniversary. The Archbishop of the Church of Uganda, Stanley Ntagali, led prayers at the celebrations attended by Education, Science, Technology and Sports minister Jessica Alupo. Also in attendance was Minister Without Portfolio Richard Todwong, who represented his excellence Yoweri Museveni, president of Uganda.[5] Winning_trophy1.jpg In the years after its founding, Ngora High School was one of Uganda's premi√®re schools, with students from the surrounding districts competing to attend. However, the hardships of the Teso Insurgency (1986 - 1993) and the incursion of the Lord's Resistance Army (2001 - 2003), combined to damage both the physical premises of the school and its academic reputation.[6] During this time, it was the site of battles between government forces and the rebels. When there was no fighting, it was used as a camp for displaced persons. Many students and teachers relocated to safety in other areas. After the violence ended, the school was left with fewer than ten teachers on a war-battered campus.[7]

Ngora High School has made a gradual recovery, admitting more students and hiring more teachers.[8] Now it is once again one of the top schools in the country, with its students performing very well in Uganda Certificate of Education exams [9] and winning the 2011 Secondary Schools Science Fair against competition from 24 other schools.[10]
