FRANCESCA MOROSINI (fl. 1454), was a Duchess consort of Naxos by marriage to John II Crispo. She served as regent of Naxos during the minority of her son Giacomo II Crispo from 1433.

She was described as a "masterful woman", who continued to influence in the affairs of state during the reign of her son and grandson until the accession of William II to the throne in 1453.[1]

In 1447, she claimed the post of regent for her grandson, but Niccolo of Syra and Santorin and William of Anaphe had her imprisoned and resumed regency with the support of Venice.[2] When Niccolo died, Francesca Morosini, the archbishop and the Naxians elected his son Francesco in his place in the regency and successfully asked Venice to ratify it.[3]

After the succession of William II in 1453, the dowager duchess Francesca retired to Venice after having founded the church and monastery of St Antonio dedicated to the Knights of St John in 1452.[4]
