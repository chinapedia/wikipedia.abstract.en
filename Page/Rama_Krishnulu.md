Plot

Rama Krishnulu is the story of two brothers, not by blood but by bond. Rama is the son of a Satyananda, a Sub-inspector, whose path of righteousness leaves him with his wife and daughter murdered by the men jailed by him. Rama survives the ordeal and his father believes that without sufficient evidence, there's nothing they can do to bring the murderers to justice. Rama runs away from home and meets Krishnudu, an orphan who steals to feed the poor. Rama and Krishnudu grow up to be bounty hunters who bring the convicted felons to justice. The story is about how Rama seeks his revenge on the men who murdered his mother and sister.
