Old_Battersea_House,_30_Vicarage_Crescent,_London_01.JPG OLD BATTERSEA HOUSE is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Battersea, South West London and is Grade II* listed.[1] It was built around 1699,[2] and was once rumoured to have been designed by Sir Christopher Wren.[3][4]


Building

Until the 1930s, the building was known as Terrace House.[5] It was built for the "naval administrator"[6] Samuel Pett,[7] and was most likely completed in 1699.[8]

Battersea Council almost demolished the house in the 1920s and built St. John's estate[9] (now Battersea Village) on the grounds of the house in the 1930s. In 1931 it passed into the possession of novelist Wilhelmina Stirling, who renamed it Old Battersea House.[10] Under her tenure the house served to house a collection of art by her sister, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Evelyn De Morgan, and Evelyn's husband, the potter designer William De Morgan.[11][12] This collection is now kept by the De Morgan Foundation.

The building was listed on 28 June 1954[13] and became derelict after Stirling's death in 1965. It was acquired by Malcolm Forbes in 1970[14] and housed some of his family's valuable art collection until 2011.[15]
