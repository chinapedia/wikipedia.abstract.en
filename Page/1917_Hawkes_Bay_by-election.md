The 1917 HAWKES BAY BY-ELECTION was a by-election held in the eastern North Island electorate of during the 19th New Zealand Parliament, on 8 March 1917.

It was caused by the death of incumbent MP Robert McNab,[1] and was won by fellow party Liberal Party member Sir John Findlay with a majority of 471 votes.


Background

Under the terms of the coalition agreement between Reform and the Liberals a condition was made not to oppose each other in by-elections for deceased or retiring MPs from their own parties. As the deceased MP for this electorate was a Liberal the Reform Party did not contest the seat, and endorsed the Liberal's official candidate as a sign of goodwill and wartime unity. The newly formed Labour Party chose not to stand a candidate, but there was rumour that former MP for , Harry Atmore was considering standing in "Labour" interests.[2] This did not eventuate.

Sir John Findlay was chosen by the Liberal Party to contest the seat, he was a former Legislative Councillor and served in Sir Joseph Ward's cabinet from 1906 to 1911 as Attorney-General and later as Minister of Justice.[3] Former MP Alfred Fraser previously sought the Liberal nomination, however he retired from the contest,[4] yet 9 votes were still cast for him.

H. Ian Simpson also stood in support of the National Government and was Findlay's only real competition for the seat.[5]
