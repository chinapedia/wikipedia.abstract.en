LOUISE ERDRICH (born KAREN LOUISE ERDRICH, June 7, 1954)[1] is an American author, writer of novels, poetry, and children's books featuring Native American characters and settings. She is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized tribe of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe and Chippewa).[2]

Erdrich is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant writers of the second wave of the Native American Renaissance. In 2009, her novel _The Plague of Doves_ was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and received an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.[3] In November 2012, she received the National Book Award for Fiction for her novel _The Round House_.[4] She was awarded the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction at the National Book Festival in September 2015.[5] She was married to author Michael Dorris and the two collaborated on a number of works.

She is also the owner of Birchbark Books, a small independent bookstore in Minneapolis that focuses on Native American literature and the Native community in the Twin Cities.[6]


Early and personal life

Erdrich was born on June 7, 1954, in Little Falls, Minnesota. She was the oldest of seven children born to Ralph Erdrich, a German-American, and Rita (n√©e Gourneau), a Chippewa woman (of half Ojibwe and half French blood). Both parents taught at a boarding school in Wahpeton, North Dakota, set up by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Erdrich's maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the federally recognized tribe of Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians for many years.[7]

While Erdrich was a child, her father paid her a nickel for every story she wrote. Her sister Heidi became a poet and also lives in Minnesota; she publishes under the name Heid E. Erdrich.[8] Another sister, Lise Erdrich, has written children's books and collections of fiction and essays.

Post secondary education

Erdrich attended Dartmouth College from 1972 to 1976.[9] She was a part of the first class of women admitted to the college and earned an A.B. in English. During her first year, Erdrich met Michael Dorris, an anthropologist, writer, and then-director of the new Native American Studies program. While attending Dorris' class, she began to look into her own ancestry, which inspired her to draw from it for her literary work, such as poems, short stories, and novels.

In 1978, Erdrich enrolled in a Master of Arts program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She earned the Master of Arts in the Writing Seminars in 1979.[10] Erdrich later published some of the poems and stories she wrote while in the M.A. program. She returned to Dartmouth as a writer-in-residence.[11]

Marriage

Erdrich remained in contact with Dorris. He attended one of her poetry readings, became impressed with her work, and developed an interest in working with Erdrich. Although Erdrich and Dorris were on two different sides of the world, Erdrich in Boston and Dorris in New Zealand for field research, the two began to collaborate on short stories. Their collaborative story, "The World's Greatest Fisherman", won $5,000 in the Nelson Algren fiction competition.[12] Erdrich and Dorris expanded the story into the novel _Love Medicine_ (1984), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction.

Around the same time, Dorris returned from New Zealand. The pair's literary partnership led them to a romantic relationship. They married in 1981, and raised three adopted children and three biological children together. They separated in 1995, and Dorris committed suicide in 1997.

Reflections

When asked in an interview if writing is a lonely life for her, Erdrich replied, "Strangely, I think it is. I am surrounded by an abundance of family and friends and yet I am alone with the writing. And that is perfect." Erdrich lives in Minneapolis. [13]


Work

In 1979 she wrote "The World's Greatest Fisherman", a short story about June Kashpaw, a divorced Ojibwe woman whose death by hypothermia brought her relatives home to a fictional North Dakota reservation for her funeral. It won the Nelson Algren Short Fiction prize and eventually became the first chapter of her debut novel, _Love Medicine_, published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1984.[14]

_Love Medicine_ won the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award. [15] It has also been featured on the National Advanced Placement Test for Literature.[16]

During the publication of _Love Medicine_, Erdrich produced her first collection of poems, _Jacklight_ (1984), which highlights the struggles between Native and non-Native cultures, as well as celebrating family, ties of kinship, autobiographical meditations, monologues, and love poetry. She incorporates elements of Ojibwe myths and legends. [17] Erdrich continued to write poems, which have been included in her collections. She is best known as a novelist, and has published a dozen award-winning and best-selling novels. [18]

Erdrich followed _Love Medicine_ with _The Beet Queen_ (1986), which continued her technique of using multiple narrators and expanded the fictional reservation universe of _Love Medicine_ to include the nearby town of Argus, North Dakota. The action of the novel takes place mostly before World War II. Leslie Marmon Silko accused Erdrich's _The Beet Queen_ of being more concerned with postmodern technique than with the political struggles of Native peoples. [19]

_Tracks_ (1988) goes back to the early 20th century at the formation of the reservation. It introduces the trickster figure of Nanapush, who owes a clear debt to Ojibwe figure _Nanabozho_.[20] _Tracks_ shows early clashes between traditional ways and the Roman Catholic Church. _The Bingo Palace_ (1994), set in the 1980s, describes the effects of a casino and a factory on the reservation community. _Tales of Burning Love_ (1997) finishes the story of Sister Leopolda, a recurring character from all the previous books, and introduces a new set of European-American people into the reservation universe.

_The Antelope Wife_ (1998), Erdrich's first novel after her divorce from Dorris, was the first of her novels to be set outside the continuity of the previous books. [21]

She subsequently returned to the reservation and nearby towns. She has published five novels since 1998 dealing with events in that fictional area. Among these are _The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse_ (2001) and _The Master Butchers Singing Club_ (2003). Both novels have geographic and character connections with _The Beet Queen_. In 2009, Erdrich's novel _The Plague of Doves_ was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. The narrative focuses on the historical lynching of four Native people wrongly accused of murdering a Caucasian family, and the effect of this injustice on the current generations.

Non fiction and teaching

In addition to fiction and poetry, Erdrich has published non-fiction. _The Blue Jay's Dance_ (1995) is about her pregnancy and the birth of her first child. _Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country_ traces her travels in northern Minnesota and Ontario's lakes following the birth of her last daughter.[22]

Erdrich and her two sisters have hosted writers' workshops on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in North Dakota. [23]

Influence and style

Her heritage from both parents is influential in her life and prominent in her work. [24] Although many of Erdrich's works explore her Native American heritage, her novel _The Master Butchers Singing Club_ (2003) featured the European, specifically German, side of her ancestry. The novel includes stories of a World War I veteran and is set in a small North Dakota town. The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award.

Erdrich's complexly interwoven series of novels have drawn comparisons with William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha novels. Like Faulkner's, Erdrich's successive novels created multiple narratives in the same fictional area and combined the tapestry of local history with current themes and modern consciousness.[25]


Birchbark Books

Her bookstore hosts literary readings and other events. Erdrich's new works are read here, and events celebrate the works and careers of other writers as well, particularly local Native writers. Erdrich and her staff consider Birchbark Books to be a "teaching bookstore".[26] In addition to books, the store sells Native art and traditional medicines, and Native American jewelry. Wiigwaas Press, a small nonprofit publisher founded by Erdrich and her sister, is affiliated with the store.[27]
