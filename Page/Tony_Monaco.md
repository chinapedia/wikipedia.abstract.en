ANTHONY M. "TONY" MONACO (born August 14, 1959) is an American jazz organist.[1][2]


Biography

Monaco played accordion from childhood and was heavily influenced by Jimmy Smith in his youth. In 1971, he switched to organ after hearing Smith play the instrument, and later received personal mentoring from Smith. In the early 2000s, he recorded his debut album in collaboration with Joey DeFrancesco, _A New Generation: Paesanos on the New B3_ which reached #18 on _Jazzweek's Top 100_ for the year 2003, and began releasing material on Summit Records. [3] Monaco's career continued in the 2000s with frequent touring and performances with guitarist Pat Martino. Down Beat International Critics Poll placed Monaco in the top 5 jazz organists for the years 2005-2011.[4] His most commercially successful album was _East to West_ which reached #4 on _Jazzweek's Top 100_ for the year 2006. [5] Monaco is also noted for his efforts in jazz education and holds the position Artist in Residence in Music at Hope College.[6]


Playing style and critical reception

Monaco's work, along with several contemporaries, is associated with a minor resurgence of "Chitlin' Circuit" style jazz. [7][8]
