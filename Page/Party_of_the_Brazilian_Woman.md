The PARTY OF THE BRAZILIAN WOMAN (, PMB) is a political party in Brazil which uses the number 35.[1] Known for its non-feminist and anti-abortion stance, the party is not represented in the National Congress.[2]

The PMB was founded in 2015 by Sued Haidar, who doubled as the president of the party's National Committee.[3] At its peak, the party was the tenth largest in Congress,[4] represented by 21 federal deputies in the Chamber of Deputies,[5] only two of which are women,[6] and one representative in the Federal Senate, Senator Hélio José.[7] Most of the deputies have since left the party, and José switched his party affiliation to the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in March 2016.[8]

In January 2017, the PMB had 38,438 members.[9] As of July 2018, this number has grown to 42,619.[10]
