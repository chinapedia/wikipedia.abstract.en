HAPPN is a location-based social search mobile app that allows users to like or dislike other users, and allows users to chat if both parties liked each other (a match). The app is used as a online dating application.[1] Happn was founded by Didier Rappaport.[2] and developed by FTW & Co. The application is compatible with Android, iPhone,[3] and Windows.[4] The app uses a feed based upon the location of users' phone, listing possible matches.[5] In July 2014, the app had 40,000 daily users.[6] In January 2016, happn had 10 million users.[7]

The focus of Happn is to match users based on locations where they've crossed paths.[8]
