Reception

Fletcher writes _Marchmont_ was "in general very well received and represented in columes of extracts, a good indicator of popularity, more often than other novels of that year."[2]

For example, one reviewer writes:

  The present novel is certainly spun out in the beginning, and wound up too hastily at the conclusion; still the design of showing the misery, which unprincipled men of the law may bring on the innocent, is well imagined.[3]

There were many other contemporary reviews, reflecting similar sentiments, including reviews in _Monthly Review_,[4] _The Monthly Visitor and Entertaining Pocket Companion_,[5] and _The Critical Review_.[6]
