DANIEL PATRICK MACNEE (6 February 1922 – 25 June 2015) was a British-American film and television actor. He was best known for his role as the secret agent John Steed in the British television series _The Avengers._


Early life and career

The elder of two sons, Macnee was born in Paddington, London, England on 6 February 1922;[1] to Daniel Macnee (1878−1952) and Dorothea Mabel Macnee (née Henry) (1896−1984). His father, who was a grandson of the Scottish artist Sir Daniel Macnee, trained race horses in Lambourn, and was known for his dress sense;[2][3] he had served as an officer in the Yorkshire Dragoons in the First World War.[4] His maternal grandmother was Frances Alice Hastings (1870−1945), who was the daughter of Vice-Admiral George Fowler Hastings and granddaughter of Hans Francis Hastings, 12th Earl of Huntingdon. His younger brother James, known as Jimmy, was born five years later.[5]

Macnee's parents separated after his mother began to identify as a lesbian. His father later moved to India, and his mother began to live with her wealthy partner, Evelyn Spottswood, whose money came from the Dewar's whiskey business.[6] Macnee referred to her in his autobiography as "Uncle Evelyn", and she helped pay for his schooling. He was educated at Summer Fields School and Eton College, where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps and was one of the guard of honour for King George V at St George's Chapel in 1936. He was later expelled from Eton for selling pornography and being a bookmaker for his fellow students.[7]

Macnee studied acting at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, but shortly before he was to perform in his first West End leading role, which would have had him acting alongside Vivien Leigh, he was called up for the United Kingdom Armed Forces.[8] He joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman in October 1942[9] and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in June 1943, becoming a navigator on Motor Torpedo Boats in the English Channel and North Sea.[10] Reassigned as first lieutenant on a second MTB, Macnee caught bronchitis just before D-Day; while he was recuperating in hospital, his boat and crew were lost in action. Two of the crew received the Distinguished Service Medal.[11] He left the Navy in 1946 as a lieutenant.[12][13]

Macnee nurtured his acting career in Canada early on, but he also appeared as an uncredited extra in the British films _Pygmalion_ (1938), _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_ (1943) and Laurence Olivier's _Hamlet_ (1948), as well as some live TV dramas for the BBC, before graduating to credited parts in such films as _Scrooge_ (US: _A Christmas Carol_, 1951), as the young Jacob Marley, the Gene Kelly vehicle _Les Girls_ (1957), as an Old Bailey barrister, and the war film _The Battle of the River Plate_ (1956). Between these occasional movie roles, Macnee spent the better part of the 1950s working in dozens of small parts in American and Canadian television and theatre, including an appearance in an episode of _The Twilight Zone_ in 1959 ("Judgment Night"). Disappointed in his limited career development, in the late 1950s Macnee was daily smoking 80 cigarettes and drinking a bottle of whiskey.[14]

Not long before his career-making role in _The Avengers_, Macnee took a break from acting and served as one of the London-based producers for the classic documentary series _The Valiant Years_, based on the Second World War memoirs of Winston Churchill.[15][16]


_The Avengers_

While working in London on the Churchill series, Macnee was offered the part in _The Avengers_ (1961−69), (originally intended to be known as Jonathan Steed), for which he became best known. The series was originally conceived as a vehicle for Ian Hendry,[17] who played the lead role of Dr. David Keel in a sequel to an earlier series, _Police Surgeon_ (1960), while John Steed was his assistant. Macnee, though, became the lead after Hendry's departure at the end of the first season.[18] Macnee played opposite a succession of glamorous female partners; Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, and Linda Thorson. Of the 161 completed episodes, Macnee appeared in all but two.

Although Macnee evolved in the role as the series progressed, the key elements of Steed's persona and appearance were there from very early on: the slightly mysterious demeanour and, increasingly, the light, suave, flirting tone with ladies (and always with his female assistants). Finally, from the episodes with Blackman onwards, the trademark bowler hat and umbrella completed the image. Though it was traditionally associated with London "city gents", the ensemble of suit, umbrella and bowler had developed in the post-war years as mufti for ex-servicemen attending Armistice Day ceremonies. Steed's sartorial style may also have been drawn from Macnee's father.[19][20] Macnee, alongside designer Pierre Cardin, adapted the look into a style all his own, and he went on to design several outfits himself for Steed based on the same basic theme. Steed was also the central character of _The New Avengers_ (1976–77), in which he was teamed with agents named Purdey (Joanna Lumley) and Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt).

Macnee insisted on, and was proud of, never carrying a gun in the original series; when asked why, he explained, "I'd just come out of a World War in which I'd seen most of my friends blown to bits."[21] Lumley later said she did all the gun-slinging in _The New Avengers_ for the same reason.[22] However, the Internet Movie Firearms Database lists seven instances where Steed uses a firearm, all in the original series.[23]

When asked in June 1982 which _Avengers_ female lead was his favourite, Macnee declined to give a specific answer. "Well, I'd rather not say. To do so would invite trouble," he told _TV Week_ magazine. Macnee did provide his evaluation of the female leads. Of Honor Blackman he said, "She was wonderful, presenting the concept of a strong-willed, independent and liberated woman just as that sort of woman was beginning to emerge in society." Diana Rigg was "One of the world's great actresses. A superb comedienne. I'm convinced that one day she'll be Dame Diana" (his prediction came true in 1994). Linda Thorson was "one of the sexiest women alive" while Joanna Lumley was "superb in the role of Purdey. An actress who is only now realising her immense potential."[24]

Macnee co-wrote two original novels based upon _The Avengers_ during the 1960s, titled _Dead Duck_ and _Deadline._ He hosted a documentary, _The Avengers: The Journey Back_ (1998), directed by Clyde Lucas.[25]

For the critically lambasted film version of _The Avengers_ (1998), he lent his voice in a cameo as "Invisible Jones". The character of Steed was taken over by Ralph Fiennes.


Later roles

Macnee's other significant roles included playing Sir Godfrey Tibbett opposite Roger Moore in the James Bond film _A View to a Kill_ (1985), as Major Crossley in _The Sea Wolves_ (again with Moore), guest roles in _Encounter,_ _Alias Smith and Jones_ (for Glen Larson), _Magnum, P.I._, _Hart to Hart,_ _Murder, She Wrote,_ and _The Love Boat._ Although his best known part was heroic, many of his television appearances were as villains; among them were his roles of both the demonic Count Iblis and his provision of the character voice of the Cylons' Imperious Leader in _Battlestar Galactica,_ also for Glen Larson, for which he also supplied the show's introductory voiceover. He also presented the American paranormal series _Mysteries, Magic and Miracles._ Macnee appeared on Broadway as the star of Anthony Shaffer's mystery _Sleuth_ in 1972–73.[26] He subsequently headlined the national tour of that play.

Macnee reunited with Diana Rigg in her short-lived NBC sitcom, _Diana_ (1973) in a single episode. Other television appearances include a guest appearance on _Columbo_ in the episode "Troubled Waters" (1975); and playing Major Vickers in _For the Term of His Natural Life_ (1983). He had recurring roles in the crime series _Gavilan_ with Robert Urich and in the short-lived satire on big business, _Empire_ (1984), as Dr. Calvin Cromwell. Macnee also narrated the documentary _Ian Fleming: 007's Creator_ (2000).[27]

Macnee featured prominently in two editions of the long-running British television series _This Is Your Life_: in 1978, when he and host Eamonn Andrews, both dressed as Steed, surprised Ian Hendry, and in 1984 when he was the edition's unsuspecting subject.

He also appeared in several cult films: in _The Howling_ (1981), as 'Dr George Waggner' (named whimsically after the director of _The Wolf Man_, 1941) and as Sir Denis Eton-Hogg in the rockumentary comedy _This Is Spinal Tap_ (1984). He played Dr. Stark in _The Creature Wasn't Nice_ (1981), also called _Spaceship_ and _Naked Space_. Macnee played the role of actor David Mathews in the made-for-television movie _Rehearsal for Murder_ (1982), which starred Robert Preston and Lynn Redgrave. The movie was from a script written by _Columbo_ co-creators Richard Levinson and William Link. He took over Leo G. Carroll's role as Alexander Waverly, the head of U.N.C.L.E. in _Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen-Years-Later Affair_ (1983), produced by Michael Sloan. He was featured in the science fiction television movie _Super Force_ (1990) as E. B. Hungerford (the series which followed only featured Macnee's voice as a Max Headroom-style computer simulation of his character), as a supporting character in the parody film _Lobster Man From Mars_ (1989) as Prof. Plocostomos and in _The Return of Sam McCloud_ (1989), a TV film, as Tom Jamison. He made an appearance in _Frasier_ (2001),[28] and several episodes of the American science-fiction series _Nightman_ as Dr. Walton, a psychiatrist who would advise Johnny/Nightman. Macnee appeared in two episodes of the series _Kung Fu: The Legend Continues_ (1993–94) and was a retired agent in a handful of instalments of _Spy Game_ (1997–98).

Macnee made numerous TV commercials including one around 1990 for Swiss Chalet, the Canadian restaurant chain, and a year or so before, a commercial for the Sterling Motor Car Company. Over the James Bond theme, the car duels with a motorcycle assailant at high speed through mountainous territory, ultimately eludes the foe, and reaches its destination. Macnee steps out of the car and greets viewers with a smile, saying, "I suppose you were expecting someone else". Macnee was the narrator for several "behind-the-scenes" featurettes for the James Bond series of DVDs and recorded numerous audio books, including the releases of many novels by Jack Higgins. He also recorded the children's books _The Musical Life of Gustav Mole_ and its sequel, _The Lost Music (Gustav Mole's War on Noise),_ both written by Michael Twinn.

Macnee featured in two pop videos: as Steed in original _Avengers_ footage in The Pretenders' video for their song "Don't Get Me Wrong" (1986) and in the promotion for Oasis's "Don't Look Back in Anger" (1996), as the band's driver, a role similar to that which he played in the James Bond film _A View To A Kill_ (1985). In 1990 his recording with his _Avengers_ co-star Honor Blackman, called "Kinky Boots" (1964), reached the UK Singles Chart after being played on Simon Mayo's BBC Radio One breakfast show.

Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson

Macnee appeared in _Magnum, P.I._ (1984) as a retired, but delusional, British agent, who believed he was Sherlock Holmes, in a season four episode titled _Holmes Is Where the Heart Is_. He played both Holmes and Dr. Watson on several occasions. He played Watson three times: once alongside Roger Moore's Sherlock Holmes in a TV film, _Sherlock Holmes in New York_ (1976), and twice with Christopher Lee, first in _Incident at Victoria Falls_ (1991), and then in _Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady_ (1992). He played Holmes in another TV film, _The Hound of London_ (1993), along with the 1996 TV film _Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Temporal Nexus_ . He is thus one of only a very small number of actors to have portrayed both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson on screen.[29]


Personal life

Macnee married his first wife, Barbara Douglas (1921–2012), in 1942. They had two children, Rupert and Jenny, and a grandson, Christopher ("Kit"). After they were divorced in 1956, his second marriage (1965−1969) was to actress Katherine Woodville. His third marriage was to Baba Majos de Nagyzsenye, daughter of opera singer Ella Némethy. It lasted from 1988 until her death in 2007. Macnee became a US citizen in 1959.[30][31] He dictated his autobiography, which he entitled _Blind in One Ear: The Avenger Returns_ (1988), to Marie Cameron. Later in life, Macnee was an enthusiastic nudist.[32]


Death

On 25 June 2015, Macnee died at Rancho Mirage, California, his home for the previous four decades, at the age of 93.[33][34]
