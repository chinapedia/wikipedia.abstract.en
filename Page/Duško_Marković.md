DUŠKO MARKOVIĆ (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Душко Марковић; born 6 July 1959) is a Montenegrin politician and the current Prime Minister of Montenegro, elected on 28 November 2016.[1] He is also Deputy president of ruling Democratic Party of Socialists.


Early and personal life

Marković was born on 6 July 1959 in Mojkovac, Yugoslavia. He finished elementary and middle school in Mojkovac, and graduated in law at the University of Kragujevac.[2] After he graduated from Kragujevac, he began working in legal consulting for the _Brskovo_ mine in Mojkovac.[3] He is married and has three children.[4]


Political career

In 1986, Marković was appointed secretary of the municipal assembly of Mojkovac, and mayor in 1989.[5] He left the post in 1991 to be appointed Secretary-General of the Montenegrin government led by Milo Đukanović within Yugoslavia. In 1997, he was elected to the Montenegrin Assembly, and the following year he became assistant Minister of the Interior, in charge of the State Security Service.[6]

During his time in the State Security Service, the editor-in-chief of daily newspaper _Dan_, Duško Jovanović, was killed on 27 May 2004. In 2014, Marković was sued for concealing information which may have exposed Jovanović's killers.[7] Jovanović's wife testified in court that Marković threatened to kill Jovanović during a phone call in April 2003, the same month the _Dan_ office was set on fire.[8]

In 2005, following the establishment of the new National Security Agency (ANB) in May that year, Marković was appointed by Parliament to head the agency, a position he held until 2010.[9] In 2010, Igor Lukšić's government appointed him first as a minister without portfolio, then as deputy prime minister and Justice Minister.[10] In March 2012, he was appointed Minister of Human and Minority Rights.[11] He left the government in 2015 and the same year the congress of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) elected him Deputy president of the party. In 2016, he was again appointed the Minister of the Justice in Provisional government.

On 25 October 2016, ten days after the parliamentary election, the DPS bureau chose Marković to replace Milo Đukanović as prime minister.[12] His nomination was condemned by the opposition, who accused Marković of involvement in corruption scandals and of omission of information in the inquiry about the murder of Duško Jovanović in 2004.[13]

On 25 May 2017, Marković made headlines around the world when the United States president Donald Trump appeared to brusquely shove him aside to get in front of him at a photo op during a NATO summit meeting, which was attended by Montenegro for the first time, days prior to its formal accession to the alliance.[16] Later, Marković responded to questions about the incident by shrugging it off.[17]

On 10 October 2018, Marković expressed his support[18] for amendments on the Law on State Symbols and Day of Statehood, which would penalize those who don't stand up for the Montenegrin national anthem by up to €2,000.[19] The amendment included tiers depending on the subject's occupation, with penalties for businessmen up to €6,000, and up to €20,000 for those working in the legal system.[20]

When a journalist asked Marković whether the amendments could be enforced, Marković suggested that it could be enforced at stadiums, saying that "everyone will be watching, every institution which bears a flag, every citizen who loves this country. And of course state agencies, inspection agencies. Whoever we recognize at the stadium who wouldn't stand, if we identify them we'll file a charge."[21]
