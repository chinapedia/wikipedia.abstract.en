The stream headwaters arise just west of Missouri Route U about 1.2 miles south of Missouri Route 42 at and it flows generally west passing just south of Brumley and under Missouri Route C to its confluence with the Grandglaize at just within the southeastern boundary of Lake of the Ozarks State Park.[2][3]

Mill Creek was named for the fact a watermill operated at its bank.[4]
