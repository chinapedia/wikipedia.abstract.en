RORY HUTCHINSON is a professional rugby union player currently playing with Northampton Saints.[1]

Playing predominantly at centre as he progresses with his career, Hutchinson began his rugby at National League 2 South side Shelford RFC, but was soon noticed by the Northampton club and joined their academy ranks.[2]

After appearing for the Saints' second side, the Wanderers, on numerous occasions and being a part of the club's Singha Sevens side, Hutchinson made his senior debut for the club on 31 January 2015, aged just 19 as Saints played local rivals Leicester Tigers.[3]

The centre then had to wait a whole two seasons for his next senior appearance in a Saints shirt, only making his Aviva Premiership debut against Exeter Chiefs in September 2016. Hutchinson managed to score a try in Saints' tight one point victory over their guest.[4]

In 2017, Hutchinson featuring in Saints' second team the Wanderers, as the side fought their way through the Aviva 'A' League system and into the final where they beat Gloucester United to take the title.[6]

Most recently, Hutchinson returned to the first team where he helped Saints secure a European Rugby Champions Cup place as the side fought off Stade Francais in the European Champions Cup play-off final to claim the last spot in the competition for the 2017/18 season despite the Scottish centre receiving a yellow card during the game.[7]
