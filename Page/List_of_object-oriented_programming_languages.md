This is a list of notable programming languages with object-oriented programming (OOP) features, which are also listed in :Category:Object-oriented programming languages. Note that, in some contexts, the definition of an "object-oriented programming language" is not exactly the same as that of a "programming language with object-oriented features".[1] For example, C++ is a multi-paradigm language including object-oriented paradigm;[2] however, it is less object-oriented than some other languages such as Python[3] and Ruby.[4] Therefore, someone considers C++ as an OOP language, while others do not or prefer to name it as "semi-object-oriented programming language".
