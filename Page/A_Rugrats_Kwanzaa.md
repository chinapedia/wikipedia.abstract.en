"A RUGRATS KWANZAA" is the 14th episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series _Rugrats_ and the show's 143rd episode. Released as a Kwanzaa television special, it looks at the holiday from the perspective of toddler Susie Carmichael during a visit from her great-aunt T. Susie, her friends—Tommy Pickles, Chuckie and Kimi Finster, and Phil and Lil Deville,— and family learn about Kwanzaa from Aunt T. Susie becomes depressed after thinking she is the only member of her family not to achieve greatness. Aunt T consoles her by sharing her memories using a scrap book. The episode concludes with Susie realizing that she still has plenty of time in her life to discover what makes her great.

Anthony Bell directed the episode from a script by Lisa D. Hall, Jill Gorey, and Barbara Herndon. "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was produced as part of Nickelodeon's commitment to feature cultural diversity in its programming. Some television critics compared it to similar holiday episodes by _As Told by Ginger_ and _The Proud Family._ "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was first broadcast on December 11, 2001, and later reaired at different events. A picture book entitled _The Rugrats' First Kwanzaa_ was adapted from the script. The episode was released on VHS in 2001, and it was later included in other home media releases.

"A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was praised by critics for its inclusion and representation of the holiday and the voice acting; there was a more mixed response to its commercialism. Cree Summer, who voices Susie, earned a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Performance by a Youth at the 34th NAACP Image Awards for her role in the episode.


Plot

On the first night of Kwanzaa, toddler Susie Carmichael is visited by her great-aunt T, who wants to celebrate the holiday with the family. The Carmichaels do not normally observe Kwanzaa, and Susie has never heard of it. Aunt T describes Kwanzaa as honoring the legacy and greatness of their ancestors. Susie's friends—Tommy Pickles, Chuckie and Kimi Finster, and Phil and Lil Deville—are invited to the Carmichaels' home as part of the festivities. Susie feels inferior to the rest of her family after Aunt T congratulates them on their accolades. Aunt T decides to hold the Karamu early to bring the family together. She gives Susie and her siblings presents, though Susie is disappointed to receive a scrapbook. Susie is not assigned a role for the Karamu preparations, leading her to believe she is not great having never won an award.

Following the babies' encouragement, Susie tries to emulate her siblings, including acting as class president, conducting scientific experiments, and playing soccer. When Susie fails at these tasks, Tommy advises her to find something special for herself. Susie unsuccessfully attempts to create a clay sculpture of her head as a gift to Aunt T, though her great-aunt reminds her that greatness is not measured by prizes. During a power outage, Aunt T shares her memories with the children using a scrapbook. Aunt T and her husband Charles had met Martin Luther King Jr. while driving to the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Susie's mother, Lucy, performed "This Little Light of Mine" as her first solo in church despite nearly being too afraid to sing. Lucy says that Aunt T is one of the greatest people of all and recalls how she provided her with money to attend Harvard Medical School. Once the power is restored, the family have dinner and Susie does the toast with her sculpture. Aunt T assures Susie that she will discover her greatness later in life.


Production

Kevin_Michael_Richardson_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg has a guest role as Martin Luther King Jr. in the episode.|alt=An image of a black man wearing a multi-colored dress shirt.]] The 23-minute, 18-second episode was written by Lisa D. Hall, Jill Gorey, and Barbara Herndon and directed by Anthony Bell.[1] It was also known as "A Rugrats Kwanzaa Special"[2][3] and "Rugrats: The Kwanzaa Special".[4] Nickelodeon's senior vice president for production Marjorie Cohn identified _Rugrats_ as the "natural home" for a Kwanzaa episode; the series had previously shown holiday specials on Christmas and Hanukkah. Cohen explained that the network included cultural diversity and representation in its programing to stay true to its "commitment to being there for all kids".[5] Expressing a similar sentiment, Nickelodeon president Cyma Zarghami said that, "Nickelodeon is committed to the idea that the kids on our programs look like the kids who watch it", and further explained: "Diversity is something we celebrate every day, and we believe kids are everyday heroes".[6]

Irma P. Hall, who guest-stars as Aunt T, praised _Rugrats_ for introducing Kwanzaa to a larger audience, and explained that she often did the same for her non-black friends. Discussing the importance of the episode, Hall said: "One thing that 9-11 taught us is that we really need to know as much as possible about other people's cultures. ... Getting to know about all these different holidays that people celebrate, it helps to reinforce the fact that we are more alike than different."[7] Other guest appearances in the episode include Kevin Michael Richardson as Martin Luther King Jr., Kimberly Brooks as the younger version of Lucy Carmichael, and Bill Cobbs as Uncle Charles.[8]

According to _Mental Floss_, _Rugrats_ was one of the first shows to focus on Kwanzaa in mainstream television.[9] Television critics compared "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" to episodes of _As Told by Ginger_ and _The Proud Family_, which aired the same year.[10][11] An Associated Press contributor wrote that the _Rugrats_ and _The Proud Family_ episodes' Kwanzaa-centric storylines helped to draw attention to the holiday.[12] The _Orlando Sentinel_{{'}}s Tammy Carter felt _Rugrats_ and _As Told By Ginger_ had focused on Kwanzaa and Hanukkah, respectively, to expand holiday programming beyond just Christmas.[13] Believing "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was intended to educate children about the holiday, M.S. Mason of _The Christian Science Monitor_ thought it was also created to further develop Susie as a character.[14]


Broadcast history and release

"A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was originally broadcast in the United States at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time on December 11, 2001, on Nickelodeon,[15][16] and repeated on December 15 and December 26.[17] The same year, author Stephanie Greene adapted the episode's script into the picture book _The Rugrats' First Kwanzaa_, published by Simon Spotlight and Nickelodeon.[18][19] Greene used misspelled words, including "Kwonzo", "eggsackly", and "imbentor", to represent the babies' dialogue. Segundo Garcia drew the illustrations. The book is intended for children between the ages of four and eight.[20]

"A Rugrats Kwanzaa" has been included on other _Rugrats_ home media releases. In 2001, Paramount Pictures released the special on VHS;[21] the tape also includes the episodes "And the Winner Is..." and "Cooking with Susie" as two "bonus cartoons".[22] It was also made available as part of _Rugrats, Holiday Collection!_[23] and the _Turkey and Mistletoe_ DVD.[24] Even though Viacom released "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" as part of _Rugrats_{{'}} season seven DVD,[25] the iTunes Store put it with the show's eighth season instead.[26] The episode was included in the _Rugrats, The Complete Series_ release.[27] It was made available on numerous streaming video on demand services, including Amazon Video, Hulu, and Google Play.[28]

In December 2003, Nickelodeon played "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" as part of its "Nickmas" television marathon.[29] The network has uploaded two clips from the episode to NickSplat's YouTube account.[30][31] The flashback of Lucy singing at church was uploaded on December 28, 2016;[32] the segment involving Martin Luther King Jr. was uploaded January 16, 2017, to commemorate his birthday.[33] "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" was screened as part of the 14th annual Kwanzaa Observance Program in Chicago, Illinois,[34] and at a separate event at the African Burial Ground National Monument in December 2017.[35] The episode was also shown as part of a 2019 event at the Paley Center for Media, along with "A Rugrats Chanukah";[36] the center has included the episode as part of its collection of African-American comedy.[37]


Critical response

Commentators praised how _Rugrats_ introduced Kwanzaa to a wider audience. A contributor from _TheJournal.ie_ believed the episode might be the only time some children were exposed to the holiday.[38] _Bustle_'s Madeleine Aggeler commended the episode for discussing Kwanzaa in a "straightforward, entertaining way that the babies and their fans could understand" without resorting to talking down to the viewer.[39] The _Los Angeles Times_{{'}} Lee Margulies held up the special as a "model of diversity programming" and children's television. Margulies felt that its focus on Susie's insecurities, rather than the history of Kwanzaa, helped to provide a "special resonance for African American viewers" through "universal themes that make Kwanzaa valuable for everyone to acknowledge".[40] Ted Cox, writing for the _Daily Herald_, enjoyed how _Rugrats_ included jokes about Kwanzaa's "contrived origins", such as Susie's older brother writing a report on it.[41] _The Hollywood Reporter_{{'}}s Deborah Holmes summed up the episode as "a cultural and educational experience for some and an enjoyable reminder for others".[42] Discussing its overall message, Holmes said:

Critics commended "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" for its representation of the holiday. According to _Den of Geek!_ and Blavity, _Rugrats_ was known and well-received for celebrating a diverse set of holidays.[43][44] _The A.V. Club_{{'}}s Pilot Viruet wrote: "The beauty of Rugrats wasn’t in its Christmas episodes ... but was actually when it branched out to include other holidays like Kwanzaa and Chanukah".[45] MTV News' Jonathan Savitt praised the episode for encouraging its viewers to have respect for different cultures.[46] Children's literature scholar Cathlena Martin cited "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" as an example of how _Rugrats_ brought a "positive awareness of race and culture" through its focus on the characters' family and friends.[47] Approaching _Rugrats_ as a socially progressive program, Movie Pilot's Kristy Anderson posed the question: "What other cartoon boasts Christmas, Hanukkah, Passover and Kwanzaa specials among its episodes?"[48]

In contrast, David Rennie of _The Daily Telegraph_ criticized "A Rugrats Kwanzaa" as part of the commercialization of Kwanzaa; Maulana Karenga, the holiday's creator, was critical of "the corporate world's move to penetrate and dominate the Kwanzaa market".[49] However, Kristen Lopez of Livingly Media felt that _Rugrats_ had successfully "bridge[d] the gap between telling a heartfelt story and acting as a marketing tool" through its holiday programming.[50]

The voice acting was also the subject of some praise. Cree Summer, who voices Susie, received a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Performance by a Youth at the 34th NAACP Image Awards for her performance in the episode.[51] Margulies praised Irma P. Hall for "energetically voic[ing]" her character,[52] and Holmes wrote that Hall and Summer were "great" and "delightful" in their roles, respectively.[53]
