LOIS LANE is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, she first appeared in _Action Comics_ #1 (June 1938). Lois is an award-winning journalist for the Metropolis newspaper the _Daily Planet_ and the primary love interest of the superhero Superman and his alter-ego, Clark Kent. In DC continuity, she is also his wife and the mother of their son, Jon Kent, the current Superboy in the DC Universe.

Lois' physical appearance was originally based on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Joe Shuster. For her character, Jerry Siegel was inspired by actress Glenda Farrell's portrayal of the fictional reporter Torchy Blane in a series of films. Siegel took her name from actress Lola Lane.[1] She was also influenced by the real-life journalist Nellie Bly.[2]

Depictions of the character have varied spanning the comics and other media adaptations. The original Golden Age version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a dauntless journalist and intellectually equal to Superman. During the Silver Age of Comics, she was the star of _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_, a comic book series that had a light and humorous tone. Beginning in 2015, she is the protagonist in the young adult novel series, _Lois Lane_, by writer Gwenda Bond.

Lois is among the best-known female comic book characters. She has appeared in various media adaptations. Actress Noel Neill first portrayed Lois Lane in the 1940s _Superman_ film series and later reprised her role in the 1950s television series _Adventures of Superman_, replacing Phyllis Coates from season two. Margot Kidder played the character in four Superman films in the 1970s and 1980s, Kate Bosworth in the 2006 film _Superman Returns_, and Amy Adams in the DC Extended Universe. In the 1990s television series, she was portrayed by Teri Hatcher in _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_ and Erica Durance in the 2000s series, _Smallville_. Most recently Elizabeth Tulloch appeared as Lois in the Arrowverse television series. Actresses who have voiced Lois in animated adaptations include Joan Alexander in the Fleischer Superman cartoons and Dana Delany in _Superman: The Animated Series_, among others.


Creation

Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster first conceived Lois Lane in 1934, when they were still developing Superman.[3] One of the major influence on Lois' characterization was actress Glenda Farrell and her portrayal of the fictional reporter Torchy Blane in a series of Warner Bros. films. The Torchy Blane movies were popular second features during the later 1930s. On the conception of Lois Lane, Jerry Siegel stated in the 1988 _Time_ magazine:

Joe Shuster based Lois' physical appearance on a model name Joanne Carter. Carter had placed an ad in the _Cleveland Plain Dealer_ newspaper in the Situation Wanted column, advertising herself as a model.[4] Shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for Lois Lane. Shuster's depiction of Lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features. "To me she was Lois Lane. She was a great inspiration for me, though. She encouraged me, she was very enthusiastic about the strip; it meant a lot to me." Shuster said about Joanne Carter.[5]

Joanne Carter married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948. On working with Joe Shuster for Lois Lane, Carter said in the 1983 _Nemo_ magazine interview: "Joe was redrawing the strip, and it was going to be more realistic, rather than cartoony. I used to model for him every Saturday until he had enough drawings. He made so many stock drawings that it got to a point where he didn't need any more. We became such good friends by that time we decided we would always stay friends."[6]


Publication history

Lois Lane made her debut in __Action Comics_ #1_ (June 1938) the first published Superman story. She was one of the first female comic book characters appearing in the superhero comics.[7] Lois is the daughter of Ella and Sam Lane, in earlier comics, her parents were farmers in a town called Pittsdale.[8] The modern comics depicts Lois as a former Army brat, born at Ramstein Air Base with Lois having been trained by her father, a US Army General, in areas such as hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms. She has one younger sibling, her sister Lucy Lane.[9] Lois is a journalist for the _Daily Planet_, one of the best investigative reporters and the best at the newspaper she works at.[10] In some stories, she has been shown obtaining superpowers and becoming a superhero, some of her superhero identities are Superwoman and Red Tornado of Earth 2.

Aspects of Lois' personality have varied over the years, depending on the comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, she is shown to be an independent person who is smart, determined and strong-willed. Her physical appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion or media adaptations. In the 1990s, when the television series _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_ began airing Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress Teri Hatcher, and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on _Superman: The Animated Series_. From the late 1980s through the 1990s she was depicted with auburn hair in the comic books.

In the 1940s, Lois had a newspaper comic strip, _Lois Lane, Girl Reporter_, a direct spin-off of the Superman comic strip running at the time. A similar title comic series began appearing in the _Superman_ comic book in 1944, starting with _Superman_ #28. In 1958, DC Comics gave Lois a comic book series, _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_. The series focuses on her solo adventures and began publication in April 1958. In the 1960s, the series was one of DC's most popular titles and was the top ten best-selling comic books in America.[11] She had a series featured in _The Superman Family_ comic book from 1974 to 1982. In 2015, she received her own young adult novel series written by author Gwenda Bond.

In the 1990s, after Clark proposes to Lois and reveals to her that he is Superman,[12][13] she married him in the comic book _Superman: The Wedding Album_ (Dec. 1996).[14][15] The couple's biological child in DC Comics canon was born in _Convergence: Superman #2_ (July 2015) a son named Jonathan Samuel Kent, who eventually becomes Superboy.


Fictional character biography

Golden Age

Superman27.PNG.]]

In the Golden Age comics, Lois was an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the _Daily Star_ (the newspaper's name was changed to the _Daily Planet_ in _Action Comics_ #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent.

Starting early as the 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his secret identity, all of which backfired because of Superman's efforts. The first such story appears in _Superman_ #17 (July–August 1942).[16] This theme became particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s Silver Age comic books.

Lois gained her first series of stories (without Superman) starting with _Superman_ #28 (May–June 1944),[17] _Lois Lane, Girl Reporter_, running in the _Superman_ comic book for a number of years, had Lois defeating bad guys and getting front-page stories on her own, without any help from Superman.

In the Golden Age comics, Lois had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated tall tales and fibs to adults.[18] Susie's last appearance was in _Superman_ #95 (February 1955).[19] Subsequent comics presented Lois' only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

Silver Age and Bronze Age

When the reading audience of superhero comic books became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, and bizarre plots.

Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to a Superman impostor from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul[20] and a man from the future.[21] All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.

Lois became more and more popular during the 1950s, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC's title _Showcase_ in 1957,[22] DC Comics created an ongoing series for the character, titled _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_[23] beginning in April 1958 and running for 137 issues until October 1974. Most stories were about Lois' romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist Kurt Schaffenberger; indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lois became cited by many[24][25] as the "definitive" version of Lois, and he was often asked by DC editor Mort Weisinger to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared.[26] So many stories depicted Lois and marriage that the cover of a 1968 80-Page Giant that reprinted several such stories, the "All-Wedding Issue", described the magazine as "featuring Lois' schemes and dreams to marry Superman!".[27]

The series _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_ became one of DC's most popular titles, the third best-selling comic in 1962 and 1965.[28][29] The title featured the first appearance of the Silver Age Catwoman, after an absence from the comics for over a decade.[30]

While Lois suspicious of Superman's secret identity as early as _Superman_ #7 (1940), her suspicions grew during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. Stories showed Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his Superman robots or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.[31]

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women's role in American society changed, Lois' character changed as well. In _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_ #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look.[32] Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.

Lois had a series featured in _The Superman Family_ (an anthology title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of _Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane_ and _Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen_) from 1974 to 1982. In her series, Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian martial art of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of Kandor.[33] There were several cameos of the New Gods, including Desaad and Darkseid. Lois Lane was the backup series in _The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl_ in 1982 to 1983.[34]

During the Silver and Bronze Age, Lois' backstory became more fully fleshed out, with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the _Daily Planet_. This backstory was attributed to the Lois Lane of Earth-One.

As summarized in various stories, Lois was born to Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of Pittsdale.[35] While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a rattlesnake in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El's baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El's experimental rockets.[36] At the age of two, Lois suffered measles, and at the age of three, whooping cough.[37] At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.[38]

During Lois' adolescence, she won a youth contest run by the _Daily Planet_, with the prize being a trip to Metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most scoops, which turned out to be Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois' bet (an ice cream sundae), and the two returned to their respective hometowns.[39] Lois would meet Superboy (but not Clark Kent) again during her adolescence while attending an all-girls summer camp near Smallville. There, Lois met Lana Lang, a fellow camper, for the first time.[40] Lois would make further attempts at landing a job with the _Daily Planet_ during her teenage years[41] and spent time writing for her hometown's newspaper, the _Pittsdale Star_.[42]

Upon finishing high school, Lois left Pittsdale and attended Raleigh College to study journalism. While in college, Lois worked for the student newspaper, the _Raleigh Review_, as a reporter and eventually its co-editor.[43] After graduating from college, Lois became permanently employed at the _Daily Planet_. Clark Kent and Jimmy Olsen later joined the _Planet_{{'}}s staff but Lois remained the newspaper's star reporter,[44] winning the Pulitzer Prize.[45] She was very dependent on Superman, however; he told her that having to rescue her so often from problems she caused prevented him from helping others.[46] For example, when late for a deadline Lois jumped off a cliff expecting Superman to catch her "as he has done a thousand times", and fly her to her destination.[47] When asked on a Sunday morning talk show what she would do if trapped in an underground mine with rescue impossible before the air ran out, Lois admitted that she would impatiently await Superman because "I've got a deadline to meet."[48]

After the 1985–1986 miniseries _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ writer John Byrne revised the Superman legend and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity. Before this happened, a final non-canonical imaginary story _Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?_ was written by Alan Moore, meant as a send-off for the pre-Crisis versions of the characters, including Lois. Published at the same time but in Earth-One continuity was a two-issue miniseries, _Lois Lane_, in which she investigates missing children.[49][50]

Modern Age

Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne's _The Man of Steel_ miniseries, which significantly rewrote Superman's origin and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois' first real relationship in this version was with Jose Delgado, a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered in a battle with a Lexcorp cyborg/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois' attraction to Superman with whom Delgado felt he had to compete.[51][52]

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until _The Adventures of Superman_ #460–463 and _Action Comics_ #650.

Following Clark's brief rampage under the influence of the Eradicator, Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for "selling out" to Collin Thornton and running _Newstime_ Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to "_grovel for his job back_". Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually, Lois accepted a proposal of marriage.[53][54] Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.[55][56]

DC Comics had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993's _Superman vol. 2_ #75. With the then-upcoming television show _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_, DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, Superman was killed in _Superman_ #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a battle royal with the monster Doomsday. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the mermaid Lori Lemaris). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to Perry White's cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally married in the comic book _Superman: The Wedding Album_ (Dec. 1996), which featured the work of nearly every living artist who had ever worked on Superman.[57] The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of the television series _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_, which featured the wedding of the two characters.[58][59] _The Wedding Album_ itself spent part of its opening pages accommodating and reconciling the then-current comic storyline of Lois and Clark having broken off their engagement.

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to be one of the strongest relationships in comics. In 2006, the couple took the next step in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they named Chris Kent. The boy is later discovered to be the son of Jor-El's foe, General Zod. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered child, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being 'Mommy Lois.' Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the Phantom Zone rift, trapping himself inside with Zod's forces, leaving Lois without her son.

In the second issue of _Final Crisis_, Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by Clayface destroying the _Daily Planet_ and Lois is critically injured. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife's life. The story is continued in the 3D tie-in comic _Superman Beyond_, where the female Monitor Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of The Bleed and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in _Final Crisis_ #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of _Superman: New Krypton_ Superman must leave Earth for an undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow Kryptonians to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander, but he secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In the issues of _Action Comics_ Lois has reunited with Christopher Kent who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero Nightwing.[60] Supergirl and Lana visit Lois' apartment to tell her the bad news that her sister Lucy Lane was killed during a battle with Supergirl. Lois doesn't believe that her sister is dead and refuses to accept the news until she has irrefutable proof. Lois asks Supergirl for a recovered piece of Superwoman's costume.[61]

Lois hands her exposé in and the government is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the _Daily Planet_ under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the _Daily Planet_, as Lois gets her edge back.[62] It was later revealed she never really quit the _Daily Planet_.

Lois learns her father's forces destroyed New Krypton. She is kidnapped by Lucy and taken to Sam's secret base.[63] There, Lois argues with her father, saying the Kryptonians think of him as a genocidal maniac. In the war between New Krypton and Earth, Supergirl finds them and threatens to kill Sam. Lois stops her, saying her father will be judged for his war crimes. Sam takes a gun and commits suicide.[64] Later, Lois visits the imprisoned Lucy.[65] She expresses disbelief on what her sister has become. Lois says while she will not miss her father, she will miss her sister.[66]

In _Superman: Grounded_, Superman begins a journey through America to reconnect with the American people, and Lois, though confused at first, supports his choice. Lois later travels to Rushmark and finds an old college friend Brian, who invites her to have dinner with him and his wife. When Lois leaves Brian's home she is met by Superman. The two reaffirm their love to each other and go to Chicago.[67] There, Lois helps Superman arrest a violent father who has been attacking his wife and son.[68] Later, Lois and Superman investigate a factory in Des Moines. Lois wants to publish an article, which would reveal the workers' illegal activities, but Superman forces her not to. Feeling betrayed, Lois returns to Metropolis and does not speak to Superman for a while.[69] When Lois is kidnapped by Lisa Jennings, a woman who wants to destroy Superman, he rescues her.[70] With the danger over. Superman apologizes to Lois about what happened in Des Moines. Lois replies that she wrote the article anyway, saying that she was a reporter before she was his wife. Knowing that his wife did the right thing, Superman kisses her. The two then return home.[71]

New 52

In 2011, DC Comics relaunched its titles and its main continuity was rebooted with the New 52. Lois now works for Morgan Edge heading up the media division of the _Daily Planet_. She views Clark as a friend and is unaware that he is Superman.[72]

Lois investigates the story of twenty people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac. Her search leads her to a U.S. senator, who revealed to be one of the Twenty. The senator dies, but not before transferring his powers to Lois, who falls into a coma.[73] Lois later awakes from her coma at the hospital, with Jonathan Carroll at her side.[74] Lois manifests psychic powers and helps Superman fight the Psychic Pirate. During the fight, Lois learns that Clark is Superman but falls back into a coma. After defeating the Psychic Pirate, Superman brings Lois back to the hospital.[75] Later, the Parasite attacks the hospital and attempts to steal Lois' powers.[76] Superman tricks the Parasite into absorbing Lois' psionic energy. The power overwhelms the Parasite, causing him to collapse. Lois awakens from her coma but she does not seem to remember Superman's identity.[77]

Lois is the main character in the _Superman: Lois Lane_ #1 one-shot. In this story, Lois' sister, Lucy, asks for her help in finding her roommate Amanda Suresh, who had been kidnapped by a mysterious group called "the Cartel." According to Lucy, Amanda had been taking a drug that transformed her into a monster. As Lois investigates the Cartel, she gets captured and taken to the Cartel's headquarters. There, Lois finds out the Cartel had been capturing people who had been mutated by the drug. Lois escapes and rescues Amanda when the captured monsters cause a riot. As she returns home, Lois finds out Lucy had been taking the drug. As Lucy apologizes for putting all three in danger, Lois chooses to publish her story about the Cartel.[78]

In the _New 52: Futures End_, set five years in the possible future of the New 52-verse. Lois is considered the most successful freelance reporter on the planet and her blog "The Fast Lane" is one of the most read and well-respected sources of news in the world.[79]

In the miniseries _Convergence_, which featured many Post-_Crisis_ DC Universe characters, including a married Superman and his pregnant wife Lois Lane, deal with the impending birth of their child, as Superman is called to protect the city.[80] _Convergence_ shows the birth of their son, Jonathan Samuel Kent.[81]

Following _Convergence_, DC announced the spin-off comic book series _Superman: Lois and Clark_, debuting in October 2015 by Dan Jurgens and Lee Weeks.[82] The eight-issue series is set several years after the _Convergence_ event, where Clark and Lois and their son Jonathan has been living and working in the New 52 universe. The couple now lives in California and has changed their last name to White (a tribute to Perry White). Lois has become an anonymous author, publishing several critically acclaimed books under the alias name "Author X." While Clark continues his superhero duty, protecting cities and civilians quietly behind the scenes.[83] Their son, Jonathan, eventually began to develop superpowers of his own (similar to those of his father Superman) and learned the truth about his parents' true origin.

DC Rebirth

In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic book titles with DC Rebirth. The publisher once again re-established the Post-_Crisis_ Superman as the principal Superman in DC comics, along with his wife, Lois Lane, and their son, Jonathan Samuel Kent.[84]

Lois began to investigate the disappearance of her New 52 counterpart,[85] and after learning the apparent death of her other-self, she returns to the _Daily Planet_ posing as her counterpart.[86] Following a confrontation with Mister Mxyzptlk, Lois and Superman's essence is merged with their New 52 counterpart, creating a new DC Universe.


Superhero identity

Lois Lane has become a superhero and gained superpowers several times in the comics, animation, and live-action series.

Superwoman

Lois was the first person to assume the Superwoman persona and has become the superheroine on several occasions. Her first appearance as Superwoman (as well as Superwoman's first appearance in DC Comics) was in _Action Comics_ #60 (May 1943).[87] The story is set in a dream sequence, where, after Lois is hit by a truck, she dreams a transfusion of Superman's blood gives her superpowers and she becomes Superwoman. In _Superman_ #45, Lois believes Hocus and Pocus—a pair of fraudulent magicians—have given her superpowers, and with Superman's help and intervention, Lois once again becomes Superwoman.[88] In _The Superman Family_ #207, the Earth-Two Lois gained superpowers from her husband, after Superman brought an extraterrestrial plant into their home, with Lois losing the powers after the death of the plant.[89] Other stories have Lois transformed into Superwoman when Superman transfers some of his powers to Lois, or from one of Lex Luthor's inventions or due to Mr. Mxyzptlk's interference. On _Smallville_ in the episode "Prophecy," Jor-El gives Lois all of Clark's powers for one day.

In the original Crime Syndicate of America on Earth-Three, Lois Lane and Superwoman were two separate individual characters.[90] Superwoman is a supervillain and Lois married Earth-Three's greatest champion, Alexander Luthor. The pre-Crisis version of the characters perished when Earth-Three was destroyed during the events of _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.[91] In the graphic novel _JLA: Earth 2_, Superwoman, a member of the Crime Syndicate is the alternate version of Lois Lane.[92] She is an Amazon by birth and the chief editor of the _Daily Planet_. She inhabits the same antimatter universe which contains the planet Qward. The New 52 version of Superwoman of Earth-3 is also named Lois Lane and is part of the Crime Syndicate.

In _All-Star Superman_, the 12 issue comic book series by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, Lois becomes a Kryptonian Superwoman for 24 hours. In the story, Superman (who believed he was dying) revealed his secret identity to her and takes Lois to his Fortress of Solitude to spend her birthday. While at his Arctic sanctuary, he presents Lois with her birthday present, a formula called "Exo-Genes" created by Superman from his own DNA, that allows Lois to have his powers for twenty-four hours. With her new Kryptonian powers and new Superwoman costume (made by Superman), the two spend the whole day together on different adventures and shared a kiss on the moon.[93][94] At the end of the story, Superman proclaims his love for Lois, before he flies off into the sun to repair it. Lois later appeared as Superwoman in the animated All-Star Superman film, voiced by Christina Hendricks.

In DC Rebirth, the _New 52_ Lois and Lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the New 52 Superman. This results in both Lois and Lana becoming Superwoman, with Lois possessing all of Superman's traditional powers, while Lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms. Lois later dies at the hands of a female Bizarro, being overloaded with solar energy the same way Superman was killed.[95]

Red Tornado

Following the DC relaunch, the series _Earth 2_ debuted in 2012, set on the parallel world of that name. It depicts a modern take on the Golden Age world, starring the Justice Society of America and superheroes of that period.

In _Earth 2_, Lois Lane is married to Superman. When Clark's cousin, Kara arrived on earth, she stayed with Clark's parents, before moving in and living with Clark and Lois. Lois considers Kara as her daughter and Kara calls Lois mom.[96] Five years prior to the start of the story, during the first Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois was killed by one of Darkseid's assassins at the Daily Planet, she died in her husband's arms.[97] Superman and many other heroes of Earth 2 perished in the war.

Five years later, as various heroes begin to rise and various gods from Apokolips begin to wreak havoc again. Lois' consciousness is revealed to have survived and was downloaded into the robot body of Red Tornado by her father Sam Lane.[98] Lois, now as Red Tornado, possessed the power of wind manipulation and cyclone generation abilities. Lois bands together with Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Batman (Thomas Wayne), Accountable (Jimmy Olsen) and the other gathered heroes to fight against the forces of Apokolips. After a protracted battle with what was thought to be a surviving brainwashed Superman, Lois realizes he is, in fact, a Bizarro, and takes advantage of his deteriorating form to disintegrate him with a cyclone blast.[99] In the story, Lois is referred to by Doctor Fate as the "Resurrection hope".

During Superman's rampage and destruction on Earth 2, Lois is among a group that discovers Val-Zod, a Kryptonian, hidden in a cell beneath Arkham.[100] Lois helps Val feel accepted and welcomed on Earth 2, learn to control his superpower, and overcome his agoraphobia (due to his prolonged travel in space to Earth).[101] Val-Zod eventually becomes the new Superman of Earth 2.

In the second Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois and Kara are reunited, after Kara and Huntress return to Earth 2 from Prime Earth.[102] Lois, along with Kara, Val, Huntress, Batman and other heroes, fights against the armies of Apokolips and new villains appearing across Earth 2. While searching for Huntress beneath the fire pits of Earth 2 in DeSaad's cloning facility, Lois, Val, Kara and Batman found the real Superman who has been held captive for five years. He was revived by DeSaad and was used as the genetic source for the Kryptonian clones. The extraction of his DNA corrupted his body leaving him without any powers.[103] Lois and Superman reunite briefly, before he sacrificed himself one last time, destroying the Parademon facilities using his corrupt DNA.[104] After Superman's death, Lois gave Kara the symbol from his uniform, which was then worn by Kara in remembrance.

In the final days of Earth 2, Lois' instincts as a journalist lead her to attempt to preserve and record the history and stories of Earth 2 in her large memory bank in the hope that someday, someone will read the data and rebuild this world.[105] After the destruction of Earth 2, Lois and the remaining civilians and heroes of Earth 2 relocated to a new world.[106]

The writer of _Earth 2_, Tom Taylor, specifically resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 after he was told to kill off the character in the _Injustice_ comic series. Taylor stated "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then it was just a matter of working out exactly how."[107] Taylor received "Women in Refrigerators" criticism for his _Injustice_ comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to "unfridge" Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope."[108]

Nicola Scott, the long-time artist on Earth 2, on drawing Red Tornado Lois, "I wanted Lois to be Lois, despite the fact that she’s metal. I wanted to make sure she looked really feminine and really beautiful, so all she’d need is a flesh coating and a wig and she’d be good to go."[109]

Earth-Two version

DC Comics instituted its multiverse system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity and introduced the Earth-Two Superman in _Justice League of America_ #73 (August 1969).[118] This retcon declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of "Earth-Two" versus the then mainstream (Silver Age) universe of "Earth-One".

Action_Comics_484.jpg and Dick Giordano.]]

In _Action Comics_ #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth-Two's Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old Justice Society of America enemy, the Wizard), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other and were soon married. During the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman, and after recruiting the aid of the Wizard, restored Clark's memory.[119]

The now-married Lois and Clark appeared in a series of stories in _The Superman Family_ #195 – #199 and #201 – #222 titled _Mr and Mrs Superman_, which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character.[120] Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for Power Girl, Superman's cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the Superboy of Earth-Prime are taken by Earth-Three's Alexander Luthor, Jr. into a paradise-like dimension at the end of the story. Following the events of _Crisis on Infinite Earths,_ this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC's continuity.

In 2005's _Infinite Crisis_ miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and dying for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in _Infinite Crisis_ #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of _Infinite Crisis_ #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words "_It's... not... going..._" as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister Black Lantern with her husband in the _Blackest Night_ crossover. Her first task is to kidnap Martha Kent with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for Kal-El, Connor Kent, and Martha, to be reunited with Jonathan Kent in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until Krypto intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking Smallville, and reaching town to aid others unhindered.[121][122][123]

Black Lantern Lois later appears to Power Girl, claiming that she has escaped the ring's corrupting influence, and needs her help. This was just a ploy to get close enough to her husband's body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois "sacrifices" herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.[124][125]

In the sequel, _JLA: Another Nail_ Lois helps the Kents create Kal-El's 'Clark' disguise- albeit naming him 'Carl' on impulse- to give him a chance at a normal life outside of his role as Superman, reasoning that the simplicity of the glasses will stop people paying too much attention to him, while their original plan to completely cover him with a false beard would make people suspect that Kal-El had something to hide.
