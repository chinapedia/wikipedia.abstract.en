VIDEOLAND was originally a Dutch retail chain of video rental stores and is now primarily a OTT online service provider owned by RTL Nederland. Its main competitor is Netflix.


History

Videoland was founded by Nico Broersen and Gerard van Stijn, and opened its first store in 1984. From 1992 to 1996 Philips was the owner, and took over the management in the Netherlands. In 2004 the 200th store opened.[1]

By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the video stores came more and more under pressure due to the rise of Video-on-Demand services. Parent company Entertainment Retail Group filed for bankruptcy in 2010. The Videoland formula and franchise were then acquired by Moving Pictures Holding.[2]


Video-on-Demand Service

Videoland on Demand is available since 2010 and RTL Nederland took a share of 65% in 2013. Since 2015 Videoland on Demand is fully owned by RTL Nederland. The rental stores closed its doors.[3]
