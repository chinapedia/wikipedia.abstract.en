History

Owners Jeff and Jen Herbert began making mead as home-brewers around 2007,[7] and began professional production in 2012 when they entered into an alternating proprietorship with Juniper Well Ranch in Skull Valley, Az.[8] The company opened a production facility and tasting room in the cellar of the Burmister Building in Prescott, Az in 2014.[9]

Product Line

Superstition's product line features over 85 different meads,[20] "including brews created with blackberries, Belgian dark candi sugar and vanilla beans, all predominantly aged in American oak, as well as bourbon, wine, craft beer and port barrels." [21] Staples include traditional meads like _Lagrimas de Oro_ (a semi-sweet traditional mead), melomels like the berry-based _Marion_ and mango-based _Ragnarok_, a vanilla metheglin called _Tahitian Honeymoon,_ and grape-based pyments like _Aphrodisia._[22] Superstition also produces heavier dessert meads, like the _White Series_: barrel aged meads with one of four berry juices and white chocolate.[23]
