Academics

UCV will offer the students a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science depending on the courses in their personal curriculum. The study is completely taught in English. Every student is, besides the courses, also doing several skill trainings and projects. UCV uses, as compared to the other studies of Maastricht University, the problem-based learning method taught in small classes. On top of that, UCV uses the research-based learning method, which provides the students with opportunities to collaborate with industry and local institutions. This provides the students with a more practical insight in their future careers.

_Curriculum structure_

UCV students have dependent on their chosen courses a life science, social sciences or interdisciplinary concentration. With UCM using the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) a BA or BSc at UCM will comprise a total of 180 ECTS. Students subsequently enrol in a maximum of 30 ECTS per semester, or 60 ECTS for a full year, with students receiving 5 ECTS for courses and projects and 2.5 ECTS for skills trainings. Students create their own curriculum, with help of academic advisors, by choosing courses located within their respective concentration in addition to a requirement to complete a core curriculum. By choosing their own courses and concentration, students will be able to develop a good background for future jobs or for enrolment in a Master programme after they finished their Bachelor studies.
