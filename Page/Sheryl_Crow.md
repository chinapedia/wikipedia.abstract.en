Childhood and education

Sheryl Suzanne Crow was born in Kennett, Missouri, the daughter of Bernice (née Cain), a piano teacher, and Wendell Wyatt Crow, a lawyer and trumpet player.[3][4][5][6] Her great-grandfather was congressman Charles A. Crow (1873–1938).[7][8] She has two older sisters named Kathy and Karen, and a younger brother named Steven.

While studying at Kennett High School, Crow was a majorette and an all-state track athlete, medaling in the 75-meter low hurdles. She also joined the 'pep club', the National Honor Society, and the National FFA Organization, and was crowned Paperdoll Queen in a celebrity-judged beauty contest[9][10] during her senior year. She then enrolled at the University of Missouri in Columbia and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in music composition, performance, and education from the School of Music. While at the university, she sang in the local band Cashmere. She was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity for Women, and the Omicron Delta Kappa Society as well as working as a 'Summer Welcome' orientation leader.[11]


Career

1987–1992: Early years

After graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at Kellison Elementary School in Fenton, Missouri.[12] Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer Jay Oliver. He had a studio in the basement of his parents' home in St. Louis and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a 'back to school' spot for the St Louis department store Famous-Barr. Soon after she sang in commercial jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. She was quoted in a _60 Minutes_ segment as saying she made $40,000 on her McDonald's ad alone.[13]

Crow toured with Michael Jackson as a backing vocalist during his Bad tour 1987–1989, and often performed with Jackson on "I Just Can't Stop Loving You".[14] She also recorded background vocals for Stevie Wonder, Belinda Carlisle and Don Henley.

In 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the Neal Schon track "Smoke of the Revolution" from his album Late Nite.[15]

Crow also sang in the short-lived Steven Bochco drama _Cop Rock_ in 1990 and her song "Heal Somebody" appeared in the film _Bright Angel_. In 1991 her recording of "Welcome to the Real Life' featured on the soundtrack to the Brian Bosworth action film, Stone Cold. Later that year her performance of "Hundreds of Tears" was included in the _Point Break_ soundtrack and she sang a duet with Kenny Loggins on the track "I Would Do Anything", from his album _Leap of Faith_.

1992–1994: Scrapped debut album

In 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with Sting's record producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was due to be released on September 22, 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as "too produced" and "slick". However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion, Tina Turner and Wynonna Judd.

1994–1998: International success

She then began dating Kevin Gilbert and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the "Tuesday Music Club." [16] Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David & David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, _Tuesday Night Music Club_.[17]

The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits.[18]

Sheryl_Crow_003.jpg, California in 2002, with guitarist Peter Stroud]] Crow appeared in the "New Faces" section of _Rolling Stone_ in 1994. _Tuesday Night Music Club_ featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, "Leaving Las Vegas". The album was slow to garner attention, until "All I Wanna Do" became an unexpected smash hit in the fall of 1994. As she later stated in _People_, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song.[19] The singles "Strong Enough" and "Can't Cry Anymore" were also released, with the first song ("Strong Enough") charting at No. 5 on _Billboard_ and "Can't Cry Anymore" hitting the Top 40.[20] _Tuesday Night Music Club_ went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the U.S. and U.K. during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammy Awards, in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Female Vocal Performance.[21] She performed at the 1994 and 1999 Woodstock Festivals, as well as the Another Roadside Attraction in 1997.

Crow supplied background vocals to the song "The Garden of Allah" from Don Henley's 1995 album _Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits_.

In 1996, Crow released her self-titled second album.[22] She produced the album herself and also played a variety of instruments, from various guitars, bass or pedal steel to various organs and piano. The debut single, "If It Makes You Happy", became a radio success and netted her two Grammy awards for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album.[23] Other singles included "A Change Would Do You Good", "Home", and "Everyday Is a Winding Road". The album was banned from sale at Wal-Mart, because in the lyrics to "Love Is a Good Thing" Crow says that Wal-Mart sells guns to children.[24][25] The album also features a protest song called "Redemption Day", which was covered by Johnny Cash on his last album American VI: Ain't No Grave. In 1997, Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies_. Her song "Tomorrow Never Dies" was nominated for a Grammy Award and Best Original Song Golden Globe.[26][27] Crow collaborated on Scott Weiland's 1998 album, _12 Bar Blues_.

1998–2002: _The Globe Sessions_ and live album

In 1998, Crow released _The Globe Sessions_. During this period, she discussed in interviews having gone through a deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, "My Favorite Mistake," was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend.[28][29] Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling _Billboard Magazine_ on the release of her album, "Oh, there will be just so much speculation, and because of that there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know. I'm really private about who I've had relationships with, and I don't talk about them in the press. I don't even really talk about them with the people around me."[30] Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, "My favorite single is 'My Favorite Mistake.' It was a lot of fun to record and it's still a lot of fun to play."[31] The album won Best Rock Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song "Sweet Child o' Mine," which was included on the soundtrack of the film _Big Daddy_. The song won the 1999 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.[32] Other singles included "There Goes the Neighborhood," "Anything but Down," and "The Difficult Kind." Crow won the 2001 Grammy best female rock vocal performance for _There Goes the Neighborhood._[33] _The Globe Sessions_ peaked at No. 5 on the _Billboard_ 200 chart, achieving US sales of 2 million as of January 2008.[34]

Later in 1998, Crow took part in a live concert in tribute to Burt Bacharach, contributing vocals on "One Less Bell to Answer."[35] In 1999, Crow also made her acting debut as an ill-fated drifter in the suspense/drama _The Minus Man_, which starred her then-boyfriend Owen Wilson as a serial killer. Also in 1999, she appeared in Prince's album _Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic_, singing backing vocals in the song "Baby Knows". Prince included a cover of her "Everyday Is a Winding Road" in the album. She also appeared in Zucchero Fornaciari's collection _Overdose d'amore/The Ballads_ featuring the song _Blue_ (co-written by Bono).

She also released a live album called _Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live From Central Park_. The record featured Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, Keith Richards, and Eric Clapton. It included "There Goes the Neighborhood", which won the Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

2005–2008: _Wildflower_

Her fifth studio album, _Wildflower_, was released in September 2005. Although the album debuted at No. 2 on the _Billboard_ charts, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as her previous albums. In December 2005, the album was nominated for a Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy, while Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for the first single _Good Is Good._ However, she ultimately lost in both categories to Kelly Clarkson. The album got a new boost in 2006 when the second single was announced as _Always on Your Side,_ re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced at Adult Top 40. The collaboration with Sting resulted in a Grammy-nomination for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals. As of January 2008, _Wildflower_ has sold 949,000 units in the United States.[43]

Her reported explanation was that, "Denim has become so high-priced as of late, my friends back home don't want to spend $250 for a pair of jeans. I want them to be able to walk into a medium-priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks."[50] The jeans are styled like the California hippie-style faded bootcut jeans that Crow prefers wearing.[51] Crow said that she owns dozens of pairs of jeans, wears jeans more during the summer than during the spring, and does "...almost everything in jeans except sleep."

Crow said, "This event is one of the most important events to happen at this moment in history. ...

The album has a classic Memphis soul vibe and features the lead single "Summer Day."[55] _100 Miles from Memphis_ (released July 20 on A&M Records), the distance from her hometown to the music mecca, is an ode to her formative memories of music – and one that the label hopes can inspire young music fans to investigate the landscape beyond processed pop and Auto-Tune.[56]

Later that year, she joined Loretta Lynn and country singer Miranda Lambert on an update of Lynn's song "Coal Miner's Daughter" for the 2010 album _Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn_. They later performed the song on the 44th Annual Country Music Awards in November.[57]

As the title suggests, the country-flavored tune defends the idea of a woman president. Mixed reviews from critics ranged from "sort of patronizing and gender essentialist" to "good-natured and well-intentioned." The song, praised for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, was commented on by country singer Brad Paisley, who characterized it as "all in good fun."[65] The song was later released for digital download on iTunes and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the American Red Cross to aid in the recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.[66]

Also in 2012, VH1 ranked Crow at No. 25 as one of the _100 Greatest Women in Music_.[67]

Crow's ninth studio album, _Be Myself_, was released on April 21, 2017.[79] It was co-produced by Crow, Jeff Trott and Tchad Blake, and is the first time the latter has appeared on one of Crow's studio albums since _The Globe Sessions_ in 1998. It has been described by Crow as a return to the sound of her nineties work, and intentionally eschews the country-influenced sound of her previous album. She has said that she did not enjoy the political promotion system utilized by country radio, saying: "You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that's just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain. I'm too old to allow that for myself, and to spend any night away from my kid for that is not justified."[80][81] An extensive tour is planned in support of the album, as is a six-day "Outlaws" tour in July 2017 headlined by Willie Nelson and including artists such as Bob Dylan, Jason Isbell, Margo Price and Hayes Carll among others.[82] In June 2018, Crow supported James Taylor on part of his American tour after original support Bonnie Raitt was forced to miss several shows due to health reasons.[83] She then embarked on a "Greatest Hits" tour in the UK, concluding with a set at the Isle of Wight Festival on June 24.[84]

This will feature vocals from Johnny Cash taken from his own cover of the song, which was released posthumously on his 2010 album _American VI: Ain't No Grave_.[85][86] While promoting her UK tour, Crow released "Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You" featuring St. Vincent and revealed that she intends for the duets project to be her final album, citing the impossibility of releasing something that could follow-up such a gathering of artists. She added that she will continue to write and tour and will potentially release short-form music akin to extended plays.[87][88] Crow announced the title for this final album, _Threads_, on May 22, 2019, alongside a new song "Live Wire" which features Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples. She also stated that the album would be released August 30.[89] The following week, Crow released another track, "Prove You Wrong" featuring Maren Morris and Stevie Nicks.[90]

On June 25, 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Sheryl Crow among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[91] Crow confirmed to BBC News that the master and safety back-ups for her first seven albums were lost in the fire, and said she was not informed of their destruction until she read the _Times_ report.[92]


Instruments and Signature Model guitars

Early in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 Gibson Country Western guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked Gibson to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a "Sheryl Crow" model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model.[93] In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition "Sheryl Crow Southern Jumbo", a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.[94]
