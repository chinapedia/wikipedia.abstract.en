_PHYLLIDIOPSIS XISHAENSIS_ is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Phyllidiidae.[1]

Frequently misidentified as _Phyllidiopsis striata_ but that species has been shown to be a completely different animal, a _Phyllidiella_.[2][3]


Distribution

This species was described from China. It has been reported from South Africa, Réunion, the Maldives, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.[4]


Description

This nudibranch has a blue-whiite dorsum with four longitudinal black lines interspersed with raised ridges. It is a small Phyllidiid, growing to about 20 mm in length. There are sometimes black spots in the region between the outer black lines and the edge of the mantle. The rhinophores are lemon coloured or white. It is similar to _Phyllidiopsis annae_ except for the colour of the rhinophores, which are black in that species. _Phyllidiopsis phiphiensis_ is also similar but has three instead of four longitudinal black lines on the mantle.[5]


Diet

This species feeds on a sponge.
