AUDIOCONFUSION is a recording studio in Mesa, Arizona. It was established 1996. The newest incarnation of the studio was built in 2006. It is owned and operated by Jalipaz Nelson. Audioconfusion is notable for its production and recording of various independent Phoenix bands,[1] especially the first four studio albums by AJJ (and the majority of all of their recorded output with the exception of their two most recent studio records). The studio's sound emphasizes natural reverb[2] and live recording methods.[3]


History

Originally from Pennsylvania, Jalipaz Nelson settled in Arizona at the premature culmination of a road trip when he was hindered from crossing the California border due to ferret regulations.[4] In 1995, Nelson attended an introductory recording program in Ohio prior to starting Audioconfusion in 1996. In 2004, he began The Audioconfusion Manifesto. In 2006, he constructed a new studio which measures 1000 ft².[5] He later partnered with Dan Somers, an early department head of Radio Phoenix.[6]

The Audioconfusion Manifesto was an independent record label and musical collective (the titular manifesto was non-existent). Bands in the Phoenix scene organized around recording at the newly constructed Audioconfusion studio. Participating bands included AJJ, Peachcake, and Asleep in the Sea.[7] The first studio album by AJJ, Candy Cigarettes & Cap Guns, was originally released by The Audioconfusion Manifesto and recorded at Audioconfusion,[8] prior to being re-released on Asian Man Records. In 2010, a similar collective and label outfit called Black Cactus Records was founded.[9][10] Both Nelson and Somers were founding members.[11]
