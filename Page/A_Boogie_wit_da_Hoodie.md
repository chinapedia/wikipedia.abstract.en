Early life

Artist Julius Dubose was born on December 6, 1995 in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City.[4] Dubose was raised in Highbridge and began rapping at age twelve after listening to Kanye West and 50 Cent.[5][6] He attended Eagle Academy, where he expanded upon rapping during his freshman year, performing in cyphers at lunchtime by performing rhymes he had already written and stored in a large notebook he carried with him.[7] Remarking on his time in high school to _XXL_, he said "I was regular, nobody really noticed me. I was the one in the back of the classroom, quiet."[8]

On his unconventional stage name, DuBose told _Newsweek_, "I used to watch _Paid in Full_ every day when I was like 12, 13, and then I started rapping and everybody would call me A Boogie [a character from the film]. And then the hoodie came along because I was wearing hoodies all the time. [People] started saying A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it stuck. The only other rap name [I would have considered] is Artist, and that’s my real name (Artist J. Dubose). After a while, everybody will know me as Artist."[9]

Growing up, Dubose frequently got into legal trouble, mainly for selling cannabis and narcotics,[10] after finding out when he was sixteen, Dubose's parents sent him to Florida as punishment. He graduated from high school at the Performance-based Preparatory Academy in Fort Pierce, Florida.[11]
