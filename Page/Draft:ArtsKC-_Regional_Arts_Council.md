ARTSKC- REGIONAL ARTS COUNCIL is a nonprofit serving the five counties surrounding Kansas City, Missouri, including Clay, Platte and Jackson in Missouri; and Johnson and Wyandotte in Kansas. ArtsKC is located at 106 Southwest Blvd, Kansas City, MO 64108, in the Crossroads Arts District.


History and Name

ArtsKC- Regional Arts Council was founded in February 1999 as the Metropolitan Arts Council of Greater Kansas City. It was started as a result of a community-wide planning process facilitated by the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation and supported by the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation. Kansas City is one of the largest regions in the United States that does not have an established source of dedicated public funding for the arts. Securing sustainable public funding for the arts is a long-term goal of ArtsKC. In 2007, ArtsKC started the ArtsKC Fund, a united arts fund. ArtsKC is the DBA of the Metropolitan Arts Council of Greater Kansas City. For further history, please refer to ArtsKCâ€™s Press Room.[1] [2]
