Lluís Brines' research about Francesc Eiximenis began with his doctoral dissertation, after getting his degree in Law in the University of Valencia. This task took him 4 years (1998–2002). The original title of this dissertation was _La filosofia política i jurídica de Francesc Eiximenis_ (Francesc Eiximenis' Political and Legal Philosophy). It analyzes Francesc Eiximenis' works and thought from a social, political, economic and only in some respect, in spite of the title, legal point of view. It deals specially with the theological Franciscan thought and its presence in Eiximenis' work. It deals as well with eschatological matters and prophetism. This doctoral dissertation was published, with some additions, in 2004, now with the title of _La Filosofia Social i Política de Francesc Eiximenis_ (Francesc Eiximenis' Social and Political Philosophy).[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] It was reprinted in the review _Estudios Franciscanos_ (Franciscan Studies) between 2006 and 2007 (with an enlargement of a short biography of Francesc Eiximenis).[8]

Later Dr. Brines wrote in 2009, owing to a grant that was given by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (Valencian Language Academy) a _Biografia documentada de Francesc Eiximenis_ (Francesc Eiximenis' documented biography).[9] The book was finally published in 2018.[10][11][12][13]

Also in 2009 he worked together with philologist Josep Palomero in an edition with modern language of Francesc Eiximenis' classical book _Regiment de la cosa pública_ (Government of the Republic).[14]

His last researches have deepened in the theological aspects of Eiximenis' thought, and the result of it is the article _Tendències de pensament franciscà en Francesc Eiximenis_ (Tendencies of Franciscan thought in Francesc Eiximenis), which was published in the EF in 2014.[15]

It is also remarkable in 2015 a little contribution for a collective tribute to the Swiss-Canadian Eiximenis researcher Curt Wittlin, whose title is "Eiximenis i la ciència" (Eiximenis and science).[16]

His last research line has been Ramon Llull's thought, specially the theological side of it within the Franciscan thought. Since year 2016 is the 800th anniversary of Llull's death, Brines has written the article whose title is _Tendències franciscanes en Ramon Llull_ (Ramon Llull's Franciscan tendencies), which has been published also in the EF in a special issue about this Majorcan author.[17]


Antiblavers project

Lluís Brines was the ideologist and creator of the website _antiblavers_, whose main aim was to fight in a scientific and serious way against Blaverism. Other collaborators took care of the informatic matters.

At the end of 2004 a group of people around the Valencian Community was very concerned about the fact that there were many Blaverist websites, such as www.elpalleter.com, www.valenciafreedom.com or www.llenguavalencianasi.com. Moreover, these websites were very aggressive and offered a biased point of view. So they had the aim of creating a serious and scientific tool in order to fight against Blaverism. This is the way that www.antiblavers.info was born in May 2005. In the beginning the website offered only information, with a part of research materials and a gallery of images. During its first year it achieved 35,000 visits.[18] After some time, in August 2006, a forum was added.[19]

One of the most important milestones of the website during its first years was the gathering of old and modern evidences of the flag with four red stripes in Valencian territory. This way in February 2010 there were already 2100 evidences that had been gathered.[20] In the research that lead to the report about the historicity of the flag with four red stripes in Valencian territory, the creators of this website had the personal advising of the prestigious Valencian heraldist Pere Maria Orts i Bosch.

At the end of 2010 the website creators suffered an outrageous attack campaign that was made by the Blaverists, who were very upset by the task of telling the historical truth and of fighting them that this website was doing. Maybe one thing that made Blaverists very upset was the success of the campaign that was done by the website _antiblavers_, in collaboration with the _antifeixistes_ website in order to avoid the presence of the GAV (Group of Valencianist Action) in the Christmas fair _Expojove_ during the Christmas of 2010. As they acknowledged themselves, _Expojove_ was the main attraction point for new members of the GAV.[21]

As a result of these immoderate attacks, in 2011 Lluís Brines ceased to be the main administrator of the website, and other people began to do this task, even though he collaborated from time to time. Moreover, the project was divided into two websites:

-   antiblavers.org – The main website, that has most of the information and a debate forum.
-   antiblavers.info – It was the first name of the website, before the project was divided into two websites. Nowadays it is a blog, whose content is varied and dynamic.[22]


Blaverist threats and attacks

The first important Blaverist attack against Lluís Brines took place in December 2010, when in his old address in Valencia some graffitis appeared with his name and surname and the words "paederast" and "paedophile". These insults against him were constantly repeated in the website _www.valenciafreedom.com_, which is linked with the GAV. Theses graffitis were made allegedly by the former co-president of the Youths of the GAV (JJGAV) Aitor Alan Marquina Bañuls.[23]

A bit later, in January 2011, other graffitis appeared in Simat de la Valldigna (Safor), the village of Brines' paternal family, where he was also called "paederast" and "paedophile". Several witnesses of the village identified the GAV activist from Gandía Francisco Albiñana Barber as the author of such graffitis.[24]

Finally, in November 2012 another graffiti appeared in the address of Valencia that was used by Lluís Brines as the address for court notifications. This graffiti consisted in Brines' name and surnames, a bull's eye and it was signed by the anagram 71, which is the one that the GAV uses (7 is the place of letter G inside the alphabet, and 1 is the place of letter A).[25]

The three graffitis were denounced by Lluís Brines, but this kind of graffitis are seldom (or never) investigated in Spain, and these three matters were filed by the legal authorities.

Furthermore, in the Blaverist and far-right website _valenciafreedom_ there is a permanent thread, allegedly opened by the above mentioned Francisco Albiñana Barber (who uses the pseudonyms of _paco1983_ and _nandivirus_ in that website), where Lluís Brines receives all kinds of insults and slanders.[26]
