JENNATA () is a local authority in Southern Lebanon, located in Tyre District, Governorate of South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer, the name comes from _Jennat_, garden.[1]


History

In 1875, Victor Guérin found the village, (which he called _Djennateh_), to have 60 Metawileh inhabitants.[2] He further noted: "The village contains a number of ruined houses. A little mosque is partly built of ancient materials."[3]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A small village of stone and mud, containing about 100 Moslems. […] It lies low, on arable land. The water is supplied by two wells in the village."[4]
