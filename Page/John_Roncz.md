JOHN GREGORY RONCZ (born 1948) is an inventor, businessman, computer expert, book author, and aerodynamicist.


Biography

Roncz was born in Indiana. A musical prodigy, he had mastered the violin by age 5, and was competing in international piano competitions by age 11. His first 8 years of schooling were in a Catholic school. He then joined a tiny private high school (seminary) on the University of Notre Dame campus, where he learned Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. By his graduation from college, Roncz was proficient in several languages. "I have a funny talent for languages." (A&S December 1990) He earned a bachelor's degree in Government & International Studies, and then worked as a carpenter in a mobile home plant. He briefly pursued a career in abstract painting, then started Gemini Sales, supplying steel to the metal-stamping industry.


Aeronautics career

During his college study, Roncz attempted to study the seminal airfoil-section reference book _Theory of Wing Sections_ (1949) by Ira Abbbott and Albert Von Doenhoff. He had long been interested in airplanes, and realized the formulas in that book would allow him to improve the design of airfoil sections. However, their complexity deterred him until 1975, when he purchased and assembled a Heathkit H-8 computer kit. He quickly realized this radical new invention could be used to manipulate the airfoil equations, and immersed himself in the world of computational fluid dynamics.

Roncz was particularly interested in the world of laminar flow, that elusive concept which promises greatly reduced drag if it could be achieved and maintained in a practical operational situation. Of his own volition, he analyzed the canard airfoils of Burt Rutan's homebuilt airplane design, the Long-EZ. He was not acquainted with Rutan, but he sent his analysis to the then-famous airplane designer. Rutan verified the analysis with an airfoil specialist at Rockwell International, then contacted Roncz. The two have since collaborated on some 20 designs, 17 of which have been constructed.

While pursuing his early business interests after college, Roncz learned to fly, and bought his first airplane (Rockwell 112A), and maintained a part-time career as a cargo pilot in twin-engine Navajo propeller aircraft.

Roncz's first public collaboration with Rutan was the Solitaire sailplane. Possibly his best known contribution to Rutan's designs is his involvement in the Rutan Voyager, the very light and very efficient twin-engine craft which flew nonstop/non-refueled around the world. Worried about the effects of rain or insects on the canard, he funded a wind tunnel model, which was tested at The Ohio State University Aeronautical and Astronautical Research Laboratory in their 3 by 5 foot wind tunnel. With Roncz running the computer data system, and Dick Rutan running the wind tunnel, they created vortex generator designs which would protect the canard wing in any weather. He also designed the propellers for both the front and rear engines, increasing their efficiency by 4%. He designed all the airfoil surfaces to control contamination by drag increasing bug-spattering. The airflow approaching the airfoil would direct heavier insects along the stagnation point, and smaller insects to go above the wing. Post-flight examination found only 3 insect carcasses splattered on the Voyager's wings.

Roncz's computations were used extensively in the Beech Starship, Scaled Composites Triumph, intended for Beechcraft as the first light jet powered by the Williams FJ-44 engine, and many other Rutan designs. However, Beechcraft's deteriorating financial situation in the 1990s doomed the concept, and only the first Triumph prototype was built. He joined lead engineer Jon Karkow on the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer program, doing the wing aerodynamic design and predicting performance. Steve Fossett flew solo around the world in 2005 with this aircraft. Roncz designed a three-surface aircraft called the Eagle X-TS. It has outstanding handling qualities and was produced in Australia and also in Malaysia. Later he modified the airplane to use a Continental IO-240 engine, and took charge of certifying that airplane, the Eagle 150B, in the USA. He also worked on the Explorer, a large cargo airplane built in Australia, which is faster than the Cessna Caravan. The Genesis glider was his first flying wing design. Several of his UAV designs are being produced in Israel, and are in use by US military forces. He worked with Jon Karkow at Icon Aircraft to develop the spin-resistant wing on the A5. He is now working on a new clean sheet design for Windecker Aircraft Company, a pressurized airplane with turbine or diesel power.

Roncz has contributed to the design of 53 aircraft to date. He has also designed sixteen propellers and wind turbines. He designed the radical wing-sailed catamaran used in the 1988 America's Cup yacht competition. He also contributed to the improved design of a WSC race car for Riley & Scott.


Honors and recognitions

Roncz has been profiled in Smithsonian's _Air & Space_ magazine. He contributed 12 articles to the Experimental Aircraft Association's _Sport Aviation_ magazine. He has presented lectures at 8 universities. He was honored as an "Old Master" by Purdue University. He has received the Stanley Dzik memorial trophy, the Honor Roll of Professional Pilot magazine, the Medal of Achievement from Sailing World magazine, the Professor August Raspet award, and the Milwaukee School of Engineering Gold Medal. John served as a “Distinguished Lecturer” for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In November 2000 he was honored by His Royal Highness Prince Philip at a ceremony in London, where he was presented with the Prince’s Australian Medal for the design of the Eagle.

He has received at least one patent for his design work.
