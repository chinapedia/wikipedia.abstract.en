Non-profit and political work

Controversy

In 2011, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. did not reappoint Savage, then a New York State Democratic Committeeman for the 76th Assembly District, to local Community Board #9 in the Soundview area of the Bronx, due to the fact that Savage helped Charlie Ramos (a candidate for senate) in the 2011 September primary elections against Ruben Diaz Jr's father, New York state Sen. Rubén Díaz Sr.[24]

In 2016, Savage reported that Afrika Bambaataa molested him at the age of 15 in 1980.[25] Former Hot 97 host of the _Star & Buck-wild Show_ in New York City broke the story on the Shot 97 internet radio show. On April 9, the exclusive story appeared in the _New York Daily News_.[26] The Universal Zulu Nation apologized to Savage, after three more men came forth with accounts of being abused by Bambaataa after the story was published. Savage has also fought to help change the statute of limitations laws in New York State against child molesters.[27][28]

Savage was featured on the 2016 single "Don't Close Your Eyes" produced by Jonathan Hay, where he spoke over Bambaataa's song "Planet Rock" which was replayed in the track. Savage speaks out about child molestation and issues a very bold challenge to the President of the United States, stating, “Children are being molested every day. I was molested by a world Hip-Hop icon,” states Savage. “My question is to the President of the United States of America: what are you going to do about the child molestation crisis of America?”.[29] Savage also stated in an interview in London, "I don’t recognize the term hip hop Culture because that is a term Bambaataa coined and I don’t know what his intention was when he coined the term, but what I do recognize is hip hop and I salute the rebirth of the hip hop movement".[30]
