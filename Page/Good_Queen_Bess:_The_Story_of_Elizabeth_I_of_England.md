Reception

_Booklist_ wrote "This biography of Queen Elizabeth I does an excellent job of describing the context of her life so that reasons for many of her actions become clear. The resulting depth is a pleasant surprise and will give the book a wide audience."[1] while the _School Library Journal_ wrote "Although the format suggests a picture-book audience, this biography needs to be introduced to older readers who have the background to appreciate and understand this woman who dominated and named an age.."[2]

_Kirkus Reviews_ called _Good Queen Bess_ "An admirably clear, attractive summary."[3] _Publishers Weekly_ wrote "The authors .. vivify another colorful character"[4]
