Other early matches were wrestled for Northeast Wrestling in CT (his home promotion in which he debuted April 18, 2015 in a match against Frankie Arion), Xtreme Wrestling Alliance in West Warwick, RI and Pioneer Valley Pro Wrestling in Hadley, MA.

Ring of Honor (2016–present)

TK made his Ring of Honor debut on October 1, 2016 in Lowell, MA as a part of The Kingdom (with Matt Taven and Vinny Marseglia). They defeated The Bullet Club (Adam Cole and The Young Bucks).[1][2]

On December 2, 2016, The Kingdom became the first-ever ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions by defeating Kushida, Lio Rush & Jay White.[3]

O'Ryan was injured on March 10, 2017, during the ROH 15th Anniversary Show when he jumped too far on an Asai Moonsault and broke his leg on a guard rail. The following day, Silas Young replaced O'Ryan in a match, where The Kingdom lost the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship to Bully Ray and The Briscoes.[4]

On May 9, 2018 at ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds Tour, The Kingdom would regain the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship by defeating SoCal Uncensored.
