'' (1935)]] MUSICAL FILM is a film genre in which songs sung by the characters are interwoven into the narrative, sometimes accompanied by dancing.

The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film's characters, but in some cases, they serve merely as breaks in the storyline, often as elaborate "production numbers."

The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology. Typically, the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater. Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching. In a sense, the viewer becomes the diegetic audience, as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it.


Hollywood musical films

is considered one of the greatest movies of all time.]]

The classical sound era

The 1930s through the early 1950s are considered to be the golden age of the musical film, when the genre's popularity was at its highest in the Western world. Disney's _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_, the earliest Disney animated feature film, was a musical which won an honorary Oscar for Walt Disney at the 11th Academy Awards.

The first musicals

Musical short films were made by Lee de Forest in 1923â€“24. Beginning in 1926, thousands of Vitaphone shorts were made, many featuring bands, vocalists, and dancers. The earliest feature-length films with synchronized sound had only a soundtrack of music and occasional sound effects that played while the actors portrayed their characters just as they did in silent films: without audible dialogue.[1] _The Jazz Singer_, released in 1927 by Warner Brothers, was the first to include an audio track including non-diegetic music and diegetic music, but it had only a short sequence of spoken dialogue. This feature-length film was also a musical, featuring Al Jolson singing "Dirty Hands, Dirty Face", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie", "Blue Skies", and "My Mammy". Historian Scott Eyman wrote, "As the film ended and applause grew with the houselights, Sam Goldwyn's wife Frances looked around at the celebrities in the crowd. She saw 'terror in all their faces', she said, as if they knew that 'the game they had been playing for years was finally over'."[2] Still, only isolated sequences featured "live" sound; most of the film had only a synchronous musical score.[3] In 1928, Warner Brothers followed this up with another Jolson part-talkie, _The Singing Fool_, which was a blockbuster hit.[4] Theaters scrambled to install the new sound equipment and to hire Broadway composers to write musicals for the screen.[5] The first all-talking feature, _Lights of New York_, included a musical sequence in a night club. The enthusiasm of audiences was so great that in less than a year all the major studios were making sound pictures exclusively. _The Broadway Melody_ (1929) had a show-biz plot about two sisters competing for a charming song-and-dance man. Advertised by MGM as the first "All-Talking, All-Singing, All-Dancing" feature film, it was a hit and won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1929. There was a rush by the studios to hire talent from the stage to star in lavishly filmed versions of Broadway hits. _The Love Parade_ (Paramount 1929) starred Maurice Chevalier and newcomer Jeanette MacDonald, written by Broadway veteran Guy Bolton.[6]

Warner Brothers produced the first screen operetta, _The Desert Song_ in 1929. They spared no expense and photographed a large percentage of the film in Technicolor. This was followed by the first all-color, all-talking musical feature which was entitled _On with the Show_ (1929). The most popular film of 1929 was the second all-color, all-talking feature which was entitled _Gold Diggers of Broadway_ (1929). This film broke all box office records and remained the highest-grossing film ever produced until 1939. Suddenly, the market became flooded with musicals, revues, and operettas. The following all-color musicals were produced in 1929 and 1930 alone: _The Show of Shows_ (1929), _Sally_ (1929), _The Vagabond King_ (1930), _Follow Thru_ (1930), _Bright Lights_ (1930), _Golden Dawn_ (1930), _Hold Everything_ (1930), _The Rogue Song_ (1930), _Song of the Flame_ (1930), _Song of the West_ (1930), _Sweet Kitty Bellairs_ (1930), _Under a Texas Moon_ (1930), _Bride of the Regiment_ (1930), _Whoopee!_ (1930), _King of Jazz_ (1930), _Viennese Nights_ (1930), and _Kiss Me Again_ (1930). In addition, there were scores of musical features released with color sequences.

Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931.[7] By late 1930, audiences had been oversaturated with musicals and studios were forced to cut the music from films that were then being released. For example, _Life of the Party_ (1930) was originally produced as an all-color, all-talking musical comedy. Before it was released, however, the songs were cut out. The same thing happened to _Fifty Million Frenchmen_ (1931) and _Manhattan Parade_ (1932) both of which had been filmed entirely in Technicolor. Marlene Dietrich sang songs successfully in her films, and Rodgers and Hart wrote a few well-received films, but even their popularity waned by 1932.[8] The public had quickly come to associate color with musicals and thus the decline in their popularity also resulted in a decline in color productions.

Busby Berkeley

The taste in musicals revived again in 1933 when director Busby Berkeley began to enhance the traditional dance number with ideas drawn from the drill precision he had experienced as a soldier during World War I. In films such as _42nd Street_ and _Gold Diggers of 1933_ (1933), Berkeley choreographed a number of films in his unique style. Berkeley's numbers typically begin on a stage but gradually transcend the limitations of theatrical space: his ingenious routines, involving human bodies forming patterns like a kaleidoscope, could never fit onto a real stage and the intended perspective is viewing from straight above.[9]

Musical stars

Musical stars such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were among the most popular and highly respected personalities in Hollywood during the classical era; the Fred and Ginger pairing was particularly successful, resulting in a number of classic films, such as _Top Hat_ (1935), _Swing Time_ (1936), and _Shall We Dance_ (1937). Many dramatic actors gladly participated in musicals as a way to break away from their typecasting. For instance, the multi-talented James Cagney had originally risen to fame as a stage singer and dancer, but his repeated casting in "tough guy" roles and mob films gave him few chances to display these talents. Cagney's Oscar-winning role in _Yankee Doodle Dandy_ (1942) allowed him to sing and dance, and he considered it to be one of his finest moments.

Many comedies (and a few dramas) included their own musical numbers. The Marx Brothers' films included a musical number in nearly every film, allowing the Brothers to highlight their musical talents. Their final film, entitled _Love Happy_ (1949), featured Vera-Ellen, considered to be the best dancer among her colleagues and professionals in the half century.

Similarly, The vaudevillian comedian W. C. Fields joined forces with the comic actress Martha Raye and the young comedian Bob Hope in Paramount Pictures musical anthology _The Big Broadcast of 1938_. The film also showcased the talents of several internationally recognized musical artists including: Kirsten Flagstad (Norwegian operatic soprano), Wilfred Pelletier (Canadian conductor of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Tito Guizar (Mexican tenor), Shep Fields conducting his Ripppling Rhythm Jazz Orchestra and John Serry Sr. (Italian-American concert accordionist).[10] In addition to the Academy Award for Best Original Song (1938), the film earned an ASCAP Film and Television Award (1989) for Bob Hope's signature song "Thanks for the Memory".[11]

The Freed Unit

'', a musical movie from 1956]]During the late 1940s and into the early 1950s, a production unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer headed by Arthur Freed made the transition from old-fashioned musical films, whose formula had become repetitive, to something new. (However, they also produced Technicolor remakes of such musicals as _Show Boat_, which had previously been filmed in the 1930s.) In 1939, Freed was hired as associate producer for the film _Babes in Arms_. Starting in 1944 with _Meet Me in St. Louis_, the Freed Unit worked somewhat independently of its own studio to produce some of the most popular and well-known examples of the genre. The products of this unit include _Easter Parade_ (1948), _On the Town_ (1949), _An American in Paris_ (1951), _Singin' in the Rain_ (1952), _The Band Wagon_ (1953) and _Gigi_ (1958). Non-Freed musicals from the studio included _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers_ in 1954 and _High Society_ in 1956, and the studio distributed Samuel Goldwyn's _Guys and Dolls_ in 1955.

This era saw musical stars become household names, including Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Mickey Rooney, Vera-Ellen, Jane Powell, Howard Keel, and Kathryn Grayson. Fred Astaire was also coaxed out of retirement for _Easter Parade_ and made a permanent comeback.

Outside MGM

The other Hollywood studios proved themselves equally adept at tackling the genre at this time, particularly in the 1950s. Four adaptations of Rodgers and Hammerstein shows - _Oklahoma!_, _The King and I_, _Carousel_, and _South Pacific_ - were all successes, while Paramount Pictures released _White Christmas_ and _Funny Face_, two films which used previously written music by Irving Berlin and the Gershwins, respectively. Warner Bros. produced _Calamity Jane_ and _A Star Is Born_; the former film was a vehicle for Doris Day, while the latter provided a big-screen comeback for Judy Garland, who had been out of the spotlight since 1950. Meanwhile, director Otto Preminger, better known for controversial "message pictures", made _Carmen Jones_ and _Porgy and Bess_, both starring Dorothy Dandridge, who is considered the first African American A-list film star. Celebrated director Howard Hawks also ventured into the genre with _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_.

The post-classical era

In the 1960s, 1970s, and continuing up to today, the musical film became less of a bankable genre that could be relied upon for sure-fire hits. Audiences for them lessened and fewer musical films were produced as the genre became less mainstream and more specialized.

The 1960s musical

In the 1960s, the critical and box-office success of the films _West Side Story_, _Gypsy_, _The Music Man_, _Bye Bye Birdie_, _My Fair Lady_, _Mary Poppins_, _The Sound of Music_, _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_, _The Jungle Book_, _Thoroughly Modern Millie_, _Oliver!_, and _Funny Girl_ suggested that the traditional musical was in good health, while French filmmaker Jacques Demy's jazz musicals _The Umbrellas of Cherbourg_ and _The Young Girls of Rochefort_ were popular with international critics. However popular musical tastes were being heavily affected by rock and roll and the freedom and youth associated with it, and indeed Elvis Presley made a few films that have been equated with the old musicals in terms of form, though _A Hard Day's Night_ and _Help!_, starring the Beatles, were more technically audacious. Most of the musical films of the 1950s and 1960s such as _Oklahoma!_ and _The Sound of Music_ were straightforward adaptations or restagings of successful stage productions. The most successful musicals of the 1960s created specifically for film were _Mary Poppins_ and _The Jungle Book_, two of Disney's biggest hits of all time.

The phenomenal box-office performance of _The Sound of Music_ gave the major Hollywood studios more confidence to produce lengthy, large-budget musicals. Despite the resounding success of some of these films, Hollywood also produced a large number of musical flops in the late 1960s and early 1970s which appeared to seriously misjudge public taste. The commercially and/or critically unsuccessful films included _Camelot_, _Finian's Rainbow_, _Hello Dolly!_, _Sweet Charity_, _Doctor Dolittle_, _Star!_, _Darling Lili_, _Goodbye, Mr. Chips_, _Paint Your Wagon_, _Song of Norway_, _On a Clear Day You Can See Forever_, _Man of La Mancha_, _Lost Horizon_, and _Mame_. Collectively and individually these failures crippled several of the major studios.

1970s

In the 1970s, film culture and the changing demographics of filmgoers placed greater emphasis on gritty realism, while the pure entertainment and theatricality of classical-era Hollywood musicals was seen as old-fashioned. Despite this, _Fiddler on the Roof_ and _Cabaret_ were more traditional musicals closely adapted from stage shows and were strong successes with critics and audiences. Changing cultural mores and the abandonment of the Hays Code in 1968 also contributed to changing tastes in film audiences. The 1973 film of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's _Jesus Christ Superstar_ was met with some criticism by religious groups but was well received. By the mid-1970s, filmmakers avoided the genre in favor of using music by popular rock or pop bands as background music, partly in hope of selling a soundtrack album to fans. _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ was originally released in 1975 and was a critical failure until it started midnight screenings in the 1980s where it achieved cult status. 1976 saw the release of the low-budget comic musical, _The First Nudie Musical_, released by Paramount. The 1978 film version of _Grease_ was a smash hit; its songs were original compositions done in a 1950s pop style. However, the sequel _Grease 2_ (released in 1982) bombed at the box-office. Films about performers which incorporated gritty drama and musical numbers interwoven as a diegetic part of the storyline were produced, such as _Lady Sings the Blues_, _All That Jazz_, and _New York, New York_. Some musicals made in Britain experimented with the form, such as Richard Attenborough's _Oh! What a Lovely War_ (released in 1969), Alan Parker's _Bugsy Malone_ and Ken Russell's _Tommy_ and _Lisztomania_.

A number of film musicals were still being made that were financially and/or critically less successful than in the musical's heyday. They include _1776_, _The Wiz_, _At Long Last Love_, _Mame_, _Man of La Mancha_, _Lost Horizon_,'' Godspell'', _Phantom of the Paradise_, _Funny Lady_ (Barbra Streisand's sequel to _Funny Girl_), _A Little Night Music_, and _Hair_ amongst others. The critical wrath against _At Long Last Love_, in particular, was so strong that it was never released on home video. Fantasy musical films _Scrooge_, _The Blue Bird_, _The Little Prince_, _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_, _Pete's Dragon_, and Disney's _Bedknobs and Broomsticks_ were also released in the 1970s, the latter winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

1980s to 1990s

By the 1980s, financiers grew increasingly confident in the musical genre, partly buoyed by the relative health of the musical on Broadway and London's West End. Productions of the 1980s and 1990s included _The Apple_, _Xanadu_, _The Blues Brothers_, _Annie_, _Monty Python's The Meaning of Life_, _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas_, _Victor Victoria_, _Footloose_, _Fast Forward_, _A Chorus Line_, _Little Shop of Horrors_, _Forbidden Zone_, _Absolute Beginners_, _Labyrinth_, _Evita_, and _Everyone Says I Love You_. However, _Can't Stop the Music_, starring the Village People, was a calamitous attempt to resurrect the old-style musical and was released to audience indifference in 1980. _Little Shop of Horrors_ was based on an off-Broadway musical adaptation of a 1960 Roger Corman film, a precursor of later film-to-stage-to-film adaptations, including _The Producers_.

Many animated films of the period â€“ predominately from Disney â€“ included traditional musical numbers. Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Stephen Schwartz had previous musical theater experience and wrote songs for animated films during this time, supplanting Disney workhorses the Sherman Brothers. Starting with 1989's _The Little Mermaid_, the Disney Renaissance gave new life to the musical film. Other successful animated musicals included _Aladdin_, _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, and _Pocahontas_ from Disney proper, _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ from Disney division Touchstone Pictures, _The Prince of Egypt_ from DreamWorks, _Anastasia_ from Fox and Don Bluth, and _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_ from Paramount. (_Beauty and the Beast_ and _The Lion King_ were adapted for the stage after their blockbuster success.)

21st-century musicals

In the 21st century, movie musicals were reborn with darker musicals, musical biopics, epic drama musicals and comedy-drama musicals such as _Moulin Rouge!_, _Chicago_, _Walk the Line_, _Dreamgirls_, _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, _Les MisÃ©rables_, and _La La Land_; all of which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture â€“ Musical or Comedy in their respective years, while such films as _The Phantom of the Opera_, _Hairspray_, _Mamma Mia!_, _Nine_, _Into the Woods_, _The Greatest Showman_, and _Mary Poppins Returns_ were only nominated. _Chicago_ was also the first musical since _Oliver!_ to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

Joshua Oppenheimer's Academy Award-nominated documentary _The Act of Killing_ may be considered a nonfiction musical.[12]

One specific musical trend was the rising number of jukebox musicals based on music from various pop/rock artists on the big screen, some of which based on Broadway shows. Examples of Broadway-based jukebox musical films included _Mamma Mia!_ (ABBA), _Rock of Ages_, and _Sunshine on Leith_ (The Proclaimers). Original ones included _Across the Universe_ (The Beatles), _Moulin Rouge!_ (various pop hits), _Idlewild_ (Outkast) and _Yesterday_ (The Beatles).

Disney also returned to musicals with _Enchanted_, _The Princess and the Frog_, _Tangled_, _Winnie the Pooh_, _The Muppets_, _Frozen_, _Muppets Most Wanted_, _Into the Woods_, _Moana_, and _Mary Poppins Returns_. Following a string of successes with live action fantasy adaptations of several of their animated features, Disney produced a live action version of _Beauty and the Beast_, the first of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical, and features new songs as well as new lyrics to both the Gaston number and the reprise of the title song. The second film of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical was _Aladdin_ and features new songs. T he third film of this live action fantasy adaptation pack to be an all-out musical was â€˜â€™The Lion Kingâ€™â€™ and features new songs. Pixar also produced _Coco_, the very first computer-animated musical film by the company.

Other animated musical films include _Rio_, _Trolls_, _Sing_, _Smallfoot_ and _UglyDolls_.

Biopics about music artists and showmen were also big in the 21st century. Examples include _8 Mile_ (Eminem), _Ray_ (Ray Charles), _Walk the Line_ (Johnny Cash and June Carter), _La Vie en Rose_ (Ã‰dith Piaf), _Notorious_ (Biggie Smalls), _Jersey Boys_ (The Four Seasons) _Love & Mercy_ (Brian Wilson), _CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story_ (TLC), _Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B_ (Aaliyah), _Get on Up_ (James Brown), _Whitney_ (Whitney Houston), _Straight Outta Compton_ (N.W.A), _The Greatest Showman_ (P. T. Barnum), _Bohemian Rhapsody_ (Freddie Mercury), _The Dirt_ (MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e) and _Rocketman_ (Elton John).

Director Damien Chazelle created a musical film called _La La Land_, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It was meant to reintroduce the traditional jazz style of song numbers with influences from the Golden Age of Hollywood and Jacques Demy's French musicals while incorporating a contemporary/modern take on the story and characters with balances in fantasy numbers and grounded reality. It received 14 nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, tying the record for most nominations with _All About Eve_ (1950) and _Titanic_ (1997), and won the awards for Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Production Design.


Indian musical films

dances usually follow or are choreographed to _filmi_ Bollywood songs.]] An exception to the decline of the musical film is Indian cinema, especially the Bollywood film industry based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), where the majority of films have been and still are musicals. The majority of films produced in the Tamil industry based in Chennai (formerly Madras), Sandalwood based in Bangalore, Telugu industry based in Hyderabad, and Malayalam industry are also musicals.

Early sound films (1930sâ€“1940s)

'' (1936)]]

Bollywood musicals have their roots in the traditional musical theatre of India, such as classical Indian musical theatre, Sanskrit drama, and Parsi theatre. Early Bombay filmmakers combined these Indian musical theatre traditions with the musical film format that emerged from early Hollywood sound films.[13] Other early influences on Bombay filmmakers included Urdu literature and the _Arabian Nights_.[14]

The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani's _Alam Ara_ (1931), was a major commercial success.[15] There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming.

In 1937, Ardeshir Irani, of _Alam Ara_ fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, _Kisan Kanya_. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of _Mother India_. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

Golden Age (late 1940sâ€“1960s)

, Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar in _Andaz_ (1949). Kapoor and Kumar are among the greatest and most influential movie stars in the history of Indian cinema,[16][17] while Nargis is one of its greatest actresses.[18]]]

Following India's independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the "Golden Age" of Hindi cinema.[19][20][21] Some of the most critically acclaimed Hindi films of all time were produced during this period. Examples include _Pyaasa_ (1957) and _Kaagaz Ke Phool_ (1959) directed by Guru Dutt and written by Abrar Alvi, _Awaara_ (1951) and _Shree 420_ (1955) directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and _Aan_ (1952) directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Dilip Kumar. These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class life in India, particularly urban life in the former two examples; _Awaara_ presented the city as both a nightmare and a dream, while _Pyaasa_ critiqued the unreality of city life.[22]

Mehboob Khan's _Mother India_ (1957), a remake of his earlier _Aurat_ (1940), was the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it lost by a single vote.[23] _Mother India_ was also an important film that defined the conventions of Hindi cinema for decades.[24][25][26]

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the industry was dominated by musical romance films with "romantic hero" leads, the most popular being Rajesh Khanna.[27] Other actors during this period include Shammi Kapoor, Jeetendra, Sanjeev Kumar, and Shashi Kapoor, and actresses like Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Saira Banu, Helen and Asha Parekh.

Classic Bollywood (1970sâ€“1980s)

By the start of the 1970s, Hindi cinema was experiencing thematic stagnation,[28] dominated by musical romance films.[29] The arrival of screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, marked a paradigm shift, revitalizing the industry.[30] They began the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films in the early 1970s, with films such as _Zanjeer_ (1973) and _Deewaar_ (1975).[31][32]

The 1970s was also when the name "Bollywood" was coined,[33][34] and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established.[35] Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain,[36] along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed,[37] pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.[38] _Yaadon Ki Baarat_ (1973), directed by Hussain and written by Salim-Javed, has been identified as the first masala film and the "first" quintessentially "Bollywood" film.[39][40] Salim-Javed went on to write more successful masala films in the 1970s and 1980s.[41] Masala films launched Amitabh Bachchan into the biggest Bollywood movie star of the 1970s and 1980s. A landmark for the masala film genre was _Amar Akbar Anthony_ (1977),[42][43] directed by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan. Manmohan Desai went on to successfully exploit the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.

Along with Bachchan, other popular actors of this era included Feroz Khan,[44] Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol. Actresses from this era included Hema Malini, Jaya Bachchan, Raakhee, Shabana Azmi, Zeenat Aman, Parveen Babi, Rekha, Dimple Kapadia, Smita Patil, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapure.[45]

New Bollywood (1990sâ€“present)

In the late 1980s, Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation, with a decline in box office turnout, due to increasing violence, decline in musical melodic quality, and rise in video piracy, leading to middle-class family audiences abandoning theaters. The turning point came with _Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak_ (1988), directed by Mansoor Khan, written and produced by his father Nasir Hussain, and starring his cousin Aamir Khan with Juhi Chawla. Its blend of youthfulness, wholesome entertainment, emotional quotients and strong melodies lured family audiences back to the big screen.[46][47] It set a new template for Bollywood musical romance films that defined Hindi cinema in the 1990s.[48]

The period of Hindi cinema from the 1990s onwards is referred to as "New Bollywood" cinema,[49] linked to economic liberalisation in India during the early 1990s.[50] By the early 1990s, the pendulum had swung back toward family-centric romantic musicals. _Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak_ was followed by blockbusters such as _Maine Pyar Kiya_ (1989), _Chandni_ (1989), _Hum Aapke Hain Kaun_ (1994), _Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge_ (1995), _Raja Hindustani_ (1996), _Dil To Pagal Hai_ (1997), _Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha_ (1998) and _Kuch Kuch Hota Hai_ (1998). A new generation of popular actors emerged, such as Aamir Khan, Aditya Pancholi, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan (Salim Khan's son), and Shahrukh Khan, and actresses such as Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi, Juhi Chawla, Meenakshi Seshadri, Manisha Koirala, Kajol, and Karisma Kapoor.[51]

Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the "Three Khans": Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Salman Khan.[52][53] Combined, they have starred in most of the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films. The three Khans have had successful careers since the late 1980s,[54] and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s,[55] across three decades.[56]

Influence on Western films (2000sâ€“present)

In the 2000s, Bollywood musicals played an instrumental role in the revival of the musical film genre in the Western world.[57] Baz Luhrmann stated that his successful musical film _Moulin Rouge!_ (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals.[58] The film thus pays homage to India, incorporating an Indian-themed play based on the ancient Sanskrit drama _The Little Clay Cart_ and a Bollywood-style dance sequence with a song from the film _China Gate_. The critical and financial success of _Moulin Rouge!_ renewed interest in the then-moribund Western musical genre, and subsequently films such as _Chicago_, _The Producers_, _Rent_, _Dreamgirls_, _Hairspray_, _Sweeney Todd_, _Across the Universe_, _The Phantom of the Opera_, _Enchanted_ and _Mamma Mia!_ were produced, fuelling a renaissance of the genre.[59][60]

_The Guru_ and _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_ also feature Indian-style song-and-dance sequences; the Bollywood musical _Lagaan_ (2001) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; two other Bollywood films _Devdas_ (2002) and _Rang De Basanti_ (2006) were nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language; and Danny Boyle's Academy Award winning _Slumdog Millionaire_ (2008) also features a Bollywood-style song-and-dance number during the film's end credits.


Spanish musical films

Spain has a history and tradition of musical films that were made independent of Hollywood influence. The first films arise during the Second Spanish Republic of the 1930s and the advent of sound films. A few zarzuelas (Spanish operetta) were even adapted as screenplays during the silent era. The beginnings of the Spanish musical were focused on romantic Spanish archetypes: Andalusian villages and landscapes, gypsys, "bandoleros", and copla and other popular folk songs included in story development. These films had even more box-office success than Hollywood premieres in Spain. The first Spanish film stars came from the musical genre: Imperio Argentina, Estrellita Castro, FloriÃ¡n Rey (director) and, later, Lola Flores, Sara Montiel and Carmen Sevilla. The Spanish musical started to expand and grow. Juvenile stars appear and top the box-office. Marisol, Joselito, Pili & Mili, and RocÃ­o DÃºrcal were the major figures of musical films from 1960s to 1970s. Due to Spanish transition to democracy and the rise of "Movida culture", the musical genre fell in production and box-office, only saved by Carlos Saura and his flamenco musical films.


Soviet musical film under Stalin

Unlike the musical films of Hollywood and Bollywood, popularly identified with escapism, the Soviet musical was first and foremost a form of propaganda. Vladimir Lenin said that cinema was "the most important of the arts." His successor, Joseph Stalin, also recognized the power of cinema in efficiently spreading Communist Party doctrine. Films were widely popular in the 1920s, but it was foreign cinema that dominated the Soviet filmgoing market. Films from Germany and the U.S. proved more entertaining than Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's historical dramas.[61] By the 1930s it was clear that if the Soviet cinema was to compete with its Western counterparts, it would have to give audiences what they wanted: the glamour and fantasy they got from Hollywood.[62] The musical film, which emerged at that time, embodied the ideal combination of entertainment and official ideology.

A struggle between laughter for laughter's sake and entertainment with a clear ideological message would define the golden age of the Soviet musical of the 1930s and 1940s. Then-head of the film industry Boris Shumyatsky sought to emulate Hollywood's conveyor belt method of production, going so far as to suggest the establishment of a Soviet Hollywood.[63]

_The Jolly Fellows_

In 1930, the esteemed Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein went to the United States with fellow director Grigori Aleksandrov to study Hollywood's filmmaking process. The American films greatly impacted Aleksandrov, particularly the musicals.[64] He returned in 1932, and in 1934 directed _The Jolly Fellows_, the first Soviet musical. The film was light on plot and focused more on the comedy and musical numbers. Party officials at first met the film with great hostility. Aleksandrov defended his work by arguing the notion of laughter for laughter's sake.[65] Finally, when Aleksandrov showed the film to Stalin, the leader decided that musicals were an effective means of spreading propaganda. Messages like the importance of collective labor and rags-to-riches stories would become the plots of most Soviet musicals.

"Movies for the Millions"

The success of _The Jolly Fellows_ ensured a place in Soviet cinema for the musical format, but immediately Shumyatsky set strict guidelines to make sure the films promoted Communist values. Shumyatsky's decree "Movies for the Millions" demanded conventional plots, characters, and montage to successfully portray Socialist Realism (the glorification of industry and the working class) on film.[66]

The first successful blend of a social message and entertainment was Aleksandrov's _Circus_ (1936). It starred his wife, Lyubov Orlova (an operatic singer who had also appeared in _The Jolly Fellows_) as an American circus performer who has to immigrate to the USSR from the U.S. because she has a mixed-race child, whom she had with a black man. Amidst the backdrop of lavish musical productions, she finally finds love and acceptance in the USSR, providing the message that racial tolerance can only be found in the Soviet Union.

The influence of Busby Berkeley's choreography on Aleksandrov's directing can be seen in the musical number leading up to the climax. Another, more obvious reference to Hollywood is the Charlie Chaplin impersonator who provides comic relief throughout the film. Four million people in Moscow and Leningrad went to see _Circus_ during its first month in theaters.[67]

Another of Aleksandrov's more-popular films was _The Bright Path_ (1940). This was a reworking of the fairytale _Cinderella_ set in the contemporary Soviet Union. The Cinderella of the story was again Orlova, who by this time was the most popular star in the USSR.[68] It was a fantasy tale, but the moral of the story was that a better life comes from hard work. Whereas in _Circus_, the musical numbers involved dancing and spectacle, the only type of choreography in _Bright Path_ is the movement of factory machines. The music was limited to Orlova's singing. Here, work provided the spectacle.

Ivan Pyryev

The other director of musical films was Ivan Pyryev. Unlike Aleksandrov, the focus of Pyryev's films was life on the collective farms. His films, _Tractor Drivers_ (1939), _The Swineherd and the Shepherd_ (1941), and his most famous, _Cossacks of the Kuban_ (1949) all starred his wife, Marina Ladynina. Like in Aleksandrov's _Bright Path_, the only choreography was the work the characters were doing on film. Even the songs were about the joys of working.

Rather than having a specific message for any of his films, Pyryev promoted Stalin's slogan "life has become better, life has become more joyous."[69] Sometimes this message was in stark contrast with the reality of the time. During the filming of _Cossacks of the Kuban_, the Soviet Union was going through a postwar famine. In reality, the actors who were singing about a time of prosperity were hungry and malnourished.[70] The films did, however, provide escapism and optimism for the viewing public.

_Volga-Volga_

'', directed by Grigori Aleksandrov]] The most popular film of the brief era of Stalinist musicals was Alexandrov's 1938 film _Volga-Volga_. The star, again, was Lyubov Orlova and the film featured singing and dancing, having nothing to do with work. It is the most unusual of its type. The plot surrounds a love story between two individuals who want to play music. They are unrepresentative of Soviet values in that their focus is more on their music than their jobs. The gags poke fun at the local authorities and bureaucracy. There is no glorification of industry since it takes place in a small rural village. Work is not glorified either, since the plot revolves around a group of villagers using their vacation time to go on a trip up the Volga to perform in Moscow.

_Volga-Volga_ followed the aesthetic principles of Socialist Realism rather than the ideological tenets. It became Stalin's favorite film and he gave it as a gift to President Roosevelt during WWII. It is another example of one of the films that claimed life is better. Released at the height of Stalin's purges, it provided escapism and a comforting illusion for the public.[71]
