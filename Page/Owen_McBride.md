He has lived in Toronto since his arrival in Canada in 1963[1] A veteran performer,[2] McBride was a key figure in the folk revival movement in Canada and in North American. He was a perennial favourite at the Mariposa Folk Festival, performing almost every year from 1964 to the '80s and frequently in subsequent years.[3] McBride was featured in the folk music magazine _Hoot_ in 1966.[4] He is an active performer in the folk music club and festival scenes, including appearances at the Philadelphia Folk Festival. In 1970 the _New York Times_ reported his ballad performances at the Philadelphia Festival as "sentimental and boozy".[5] He performs traditional Irish and Scottish music and is also accomplished storyteller, with appearances on CBC radio and storytelling festivals.[6] McBride has made several commercial recordings, including one on the Philo Records (folk) label.
