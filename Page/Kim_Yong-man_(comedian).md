KIM YONG-MAN (born November 30, 1967) is a South Korean comedian.[1][2] He is currently signed with the entertainment agency, FNC Entertainment.[3][4][5]


Education

In 2005, Kim was a student at Sungkyunkwan University's School of Art where he aimed to improve his acting skills for his sitcom, _Nonstop 5_, having previously studied at Seoul National University in 1992.[6]


Career

In 1991, Kim won the Grand Prize in the National College Comedy Contest, making his official debut in the South Korean entertainment industry.[7] In the early 1990s, Kim was a part of a group of comedians who called themselves _Team Potato_ (), composed of Kim Gook-jin, Kim Soo-yong and Park Soo-hong, who all debuted in the same year on KBS.[8][9][10] It had been reported that Kim himself had been admitted to hospital due to their busy schedule, and therefore Kim Gook-jin attempted to reason with television program producers to lighten their workload.[11] However, this request was not received well by producers, who then decided it was necessary to permanently ban _Team Potato_ from making appearances on television.[12] As a result, in January 1993, the four comedians planned to leave South Korea for the U.S., taking a break from the South Korean entertainment industry, although ultimately, only Kim himself and Kim Gook-jin went to the United States of America, while Park began his compulsory army duty and Kim Soo-yong went to Canada.[13][14][15]

In 2011, he hosted the 2011 SBS Entertainment Awards, along with Shin Bong-sun and Kim Won-hee.[16] In 2012, Kim became a CEO when he and comedian Kim Soo-yong started an online website called _StarLogin_, which allows companies and businesses alike to easily contact South Korean celebrities, including entertainers, singers and comedians, for events such as lectures, festivals or corporate events.[17][18][19]

After his gambling scandal,[20][21][22][23] Kim had spent nearly three years inactive in the entertainment industry.[24][25]

In 2015, he became a cast member of tvN's variety television program, _Useful Men_, making his first appearance on South Korean television since his career break that he took during his gambling scandal.[26][27]


Personal life

In March 2013, Kim was investigated for illegally gambling more than 1,000,000,000 KRW (approximately $900,000 USD) online on sports websites, under his manager's bank account. This could be described as the start of the investigations into other South Korean celebrities such as Tak Jae-hoon and Lee Soo-geun, who, along with Kim, were reportedly encouraged to gamble by an individual from their football club. Kim chose to leave the television programs he regularly took part in, including Vitamin, giving himself time to reflect.[28][29][30][31] Kim was officially charged with gambling 1,300,000,000 KRW (approximately $1,170,000 USD) between March 2008 and May 2011, in April 2013.[32][33] He was given a one-year prison sentence.[34]

Kim, among other South Korean celebrities such as Kim Won-hee and Song Eun-i, is a part of a volunteer group called _God is Love Ministry (GIL Ministry)_, who raise money to provide medical sponsorships for Haitian children with congenital heart disease to travel to South Korea to be medically treated.[35][36][37]
