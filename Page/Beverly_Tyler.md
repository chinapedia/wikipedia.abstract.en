BEVERLY TYLER (July 5, 1927 â€“ November 23, 2005), was an American film actress and singer who was a minor MGM leading lady who appeared in a handful of mostly B movies in the 1940s and 1950s.


Early years

Tyler was born BEVERLY JEAN SAUL in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on July 5, 1927,[1] the daughter of a secretary and factory employee, who secured piano and music lessons for their daughter at a young age. She was reared in adjacent Dunmore, Pennsylvania, attended Central High School, and she and her parents were devout Methodists who were active in the Dunmore Methodist Church where Beverly sang in the choir.[2] When she was 14 years old, Tyler passed screen and voice tests and was informed, "you're a movie actress."[3]


Film and Television

Tyler debuted in films billed as Beverly Jean Saul in _The Youngest Profession_ (1943).[4] She worked in over 30 motion pictures between 1943 and 1957, some of which included _The Green Years_ (1946), _My Brother Talks to Horses_ (1947), _The Fireball_ (1950), _Voodoo Island_ (1957), _Toughest Gun in Tombstone_ (1958), and _Hong Kong Confidential_ (1958). In 1953, Tyler played Lorelei Kilbourne on the television program _Big Town_.[5] She also was seen in such syndicated programs as _The Andy Griffith Show_, _Bonanza_ and _Hazel_. She was considered for the roles of Betty Schaefer in _Sunset Boulevard_ (1950), Eve Harrington in _All About Eve_ (1950), Georgie Elgin in _The Country Girl_ (1954), and Marylee Hadley in _Written on the Wind_ (1956), but never got any part (any, if not all, of which would have been instrumental in elevating her career and showcasing her talents as an actress).


Stage

Tyler appeared on Broadway during her teenage years as the female lead in the 1945 production _The Firebird of Florence_.[6]


Later years

Tyler's last appearance on the small screen was in 1961, and for the next couple of decades she focused on marriage, motherhood, and was a mainstay on the local theatre and supper club circuit in Reno until her retirement in 1990. She did return to her native Scranton/Dunmore area in 1950 to promote her picture _The Fireball_ and was given the key to the city by then mayor James T. Hanlon and she also went back to spend a few weeks in 1990 after her retirement to visit her old neighborhood with a childhood friend she kept in touch with.[7]


Personal life

During her time in Hollywood, Tyler was well known as a "girl about town" being seen at some of Tinsel Town's most popular nightclubs with such leading men as Mickey Rooney, Rory Calhoun, and Peter Lawford.[8]

Tyler was a Democrat who was supportive of Adlai Stevenson's campaign during the 1952 presidential election.[9]

In May 1962, she married Jim Jordan, Jr., the son of the famed 1930s radio couple Fibber McGee and Molly,[10] and had a son and three daughters. They remained married until his death in December 1998.[11]
