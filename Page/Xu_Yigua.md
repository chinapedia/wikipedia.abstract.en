XU YIGUA (须一瓜) is the pen name of XU PING (徐苹; born 1960s?), a Chinese writer based in Xiamen. She writes news reports for _Xiamen Evening News_ (厦门晚报; a local newspaper) under the name Xu Ping, and fiction under the name Xu Yigua. She found fame in the early 2000s when her fictions were featured on the covers of prominent national literary magazines, and after her real identity was discovered (to the shock of many Xiamen residents[1]), the catchphrase "Tail-line Reporter, Headline Author" (尾条记者，头条作家) caught on.[2]

Xu's work with _Xiamen Evening News_ gave her extensive experience in the fields of law and government. As a result, most of her fiction deal with crimes.

Xu Yigua's 2010 novel _Sunspot_ (太阳黑子) was adapted into a 2015 film _The Dead End_ directed by Cao Baoping, which was a commercial and critical success.
