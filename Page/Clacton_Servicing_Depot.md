History

Opened by British Rail in 1981, the depot was built with a three-road dead-end shed.[2] Around 1987, the depot had an allocation of Classes 302, 308, 309, 312 and 313 EMUs.[3] The depot lost its allocation of rolling stock in 1994, and was put to various uses before being scheduled for reopening around 2009.[4]


Present

As of 2016, there is no allocation. It is, instead, a stabling point for Greater Anglia Class 321[5] and Class 360 EMUs.[6] The depot currently carries out cleaning and the servicing for the trains, during the night.[7]
