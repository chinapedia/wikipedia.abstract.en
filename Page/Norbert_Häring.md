NORBERT HÄRING is an economist and business journalist. Since 2002 he has reported on finance and economics for the German business newspaper Handelsblatt.[1]


Life

He is the author (with Olaf Storbeck) of the book _Ökonomie 2.0_ which was a bestseller in Germany and won the 2007 GetAbstract International Book Award for best business book.[2] It was published in English as _Economics 2.0_ and also translated into Chinese, Korean, Italian and Japanese.[3] His book _Markt ind Macht_ was published in English as _Economists and the Powerful_ (with Niall Douglas) by Anthem Press in 2012.[4] In a review for CounterPunch, economist Michael Hudson wrote that the authors "provide a wealth of references tracing how economics was turned into a propaganda exercise for financiers, landlords, monopolists, insiders, fraudsters and other rent-seeking predators."[5]

Häring serves as non-voting chairman for the Shadow ECB Council, a group of 15 economists drawn from banks, academia, and other institutions founded in 2002 to discuss monetary policy and make recommendations to the European Central Bank.[6] He is a co-founder and co-director of the World Economics Association and co-editor of the journal _World Economic Review_, both of which aim to promote a pluralistic approach to economic research.[7]

In 2014 he was awarded the Keynes Prize for Economic Writing for his contributions to Handelsblatt.[8]
