Along the way, Amani found many secrets about herself, and the mysterious Rebel Prince.


Reception

In a _New York Times_ review, Jeff Giles wrote: "_Rebel of the Sands_ is a winning bit of storytelling, as well as a homage to storytelling itself. It evokes such disparate influences ... that at times you wonder whether Hamilton can pull it all off. She can."[2] Linda Buckley-Archer of _The Guardian_ called the book "a high-concept, and highly enjoyable, epic fantasy adventure for young adults."[3] A _Publisher Weekly_ review remarked, "Hamilton successfully mingles romance with thrilling stakes, and hints at a welcome sequel."[4] A _Kirkus_ review described the book as "romantic, thrilling, hilarious, and just plain great fun."[5]
