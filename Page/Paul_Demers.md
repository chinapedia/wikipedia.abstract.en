PAUL DEMERS (March 9, 1956 – October 29, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter.[1] He was best known for writing the song "Notre place", which came to be recognized as an anthem of the Franco-Ontarian community.[2]


Background

Born in Gatineau, Quebec,[3] his family moved to Ottawa, Ontario when he was 16.[4] He began performing as a musician in adulthood, touring music festivals across Ontario and forming the band Purlaine in 1979.[5] Following a diagnosis with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the early 1980s, however, he took several years off from music to undergo cancer treatment.[6]


"Notre place"

He came out of retirement in 1986 to write "Notre place", which was originally commissioned for a gala to celebrate the passage of Ontario's 1986 French Language Services Act.[7] The song came to be adopted as the Franco-Ontarian community's unofficial anthem,[8] and was formally designated as the community's official anthem by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 2017.[9][10]

Following "Notre place", Demers returned to touring, both as a solo artist and with musicians Robert Paquette and Marcel Aymar in the group Paquette-Aymar-Demers,[11] released three albums, and worked as a theatre producer and director.[12] A biography of him, by writer Pierre Albert, was published by Éditions Interligne in 1992.[13]


Death

Demers was diagnosed with mesothelioma in January 2016.[14] He gave a retrospective interview from his hospital bed to the Ici Radio-Canada Première program _Grands Lacs Café_ in the fall, prior to his death on October 29.[15]
