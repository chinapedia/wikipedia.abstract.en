The SYNOD OF QUEENSLAND or QUEENSLAND SYNOD is a state council of the Uniting Church in Australia. The word 'synod' also describes the regular meeting (every 18 months) of representatives of the state-wide church known as Synod in Session. The next Synod in Session will be the 35th Synod in 2020.

The Assembly is the national council of the church, headed by the President of the Uniting Church, with a general secretary as chief executive officer. The six geographically-based synods are responsible for overall support and resourcing of the church in their area—especially in community services, mission planning, theological education and other educational services, administration relating to ministers, and property and financial services. The elected head of each synod is the moderator, and a general secretary is usually appointed as the chief executive officer. The moderator is the spiritual head and the main spokesperson for the Uniting Church in Queensland. Moderator Reverend David Baker has held this role since 2014. His term was extended in 2016 to run until the 35th Synod in 2020.[1]


Presbyteries

A synod may relate to a number of presbyteries within its bounds. A presbytery is a council of the Uniting Church which has oversight of congregations, ministry and programs within a region. Ministers of the Word and deacons are responsible to their presbytery, which has the duty of caring for them and ensuring their work is carried out faithfully. Presbytery meetings include ordained ministers, lay pastors and elected lay persons from every congregation.

The Synod of Queensland has eight presbyteries.[2]

-   Bremer Brisbane Presbytery 1
-   Calvary Presbytery (the regional body of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress (UAICC) in Queensland)
-   Central Queensland Presbytery 2
-   Mary Burnett Presbytery 3
-   Moreton Rivers Presbytery 4
-   North Queensland Presbytery 5
-   South Moreton Presbytery 6
-   The Downs Presbytery 7
