Description

_Eucalyptus dolichorhyncha_ is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale grey over pale orange to pale brown bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged alternately and egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to oblong, long and wide on a petiole wide. The flower buds hang singly in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the pedicel long. Mature buds are red, oblong and square in cross section with a wing on each corner, long and wide. Flowering occurs between January and May and the flowers are yellow. The fruit is a woody capsule that is a similar shape to the mature buds, long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim.[2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

Fuchsia gum was first formally described in 1973 by Ian Brooker who gave it the name _Eucalyptus forrestiana_ subsp. _dolichorhyncha_ and published the description in the _Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia_. The type specimen was collected by John W. Green near Grass Patch in 1957.[4][5][6] In 1993, Brooker and Hopper raised the subspecies to species status as _E. dolichorhyncha_.[7] The specific epithet (_dolichorhyncha_) is derived from the Ancient Greek words _dolichos_ meaning "long"[8] and _rhynchos_ meaning "snout" or "muzzle",[9] referring to the long narrow operculum.[10]


Distribution and habitat

_Eucalyptus dolichorhyncha_ has a limited range on flats in a small area along the south coast of the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia north of Esperance where it grows in sandy clay or clay soils.[11]


Conservation status

This mallet is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife,[12] meaning that is rare or near threatened.[13]
