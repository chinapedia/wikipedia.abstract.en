Political career

Laura Grimond was Liberal candidate for the West Aberdeenshire division at the 1970 General Election. West Aberdeenshire was a seat the Liberals had gained from the Conservatives at the previous general election. The Liberal victor James Davidson decided not to defend his seat and instead campaigned for Laura Grimond. Her prospects of holding the seat lessened when a SNP candidate intervened in the contest. However _The Times_, the Conservative leaning national newspaper made a point of endorsing her by name; through "an invocation of 'the Asquith ideal', which called strenuously for more Liberal MPs and in particular for Mrs Laura Grimond."[5] In a difficult election for the Liberal Party nationwide, the Conservatives regained the seat, beating her by over 5,000 votes. She did not stand for parliament again.[6] She continued to be active for the Liberal Party at a national level; From 1983-1985 she was President of the Women's Liberal Federation. Three times during the mid 1980s she appeared as a party spokesperson on BBC's Question Time. She was also politically active locally in Orkney; She was a Councillor for Firth & Harray and Chairman of Orkney Islands Council's Housing Committee.[7]
