History

The minor princely state, in Gohelwar _prant_, was ruled by Kathi Chieftains. During the British Raj, it was a Sixth Class state, in the charge of the colonial Eastern Kathiawar Agency.

In 1901 it comprised two villages, with a population of 506, yielding 3,000 Rupees state revenue (1903-4, mostly from land), paying 355 Rupees tribute, to the British and to Junagadh State.[1]
