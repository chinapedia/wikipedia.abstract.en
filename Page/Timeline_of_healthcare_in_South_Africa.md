  17th–18th centuries   Hospital care is provided by the Dutch East India Company, colonial governments, and Christian missions. Traditional healers, European trained doctors, missionaries, and other health providers offer a mix of services.[1]
  19th century          Medically trained doctors become mainstream. Indigenous and traditional healers are marginalized. Orthodox medicine becomes a professional practice with training of nurses and doctors. By mid-century, hospitals are present in most major centers. Epidemics of syphilis, tuberculosis, bubonic plague, yellow fever, typhus, cholera, soil parasites, and malnutrition hit South Africa.[2]
  1910–1948             The Union of South Africa is established. Health services are fragmented among the four provinces. Poor urban working and living conditions with diseases are caused by overcrowding, poor sanitation and diets, stress, and social disintegration follow consolidation of racial segregation. Syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria and venereal diseases continue to spread.[3]
  1948–1994             Apartheid years. Non-communicable diseases rise in white people and poverty-related diseases persist in black people. Tuberculosis rates and deaths are much higher in black and coloured populations than among whites. Health services in bantustans are systematically underfunded.[4]
  1994–present          Post-apartheid democracy. Today, the public system serves the vast majority of the population, but it still remains underfunded and understaffed. The wealthiest 20% of the population use the private system and are far better served.[5] Diseases of poverty, non-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS comprise a huge burden for South Africa.
