GORDON CUTHBERT GRIFFIN M.B.E. (born 19 December 1942) is an English actor, audiobook reader, casting director, dialogue coach, singer, composer and lyricist.


Early life

Griffin comes from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, though he was actually born at Gilsland in Northumberland, where his family temporarily located in wartime. He trained at Rose Bruford College.[1]


Career

As a stage actor, he has half a century's experience of working in theatres up and down the British Isles, and in English-speaking productions overseas. He took part in the first national tour of _Godspell_, and played in _Julius Caesar_ and in _Murder in the Cathedral_ at Chichester Festival Theatre. Other UK regional theatres where he has performed include Derby Playhouse and the Octagon Theatre, Bolton.[2]

For twenty years he has been Casting Director for The English Theatre of Hamburg and has cast over fifty plays, including _The Importance of Being Earnest_, _Twelfth Night_, _As You Like It_, _Arms and the Man_, _Candida_, _Blithe Spirit_, _The Caretaker_, _Private Lives_ and _The Circle_, as well as the plays of LaBute and David Mamet.[3]

As a cabaret singer he has performed with his singing partner Francoise Geller in the UK and elsewhere. He has composed music and lyrics for productions such as _The Circle_, _Educating Rita_, _When the Reaper Calls_, _Over the River_, _Through the Woods_ and _April in Paris_.[4]

His first film job, in _Arabesque_, required him to play a scene with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren.[5]

On television he has been a presenter on _Play School_, he played Inky in two series of _Chips' Comic_ for Channel 4 and he spoke the first line in the first episode of _Byker Grove_.[6]

Griffin has worked as a dialogue coach on _Byker Grove_ and _Kavanagh QC_.[7]

Through doing radio drama he realised that he could display great versatility with his voice alone, accessing a greater range of parts than would otherwise be possible. (For instance, in the late 'sixties when well into his twenties he took over the part of Billy the eldest grandson in _The Dales_, formerly _Mrs Dale's Diary_, who had previously been played as a boy with an unbroken voice, and played him till the serial ended.)[8]

He 'got in on the ground floor' when audiobooks started to be recorded. For many years he has been a voiceover specialist and has recorded nearly eight hundred audiobooks, mostly unabridged.[9] The subjects have been as varied as Homer's _Odyssey_, Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ and novels by H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, as well as more modern writers like Hilary Mantel and Melvyn Bragg. Also many titles in the _Golden Age of Murder_ series for the British Library, and non-fiction titles such as _Elegy: The First Day on the Somme_, and _Breakfast is a Dangerous Meal_ by Terence Kealey, among many others. _AudioFile Magazine_ wrote: "Griffin is not just a narrator, but an artist of the Spoken Word. He is in the top five of the most borrowed audiobook narrators in the world."[10] In 2015-2016 his 2015 reading of _Kate Ellis_ 's _The Death Season_ was the sixth most borrowed adult audiobook from UK public libraries, as reported by the Public Lending Right office.[11]

His more unusual audio recordings include having been the courteous voice advising alighting passengers to "Mind the gap, please" on the London Underground.[12]

In 2017, Griffin was appointed MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List "For services to People with Sight Impairment".[13]
