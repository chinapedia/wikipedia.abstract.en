_1948: A HISTORY OF THE FIRST ARAB–ISRAELI WAR_ is a non-fiction work written by Israeli historian Benny Morris. It was published by Yale University Press in 2008.[1] The author is otherwise known for multiple other books such as _Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem_ and _Righteous Victims_, being a member of the group called the 'new historians' and the individual who most popularized the term.[2]


Background and contents

The author remarked in an interview, "The left wing and the right wing will both find things to attack in the book". He added, "Anyone who wants can find things to bash the Arabs with" and "anyone who wants can find things to bash the Jews with" given that the "book has everything in it, because that's the nature of history: it is really quite intricate."[3]

The book details the 1947–1949 Palestine war from a primarily military perspective, though wading into the numerous complex cultural, political, and social issues involved. The 1948 Palestinian exodus from various areas as well as the latter Arab–Israeli conflict are delved into in the context of the initial fighting. Morris describes a multi-faceted struggle in which numerous war crimes occur, many committed by Jewish forces despite later apologia attempting to minimize such events. He writes, "In truth ... the Jews committed far more atrocities than the Arabs and killed far more civilians and PoWs in deliberate acts of brutality in the course of 1948."[4]

The character of the Arabic forces assaulting the Jewish communities is also described as having a highly ideological, Islamist nature. Morris views the 1948 bloodshed as having a broader sense of having a conflict between civilizations, with many soldiers seeing themselves as engaging in 'jihad'. However, he states that the disorganized, divided leadership of the Arabic forces provided military opportunities from their own ineptness that the Jewish militants seized; a simplistic 'David versus Goliath' narrative does not fit.[5]


Reviews and responses

_The Guardian_ published a supportive review by fellow historian Avi Shlaim. He wrote, "Morris subjects the conflicting national narratives of the 1948 war to rigorous scrutiny in the light of the evidence and he discards all the notions, however deeply cherished, that do not stand up to such scrutiny." While criticizing some of Morris' arguments, Shlaim praised the book as an "impressive achievement of original research and synthesis" and concluded that it provided a historical account "presented in a fluent and readable style".[6]

An article published in the _Middle East Quarterly_ interviewing the author and discussing the work stated that in _1948: History of the First Arab–Israeli War_ "even when difficult facts come up, Morris tries to preserve balance and composure."[7]

The Independent published a review by Stephen Howe, a historian and frequent reviewer, that was highly critical of what many saw as a marked change in Morris’ objectivity starting at the beginning of the 2000’s:

Motti Golan, professor of Jewish History at The Zvi Yavetz School of Historical Studies at the University of Tel Aviv, published a review in The Journal of Israeli History that was highly critical of Morris’ claims that the Arab side of the 1948 wars was motivated by the Islamic principle of Jihad:

Writing in Haaretz, fellow New Historian, Tom Segev, gave Morris’ work a highly-critical review, noting a particular lack of humanism displayed in the book’s treatment of the Palestinian perspective:
