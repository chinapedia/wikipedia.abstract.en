The NATIONAL PARTY OF THE FATHERLAND[1] (), usually named NATIONAL "PRO PATRIA" PARTY, was a Salvadoran nationalist and authoritarian political party founded in 1931 by General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez to support his policies and rule, and establish a one party system, effectively banning all political parties except for Pro Patria, eliminating all competition in election and membership recruiting.
