SIMON HAMMERSLEY (born 20 March 1993) is an English rugby union player who plays at fullback for Newcastle Falcons in the English Premiership. He has been nicknamed "Lord Hammer of Hammershire" by BT Sport commentator Nick Mullins.


Club career

Hammersley started his career at his local amateur club Hull Ionians in National League Two North, before attending Durham University where he was part of the team who won the BUCS national final at Twickenham. [1]

Hammersley signed with Newcastle Falcons in summer 2013 and quickly established himself as a first team player, aided by injury to the regular starting full back Alex Tait. He was called into the England Saxons squad as injury cover in August 2016 [2]

Following Newcastle's Relegation to the RFU Championship, Hammersley invoked a relegation release clause which was present in his contract that would allow him to leave the club should such a situation like this occur. It was announced shortly afterwards that Sale Sharks had signed a three-year deal with the fullback, a move which would keep him in the Premiership.
