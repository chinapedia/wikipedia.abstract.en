COCOA ICE is a 1997 illustrated children's book by Diana Appelbaum, illustrated by Holly Meade. It was published by Orchard Books.

Cocoa Ice tells parallel stories of two little girls, one in Maine, where ice is harvested on the rivers, the another in Santo Domingo, where cocoa beans are grown, who are linked by an 1870s Yankee trading schooner and its captain. The two little girls enjoy their different versions of "cocoa ice."[1][2][3][4]
