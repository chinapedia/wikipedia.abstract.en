The TIMOTHY DAVIS HOUSE (also known as WITT FUNERAL HOME and the LEONARD FUNERAL HOME) is a historic building located at 405 First Street NW in Elkader, Iowa.


Description and history

Timothy Davis was a businessman, attorney and town speculator, who along with John Thompson and Chester Sage laid out the town of Elkader in the mid-1840s.[1] They built a saw- and gristmill here before Davis moved back to Dubuque. He returned to Elkader a couple years later and built this home, where he spent his remaining years. The 2Â½-story brick structure was built in the vernacular Federal style. Its dominate decorative feature is the front porch, which is a recreation of the original.

Ground was broken for the house in June 13, 1866.[2]

The house has subsequently been used as a funeral home, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 1976.[3]
