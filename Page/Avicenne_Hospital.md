AVICENNE HOSPITAL () is a hospital in Bobigny, Seine-Saint-Denis, in the northern suburbs of Paris. Opened in 1935 as the Franco-Muslim Hospital (_Hôpital franco-musulman de Paris_), it was built specifically to cater for North-African immigrants who had flocked to the Paris area.[1] Renamed Avicenne in 1978, in memory of the Persian physician Avicenna, it is now a university hospital catering for the local population.[2]
