The GALLIENI MASSIF () is a mountain range in Grande Terre, the main island of Kerguelen in the French Southern Territories zone of the Southern Indian Ocean.[1]


Geography

This range is located in the Gallieni Peninsula, fringing the southern coast. The highest point of the massif is the high Mont Ross, a stratovolcano that is also the highest point of the Kerguelen Archipelago.

Other important summits of the range are high Petit Ross, high Dôme du Père Gaspard and the high Grand Gendarme. The range also includes a number of glacial formations, among which the Buffon Glacier, the La Pilatte Glacier and the Sélé Glacier deserve mention.[2]
