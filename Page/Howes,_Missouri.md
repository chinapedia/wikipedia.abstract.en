HOWES is an unincorporated community in Dent County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

The community was named after the local Howe family.[2] A variant name was GANO.[3] An early postmaster named Gano gave his last name to the post office, in order to avoid repetition with nearby Howes Mill.[4] A post office called Gano was established in 1902, and remained in operation until 1923.[5]
