Political career

In 2012 Angela Vithoulkas ran as an independent in the City of Sydney, as part of the Living Sydney. She was re-elected in 2016 for a further 4 years as part of the Sydney Matters Team.

Living Sydney, 2012–14

In 2012 Angela Vithoulkas was approached by real estate agent and former campaign manager to Lord Mayor Clover Moore, Barry Goldman to run for public office as part of the Living Sydney Independent party.[23] Mr Goldman established the team due to frustrations with Clover Moore's council's inaction for business and transport reforms, including controversial reforms to the business voting laws of Sydney.[24] The 8-week campaign for City of Sydney Council was almost entirely personally funded by Angela Vithoulkas, resulting in her election as a City of Sydney Councillor.[25]

Angela Vithoulkas and the Sydney Living party was endorsed by the Consumer's and Tax Payer's association and media personality Alan Jones – however the party denied any link the organisation, likely due to their anti-carbon tax stance.[26]

The Living Sydney team received 8.4% of the vote for councillor (5524 total votes) and Angela Vithoulkas received 9.8% of Lord Mayoral votes (6722 total votes).[27]

Independent, 2014–16

In 2014, Angela Vithoulkas left the Living Sydney party citing its links to the liquor and gambling industry publicly.[28] At the time of leaving the party, Ms Vithoulkas was the only contact on the website and made up the bulk of the sites' content – suggesting that the party had largely been dismantled after the election. Vithoulkas remained from 2014 – 2016 as an independent councillor in the City of Sydney.

Sydney Matters Independent Team, 2016–present

Towards the end of Ms Vithoulkas' first tenure as a City of Sydney councillor, she established the Sydney Matters team to run in the 2016 City of Sydney local elections. It was believed that both Angela Vithoulkas as a business leader and Liberal Candidate Christine Forster would be an increased threat to incumbent Clover Moore due to the introduction of compulsory non-residential voting for businesses.[29] The changes to business voting in the local government area were a controversial change, with much of council vowing to remove the amendments if elected.[30]

In Early August, former Liberal Mayoral Candidate, and Liberal party member Edward Mandla joined the Sydney Matters team claiming that the Liberal party had lost its way.[31] Attracted by the Independence afforded by being an Independent politician, Mandla became the second the Sydney Matters ticket and ensured that Christine Forster would run as the Liberal candidate.[32] The Sydney Matters Independent team also notably included Chinese Immigration Lawyer Grace Zou, Founder of online publication Start-up Daily Mat Beeche, and fitness blogger Lorraine Chung.[33][34]

Notable campaign platforms for the Sydney Matters team included the suggestion to build a tunnel underneath Oxford St, The Introduction of Free-wifi for City of Sydney residents and the introduction of a Night Mayor as seen other cities, most notably Amsterdam.[35][36][37]

Night Mayor Proposal

A major lynch pin of the Sydney Matters 2016 campaign was a proposal for a "Night-Mayor" in the [City of Sydney].[38] In 2014, the NSW Government introduced legislation, coined the lockout laws, aimed at decreasing alcohol related violence following a series of assaults in Sydney's King's Cross district. As a response, Angela Vithuolkas' party publicly called for the introduction of a "night-mayor" as seen in international cities. The Success of Amsterdam's night mayor, Mirik Milan has been help up as a case study of what is possible for comparable cities.[39] The proposal received traction in major news outlets including the Sydney Morning Herald and wide-ranging support from public figures, most notably Justin Hemmes and the Keep Sydney open group.[40][41]

Controversy

In late August, Angela Vithoulkas made news for selling her house to fund her political campaign. Vithoulkas had stated that she wore the self-funding as a badge of honour, saying "I don’t want to tow a party line. I like my independence and I think the people of the City of Sydney get that..".[42]

A blow to the Sydney Matters campaign, came with 2 days until election day when the Sydney Morning Herald published a series of "disparaging and sexist" remarks made by Edward Mandla in email to liberal party staff.[43]

Election result

Incumbent Clover Moore had a resounding victory in the 2016 City of Sydney local government election and was returned to office alongside 5 members of the Clover Moore Team. Angela Vithoulkas was returned as an Independent Councillor, securing 7.35% of the vote as councillor (6051 total votes).[44][45] She also received 7.74% of the vote as Mayoral candidate (6432 total votes).[46] No other Sydney Matters candidates were successfully elected.

Light Rail Campaigning

Vithoulkas has been at the forefront of campaigns to compensate businesses impeded by Light Rail constructions in the Sydney CBD.[47] Vithoulkas' own business, VIVO Café, has been hindered by the constructions on George St.

In early August 2017, Vithoulkas hosted a business resident action meeting for those effected by the Light Rail.[48] The meeting was supported and addressed by veteran broadcaster Alan Jones, who has also been critical of the constructions. Over 100 business owners and residents attended the meeting and it received considerable media attention.

In late August 2017, after 2 years of campaigning, the NSW State Government announced it would award rent relief to businesses that were negatively effected by Light Rail construction.[49] Vithoulkas was critical of the time taken for the Government to act on the issue, saying it was "too little too late" for many businesses.[50]

The Small Business Party

In October 2017, Vithoulkas announced plans to challenge for a seat in State Parliament after establishing the Small Business Matters party.[51]

The party was formed after the success of her Light Rail campaigning, with Vithoulkas saying: “The light rail (experience) inspired me. I could see that getting through to State Government after the fact is the hardest job of all,” and that it was time to "take it up a notch in the upper house and keep the bastards honest".

Small Business Matters surpassed 1000 members on November 6, 2017, making it eligible to qualify and register as a political party. An official application for the party was submitted to the NSW Electoral Commission.[52]

Wentworth by-election

Vithoulkas was running as an Independent candidate in the federal Wentworth by-election.[53]
