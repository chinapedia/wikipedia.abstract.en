JOE JOHNSON was[1] an American gay cartoonist, whose MISS THING and BIG DICK were among the first ongoing gay comics characters, appearing in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[2] The characters were featured in single-panel humor cartoons originally published in _The Advocate_. MissThing.jpg Miss Thing is an unflappable, stereotypically effeminate, gay "queen";[3] the name was a popular expression in gay male subculture for such a person. He has a willowy physique and a pompadour hairstyle, and wears floral prints, bell-bottoms, and flamboyant blouses.[4] Big Dick is an outgoing, stereotypically macho gay man. He has a highly muscular physique, and wears tight jeans which emphasize his large penis, a baseball cap, and a leather jacket and boots, in the mold of a Tom of Finland character.[5][6] Both characters are sexually adventurous, and the cartoons are blatantly sexual with frequent nudity, but not sexually explicit.[7] The characters usually appear separately in cartoons under their respective names, but sometimes meet.

Johnson published a collection of Miss Thing and Big Dick cartoons through Funny Bone Press in 1973 as: _...and so, this is YOUR life, Miss Thing_ (the title being a reference to the then-recent popular television program _This Is Your Life_), with an introduction by Larry Townsend.[8] Some of Johnson's cartoons were also reprinted in volumes of _Meatmen_ in the 1980s, as well as in historical overviews such as _No Straight Lines_ published by Fantagraphics in 2012.[9] Johnson also produced explicit erotic illustrations for sale.[10]

Cartoonist Donelan was inspired by Johnson's work to begin his series "It's a Gay Life", which appeared in _The Advocate_ after "Miss Thing" and "Big Dick" ended.[11] Howard Cruse cited Johnson's "brazenly gay" cartooning as an inspiration.[12]
