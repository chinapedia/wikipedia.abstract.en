WAHIDUDDIN ZIAUDDIN AHMED (1916â€“2007)[1] was a Pakistani film-maker, known primarily for his work in the 1940s. After the Partition of India, Ahmed continued to make movies in Pakistan, but he met comparatively little success.


Career in British India

W.Z. Ahmed was born in Gujarat.[2] He was active as a film-maker in pre-Partition India, being an established personality in the film industry in Bombay and Pune.[3] Apart from his Shalimar Pictures in Pune, he also ran a studio in Madras.[4] He wrote the dialogues for the 1940 movie _Kumkum the Dancer_.[5] Between 1942 and 1947 he produced and directed _Ek Raat_ (1942), _Man Ki Jeet_ (1944), _Prem Sangeet_, _Prithaviraj-Samyukta_ and _Meera Bai_ (1947).[6][7][8][9] W.Z. Ahmed's last movie produced in India, which depicted Hindu devotee Meera Bai, was met with ferocious criticism along communal lines in _Filmindia_ whose editor Baburao Patel stated that 'Muslim "Meerabai" grossly slanders Hinduism!'.[10]


Career in Pakistan

After Partition, Ahmed was a prominent cultural personality in Pakistan for a few years, although his cinematic career did not develop well in Pakistan.[11] He established W.Z. Studios in Lahore.[12]

W.Z. Ahmed made only two movies in Pakistan, _Roohi_ and _Wadah_ (1956).[13][14] Notably _Roohi_ was the first film to be banned in independent Pakistan.[15][16] It was charged with inciting 'class hatred'.[17] Nevertheless, the ban on _Roohi_ was lifted in 1954.[18]

In 1954 W.Z. Ahmed played a prominent role in campaign against imports of Indian films.[19] He was arrested during the agitation.[20]

W.Z. Ahmed's ninth movie, _Wafa Ki Ada_, was never completed nor released.[21]


Family

His father had been a prominent police officer in Gujarat.[22] His brothers included Z.A. Ahmed (a prominent communist politician in Uttar Pradesh) and Zafaruddin Ahmed (Deputy Inspector of Police in Karachi).[23] W.Z. Ahmed's first wife was Safia Hidayattullah. He later married Shahida, who had acted in one of his films in Bombay.[24]

W.Z. Ahmed is buried at Bagh-i-Rehmat graveyard in Lahore.[25]
