_EUCALYPTUS CUPREA_, commonly known as the MALLEE BOX,[1] is a species of mallee that is endemic to the west coast of Western Australia. It has rough, flaky bark on the base of its trunk, smooth coppery-coloured bark above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and conical to cup-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus cuprea_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough flaky, box-style bark for up to of the trunk, smooth copper-colour to pale orange-grey bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped, dull greyish green leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, about long and wide with a rounded operculum, usually with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between August and November and the flowers are white or creamy-white. The fruit is a woody conical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves deeply enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus cuprea_ was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected by Brooker north of the Murchison River in 1984.[5][6] The specific epithet (_cuprea_) is a Latin word meaning "coppery"[7] in reference to the seasonal colour of the smooth bark.[8][9]

_Eucalyptus cuprea_ belongs in Eucalyptus subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ section _Adnataria_ (also known as the boxes). Within the _Adnataria_ section, _E. cuprea_ is part of a subgroup, series _Buxeales_ which are all found in south-eastern Australia, with only three occurring in Western Australia, those being _E.cuprea_ , _E. absita_ and _E. lucasii_. All three have inflexed stamens which separates them from the eastern species.[10]


Distribution and habitat

Mallee box is found in a small area in the Geraldton hills in the Mid West region of Western Australia where it grows in shallow sandy soils over granite.[11] It occurs in almost pure stands.[12]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus cuprea_ is classified as "endangered" under the Australian Government _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_[13] and as "Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora â€” Extant)" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia).[14] An Interim Recovery Plan has been prepared.[15] The main threats to the species include farming activities such as grazing by sheep, weed invasion, land clearing, firebreak maintenance and inappropriate fire regimes.[16]
