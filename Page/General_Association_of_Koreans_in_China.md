The GENERAL ASSOCIATION OF KOREANS IN CHINA is a pro-DPRK group of ethnic Koreans in the People's Republic of China. The organization is led by Chairwoman Choe Un-bok and held its sixth congress in Shenyang, China, on August 10, 2016. At that time it had been seven years since their fifth congress.[1]

There are regional and branch organizations of the GAKC, including one in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. The regional chairman there, Cha Sang-bo, is the vice-chairman of the General Association of Koreans in China.[2]

They publish a magazine called _Paektu-Halla_.[3]

The organization was apparently founded in 1991, based around a "Korean-Japanese headquarters" led by Chung Min Lee. It adopted its current name in 1998.[4][5]
