The MEGA DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION CENTER (MEGA DATRC),[1] also known as the MEGA DRUG TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION CENTER, is a drug rehabilitation center at Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Philippines.[2]


Construction

The drug rehabilitation facility's construction commenced in July 2016 but construction only went full swing after Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial signed a deed of donation with Chinese billionaire and philanthropist Huang Rulun in a meeting in Beijing, China. Huang previously met with President Rodrigo Duterte and talked about how could help deal with the illegal drugs problem in the Philippines. Huang met with Duterte thrice with two of the meetings conducted during his presidential campaign.[3]

The facility was constructed in a land at Fort Magsaysay.[4] The land where the facility is to be located was identified by the Department of National Defense (DND).[5]

75 shipping containers of China-imported material will be used in the construction of the facility.[6] The materials to be used are the same to those used in facilities erected as part of the rehabilitation of areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The drug rehabilitation facility can endure winds up to . The structures could be further reinforced to ground-attached cables as measures against winds or more. The materials are also stated to be fire-resistant and the construction project of the facility also include water and electricity works.[7]

By October 12, 2016, the facility is already 50 percent complete with the right wing of the building which can accommodate about 1,000 patients already ready to be furnished. The left wing and the female dormitory is being constructed by this time.[8] The facility had its soft opening in October 17, 2016 with the newly-hired staff of the facility set to have a "dry-run' on patient management before the facility was scheduled to begin accommodating drug dependents within the month of November 2016.[9]

President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to lead the inauguration or full opening rites of the facility at 2:00Â p.m. (UTC+8) on November 29, 2016.[10][11] The inauguration marks the completion of the Phase I of the project.[12]


Facilities

The drug rehabilitation facility will host around 10,000 bed facilities.[13] Upon its inauguration in November 2016, the facility will host an initial 2,500 bed facilities.[14]


Management

The drug rehabilitation facility is to be put under the Department of Health. The DOH will turn over the facility to the military once the number of admitted drug dependents is significantly reduced. The operating expenses for the facility for 2017 is estimated to be around .[15]


Reception

Dangerous Drugs Board chairman Dionisio Santiago described the facility as a "mistake" and "impractical" saying it would be better if the funds used to build the facility was used on smaller community-based rehabilitation programs that would accommodate 150 to 200 drug dependents instead which he believes would be effective. He also says it is difficult to admit patients from far-flung areas such as Batangas and Batanes. In June 2017, the facility has 311 residents.[16]
