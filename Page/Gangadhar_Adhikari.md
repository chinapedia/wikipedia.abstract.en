He joined the German Communist Party. He returned to India in 1928 and joined the Communist Party of India. He was arrested in the Meerut Conspiracy Case. Albert Einstein wrote an open letter to the British Prime Minister MacDonald seeking release of the scientist Adhikari.

Adhikari was a member of the CPI Politburo 1943-1951.[4]

Adhikari's position on the national question, published in 1943 under the name _Pakistan and Indian National Unity_, was inspired by Joseph Stalin's _Marxism and the National Question_ as it stressed the importance of a nationality to share a common language, a defined territory and a common national consciousness.[5]

He compiled the ten volume _Documents of the Communist Party of India_.[6]
