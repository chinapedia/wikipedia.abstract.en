11Β-HYDROXYANDROSTENEDIONE (11Β-OHA4), also known as 11Β-HYDROXYANDROST-4-ENE-3,17-DIONE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring steroid and androgen prohormone that is produced primarily, if not exclusively, in the adrenal glands.[1] It is closely related to adrenosterone (11-ketoandrostenedione; 11-KA4), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (11-KDHT), which are also produced in the adrenal glands.[2]
