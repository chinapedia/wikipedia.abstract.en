LUZ OLIVEROS-BELARDO (3 November 1906 â€“ 12 December 1999) was a Filipina pharmaceutical chemist, honored with the National Scientist of the Philippines award by the Philippine government in 1987.


Early life

Luz Oliveros was born in Navotas, Rizal, the daughter of Aurelio Oliveros and Elisa Belarmino. She held undergraduate and master's degrees in chemistry from the University of the Philippines in Manila. In 1957 she earned a PhD in pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of Connecticut,[1] with a dissertation involving molecular refraction in terpenes.[2]


Career

Luz Oliveros-Belardo was director of the Natural Sciences Research Center at the Philippine Women's University. She became Dean of the College of Pharmacy in 1947.[3] Her research focused on extracting essential oils and other chemicals from native Philippine plants, for pharmaceuticals, food production, scents, and other applications.[4] For example, she developed an experimental formulation based on apitong (_Dipterocarpus grandiflorus_) oleoresin that was suitable for a motor fuel.[5]

In 1965-1966, she was named an AAUW fellow[6] by the American Association of University Women to pursue her research at Stanford University.[7] In 1974, the Philippine Association of University Women recognized her with their Achievement Award in Natural Science.[8] She received the National Scientist Award in 1987.[9][10]


Personal life

Luz Oliveros married a dentist, Ricardo A. Belardo. They had two daughters. She died in 1999, aged 93 years. Her remains were buried at Libingan ng mga Bayani in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City.[11]
