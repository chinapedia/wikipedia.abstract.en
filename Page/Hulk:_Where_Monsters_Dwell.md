_HULK: WHERE MONSTERS DWELL_ is a 2016 direct-to-video animated superhero film featuring the character the Hulk.[1] The movie takes its name from a 1970s Marvel comic book title. Just like _Marvel Super Hero Adventures: Frost Fight!_, this film is within the Marvel Animated Universe.[2]


Plot

Doctor Strange brings Hulk to New York City to assist fighting rampaging monsters on Halloween night, which were young teens stuck dreaming and changed into the monsters that they fear. During battle, Hulk randomly reverts to an unconscious Bruce Banner. Doctor Strange planned a trip to the Dream Dimension with the Hulk to get to the bottom of the monsters while confronting Nightmare. Before this happens, they call upon the Howling Commandos (consisting of Jasper Sitwell's zombie form, Man-Thing, Vampire by Night, Warwolf, and Minotaur) to watch over their physical forms and contain the rampaging monsters. Banner and Hulk split for their trip to other dimension with Banner using the dream version of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor.[3][4]

Reception

Screen Rant awarded the film a positive review, saying "All in all, Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell isn’t nearly as thoughtful a story as it could have been, but for a superhero adventure that’s loosely tied to a holiday, it works. Kids will enjoy themselves, while adults may struggle to make it through the whole film."[15] Newsarama was more critical in their review, aiming specific criticisms at the dialogue and pacing, ultimately saying "There’s definitely a solid 45-minute episode of Avengers Assemble in this that could have easily worked better."[16] ScienceFiction.com awarded it 3.5 out of five, saying "the movie is a solid Halloween cartoon overall"[17]
