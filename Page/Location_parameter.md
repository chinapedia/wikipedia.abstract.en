In statistics, a LOCATION FAMILY is a class of probability distributions that is parametrized by a scalar- or vector-valued parameter x₀, which determines the "location" or shift of the distribution. Formally, this means that the probability density functions or probability mass functions in this class have the form

_f__(_x_₀)(_x_) = _f_(_x_ − _x_₀).
Here, x₀ is called the LOCATION PARAMETER. Examples of location parameters include the mean, the median, and the mode.

Thus in the one-dimensional case if x₀ is increased, the probability density or mass function shifts rigidly to the right, maintaining its exact shape.

A location parameter can also be found in families having more than one parameter, such as location–scale families. In this case, the probability density function or probability mass function will be a special case of the more general form

_f__(_x_₀, _θ_)(_x_) = _f__(_θ_)(_x_ − _x_₀)
where x₀ is the location parameter, _θ_ represents additional parameters, and f_(θ) is a function parametrized on the additional parameters.


Additive noise

An alternative way of thinking of location families is through the concept of additive noise. If x₀ is a constant and _W_ is random noise with probability density f_(W)(w), then X = x₀ + W has probability density f_(x₀)(x) = f_(W)(x − x₀) and its distribution is therefore part of a location family.
