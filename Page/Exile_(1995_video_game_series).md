_EXILE_ is a series of role-playing video games created by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software.[1] They were released as shareware titles for Macintosh and Windows systems. _Exile III_ was also ported to Linux by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the _Avernum_ series. Common to all games in the _Exile_ series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of Exile I and II had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with Exile III's graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.


Gameplay

In each game, the player is required to create six characters to form a party of adventurers or may instead use a default party. The characters' general, combat, magic and miscellaneous skills can be customized along with the character names and graphics. From Exile II onward, characters can have their traits and race configured.

The games have three modes including Outdoor Mode, Town Mode and Combat Mode. In Outdoor Mode, the party can enter a town, engage a group of enemies in Combat Mode and rest (if the party has food). In Town Mode, the party can talk to people, purchase from shops (provided they have enough gold), train the characters (provided they have sufficient gold and skill points), find sub-quests, pick up items (From Exile 2 onward, items can be stolen) and enter Combat Mode. In Combat Mode, the party can attack enemies, defend themselves and pick up adjacent items. Combat Mode can be ended at any time in towns, but can only end outdoors when all enemies are killed.

Magic is divided into Mage and Priest spell types. Spells for attacking can be only be cast in Combat Mode. Some spells, such as Light spells, can be cast at any time. Other spells can only be cast outdoors or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with spells up to level 3, but higher level or certain spells must be purchased or found in special encounters.


Games

_Exile I: Escape from the Pit_

The first game of the _Exile_ trilogy released in January 1995 sees a party of newly created characters thrown from the world above into the subterranean world known as Exile.[2] Once here, the party discovers a civilization formed from the outcasts of the Empire above, a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. The party meets with many of those who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the peoples of Exile.

The characters become a rallying point around which the people of Exile who desire vengeance gather to focus their energies into finding a way to strike back against the cruel Emperor of the surface. Together, the party manages to assassinate Emperor Hawthorne in his throne room, banish the demon king Grah-hoth who was becoming a significant threat to the citizens of Exile, and secure an escape route to the surface..

_Exile II: Crystal Souls_

The second _Exile_ game follows directly from the first, released in November 1996.[3] The Empire has begun to recognise the threat the Exiles pose and begin sending their army down into Exile in huge numbers. To make matters worse, unknown barriers of energy are sprouting up around the world â€“ sometimes aiding the Exiles, sometimes helping the Empire who can afford the losses much more easily than the Exiles.

A new party of characters meets one of the creatures causing the barriers sprouting up in Exile and go to meet with the unknown race to negotiate. In the end, the party is more successful - and the Vahnatai join with the Exiles to drive out the Empire. With the support of the Vahnatai the Exiles turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repulse their invasion.

_Exile III: Ruined World_

The final release in the _Exile_ trilogy takes place some time after _Exile II_, released in January 1997.[4] The Linux version was ported by Boutell.com in Summer, 2000.[5] A lot of preparation has taken place and now the Exiles are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. However, while the members of the expedition are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes the party encounters are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste.

While scouting the land, as were the expedition members' orders from the nation of Exile, the members are asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. They bring the Exiles and the Empire together as allies trying to find the cause of the destruction.

_Blades of Exile_

_Blades of Exile_ released in December 1997, consists of three short scenarios set after the main trilogy as well as an editor that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the Exile game world at all.[6] Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997. The most prominent meeting places on the web of the Blades of Exile community are the official company-hosted internet forum. These forums offer support for beginning designers and players, reviews of new scenarios and general discussions about the use of the scenario editor. In June 2007, Jeff Vogel released the source code and game content for _Blades of Exile_, which is currently under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.[7]


Release

On December 1, 1998, the first three Exile games also came packaged on a CD called the "Exile Trilogy CD".[8] As of July 8, 2013, these games are freeware on Spiderweb Software's website.


Reception

The _Exile_ trilogy was very well received. _PC Gamer_ wrote that _Exile: Escape from the Pit_ "offers an easygoing point-and-click interface; pleasant, if unambitious, graphics; ... literate prose; and a vast scope." _Exile II: Crystal Souls_ won the 1995 Eddy Award Honorable Mention for Best Shareware Game of the Year, and received a 5 out of 5 star rating from ZiffNet. _Exile III: Ruined World_[9] received the Shareware Game of the Year award from _Computer Gaming World_ and Ziff-Davis Publishing.

Inside Mac Games nominated the first _Exile_ as its pick for the best role-playing game of 1996, but ultimately gave the award to _Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest_.[10]

_Exile II_ was a finalist for _MacUser_{{'}}s award for the best shareware game of 1996.[11]


_Avernum_

More recently the _Exile_ games have been remade as the _Avernum_ series, which replaced the two-dimensional tile-based graphics system with an isometric one and made numerous changes to the RPG system and some changes to the content.[12] Fifth and sixth titles in the series are available under the Avernum moniker and engine.


Engine and Interface

While the game engine itself remained relatively similar between all games in the series, the interface went through many changes. Each iteration sported a new layout and color scheme, as well the individual elements, like the inventory and character roster boxes, were also changed to display information differently. Between _Exile I_ and _Exile II_ the most notable difference is a background color change as well as a change to the border of the play window. Between _Exile II_ and _Exile III_ the interface was changed significantly in that the colors and window styles were changed again but the player roster was overhauled and an inventory window was added. The changes between _Exile III_ and _Blades of Exile_ were more subtle and were again of the color and style nature.
