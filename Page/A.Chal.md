ALEJANDRO CHAL (better known by his stage name A.CHAL)[1][2] is a Peruvian singer-songwriter and producer.[3][4] He released his first EP, _Ballroom Riots_, in 2013.[5][6] His debut studio album, _Welcome to GAZI_, was self-released in June 2016.[7][8] His single, "Round Whippin{{'"}}, was premiered by Zane Lowe in 2015.[9][10] He has performed at the Day N Nite Fest.[11][12][13] _Pigeons & Planes_ named him one of the best new artists in 2015.[14]


Early life

A.CHAL was born in Peru and lived there for 4 years before his family moved to Queens, New York. His mother was from rural northern Peru while his father grew up closer to large Peruvian cities.[15] He began rapping at age 12 and later started making beats and writing songs with a friend at the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a songwriter and producer.[16]


Career

A.CHAL released his debut EP, _Ballroom Riots_, in 2013. The album found some success, which he parlayed into a publishing deal with Sony ATV.[17][18] He then spent two years out of the public spotlight before beginning to release a variety of singles in 2015.[19][20] One of those singles, "Round Whippin'", was debuted online on The Fader and then followed up with a world premiere on Zane Lowe's Beats1 channel and supported on OVO Sound Radio.[21][22][23] As a result of this publicity, A.CHAL was named one of _Pigeons & Planes_ best new artists of 2015.[24] He also performed at the _Interview Magazine_ event during Coachella that year.[25][26]

In February 2015, he released the single "GAZI", which he co-produced with Count Justice.[27] In September 2015, A.CHAL released another a single, "Vibe W/U", which was first publicized by A$AP Rocky on Twitter.[28][29][30] In 2016, A.CHAL performed at the Day N Nite Fest.[31] He also released a few more singles before self-releasing his debut studio album, _Welcome to GAZI_, in June 2016.[32][33] He has since premiered the official music video for "Round Whippin'" with Complex.com[34] and been featured on tracks by Ro James,[35] Stwo,[36] and Tess.[37]

In March 2018, A.CHAL signed with Epic Records.[38]


Musical style

A.CHAL's music generally fits into the hip hop and R&B genres. _USA Today_ has described his music as falling somewhere "in the negative space between Hip-Hop, R&B, chillwave, and pop music."[39] A.CHAL himself has described his music's genre as soul.[40] His sound has also been characterized as "sedated", "hazy", and "almost-psychedelic".[41][42][43] _Remezcla_ has called his voice "sultry, sparse, and desperate".[44]

Lyrically, he largely discusses anecdotal experiences. Writing about his 2016 album _Welcome to GAZI_, Jules Muir of _Pigeons & Planes_ noted that A.CHAL attempts to cut "to the core of many of society's ills and triumphs by tapping into a deep well of personal experiences and anecdotes."[45]
