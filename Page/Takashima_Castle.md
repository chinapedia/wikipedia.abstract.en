is a Japanese castle located in Suwa, central Nagano Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the Edo period, Takashima Castle was home to the Suwa clan, _daimyō_ of Takashima Domain. The castle is also known as or


Situation

Burg_Takashima_Plan.jpg Takashima Castle is originally built on a peninsula extending into Lake Suwa, with the lake itself forming part of its moats. This meant that only the side facing the shore had to have strong ramparts. The Main Bailey (_Honmaru_) [1] was connected to the Second Bailey (_Ni-no-maru_) [2] and Third Bailey (_San-no-Maru_) [3] by bridges, with the Main Bastion (_Koromo-no-nami kuruwa_ ( 衣之波曲輪 )) [K] containing the Main Gate (_Ōtemon_) [A] facing the shore. During the Edo period, increasing sedimentation of Lake Suwa left the castle surrounded by land, and the site is now located the middle of the modern city of Suwa.

Today, the area is a public park. Only the north and east side of the moat has been preserved. In 1970, some of the castle structures were reconstructed, but are not historically accurate.


History

The area around Lake Suwa had been under the control of the Suwa clan since at least the early Heian period; however, the Suwa were conquered in the Sengoku period by Takeda Shingen, who annexed the area to his territories. Takashima Castle was ruled by a succession of Takeda generals (beginning with Itagaki Nobukata) until the defeat and annihilation of the Takeda clan at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575.

The area then came under the control of Oda Nobunaga, who assigned it to one of his generals, Kawajiri Hidetaka. After Nobunaga was assassinated in the Honnō-ji incident,the territory came under the control of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who assigned Hineno Takayoshi as _daimyō_ of Suwa Domain. Hideno Takayoshi began a complete reconstruction of the castle, which was completed by his son, Hideno Yoshiakira. The Hineno were reassigned in 1601, and the domain was returned to the hands of the Suwa clan by Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Suwa remained in control of the castle until the Meiji restoration.

Following the establishment of the Meiji government and the abolition of the han system, the remaining structures of the castle were dismantled in 1875, leaving only the stone foundations. A Shinto Shrine dedicated to the war dead was established within the grounds in 1900 and the area of the Second and Third Baileys was built over as a residential district. The present donjon, _yagura_ and gates are all reconstructions, which were completed in 1970.
