JURGEN DE BREE, performing under the stage name DEBRIS, is a Dutch DJ and producer of electronic music. His first single which was released late 2015 appeared to be a big success among fans of house music as it entered the EDM Charts and managed to climb up to a second position. Few months later he made an unexpected step in his career by going on tour in Myanmar.[1][2] In the first half of 2016 Debris got featured by DJMag as the #3 upcoming Dutch Future House artist with "a golden future ahead". According to DJMag he owes his success to his successful Asia tour and songs.[3] His biggest hit to date is "Game "Over" with over a million plays on YouTube & SoundCloud.

Debris runs his own music label: Futurized Recordings, and hosts his biweekly radio show named Destruction Radio which features guestmixes of known and lesser known artists.
