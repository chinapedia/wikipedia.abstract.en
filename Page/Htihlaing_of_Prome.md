MIN HTIHLAING (, ) was governor of Prome (Pyay) from 1388/89 to 1390, according to the _Maha Yazawin_ and _Hmannan Yazawin_ chronicles.[1][2] However, the two chronicles are internally inconsistent; they say in their Summary of Rulers of Prome section that Htihlaing ruled until 1393/94.[3][4] The other main chronicle _Yazawin Thit_ does not list him as governor of Prome at all.[5]
