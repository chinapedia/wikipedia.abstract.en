_BORONIA CITRIODORA_, commonly known as LEMON-SCENTED BORONIA,[1] LEMON PLANT or LEMON THYME,[2][3] is a woody shrub that is endemic to Tasmania. It has pinnate leaves and white to pink flowers that are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven, in the leaf axils or on the ends of the branches.Boronia_citriodora_1.jpg


Description

_Boronia citriodora_ is a woody shrub that is sometimes prostrate, otherwise erect and growing to a height of . It has pinnate leaves that are long and wide in outline with between three and nine leaflets, on a petiole long. The end leaflet is narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide. The side leaflets are similar but longer. The flowers are white to pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven in leaf axils or on the ends of branches on a stalk long. The four sepals are triangular, long and wide. The four petals are long and the eight stamens have a few short hairs. Flowering occurs from November to February and the mature fruit are smooth, long and wide.[4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Boronia citriodora_ was first formally described in 1855 by Joseph Dalton Hooker from an unpublished description by Ronald Campbell Gunn and the description was published in _The botany of the Antarctic voyage of H.M. Discovery ships Erebus and Terror_.[6][7] The specific epithet (_citriodora_) is derived from the Latin word _citrus_ meaning "citron-tree"[8] and _odoris_ meaning "smell" or "scent".[9] Hooker noted that the plant has a "strong and delicious smell of lemons".[10]

In 2003, Marco Duretto described three subspecies:[11]

-   _Boronia citriodora_ subsp. _citriodora_ that has smooth sepals and leaves less than long;
-   _Boronia citriodora_ subsp. _orientalis_ that has hairy sepals;
-   _Boronia citriodora_ subsp. _paulwilsonii_ that has smooth sepals and at least some leaves more than long.


Distribution and habitat

Lemon-scented boronia grows in heath, woodland and near rainforest, often in rocky places.[12]

-   Subspecies _citriodora_ only grows on the Central Highlands of Tasmania, at altitudes above with disjunct populations further south, including on Mount Field.[13]
-   Subspecies _orientalis_ is only known from Ben Lomond and Mount Barrow;
-   Subspecies _paulwilsonii_ is only known from the south-west of Tasmania, south from Macquarie Harbour and west from Mount Shea.[14][15]


Use in horticulture

_Boronia citriodora_ is cultivated as an ornamental plant for use in gardens. It tolerates sun, shade, wind, heavy frost; and dry, sandy or waterlogged soils.[16]
