Release and composition

"Frequency" originally premiered on Cudi's SoundCloud account on March 25, 2016,[3] but was released for digital download on September 30, 2016.[4] It is the first offering from his sixth studio album, _Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'_, which was released on December 16, 2016.[5] "Frequency" runs for a duration of four minutes and fifty-eight seconds.[6] It was described as "a low-key hip-hop ballad" by _Rolling Stone_ reviewer Elias Leight.[7]


Critical reception

Ryan Middleton of Music Times gave the song a positive review, saying "it has the spacey, stoner sound that fans loved from the Cudi on his first couple of albums".[8] Fuse's Tyler Lauletta wrote that "the song is a return to form for Cudi, with shout-outs to women and psychedelic drugs in his signature sultry tone".[9] Chico from _Respect._ wrote that Cudi "hums, sings and even lyrically dances all over this one, like we always knew he could".[10] C. Vernon Coleman II of _XXL_ wrote; "The dreamy production is highlighted by odd sound effects and spaced out chords".[11]


Music video

The music video for the song, directed by Cudi himself, premiered on October 12, 2016, via his Vevo channel. The five-minute video features Cudi performing the song shirtless in a dark jungle.[12] It also shows him having a threesome in a mushroom cave.[13] Peter A. Berry of _XXL_ wrote that the video is "simultaneously dark and colorful, much like the music Cudi’s provided for fans over the last eight years".[14] The Boombox's Jacinta Howard called the video "dark and artistic", while _Rap-Up_ called it "dark and smoky".[15][16] Elisabeth Brier from Uproxx wrote; "It’s a sort of R-rated Wonderland. That’s perhaps the best way to describe the world depicted in Kid Cudi‘s new music video for "Frequency"."[17] Pigeons & Planes named it as one of the best music videos released in October 2016.[18]
