_CAR MECHANIC SIMULATOR 2015_ is a simulation video game depicting the work of an automotive mechanic. It was released on 23 April 2015 for the PC,[1] with a mobile release the following year.[2] The game is a sequel to _Car Mechanic Simulator 2014_, and was followed by _Car Mechanic Simulator 2018_.


Gameplay

The game is played from a first-person perspective, with the player able to walk freely around the shop and a few other areas. Instead of levels, the game is divided into "jobs" - customer vehicles with a list of problems - which the player must troubleshoot and repair. Upon receiving a job and a vehicle, the player is required to remove, inspect, and replace the relevant broken parts. When a vehicle is reassembled, it may be taken for a test drive before being returned to the customer.


Reception

_Car Mechanic Simulator_ received average reviews from critics, with a 68% positive rating according to Metacritic.[3]

_PCWorld_ rated the game 3.5 stars out of 5, praising the detail but criticizing the lack of variety as a "grind".[4]

_Polygon_ editor Griffin McElroy received the game positively in a video demo, but the website did not give an official review.[5]

_PCGamer's_ Christopher Livingston reviewed the game satirically, complaining that "it doesn't offer the most advanced simulation gameplay experience ever" as it lacks argumentative customers, slow computer systems, and the ability to frustrate clients by altering small details of their cars' interiors.[6]
