"A WALK TO CAESAREA" (, _Halika LeKaysarya_), also commonly known by the opening words ELI, ELI (, "My God, My God") in the song version, is a poem in Hebrew written in 1942 by Hungarian Jewish WWII resistance fighter Hannah Szenes,[1] which Israeli composer David Zehavi set to music in 1945.[2] Szenes wrote the poem while residing in kibbutz Sdot Yam which is located a short distance along the Mediterranean coast from the ancient port town of Caesarea.

The song is considered one of Israel's unofficial anthems,[3] and is the most-commonly played song on Yom HaShoah (the Holocaust Memorial Day) in Israel.[4]

The following is an English translation of the song version:

_My God, my God,_
_may it never end â€“_
_the sand and the sea,_
_the rustle of the water,_
_the brilliance of the sky,_
_the prayer of man._
