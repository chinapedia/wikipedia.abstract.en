_FOUR KEYS_ is an album by pianist Martial Solal with saxophonist Lee Konitz, guitarist John Scofield and bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen recorded in West Germany in 1979 and released on the MPS label.[1][2][3] The album was also released in the US on Pausa Records.


Critical reception

Scott Yanow of Allmusic said "An all-star quartet explores seven diverse Solal originals that range from chamberlike pieces to fairly free group improvising. The results are often exciting if cool in both tone and volume. Thoughtful yet unpredictable music".[4]
