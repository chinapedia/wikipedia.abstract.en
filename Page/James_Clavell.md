JAMES CLAVELL (born CHARLES EDMUND DUMARESQ CLAVELL, 10 October 1921[1] – 6 September 1994), was an Australian (and later naturalized American) novelist, screenwriter, director, and World War II veteran and prisoner of war. Clavell is best known as the author of his Asian Saga novels, a number of which have had television adaptations. Clavell also authored such screenplays as those for _The Fly_ (1958) (based on the short story by George Langelaan) and _The Great Escape_ (1963) (based on the personal account of Paul Brickhill).


Biography

Early life

Born in Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell, a Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia with the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 to 1922. Clavell was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School, after which he returned to Australia.

World War Two

During 1940, aged 19, Clavell joined the Royal Artillery, and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese. Wounded by machine gun fire, he was eventually captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java. Later he was transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore.

Clavell suffered greatly at the hands of his Japanese captors. According to the introduction to Clavell's novel _King Rat_ (1962), over 90 per cent of the prisoners who entered Changi never walked out.[2] Clavell was reportedly saved, along with an entire battalion, by an American prisoner of war who later became the model for "The King" in _King Rat_.

Post-war career

By 1946, Clavell had become a captain, but a motorcycle accident ended his military career. He enrolled with the University of Birmingham, where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951).[3] He would visit her on set while making films and began to be interested in becoming a film director.[4]

Early work on films

Clavell entered the film industry via distribution and worked at that in England for a number of years. He tried to get into producing but had no luck so started writing screenplays. In 1954 he moved to New York, then to Hollywood. While trying to break into screenwriting he paid the bills working as a carpenter.[5]

In 1956, he sold a script about pilots to RKO, _Far Alert_.[6] The same year Michael Pate bought a story of his _Forbidden Territory_ for filming.[7]

Neither was filmed but _Far Alert_ kept being sold and re-sold. "In 18 months it brought in $87,000," he later said. "We kept getting paid for writing it and rewriting it as it went from one studio to another. It was wonderful."[8] It was later sold to Fox where it attracted the attention of Robert L. Lippert who hired Clavell to write the science-fiction horror movie _The Fly_ (1958). This became a hit and launched Clavell as a screenwriter.

He wrote _Watusi_ (1959) for director Kurt Neumann, who had also made _The Fly_.

Clavell wrote _Five Gates to Hell_ (1959) for Lippert, and when they could not find a suitable director, Clavell was given the job.[9]

Paramount hired Clavell to write a film about the Bounty mutineers.[10] It ended up not being made. Neither was a proposed movie about Francis Powers.[11] Clavell did write produced and directed a Western at Paramount, _Walk Like a Dragon_ (1960).

In 1959, Clavell wrote "Moon Landing" and "First Woman in the Moon", two episodes of _Men into Space_, a "day after tomorrow"-style science fiction drama, which depicted, in realistic terms, the (at the time) near future of space exploration.

In 1960 he had written a Broadway show with John Sturgis, _White Alice_, a thriller set in the Arctic.[12] It was never produced.

Early prose and screenplay work

In 1960 the Writers Guild went on strike, meaning Clavell was unable to work. He decided to write a novel, _King Rat_, based on his time at Changi. It took him three months and several more months after that to rework it. The book was published in 1962 and sold well. It was turned into a film in 1965.[13]

In 1961, Clavell announced he had formed his own company, Cee Productions, who would make the films _King Rat_, _White Alice_ and _No Hands on the Clock_.[14]

In 1962 he signed a multi picture contract with a Canadian company to produce and direct two films there, _Circle of Greed_ and _The Sweet and the Bitter_.[15] Only the second was made and it was not released until 1967.

He wrote scripts for the war films _The Great Escape_ (1963) and _633 Squadron_ (1964).[16]

He wrote a short story, "The Children's Story" (1964) and the script for _The Satan Bug_ (1965), directed by John Sturges who had made _The Great Escape_. He also wrote _Richard Sahib_ for Sturges which was never made.[17]

Clavell wanted to write a second novel because "that separates the men from the boys".[18] The money from _King Rat_ enabled him to spend two years researching and then writing what became _Tai-Pan_ (1966). It was a huge bestseller, and Clavell sold the film rights for a sizeable amount (although the movie would not be made until 1986).[19]

Leading film director

Clavell returned to filmmaking. He wrote, produced and directed _To Sir, With Love_ (1967), featuring Sidney Poitier and based on E. R. Braithwaite's semiautobiographical 1959 book. It was a huge critical and commercial success.[20]

Clavell was now in much demand as a filmmaker. He produced and directed _Where's Jack?_ (1969), a highwayman film which was a commercial failure.[21] So too was an epic film about the Thirty Year War, _The Last Valley_ (1971).[22]

Career as novelist

Clavell returned to novel writing, which was the focus of the remainder of his career. He spent three years researching and writing _Shōgun_ (1975), about an Englishman who becomes a samurai in feudal Japan. It was another massive best seller. Clavell was heavily involved in the 1980 mini-series which starred Richard Chamberlain and achieved huge ratings.

In the late 1970s he spent three years researching and writing his fourth novel, _Noble House_ (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963. It was another best seller and was turned into a miniseries in 1986.[23]

Clavell briefly returned to filmmaking and directed a thirty-minute adaptation of his novelette _The Children's Story_. He was meant to do a sequel to _Shogun_ but instead found himself writing a novel about the 1979 revolution in Iran, _Whirlwind_ (1986).[24]

Clavell eventually returned to the _Shogun_ sequel, writing _Gai-Jin_ (1993). This was his last completed novel at the time of his death.

Novelist

_The New York Times_ said that "Clavell has a gift. It may be something that cannot be taught or earned. He breathes narrative ... He writes in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows".[25] His first novel, _King Rat_ (1962), was a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences at Changi. When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, _Tai-Pan_ (1966), was a fictional account of Jardine Matheson's successful career in Hong Kong, as told via the character who was to become Clavell's heroic archetype, Dirk Struan. Struan's descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. _Tai-Pan_ was adapted as a movie in 1986.

Clavell's third novel, _Shōgun_ (1975), is set in 17th century Japan, and it tells the story of a shipwrecked English navigator in Japan, based on that of William Adams. When the story was made into a TV miniseries in 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second highest rated miniseries in history with an audience of more than 120 million, after _Roots_.[26]

Clavell's fourth novel, _Noble House_ (1981), became a bestseller that year and was adapted into a TV miniseries in 1988.

Following the success of _Noble House_, Clavell wrote _Thrump-o-moto_ (1985), _Whirlwind_ (1986), and _Gai-Jin_ (1993).

Peter Marlowe

Peter Marlowe is Clavell's author surrogate,[27] and a character of the novels _King Rat_ and _Noble House_ (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan's) in _Whirlwind_ (1986). Featured most prominently in _King Rat_, Marlowe is an English prisoner of war in Changi prison during World War II. In _Noble House_, set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong. Marlowe's ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels.

In _Noble House_ Marlowe is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalized, is based on real events (like those in _King Rat_). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, "Perhaps I'm not there at all", although in a later scene, he admits he was "the hero, of course".[28]

Politics and later life

In 1963 Clavell became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[33] Politically, he was said to have been an ardent individualist and proponent of _laissez-faire_ capitalism, as many of his books' heroes exemplify. Clavell admired Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist school of philosophy, and sent her a copy of _Noble House_ during 1981 inscribed: "This is for Ayn Rand—one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks. James C, New York, 2 September 81."[34]


Death

In 1994, Clavell died in Switzerland from a stroke while suffering from cancer. He died one month before his 73rd birthday. After sponsorship by his widow, the library and archive of the Royal Artillery Museum at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in southeast London, was renamed the James Clavell Library in his honour.[35] The library was later closed pending the opening of a new facility in Salisbury, Wiltshire;[36] however, James Clavell Square on the Woolwich riverside remains.
