Club career

In 2015, Gwinn joined Bundesliga team SC Freiburg for the 2015–16 season at the age of 16 years.[4][5] She had initially agreed to sign for Freiburg in February 2015, rejecting competing offers from FC Bayern Munich and Turbine Potsdam.[6] On 13 September 2015 (3rd Round) she debuted in a 6–1 home win over 1. FC Köln. She substituted in for Sandra Starke, making her Bundesliga debut as a 16-year-old. A month later, on 11 October 2015 (5th Round), in the match against SV Werder Bremen, was her first time in the starting lineup. On 6 December 2015 (10th matchday) she scored in a 6–1 home win over Bayer Leverkusen.[7]

International career

Youth

Gwinn has represented Germany on the under-15, under-16 and under-17 national teams. At the age of 13 years, she was called up by coach Bettina Wiegmann for under-15 national team training in November 2012.[9] She made her debut for the U-15 national team in April 2013,[10] a substitute in an 8–0 win over the Netherlands.[11] She made three appearances for the under-16 national team in 2014.[12] In 2015, she was the youngest player in the U-17 national team squad for the European Championship in Iceland where the team reached the semi-finals but were defeated 0–1 by the Swiss selection.[13] UEFA's technical report noted that Gwinn's pace on the right wing had been a positive feature of Germany's play.[14] In May 2016, the team won the 2016 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship after a penalty shootout against Spain in Belarus.[15] The four Freiburg players in the squad contributed seven of Germany's 10 goals at the tournament and two of them, including Gwinn, successfully converted their kicks in the shootout.[16]

At the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Jordan, Gwinn helped Germany beat Venezuela 2–1 in their opening match earning her the "Player of the Match" award.[17] She scored the first goal with a volley, then assisted on the second.[18] Entering the tournament with 23 Under-17 caps and as a first team player with Freiburg, Gwinn was considered one of the pillars of the team.[19] In the Germans' second match against Canada, Gwinn's direct free kick salvaged a 1–1 draw.[20] In the third match, Gwinn scored a goal in Germany's victory over Cameroon.[21]

She played in the 2017 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship (scoring a goal against Scotland[22]) in Northern Ireland where she reached the semi-final and with this she qualified for the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup (where scored a goal against China[23] and was named "Player of the Match" against Nigeria[24]).

She was named "Player of the Match" for her contribution.[26] The German World Cup campaign ended in the quarterfinals after a 2-1 loss to Sweden.
