NATIONAL CORPS (), also referred to as the NATIONAL CORPS PARTY, and previously called PATRIOTS OF UKRAINE, is a Ukrainian far-right political party founded in 2016, and led by Andriy Biletsky.[1][2] The basis of the party were veterans of the Azov regiment of Ukraine's National Guard and members of the Azov Civil Corps (a non-military non-governmental organisation associated with the Azov regiment).[3]


History

Two hundred and ninety-two delegates from all over Ukraine attended the founding congress of the party in Kiev on 14 October 2016.[4] The party was previously registered as "Patriots of Ukraine" (). The congress unanimously elected Andriy Biletsky (a member of the Ukrainian parliament) as leader,[5][6] and elected Nazariy Kravchenko (Azov National Guard Headquarters Commander) as deputy leader and appointed members of the party's ruling council.[7] The congress approved changes to the party's charter and political programme.[8] The congress ended with a "Nation March", which it organised with Right Sector (another far-right organisation). About 5,000 people took part in the torch-lit march from The Motherland Monument (in the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War) to Saint Sophia Square. Some of the marchers wore or carried the yellow and blue symbol of the "Azov Battalion, which resembles a Wolfsangel, a symbol associated with Nazism".[9] 14 October is Defender of Ukraine Day, a public holiday in Ukraine since 2015.[10][11]

In November 2018 National Corps offered to nominate its leader Andriy Biletsky as the candidate of the nationalist political forces (instead of Ruslan Koshulynskyi) in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.[12] But late January 2019 Biletsky stated he would not run during the presidential elections but would concentrate all efforts "to bring our numbers to 50,000 people" and have a successful 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election.[13]

In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election National Corps joined a united party list with the political parties Svoboda, Governmental Initiative of Yarosh and Right Sector.[14]


Ideology

The party advocates expanding the powers of the President of Ukraine by granting him authority to be the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as well as the head of government.[15][16]

National Corps favours restoring Ukraine's nuclear power status and nationalising enterprises which were Ukrainian SSR-owned when Ukraine gained independent in 1991.[17] The party wants Ukraine to break all ties with Russia (diplomatic, trade and cultural ties).[18] It is against Ukraine joining the European Union and against Ukraine joining NATO.[19] It wants to create the "Intermarium Union" with Baltic and Black Sea nations (to include Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, etc.[20]).[21] The party also advocates expanding the right to bear arms and initiate public discussion about restoring capital punishment for treason and the embezzlement of excessive amounts of government funds by officials.[22]

National Corps espouses economic nationalism and protectionism.[23]
