GUY SAVILLE (born 1973) is a British author best known for _The Afrika Reich_ trilogy, which includes _The Afrika Reich_ (2011), _The Madagaskar Plan_ (2015), and a forthcoming novel tentatively referred to as _Afrika Three._

Saville held a poll on his website, with over 100 votes cast, in which he asked his readers what the third novel should be named, giving the two options as _The Sahara Solution_ and _The Sahara Projekt_. About 60% of the votes cast were in favor of the second title.[1]
