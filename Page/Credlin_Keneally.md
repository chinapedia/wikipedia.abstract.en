_CREDLIN KENEALLY_ (originally announced as _CREDLIN & KENEALLY_) is an Australian television news and commentary program broadcast weekly on Sky News Australia.[1] The program is co-hosted by Peta Credlin and Kristina Keneally and features long-form discussion of political issues between the presenters.[2]

The format marks the first time a program on Sky News has been hosted by two women.[3] The program is the first permanent hosting position for Credlin, who joined Sky News as a contributor in May 2016.[4] It is the fourth format Keneally has hosted, having previously co-hosted axed programs _The Cabinet_ and _Keneally and Cameron_, while she continues co-hosting daytime program _To The Point_ with Peter van Onselen.[5] The announcement came just three months after the pair guest hosted an episode of _The Friday Show_ together.[6]

The program was broadcast from the Sky News centre in the Sydney suburb of Macquarie Park. It premiered on 16 November 2016 at 8pm AEDT.[7] The program was put into hiatus in May 2017.[8]
