La_Grande_Chartreuse.JPG A CHARTERHOUSE (, , , ) is a monastery of Carthusian monks. The English word is derived by phono-semantic matching from the French word _Chartreuse_.[1] The English name is sometimes misunderstood to indicate that the houses were created by charter, a grant of legal rights by a high authority.

The first monastery of the order was established at Grande Chartreuse, in a valley of the Chartreuse Mountains, in 1084 by St Bruno of Cologne.[2]
