Her uncle Aaron Albert Mossell II was the first African-American from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. Her first cousin Sadie Tanner Mossell was the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States, also at the University of Pennsylvania. Another first cousin was singer and activist Paul Robeson. Her grandfather Charles Hicks Bustill was a prominent abolitionist in Philadelphia.[3]


Career

Mary Campbell Mossell taught kindergarten from 1907 to 1908 in Darby, Pennsylvania. She wrote for several newspapers, including the _Philadelphia Courant_, the _Philadelphia Tribune_, and the _Washington Sun_. She was president of the Harriet Tubman Association, and the Sojourner Truth Suffrage League, and she organized the Phillis Wheatley Literary Society. She was the author of _Afro American Men and Women who Count_ (1915).[4] In 1927-1928, she headed a national survey of black women wage earners.[5] With Anna J. Cooper, she established a New Jersey summer camp for Philadelphia children.[6]

Mary Mossell Griffin chaired the suffrage department of the Northeastern Federation of Women's Clubs during the 1910s, and of the legal department of the National Association of Colored Women[7] during the 1920s.[8] In the latter role, she took an active role in seeing an anti-lynching bill successfully through the Pennsylvania legislature.[9] She was president of the Northeast Republican Women's Alliance in 1924.[10] In 1940, she was selected to chair the Phillis Wheatley Monument Fund, to erect a monument at the Boston gravesite of Wheatley.[11]

Mossell Griffin took an interest in local affairs too. In 1934, she led a successful campaign to employ black clerks at an open air produce market in Philadelphia.[12] In 1941, she supported parents protesting about an overcrowded school in need of repairs.[13] In 1936, Mary Mossell Griffin ran for a seat on Philadelphia's 7th Ward executive committee.[14]


Personal life

Mary C. Mossell married Joshua R. Griffin Jr., a medical doctor from Richmond, Virginia, in 1909. They had one child, Francis Raleigh Griffin.[15] She was widowed when Dr. Griffin died in 1931.[16] She was still alive when her younger sister died in January 1963.[17]
