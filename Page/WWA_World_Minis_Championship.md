The WWA WORLD MINIS CHAMPIONSHIP is a professional wrestling championship promoted by the Mexican Lucha libre wrestling-based promotion the World Wrestling Association (WWA). The championship is exclusively competed for in the _Mini-Estrellas_, or Minis, division. A "Mini" is not necessarily a person with dwarfism, as in North American Midget wrestling; it can also be very short wrestlers who work in the _Mini-Estrellas_ division.[1] The championship was created at some point before May 5, 2000 where Piratita Morgan successfully defended it against Octagoncito, but the actual creation date, or how Piratita Morgan became champion has not been documented.[2][3]
