Club tournaments

LEL

The LIGA ESPAÑOLA DE LACROSSE is the main lacrosse competition in Spain. Until 2013, it was usual that teams without enough players played combined. Since 2014, a new league format was approved dividing teams into LEL and LEL2, joining the LEL only the teams that have at least ten players.

In 2011, the league changed its name to LIGA IBÉRICA DE LACROSSE as Portuguese team ACM Coimbra participated in two stages of the league.[1]
