The EUROPEAN RADIO AMATEURS' ORGANIZATION (EURAO), established in 2005, is intended to be a meeting point for all those independent radio amateurs' associations around the world, mainly from Europe, interested in sharing their activities and experiences, making up common services, working together in new projects and, of course, lobbying Public Administrations.

As its name implies, the most important for EURAO are _radio amateurs_, i.e. people, even more than the hobby itself: amateur radio. This is the reason why individuals from any country in the world are welcome to join as members. In fact, they are for whom this project makes sense.


History

In 2005 the first idea of EURAO arise and immediately several European radio amateurs' associations started to strengthen their relationship and to work together, becoming a _de facto_ association.

In 2009 these associations constituted a PROMOTERS COMMITTEE with the aim to do the necessary steps to fully legalize the Organization.

In 2010 the EUROBUREAUQSL service was launched like a coordinated network of QSL bureaus members already run.

In 2011 the first face to face Meeting took place in Barcelona (Spain).

In 2012 was the international official presentation at HAM RADIO fair, in Friedrichshafen (Germany).

In 2013 the first STATUTES were approved and a BOARD OF DIRECTORS elected.

In 2014 the headquarters was moved from Belgium to France, becoming a registered/declared association under the law of 1st July 1901.

In 2015 a LoU was signed with CEPT/ECC.

In 2016 EURAO participated in two CEPT/ECC/WGFM meetings: in Helsinki and Bordeaux.
