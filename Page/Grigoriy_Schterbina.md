GRIGORIY STEPANOVICH SCHTERBINA () was a Russian diplomat, the Russian consul seated in Mitrovica (Kosovo Vilayet) from late 1902 until his death in April 1903 from shot wounds.

The Russian Empire decided to open a consulate in Mitrovica following the Kolašin affair (1901). At the beginning of 1903, Muslim Albanian chieftains met in Yakova after the Ottoman reform plans, and decided to murder leading Serbs in the Peć _nahiya_ and compel other Serbs to flee to Serbia or be Turkicized. The plan was to rout Ottoman authorities in Peć, kill the notable Serbs, then move to Mitrovica and confront the Russian consulate. While supervising Ottoman defending troops, on 31 March Shcherbin was shot by an Ottoman Albanian corporal. He died ten days later.
