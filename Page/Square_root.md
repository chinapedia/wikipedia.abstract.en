In mathematics, a SQUARE ROOT of a number _a_ is a number _y_ such that ; in other words, a number _y_ whose _square_ (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or ) is _a_.[1] For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16 because . Every nonnegative real number _a_ has a unique nonnegative square root, called the _principal square root_, which is denoted by , where √ is called the _radical sign_ or _radix_. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by = 3, because and 3 is nonnegative. The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the _radicand_. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this example 9.

Every positive number _a_ has two square roots: , which is positive, and −, which is negative. Together, these two roots are denoted as ± (see ± shorthand). Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation "_the_ square root" is often used to refer to the _principal square root_. For positive _a_, the principal square root can also be written in exponent notation, as _a_^(1/2).[2]

Square roots of negative numbers can be discussed within the framework of complex numbers. More generally, square roots can be considered in any context in which a notion of "squaring" of some mathematical objects is defined (including algebras of matrices, endomorphism rings, etc.)


History

The Yale Babylonian Collection YBC 7289 clay tablet was created between 1800 BC and 1600 BC, showing and /2 = 1/ as 1;24,51,10 and 0;42,25,35 base 60 numbers on a square crossed by two diagonals.[3] (1;24,51,10) base 60 corresponds to 1.41421296 which is a correct value to 5 decimal points (1.41421356...).

The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a copy from 1650 BC of an earlier Berlin Papyrus and other textspossibly the Kahun Papyrusthat shows how the Egyptians extracted square roots by an inverse proportion method.[4]

In Ancient India, the knowledge of theoretical and applied aspects of square and square root was at least as old as the _Sulba Sutras_, dated around 800–500 BC (possibly much earlier). A method for finding very good approximations to the square roots of 2 and 3 are given in the _Baudhayana Sulba Sutra_.[5] Aryabhata in the _Aryabhatiya_ (section 2.4), has given a method for finding the square root of numbers having many digits.

It was known to the ancient Greeks that square roots of positive whole numbers that are not perfect squares are always irrational numbers: numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers (that is to say they cannot be written exactly as _m/n_, where _m_ and _n_ are integers). This is the theorem _Euclid X, 9_ almost certainly due to Theaetetus dating back to circa 380 BC.[6] The particular case [[Square_root_of_2| \pm i\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - x}{2}}, where the sign of the imaginary part of the root is taken to be the same as the sign of the imaginary part of the original number, or positive when zero. The real part of the principal value is always nonnegative.

For example, the principal square roots of are given by:

$$\begin{align}
   \sqrt{i} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1+i),\\
   \sqrt{-i} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1-i).
 \end{align}$$

Notes

In the following, the complex _z_ and _w_ may be expressed as:

-   z = |z|e^(iθ_(z))
-   w = |w|e^(iθ_(w))

where  − π < θ_(z) ≤ π and  − π < θ_(w) ≤ π.

Because of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the following laws are NOT TRUE in general.

-   $\sqrt{zw} = \sqrt{z} \sqrt{w}$ (counterexample for the principal square root: and ) This equality is valid only when  − π < θ_(z) + θ_(w) ≤ π
-   $\frac{\sqrt{w}}{\sqrt z} = \sqrt{\frac{w}{z}}$ (counterexample for the principal square root: and )This equality is valid only when  − π < θ_(w) − θ_(z) ≤ π
-   $\sqrt{z^*} = \left( \sqrt z \right)^*$ (counterexample for the principal square root: )This equality is valid only when θ_(z) ≠ π

A similar problem appears with other complex functions with branch cuts, e.g., the complex logarithm and the relations or which are not true in general.

Wrongly assuming one of these laws underlies several faulty "proofs", for instance the following one showing that :

$$\begin{align}
-1 &= i \cdot i \\
&= \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1} \\
&= \sqrt{\left(-1\right)\cdot\left(-1\right)} \\
&= \sqrt{1} \\
&= 1
\end{align}$$

The third equality cannot be justified (see invalid proof). It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of √ so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains ()·(). The left-hand side becomes either

$$\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}=i \cdot i=-1$$

if the branch includes +_i_ or

$$\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}=(-i) \cdot (-i)=-1$$

if the branch includes −_i_, while the right-hand side becomes

$$\sqrt{\left(-1\right)\cdot\left(-1\right)}=\sqrt{1}=-1,$$

where the last equality, , is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of √.


Square roots of matrices and operators

If _A_ is a positive-definite matrix or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator _B_ with ; we then define . In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them. For example, the identity matrix has an infinity of square roots,[7] though only one of them is positive definite.


In integral domains, including fields

Each element of an integral domain has no more than 2 square roots. The difference of two squares identity is proved using the commutativity of multiplication. If and are square roots of the same element, then . Because there are no zero divisors this implies or , where the latter means that two roots are additive inverses of each other. In other words if an element a square root of an element exists, then the only square roots of are and . The only square root of 0 in an integral domain is 0 itself.

In a field of characteristic 2, an element either has one square root or does not have any at all, because each element is its own additive inverse, so that . If the field is finite of characteristic 2 then every element has a unique square root. In a field of any other characteristic, any non-zero element either has two square roots, as explained above, or does not have any.

Given an odd prime number , let for some positive integer . A non-zero element of the field [[finite_field|}}}

where the two-digit pattern {3, 6} repeats over and over again in the partial denominators. Since , the above is also identical to the following generalized continued fractions:

$$\sqrt{11} = 3 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \ddots}}}}} = 3 + \cfrac{6}{20 - 1 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \ddots}}}}}.$$


Geometric construction of the square root

Euclid_Corollary_5.svg up to the triangle with a hypotenuse of ( }})]]

The square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a square with the area equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two similar planar Euclidean objects has the area _a_ times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is .

A square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his Elements, Euclid (fl. 300 BC) gave the construction of the geometric mean of two quantities in two different places: Proposition II.14 and Proposition VI.13. Since the geometric mean of _a_ and _b_ is , one can construct simply by taking .

The construction is also given by Descartes in his _La Géométrie_, see figure 2 on page 2. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.

Euclid's second proof in Book VI depends on the theory of similar triangles. Let AHB be a line segment of length with and . Construct the circle with AB as diameter and let C be one of the two intersections of the perpendicular chord at H with the circle and denote the length CH as _h_. Then, using Thales' theorem and, as in the proof of Pythagoras' theorem by similar triangles, triangle AHC is similar to triangle CHB (as indeed both are to triangle ACB, though we don't need that, but it is the essence of the proof of Pythagoras' theorem) so that AH:CH is as HC:HB, i.e. , from which we conclude by cross-multiplication that , and finally that . When marking the midpoint O of the line segment AB and drawing the radius OC of length , then clearly OC > CH, i.e. (with equality if and only if ), which is the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality for two variables and, as noted above, is the basis of the Ancient Greek understanding of "Heron's method".

Another method of geometric construction uses right triangles and induction: can, of course, be constructed, and once has been constructed, the right triangle with legs 1 and has a hypotenuse of . Constructing successive square roots in this manner yields the Spiral of Theodorus depicted above.
