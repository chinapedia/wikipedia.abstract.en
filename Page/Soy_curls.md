SOY CURLS are a meat alternative created and sold by Butler Foods LLC, based out of Grand Ronde, Oregon.[1][2][3] The product is made from non-GMO soybeans that have not been sprayed with chemical pesticides. Once cooked, the curls have a unique texture and flavor, similar to that of chicken.[4] Other comparable products are seitan, wheatmeat, and tempeh.


Preparation

To prepare, the soy curls have to be first rehydrated by soaking in warm water for 10 minutes. Then they are drained, added to a skillet, seasoned, and cooked until lightly browned.
