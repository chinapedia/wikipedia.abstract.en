_MISSIAMMA_ is a 1955 Indian Tamil-language romantic comedy film directed by L. V. Prasad. Produced by B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani{{'s}} Vijaya Vauhini Studios, the film's script was adapted by Chakrapani from two Bengali-language novels: Rabindranath Maitra's _Manmoyee Girls School_ and Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay{{'s}} _Detective_. _Missiamma_ also focused on social issues such as unemployment, corruption, and freedom of worship.

Production began in early 1954. The film was simultaneously shot in Telugu as _Missamma_, with an altered cast. _Missiamma_ tells the story of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: Balu and Mary. They pose as a married couple to obtain jobs in a high school founded by Gopal, the zamindar of Aandipettai. As Balu and Mary fall in love, Gopal's nephew Raju (an amateur detective) learns that Mary is Gopal's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi; she is unaware of her true identity.

Bhanumathi Ramakrishna was originally cast as the female lead, with Gemini Ganesan playing the male lead. After a dispute with Bhanumathi, Chakrapani replaced her with Savitri. K. A. Thangavelu, Jamuna, S. V. Ranga Rao, Rushyendramani, and K. Sarangkapani were cast in supporting roles while M. N. Nambiar was cast as the antagonist. C. P. Jambulingam and Kalyanam edited the film; Marcus Bartley was the cinematographer, and S. Rajeswara Rao composed the music.

Principal photography took place in and around Madras (now Chennai) and wrapped in December 1954. _Missiamma_ was released in theatres on 14 January 1955, two days after _Missamma_. Both versions were commercially successful, completing 100-day theatrical runs. The bilingual film brought recognition to its cast and studio. AVM Productions remade the film in Hindi as _Miss Mary_ in 1957, with Ganesan reprising his role.


Plot

The Zamindar runs a school in the village _Aandipettai_. He wants to replace the existing teacher with someone with higher qualification. He decides to appoint a husband and wife couple as head master and wife. When he advertised in the papers, a Hindu young man who is looking for a job wants to apply for it. But he is not married. By circumstances he meets an unmarried young girl who is looking for a way to earn some money to set off a loan taken by her father. But she is a Christian. However, the young man and young woman come to an understanding and present themselves as husband and wife to the Zamindar. He appoints them as headmaster and teacher. The young woman also teaches music to the Zamindar's daughter.

Zamindar and his wife lost their elder daughter 15 years ago in a temple festival. In fact, he named the school after the lost child, Mahalakshmi. Now the young woman teacher reminds them of their elder daughter and they shower love on her.

A nephew of the Zamindar who is a self-styled detective, takes it upon himself to search and find the missing child.

After some confusion and much banter, it comes to light that the young woman teacher is actually the lost child of the Zamindar. The family re-unites. The young man and the young woman who came pretending as husband and wife marries each other and become real couple at the end.

Production

Development

B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad to direct a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on two Bengali-language novels: Rabindranath Maitra's _Manmoyee Girls School_ and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's _Detective_.[1] Chakrapani thought the plot of _Manmoyee Girls School_, about two unemployed young people who pretend to be married to gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of _Detective_, in which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled _Missamma_ in Telugu and _Missiamma_ in Tamil.[2]

Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote the dialogues for _Missiamma_. Marcus Bartley was signed as director of photography, and C. P. Jambulingam and G. Kalyanasundaram edited the film.[3] Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were its art directors. The film was processed at Vijaya Laboratory and recorded by Western Electric. M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were its executive producers.[4]

Casting

Although _Pathala Bhairavi_ (1951) and _Pelli Chesi Choodu_ (1952) were the first bilingual films shot in Telugu and Tamil, the same actors were used in both versions. _Missiamma_ was the first bilingual film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with different male actors.[5] Bhanumathi Ramakrishna was cast as the female lead, and Gemini Ganesan (then known as R. Ganesh) was cast as the male lead in _Missiamma_, while N. T. Rama Rao played the same role in _Missamma_. S. V. Ranga Rao and Rushyendramani and Doraswamy and Meenakshi were cast as the title character's biological and foster parents, respectively, in both versions. Although all the actors in both versions used the same range of costumes, Ranga Rao wore a _veshti_ for the Tamil version in accordance with Tamil custom.

Prasad had completed four reels of film with Bhanumathi.[6] She wrote to the producers, informing them that she would shoot only in the afternoon because Varalakshmi Vratam was being held at her home. The letter went astray and Chakrapani, a strict disciplinarian, chastised her for arriving late on set.[7] When Bhanumathi refused to apologise, Chakrapani burnt the four reels in front of her and she quit the film. Although Nagi Reddy learned about the letter and tried to mediate, Chakrapani and Bhanumathi refused to reconcile. Chakrapani ordered Prasad to replace Bhanumathi with Savitri, who was initially cast as Sita. Jamuna was signed later for Sita's role,[8] upon Savitri's recommendation.[9]

Savitri benefited the Tamil version by improving the on-screen chemistry with Ganesan; they had secretly married in 1952, before filming began.[10] K. A. Thangavelu and K. Sarangkapani reprise the roles that Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah played in Telugu. M. N. Nambiar was cast as the antagonist.[11]

Filming

Principal photography began in early 1954, with both versions (with different casts) filmed simultaneously. Photographs of Nagi Reddy's younger brother and cinematographer B. N. Konda Reddy's daughter (the latter as Gopalam's missing daughter) were used in the film.[12] The scene where Ganesan's character persuades Savitri's character to pose as his wife was filmed at My Lady's Garden in Madras.[13] For one sequence in his character jumps from a balcony, Ganesan refused a stunt double and performed the scene himself. He repeated this in _Missamma_, serving as Rama Rao's double.[14] Filming was delayed because of Bhanumathi's exit and the difficulty of managing two casts simultaneously. Lasting for a year, it wrapped by the end of December 1954. After they saw the final edited version, Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani gave Dodge automobiles to the film's principal cast.


Themes

_Missiamma_ deals with themes like unemployment and freedom of religion.[15] In her 2002 book _Cinema of Interruptions: Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema_, Lalitha Gopalan wrote that male protagonists in Indian films use the piano to express desire and cited Gemini Ganesan in _Missiamma_ as an example. Pa Dheenadhayalan of _Dinamani_ described Mary as the antithesis of Savitri's role in _Devadasu_ (1953).[16]


Soundtrack

The music was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The lyrics were penned by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. The playback singers are A. M. Rajah, P. Leela and P. Susheela. "Ariya Paruvamada" was Susheela's first song for Rajeswara Rao.[17] The song "Ennai Aalum Mary Maatha", picturised on Savitri's character, is an appeal to Virgin Mary.[18] The song "Ariya Paruvamada" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Kharaharapriya,[19] while "Brindavanamum Nandakumaranum" is set primarily in Shuddha Saveri, with parts of it in Abheri.[20] Songs like "Vaarayo Vennilaave", "Brindavanamum Nandakumaranum", "Ennai Aalum Mary Maatha" and "Pazhaga Theriyavenum" became popular with the Tamil diaspora.[21][22] The songs "Saami Dharmam Thalaikakkum" and "Sitaram Jai Sitaram" were performed by K. Sarangkapani onscreen; however, neither feature on the soundtrack.[23][24]


Release and reception

_Missiamma_ was released in theatres on 14 January 1955, during Thai Pongal, and two days after _Missamma_.[25][26] It was a commercially success, completing a 100-day theatrical run.[27][28] According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai's 2015 book _Madras Studios_, speculation about Savitri's real-life romance with Ganesan played a key role in the success of the film. A postage stamp commemorating Ganesan was introduced in Chennai in February 2006 by Dayanidhi Maran (the-then Minister of Communications and Information Technology) and _Missiamma_ was shown for the occasion.[29]

The February 1955 issue of _Kumudam_ called _Missiamma_ "an interesting film with quality humor": "In the beginning one is uneasy as to how the love affair of a Christian heroine and a Hindu hero is going to be retooled for a comedy", but Prasad "has used every difficult situation as an opportunity for boundless humor". It praised the "moonlit sequence" and Bartley's cinematography, and the magazine _Gundoosi_ described Savitiri's acting as "the best so far". In _L.V. Prasad : a monograph_ (1993), film historian K. N. T. Sastry wrote: "lf cinema was to be considered a tool to forget our worries — here indeed was entertainment: _Missiamma_ answered that definition." In March 2005, film historian S. Theodore Baskaran commented on Ganesan's career best performances and found the one in _Missiamma_ a "delightful" one; he added that the film was a "charming" one which provided breakthrough to Ganesan and Savitri in Tamil cinema.[30]


Remake

Gemini Ganesan reprised his role in AVM Productions' Hindi remake of the film, _Miss Mary_, which marked his Bollywood debut.[31]


Legacy

According to film historian Film News Anandan, _Missiamma_{{'s}} success inspired filmmakers to cast different actors for different versions of their films.[32] On 23 January 1955, a 19-year-old woman gave birth to a baby in the Roxy Theatre in Madras while watching _Missiamma_. Mother and daughter were rushed to Egmore Maternity Hospital, where the baby was named Missiamma.[33] _Missiamma_{{'s}} success made Ganesan adopt the screen name Gemini Ganesan to avoid confusion with Sivaji Ganesan, another popular actor in Tamil cinema. According to film historian Randor Guy, the success of _Missiamma_ and other such romantic films earned Ganesan the tag "Kadhal Mannan" (King of Love).[34] The film was a breakthrough in the careers of Savitri and Jamuna.[35][36] Scenes from _Missiamma_ were later featured in _Kaadhal Mannan_, a documentary on the life of Gemini Ganesan.[37]
