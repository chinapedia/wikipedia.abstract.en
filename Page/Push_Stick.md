A PUSH STICK, PUSH SHOE, or PUSH BLOCK is a safety device used when working with stationary routers, jointers, or power saws such as table saws or bandsaws.[1] The purpose of a push stick is to help the user safely maneuver a workpiece, keeping it flat against a machine table or fence while it is being cut.

Types of push sticks

There are several different categories of push sticks, and many people adapt their own designs.

-   Push Shoes are push devices categorized by a long section to gain more control over the workpiece, and are typically "L" shaped.
-   Push Stick can be a general term to refer to all push devices, or to a specific type categorized by a long handle with a notch in the end.

-   Push Blocks typically are made from a thick block of wood with a handle and a hook on the back to hold onto the workpiece.Table_saw_push_block.jpg
-   Push Pads typically consist of one or two handles and a flat pad with a rubber underside to increase friction with the workpiece. They are typically used with jointers and router tables.
-   Microjig's GRR-Ripper is a hybrid push device that combines characteristics of a push block with a push pad. It uses an adjustable base which allows it to straddle a table saw blade or be used as a push pad.[2]
