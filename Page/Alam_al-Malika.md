ALAM AL-MALIKA (DIED 1130), was the chief adviser and _de facto_ prime minister of the principality of Zubayd in Yemen in 1111-1123, and its ruler in 1123-1130.

She was the slave singer, or _jarya_, to King Mansur ibn Najah of Zubayd or Zabid (r. 1111-1123), a city principality close to Sana'a in Yemen. He was reportedly so impressed by her intelligence and astuteness that he gave her the title _al-hurra_, placed her in charge of state affairs and "made no decision concerning it without consulting her".[1] In 1123, Mansur ibn Najah was poisoned by his vizier Mann Allah, but Alam al-Malika remained in charge of the state of Zubayd. Though she was not allowed to have the _khutba_ proclaimed in her name and thus not given full recognition as monarch, she was the _de facto_ ruler, and it was said of her that "she discharged her task with distinction".[2]
