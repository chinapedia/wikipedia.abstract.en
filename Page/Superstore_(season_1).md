Production

Development

The series was one of three pilots picked up by NBC on January 14, 2015, along with the sitcom _Crowded_; both were green lighted to series status the same day (May 7, 2015).[6] The series was the first project for Ruben Fleischer's newly formed company The District as part of a two-year deal with Universal, as he directed the pilot episode.[7] _Superstore_ was officially picked up as a series on May 7, 2015, by NBC.[8] The first season consisted of eleven episodes, after the episode order was reduced from thirteen on October 19, 2015.[9] It was announced on November 2, 2015, that the show would air the premiere on January 4, 2016, but would be airing two back-to-back episodes on November 30, 2015, following _The Voice_.[10] A promotional poster was released on November 2, 2015.[11]

Casting

It was announced on February 20, 2015, that Lauren Ash had been cast as a series regular, and would be playing Dina, the store’s assistant manager.[12] On March 2, 2015, _Deadline_ reported that _Superstore_ had added three other cast members, which was Colton Dunn, Mark McKinney and Nico Santos. The website reported that Dunn would be playing Garret, the often-sarcastic narrator of the piece, McKinney would be playing Glenn, the intensely store manager, and Santos would be playing Mateo, another new employee and a brown-noser from an impoverished background.[13] On March 12, 2015, Nichole Bloom was announced to have joined the show as Cheyenne, a very pregnant teenage employee.[14][15]

_Deadline_ announced on March 13, 2015, that Ben Feldman had landed the male lead in _Superstore_, as Jonah, a new employee in the superstore Cloud 9.[16] Three days later, _TVLine_ announced on March 16, 2015, that America Ferrera had landed the female lead as the floor supervisor Amy in the Cloud 9 store. It was also reported that Ferrera was also a producer for the show.[17]


Reception

Critical reception

Early reviews for the series were mixed. According to Metacritic, the first season of _Superstore_ holds a score of 58 out of 100, indicating "mixed to average reviews" based on 21 critics.[18] On another review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 54% with a "Rotten" rating, based on 24 critics, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The general consensus is: "_Superstore_{{'}}s talented cast and obvious potential are slightly overshadowed by a tonally jumbled presentation and thin, formulaic writing."[19] As the first season went along, however, reviews started to become more positive. Following the finale "Labor", the _Los Angeles Times_ called it one of TV's best new comedies."[20] Pilot Viruet of _The A.V. Club_ wrote that the "first season ... got better and more confident as it moved on", and that the first-season finale "is a nice little cap to a nice little sitcom that could’ve used a little more attention."[21] After the series aired its Olympics special, _Variety_ wrote that the show was "a funny, pointed and essential workplace comedy", and that "there are no weak links in [the] ensemble".[22]
