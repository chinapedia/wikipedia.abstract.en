_CRYOBACTERIUM_ is a Gram-positive and strictly aerobic bacterial genus from the family of Microbacteriaceae.[1][2][3]

The genus _Cryobacterium_ comes from the Greek words _kryos_ meaning cold and _bakterion_. The type species is _C. psychrophilum_.[4] Cryobacterium is a genus of bacteria of the phylum Actinobacteria, class Actinobacteria, order Micrococcales and family Microbacteriaceae.[5]

Bacteria of this genus grow at a range or temperatures from −6 to 28°C. Most are psychrophilic and psychrotolerant meaning they prefer or are tolerant of cold temperatures. Other characteristics include, strictly aerobic, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. The diagnostic cell-wall amino acid is L‐2,4‐Diaminobutyric acid. The main cellular fatty acids are iso- and anteiso-branched acids and MK-10 is the predominant menaquinone. Polar lipids of Cryobacterium contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid.[6]

The genus _Cryobacterium_ was first proposed in 1997 and the name _Cryobacterium psychrophilum_ was suggested to replace _Curtobacterium psychrophrophilum_ by Ken-Ichiro Suzuki at the Japan Collection of Microorganisms, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan and colleagues. The obligately psychrophilic (cold loving) bacteria was originally discovered from soil in Antarctica by Inoue and Komagata in 1976 who gave the name _Curtobacterium psychrophrophilum_. Based on unusual properties of the organism, Suzuki proposed _C. psychrophilum_ JCM 1463T be classified under a new genus, _Cryobacterium_.[7]


Species of Cryobacterium

Cryobacterium species have been found which are psychrophilic, psychrotolerant, or mesophilic (prefer moderate temperatures).[8] Psychrophilic microorganisms colonize permanently cold environments including deep sea, mountain and polar locations.[9]

_Cryobacterium arcticum_ is psychrotolerant, able to grow between -6 and 28 C, and were isolated from Store Koldewey, north-east Greenland soil.[10]

_Cryobacterium aureum_ is psychrophilic, grow at 0-18 C and were isolated from glacier ice in China.[11]

_Cryobacterium flavum_ grow at 0-19 C and were isolated from glacier ice in China.[12]

_Cryobacterium levicorallinum_ is psychrophilic and isolated from glacier ice in China.[13]

_Cryobacterium luteum_ grows at 0-20 C and was isolated from glacier ice in China.[14]

_Cryobacterium mesophilum_ was collected from a soil sample in Bigeum Island, South Korea and grows optimally at 25-28 C.[15]

_Cryobacterium psychrophilum_ is the type species of the genus described above.

_Cryobacterium psychrotolerans_ is psychrotolerant, able to grow 4–27 °C, optimal growth is at 20–22 °C, isolated from a glacier in China.[16]

_Cryobacterium roopkundense_ is psychrophilic, grows optimally between 15-18 C and was collected at the periphery of the glacial Lake, Roopkund, in the Himalayan mountain range, India.[17]

_Cryobacterium_ sp_._ MLB-32, isolated from cryoconite holes of glaciers in the high Arctic.[18]

_Cryobacterium_ spp. SO1 and SO2 were isolated from snow samples from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica[19]


Biotechnology

Cryobacterium have been found to be a source of carotinoids for biotechnological production. In the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and feed industry these isoprenoid pigments could potentially be used as antioxidants and colorants.[20]

Psychrophilic and psychrotropic bacteria are potential sources of cold-active enzymes and metabolites which may have industrial applications. Genome analysis of _Cryobacterium_ strains SO1 and SO2 showed genes common in cold-adapted bacteria such as molecular chaperones, heat-shock proteins, cold-shock proteins, low-temperature requirement protein A and antifreeze proteins. Enzymes with biotechnological and industrial applications found in the genomes of these _Cryobacteria_ strains include alkaline phosphatase, Uracil-DNA glycosylase, RNase polymerases and ligases for molecular biology. Genes coding for cold-active enzymes such as protease, lipase, amylase, chitinase, superoxide dismutase, beta-galactosidase and neopullulanase were also found.
