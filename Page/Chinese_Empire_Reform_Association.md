Chinese_Empire_Reform_Association_VPL_26814.jpg The CHINESE EMPIRE REFORM ASSOCIATION (known in Chinese as the "Society to Protect the Emperor" or Baohuang Hui 保皇會) was an organization active mostly outside of China that intended to support the Guangxu Emperor in his return to power in the Chinese Empire, which had been taken in a coup by Empress Dowager Cixi. It was formed in Victoria, British Columbia - where its named building still stands - in 1899 by Kang Youwei who had fled China to escape the death penalty. At its peak the association had chapters in 150 cities worldwide. Some of its efforts were factors in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.
