13 September 1217 to 22 July 1218, Simon de Montfort besieges the castle again, without success and on 25 June 1218, he was hit on the head by a stone from a trebuchet, and died.[1]

From 16 June to 1 August 1219 Louis IX laid siege to the castle, again without success. The castle was dismantled in 1549.
