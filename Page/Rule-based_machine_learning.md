RULE-BASED MACHINE LEARNING (RBML) is a term in computer science intended to encompass any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves 'rules' to store, manipulate or apply.[1][2][3] The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.

Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems,[4] association rule learning,[5] artificial immune systems,[6] and any other method that relies on a set of rules, each covering contextual knowledge.

While rule-based machine learning is conceptually a type of rule-based system, it is distinct from traditional rule-based systems, which are often hand-crafted, and other rule-based decision makers. This is because rule-based machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm to automatically identify useful rules, rather than a human needing to apply prior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule set.


Rules

Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {_IF 'condition' THEN 'result'},_ or as a more specific example, _{IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign'}_). An individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Therefore rule-based machine learning methods typically identify a set of rules that collectively comprise the prediction model, or the knowledge base.
