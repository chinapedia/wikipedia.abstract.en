東松家住宅_(2).jpg FUNAIRI-CHŌ (船入町) is a historic neighbourhood located in the Nakamura ward of Nagoya, central Japan.[1]

It was one of the merchant areas, located close to the Hori Canal and south of Nagoya Castle. The translation means a "ship entering town". It was an area of trade and commerce. Houses were in the _machiya_ style, with the commercial area downstairs, and the family living in the back and upstairs. The area was heavily damaged during the bombing of Nagoya in World War II, with a large number of merchant houses destroyed and persons perished.

One of the traditional merchant _machiya_ houses that survived from there is the Tōmatsu House (東松家住宅 , _Tōmatsu-ka jūtaku_), which was constructed in 1901 and relocated to the Meiji-mura museum in the 1970s. It has been designated by the government as an Important Cultural Property.[2]
