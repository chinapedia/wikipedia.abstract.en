JACQUES DUCHESNE-GUILLEMIN (né Jacques Duchesne, born 21 April 1910 in Jupille and died 8 February 2012 in Liège) was a linguist, philologist, and orientalist who was professor at the University of Liège and specialized in ancient Iran.

Duchesne-Guillemin began his teaching career with the untimely death of his collaborator and mentor at the University of Liège, Auguste Bricteux, in 1937, becoming a professor in 1943 and a full professor in 1964.[1]

With the publication of his _Zoroaster_ (a translation of the Gāthās of the Avesta, consisting of seventeen hymns attributed to Zoroaster) in 1948, Duchesne-Guillemin became one of the major figures in the study of the Avestan language of ancient Iran.[2] At different times in his career, he lectured at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California at Los Angeles.[3] His 1962 _La Religion de l’Iran Ancien_ is still considered a masterpiece and the best scholarly introduction to Zoroastrianism despite the decades of subsequent developments in the scholarship of the religion.[4] His international reputation culminated in his appointment, in 1973, as editor of the series _Acta Iranica_.[5]

In 1974, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Tehran.[6]
