_SABAHPHRYNUS_ is a monotypic genus of amphibians in the family Bufonidae. The sole species is _SABAHPHRYNUS MACULATUS_,[1][2] also known as the SPOTTED ASIAN TREE TOAD[3] or SABAH EARLESS TOAD.[4] It is endemic to Borneo where it is only known from Sabah, East Malaysia.[5][6]


Taxonomy

_Sabahphrynus_, as currently understood, results from recognizing two little-known species, _Pedostibes maculatus_ and _Ansonia anotis_, as conspecific. This taxon seems to be more closely related to _Leptophryne_, _Ingerophrynus_, and _Didynamipus_ than to _Ansonia_ and _Pedostibes_,[7] although its exact closest relatives remain uncertain.[8] In addition to being genetically a distinct lineage among Southeast Asian bufonids, it is also morphologically unique: it lacks middle-ear structures and tympanum.[9][10]


Description

_Sabahphrynus maculatus_ males grow to at least and females to in snoutâ€“vent length.[11] The head has no bony crests and the parotoid glands are absent. The outer finger tips are expanded into spatulate discs. The subarticular tubercles are present, but weak. The webbing of toe is moderately developed. The males lack vocal sac opening and mandibular spines.[12][13] The dorsum, at least in males, is light green.[14]


Habitat and distribution

_Sabahphrynus maculatus_ are found in the western lower montane Sabah, Borneo.[15] Specimens are known from the Kinabalu Park and Crocker Range National Park.[16] They occur near small streams, perching a few metres above ground on tree trunks as well as on logs and rocks adjacent to streams.[17]
