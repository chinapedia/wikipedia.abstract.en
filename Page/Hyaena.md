_HYAENA_ is a genus comprising two of the living species of hyenas: the striped hyena (_Hyaena hyaena_) from western Asia and northern Africa and the brown hyena (_Hyaena brunnea_) from southern Africa. The brown hyena has sometimes been placed in a separate genus _Parahyaena_, or even included in the otherwise fossil genus _Pachycrocuta_, but recent sources have tended to place it in _Hyaena_.

The brown hyena's skull is larger than that of the striped hyena. The male brown hyena is slightly larger than the female, while the sexes of the striped hyena are equally sized . Both species are smaller than the spotted hyena (_Crocuta crocuta_), but larger than the aardwolf (_Proteles cristata_). They are predominantly scavengers.
