Orthodontics

Holdaway was known for his contributions to the field of Orthodontics. He developed the holdaway lip analysis. The lip analysis, which was called H Line, was known to run from the cephalometric point Soft Tissue Pogonion to upper lip. "H" angle of Holdaway was between the Nasion-B Point (NB) line and the H line. For a normal ANB value of 2-3 degree, H angle is around 7-8 degrees.[3]

He was also known for developing the Holdaway ratio to compare the prominence of the lower incisors compare to that of the bony chin. According to him, the distance from labial surface of mandibular incisor to the N-B line and distance from Pogonion to N-B line should b equal.[4]
