SAINT GAVINUS () is a Christian saint who is greatly celebrated in Sardinia, Italy, as one of the MARTYRS OF TORRES (), along with his companions SSÂ Protus and Januarius.

He was probably a Roman soldier martyred for the Christian faith during the persecution of Diocletian in 304 in the city of Porto Torres (), according to the legend on the orders of the governor (_preside_) of Sardinia and Corsica, a certain Barbarus.

The well-known Romanesque church of Gavoi is dedicated to him, as is the town of San Gavino Monreale, and a number of communes in Corsica.

The 11th-century Basilica of San Gavino in Porto Torres, Sassari, is also dedicated to this saint. It was built by Comita or Gomida, Judge of Torres, and contains the relics, discovered in 1614, not only of Saint Gavinus, but also of his companions, Saints Protus and Januarius.

His feast day is given in the Roman Martyrology as 30 May.
