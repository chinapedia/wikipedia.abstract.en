Plot

Sir Watkyn Bassett is writing his memoirs of his misspent youth, which also include a lot of other misspent youths of people who are now famous. Bertie, who has just become engaged, is sent to destroy the manuscript. Guests at the house include would-be dictator Roderick Spode, Gussie Fink-Nottle and, nearby, another old enemy of Bertie's, Constable Oates. The local vicar is Stinker Pinker. Added to this is a number of tough young ladies, a local play and a dog that gets arrested, all of which means a lively time for Bertie and Jeeves.
