PEDALS (died October 2016, New Jersey, United States) was an American black bear (_Ursus americanus_) that walked upright on its hind legs due to injuries on his front paws. After videos of the bear were posted on the internet, more than 300,000 people signed a petition to move the bear to a wildlife sanctuary. Pedals appears to have been killed in October 2016 in New Jersey's first sanctioned bow and arrow hunt in four decades. During the hunt, which also included muzzle-loading rifles, a total of 562 bears were killed.


Fame

Pedals was first spotted in 2014 in Rockaway Township, New Jersey.[1][2] The bear walked upright on its hind legs[3] due to injuries on his front paws.[4] The bear's appearance spurred debate and discussions.[5][6][7] Videos of Pedals' bipedal walking were posted to the internet and he was described as an "internet sensation".[8] Officials initially warned that the videos may have been a hoax.[9]

Over 300,000 people concerned with Pedals' welfare signed a petition written by Lisa Rose Rublack to relocate the bear to the Orphaned Wildlife Center in Otisville, New York.[10][11] Supporters donated $22,000 to a fund created by Sabrina Pugsley to move the bear to the sanctuary to avoid the possibility of his struggling to survive in the wild.[12] New York officials opposed the transfer of Pedals to the sanctuary.[13]

Pedals was being monitored by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish and Wildlife, which asked residents to report sightings by calling a hotline.[14][15] In 2016, the Division asked the public to help with any sightings because the bear had not been seen since the previous Christmas.[16]


Death

Pedals' internet fame led Angi Metler, director of the Bear Education and Resource Program, to believe he would be targeted by bear hunters.[17] In October 2016, reports of Pedals being killed by a hunter received widespread attention.[18][19] On October 17, 2016, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced they believed Pedals had been killed during the officially sanctioned hunt.[20] The October 10â€“15 hunt was New Jersey's first sanctioned bow and arrow hunt since the 1960s.[21] During the hunt, which also permitted muzzle-loading rifles, a total of 562 bears were killed.[22][23]

In response to the killing, State Senator Raymond Lesniak introduced a bill dubbed "Pedals' Law" that would ban black bear hunting in New Jersey for five years.[24][25]

In December 2016, a hunter filed a defamation lawsuit in Morris County Superior Court alleging he was falsely accused on social media of being Pedals' killer, suffered death threats, and had his personal information published.[26]
