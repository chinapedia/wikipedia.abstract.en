SPAGHETTI WESTERN, also known as ITALIAN WESTERN or MACARONI WESTERN (primarily in Japan),[1] is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success.[2] The term was used by American critics and those in other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.[3]

According to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase 'Spaghetti Western' was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso Sánchez.[4] The denomination for these films in Italy is WESTERN ALL'ITALIANA (Italian-style Western). ITALO-WESTERN is also used, especially in Germany. In addition, the term PAELLA WESTERN has been used for the many Western films produced in Spain.[5] The term EUROWESTERNS may be used to also include Western movies that were produced in Europe but not called Spaghetti Westerns, like the West German Winnetou films or Ostern Westerns. The majority of the films were international co-productions between Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, Germany, Portugal, Greece, Israel, Yugoslavia, or the United States. as the Man with No Name in a publicity image of _A Fistful of Dollars_, a film by Sergio Leone.]] These movies were originally released in Italian, but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was post-synched, most "western all'italiana" do not have an official dominant language.[6] The typical Spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director, Italo-Spanish[7] technical staff, and a cast of Italian, Spanish, German, and American actors, sometimes a fading Hollywood star and sometimes a rising one like the young Clint Eastwood in three of Sergio Leone's films.

Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978.[8] The best-known Spaghetti Westerns were directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone, notably the three films of the _Dollars Trilogy_ (starring Clint Eastwood as the main character)—_A Fistful of Dollars_ (1964), _For a Few Dollars More_ (1965) and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ (1966)—as well as _Once Upon a Time in the West_ (1968, starring Charles Bronson). These are consistently listed among the best Westerns of any variety.[9]


Common elements

Sergio Leone's _A Fistful of Dollars_ established the Spaghetti Western as a novel kind of Western. In this seminal film, the hero enters a town that is ruled by two outlaw gangs, and ordinary social relations are non-existent. He betrays and plays the gangs against one another in order to make money. Then he uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed and he is severely beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interaction in this story between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero) on the one hand, and pathos (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his double play has been revealed) on the other, was aspired to and sometimes attained by the imitations that soon flooded the cinemas.

Italian cinema often borrowed from other films without regard for infringement, and Leone famously borrowed the plot for _A Fistful of Dollars_, receiving a letter from Japanese director Akira Kurosawa congratulating him on making "...a very fine film. But it is my film".[10] Leone had imitated one of the most highly respected directors in the world by remaking his film _Yojimbo_ as _A Fistful of Dollars_ and consequently surrendered Asian rights to Kurosawa, plus 15% of the international box office proceeds.[11] Leone later moved from borrowing and established his own oft-imitated style and plots. Leone's films and other "core" Spaghetti Westerns are often described as having eschewed, criticised or even "demythologized"[12] many of the conventions of traditional U.S. Westerns. This was partly intentional and partly the context of a different cultural background.[13]

Use of pathos received a big boost with Sergio Corbucci's influential _Django_. In the years following, the use of cunning and irony became more prominent. This was seen in Leone's next two Westerns, with their emphasis on unstable partnerships. In the last phase of the Spaghetti Western, with the Trinity films, the Leone legacy had been transformed almost beyond recognition, as terror and deadly violence gave way to harmless brawling and low comedy.

Ennio Morricone's music for _A Fistful of Dollars_ and later Spaghetti Westerns was just as seminal and imitated. It expresses a similar duality between quirky and unusual sounds and instruments on the one hand, and sacral dramatizing for the big confrontation scenes on the other.


Filming locations

Most Spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets and shot at Cinecittà studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[14] Many of the stories take place in the dry landscapes of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, hence common filming locations were the Tabernas Desert and the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches, both of which are in the Province of Almería in southeastern Spain. Some sets and studios built for Spahetti Westerns survive as theme parks, Texas Hollywood, Mini Hollywood, and Western Leone, and continue to be used as film sets.[15] Other filming locations used were in central and southern Italy, such as the parks of Valle del Treja (between Rome and Viterbo), the area of Camposecco (next to Camerata Nuova, characterized by a karst topography), the hills around Castelluccio, the area around the Gran Sasso mountain, and the Tivoli's quarries and Sardinia. _God's Gun_ was filmed in Israel.[16]


Reception

In the 1960s, critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing. The genre most identifiably American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new rougher form. For many critics, Sergio Leone's films were part of the problem. Leone's _Dollars Trilogy_ (1964–1966) was not the beginning of the "Spaghetti Western" cycle in Italy, but for Americans Leone's films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre.

Christopher Frayling, in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the Spaghetti Western cycle as, to "a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the 'cultural roots' of the American/Hollywood Western."[17] He remarks that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, "bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre."

Pauline Kael, he notes, was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film such as Akira Kurosawa's _Yojimbo_ (1961) "could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality." Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone's success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole.[18]


Rise and fall

European Westerns from the beginning

European Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself. The Lumière brothers made their first public screening of films in 1895 and already in 1896 Gabriel Veyre shot _Repas d'Indien_ ("Indian Banquet") for them. Joe Hamman starred as Arizona Bill in films made in the French horse country of Camargue 1911–12.[19]

In Italy, the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini's 1910 opera _La fanciulla del West_; it is sometimes considered to be the first Spaghetti Western.[20][21] The first Italian Western movie was _La Vampira Indiana_ (1913) – a combination of Western and vampire film. It was directed by Vincenzo Leone, father of Sergio Leone, and starred his mother Bice Walerian in the title role as Indian princess Fatale.[22] The Italians also made Wild Bill Hickok films, while the German twenties saw back-woods Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas.

Of the Western-related European films before 1964, the one attracting most attention is probably Luis Trenker's _Der Kaiser von Kalifornien_ (1936), about John Sutter.[23] During and after the Second World War there were scattered European uses of Western settings, mostly for comedy or musical comedy.

The first Spaghetti Western

A forerunner of the genre had appeared in 1943 Giorgio Ferroni's _Il fanciullo del West_ (_The Boy in the West_)[24][25] and a cycle of Western comedies was initiated 1959 with _La sceriffa_ and _Il terrore dell’Oklahoma_, followed by other films starring comedy specialists like Walter Chiari, Ugo Tognazzi, Raimondo Vianello or Fernandel. An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American Bob Hope vehicles.[26]

The first American-British western filmed in Spain was _The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw_ (1958), directed by Raoul Walsh. It was followed in 1961 by _Savage Guns_, a British-Spanish western, again filmed in Spain. This marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European western.

In 1963, three non-comedy Italo-Spanish westerns were produced: _Gunfight at Red Sands_, _Magnificent Three_ and _Gunfight at High Noon_. In 1961 an Italian company co-produced the French _Taste of Violence_, with a Mexican Revolution theme.

Since there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in general) one cannot say which one of the films mentioned so far was the first Spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre, with more than twenty productions or co-productions from Italian companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish/American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone's _A Fistful of Dollars_ whose innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story decided the future for the genre.

Impact of _A Fistful of Dollars_

The Spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment. The Italian "low" popular film production was basically low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success.[27] When the typically low-budget production _A Fistful of Dollars_ turned into a remarkable box office success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most succeeding Spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill, preferably one who looked like Clint Eastwood: Franco Nero, Giuliano Gemma, John Garko and Terence Hill started out that way; Anthony Steffen and others stayed that way all their Spaghetti Western career.

Whoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda, like in _A Pistol for Ringo_, _Blood for a Silver Dollar_, _Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold_, _Payment in Blood_ and others, while _Beyond the Law_ instead has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff. There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit (Gian Maria Volonté from _A Fistful of Dollars_, otherwise Tomas Milian or most often Fernando Sancho) and a grumpy old man – more often than not an undertaker, to serve as sidekick for the hero. For love interest, rancher's daughters, schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men, where actresses like Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri carried on Marianne Koch's role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in _A Fistful of Dollars_, or more, and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more – just like the cunning used to secure the latter's retribution.

In the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed US Western devices typical for most of the 1963–64 Spaghetti Westerns. For example, in Sergio Corbucci's _Minnesota Clay_ (1964) that appeared two months after _A Fistful of Dollars_, an American style "tragic gunfighter" hero confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, and (just as in _A Fistful of Dollars_) the leader of the latter is the town sheriff. , one of the most representative directors of the genre. ]] In the same director's _Johnny Oro_ (1966) a traditional Western sheriff and a half-breed bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans together assault the town. In _A Pistol for Ringo_ a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by Giuliano Gemma (with more pleasing manners than Eastwood's character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played by typically Fernando Sancho.

_For a Few Dollars More_ and its followers

After 1965 when Leone's second Western _For a Few Dollars More_ brought a larger box office success, the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of Spaghetti Western heroes in films like _Arizona Colt_, _Vengeance Is Mine_, _Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre_, _The Ugly Ones_, _Dead Men Don't Count_ and _Any Gun Can Play_. In _The Great Silence_ and _A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die_, the heroes instead fight bounty killers. This was also the time when every other hero or villain in Spaghetti Westerns started carrying a musical watch, after its ingenious use in _For a Few Dollars More_.

Spaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes. In Leone's film Eastwood's character is an unshaven bounty hunter, dressed similarly to his character in _A Fistful of Dollars_, who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit, and in the end turns out to also be an avenger. In the following years there was a deluge of Spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with (most often) conflicting motives. Examples include: a lawman and an outlaw (_And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave_), an army officer and an outlaw (_Bury Them Deep_), an avenger and a (covert) army officer (_The Hills Run Red_), an avenger and a (covert) guilty party (_Viva! Django_), an avenger and a con-man (_The Dirty Outlaws_), an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter (_Man With the Golden Pistol_) and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff (_Few Dollars for Django_).

The theme of age in _For a Few Dollars More_, where the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal, is taken up in _Day of Anger_ and _Death Rides a Horse_. In both cases Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law, respectively.

Zapata Westerns

One variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money-oriented American from the United States frontier. These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns.[28] The first was Damiano Damiani's _A Bullet for the General_ and then followed Sergio Sollima's trilogy: _The Big Gundown_, _Face to Face_ and _Run, Man, Run_.

Sergio Corbucci's _The Mercenary_ and _Compañeros_ also belong here, as does _Tepepa_ by Giulio Petroni – among others. Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics. They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of Mexican revolutions, and of imperialism in general.[29]

Betrayal stories

In Leone's _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films like _Any Gun Can Play_, _One Dollar Too Many_ and _Kill Them All and Come Back Alone_ several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain.

_Sabata_ and _If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death_, directed by Gianfranco Parolini, introduce into similar betrayal environments a kind of hero molded on the Mortimer character from _For a Few Dollars More_, only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly enough Sabata is performed by Lee Van Cleef himself, while John Garko plays the very similar Sartana protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata movies while Giuliano Carnimeo made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko.

_Django_ and the tragic heroes

Beside the first three Spaghetti Westerns by Leone, a most influential film was Sergio Corbucci's _Django_ starring Franco Nero. The titular character is torn between several motives – money or revenge – and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him. Indicative of this film's influence on the Spaghetti Western style, Django is the hero's name in a plenitude of subsequent westerns.[30]

Even though his character is not named Django, Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to _Texas, Adios_ and _Massacre Time_ where the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations. Similar "prodigal son"[31] stories followed, including _Chuck Moll_, _Keoma_, _The Return of Ringo_, _The Forgotten Pistolero_, _One Thousand Dollars on the Black_, _Johnny Hamlet_ and also _Seven Dollars on the Red_.

Another type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations. Giuliano Gemma starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme – _Adiós gringo_, _For a Few Extra Dollars_, _I lunghi giorni della vendetta_, _Wanted_, and to some extent _Blood for a Silver Dollar_ – where most often his character is called "Gary".

The wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many Spaghetti Westerns. Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance – _For a Few Dollars More_, _Once Upon a Time in the West_, _Today We Kill… Tomorrow We Die!_, _A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die_, _Death Rides a Horse_, _Viva Django_, _The Devil's Backbone_, _Hate for Hate_, _Greatest Robbery in the West_ – those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations.

Comedy Westerns

and Terence Hill in _They Call Me Trinity_ (1970)]] In 1968, the wave of Spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. However, the considerable box office success of Enzo Barboni's _They Call Me Trinity_ and the pyramidal one of its follow-up _Trinity Is Still My Name_ gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate. The main characters were played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, who had already cooperated as hero pair in the "old style" Spaghetti Westerns _God Forgives... I Don't!_, _Boot Hill_ and _Ace High_ directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The humor started in those movies already, with scenes with comedic fighting, but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies. They feature the quick but lazy Trinity (Hill) and his big, strong and irritable brother Bambino (Spencer).

The stories make fun of U.S. Western-style diligent farmers and Spaghetti Western-style bounty hunters. There was a wave of Trinity-inspired films with quick and strong heroes, the former kind often called Trinity or perhaps coming from "a place called Trinity", and with no or few killings. Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay, all the successors contained religious groups or at least priests, sometimes as one of the heroes.[32]

The music for the two Trinity westerns (composed by Franco Micalizzi and Guido & Maurizio De Angelis, respectively) also reflected the change into a lighter and more sentimental mood. The Trinity-inspired films also adopted this style.[33]

Some critics deplore these post-Trinity films as a degeneration of the "real" Spaghetti Westerns, and that Hill's and Spencer's skilful use of body language was a hard act to follow. It is significant that the most successful of the post-Trinity films featured Hill (_Man of the East_, _A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe_), Spencer (_It Can Be Done Amigo_) and a pair of Hill/Spencer look-alikes in _Carambola_. Spaghetti Western old hand Franco Nero also worked in this subgenre with _Cipolla Colt_ and Tomas Milian plays an outrageous "quick" bounty hunter modeled on Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp in _Sometimes Life Is Hard – Right Providence?_ and _Here We Go Again, Eh, Providence?_[34]

Twilight of the Spaghetti Western

Leone's later Westerns _Once Upon a Time in the West_ ; _Duck, You Sucker!_ and the produced and co-directed _My Name is Nobody_ in 1973 did very well at the Italian box-office but did not inspire the industry to imitations like his first three did. In fact, _Duck, You Sucker!_ has been interpreted as a critical comment on the Zapata Westerns and _My Name is Nobody_ includes Terence Hill as a Trinity-like character.

By the mid-seventies a few productions, like _Keoma_ and _Four of the Apocalypse_, tried to revive the pre-Trinity formulas but basically the Spaghetti Western was dead as an active genre.

Later years have seen some "return of stories" _Django 2_ with Franco Nero and _Troublemakers_ with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.

Other notable films

Some movies that were not very successful at the box office[35] still earn a "cult" status in some segment of the audience because of certain exceptional features in story and/or presentation. One "cult" Spaghetti Western that also has drawn attention from critics is Giulio Questi's _Django Kill_. Other "cult" items are Cesare Canevari's _Matalo!_, Tony Anthony's _Blindman_ and Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent's _Cut-Throats Nine_ (the latter among gore film audiences).

Special interest audiences might also nurture a cult of the "Worst", as exemplified in the interest for a director like Ed Wood. His Spaghetti Western equivalent would be the Western œuvre of Demofilo Fidani. _The Stranger_ (1995) is essentially, the Woman with No Name, with a motorcycle instead of a horse.[36]

The few Spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters like Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid etc. mainly appear before _A Fistful of Dollars_ had put its mark on the genre. Likewise, and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns, few films feature Indians. When they appear they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes. The only fairly successful Spaghetti Western with an Indian main character (played by Burt Reynolds in his only European Western outing) is Sergio Corbucci's _Navajo Joe_, where the Indian village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes, and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at an Indian burial ground.

Several Spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas. Titles like _Fedra West_ (also called _Ballad of a Bounty Hunter_) and _Johnny Hamlet_ signify the connection to the Greek myth and possibly the plays by Euripides and Racine and the play by William Shakespeare, respectively. The latter also inspired _Dust in the Sun_, which follows its original more closely than Johnny Hamlet, where the hero survives. _The Forgotten Pistolero_ is based on the vengeance of Orestes. There are similarities between the story of _The Return of Ringo_ and the last canto of Homer's _Odyssey_. _Fury of Johnny Kid_ follows Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_, but (again) with a different ending – the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other.

The story of _A Fistful of Dollars_ was closely based on Akira Kurosawa's _Yojimbo_. Kurosawa in fact sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism, and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan, where its hero, Clint Eastwood, was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series _Rawhide_: Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa's advance permission to use _Yojimbo_'s script.[37][38] _Requiem for a Gringo_ shows many traces from another well-known Japanese film, Masaki Kobayashi's _Harakiri_. When Asian martial arts films started to draw crowds in European cinema houses, the producers of Spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on, this time not by adapting story-lines but rather by directly including martial arts in the films, performed by Eastern actors – for example Chen Lee in _My Name Is Shanghai Joe_ or Lo Lieh teaming up with Lee Van Cleef in _The Stranger and the Gunfighter_.

Some Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars, like Ferdinando Baldi's _Rita of the West_ featuring Rita Pavone and Terence Hill. In non-singing roles were Ringo Starr as a villain in _Blindman_ and French rock 'n' roll veteran Johnny Hallyday as the gunfighter/avenger hero in Sergio Corbucci's _The Specialists_.

A celebrity from another sphere of culture is Italian author/film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who plays a revolutionary man of the church in _Requiescant_. This film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos and ends on a call for arms but it does not fit easily as a Zapata Western. The same can be said for _The Price of Power_, a political allegory where an American president is assassinated in Dallas by a conspiracy of Southern racists who frame an innocent Afro-American. They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistle-blower (Giuliano Gemma) and a political aide.

Though the Spaghetti Westerns from _A Fistful of Dollars_ and on featured more violence and killings than earlier American Western films, they generally shared the parental genre's restrictive attitude toward explicit sexuality. However, in response to the growing commercial success of various shades of sex films, there was a greater exposure of naked skin in some Spaghetti Westerns, among others _Dead Men Ride_ and _Heads or Tails_. In the former and partly the latter, the sex scenes feature coercion and violence against women.

Even though it is hinted at in some films, like _Django Kill_ and _Requiescant_, open homosexuality plays a marginal part in Spaghetti Westerns. The exception is Giorgio Capitani's _The Ruthless Four_ – in effect a gay version of John Huston's _The Treasure of the Sierra Madre_ – where the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man-to-man relations through the story.[39]


Legacy

Spaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced outside of Italy.

Clint Eastwood's first American Western film, _Hang 'Em High_ (1968), incorporates elements of Spaghetti Westerns.

The Bollywood film _Sholay_ (1975) was often referred to as a "Curry Western".[40] A more accurate genre label for the film is the "Dacoit Western", as it combined the conventions of Indian dacoit films such as _Mother India_ (1957) and _Gunga Jumna_ (1961) with that of Spaghetti Westerns. _Sholay_ spawned its own genre of "Dacoit Western" films in Bollywood during the 1970s.[41]

The 1985 Japanese film _Tampopo_ was promoted as a "ramen Western".

Japanese director Takashi Miike paid tribute to the genre with _Sukiyaki Western Django_, a Western set in Japan which derives influence from both _Django_ and Sergio Leone's _Dollars Trilogy_.[42]

American director Quentin Tarantino has utilized elements of Spaghetti Westerns in his films _Kill Bill_ (combined with kung fu movies),[43] _Inglourious Basterds_ (set in Nazi-occupied France),[44] _Django Unchained_ (set in the American South during the time of slavery).[45] and _The Hateful Eight_ (set in Wyoming post-US Civil War).

The American animated film _Rango_ incorporates elements of Spaghetti Westerns, including a character modeled after The Man With No Name.

The American heavy metal band Metallica has used Ennio Morricone's composition "The Ecstasy of Gold", from the Spaghetti Western _The Good, The Bad and the Ugly_, to open several of their concerts. The Australian band The Tango Saloon combines elements of Tango music with influences from Spaghetti Western scores. The psychobilly band Ghoultown also derives influence from Spaghetti Westerns. The music video for the song "Knights of Cydonia" by the English rock band Muse was influenced by Spaghetti Westerns. The band Big Audio Dynamite used music samples from Spaghetti Westerns when mixing their song ″Medicine Show″. Within the song you can hear samples from Spaghetti Western movies such as _A Fistful of Dollars_, _The Good, The Bad and The Ugly_, and _Duck You Sucker_.[46]
