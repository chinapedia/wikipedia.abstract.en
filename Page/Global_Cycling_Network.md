GLOBAL CYCLING NETWORK (GCN) is a cycling-related YouTube channel which was launched in 2013. It is run by the multi-channel network Play Sports Network. The channel is presented by Daniel Lloyd, Tom Last, Under-23 British National Mountain Biking champion Simon Richardson[1] and Jon Cannings. The channel is headquartered in Bath, Somerset under its parent company.


History

On 1 January 2013 Global Cycling Network was launched by SHIFT Active Media founder Simon Wear[2] under Google's now-defunct YouTube Original Channel Initiative, as part of its parent company's multi-channel network media strategy. His original objective was to create a "network of quality cycling video content creators and give cycling global promotion through an official channel".[3] The YouTube channel also provides a media channel for the promotion of the parent company's client brands.[4]

In 2015 the channel was awarded Best Vlogger/Best Use of Video during the Cycling Media Awards 2015 awards night, which aims to recognise the best of UK cycling media.[5]

In 2016 the parent company's multi-channel network division was spun off as Play Sports Network, and management of the channel was transferred to the new company[6].

On 18 April 2017 the channel broke the 1 million subscriber mark and released a "special" thanking video addressed to the people who helped reach that milestone.

On 27 February 2017 Discovery Communications, the owner of Eurosport, announced the acquisition of a 20% stake in Play Sports Group, the company that owns the GCN channel.[7] In 2019, Discovery Communications acquired a controlling interest in Play Sports Group and the GCN franchise, increasing holdings to 71%.[8]

In February 2018 GCN announced the addition of World Champion (Time Trial, Duathlon[9]) Emma Pooley to the team. On 24 March 2019, Pooley announced that after presenting for a year she would be leaving the channel to concentrate on engineering.[10]

On 3 July 2018, GCN announced another new presenter, cycling journalist and PhD graduate Oliver Bridgewood,[11] who also works as a writer and video producer at Cycling Weekly.


Content

Global Cycling Network's content tends to be predominantly road cycling-related, with regular sections consisting of instructional videos, including videos on bicycle riding, maintenance and tech news, how-to videos, and a weekly news bulletin THE GCN SHOW. The channel also features interviews of professional cyclists and coverage of international professional cycling events, including the Tour of Beijing, Dubai Tour, and the three Grand Tour races (the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España). Occasionally, the channel also creates videos on cyclo-cross and less frequently, mountain biking (mostly covered on Global Cycling Network's sister channel, Global Mountain Bike Network).

The channel is also known for its ROAD BIKE PARTY series of videos featuring former trials rider Martyn Ashton performing stunts on road bikes. It was a continuation of Ashton's independently-created first video, Road Bike Party 1. As of April 2017 Road Bike Party 2 has received more than 15 million views on YouTube.[12][13]

In 2014 British Cycling partnered with Global Cycling Network in the creation of its Racesmart campaign, which aimed to promote safe cycle racing in Great Britain.[14][15]
