Political thought on Europe

In his books "Il Terzo Spazio" () and "Citizens of Nowhere" () he responds directly to the crisis of the European Union and the rise of the nationalist right by proposing a third way between the maintaining the status quo and accepting the demise of the European project.[10] Marsili has argued that "the nation-state is not the solution, but part of the problem[11]", while strongly criticising the existing structures of the European Union.[12] He has been defined "the Italian response to the euro-sceptics[13]" and is an outspoken advocate of the need for pan-European political parties.[14] In a booklet written together with Niccolo Milanese, he has argued for the need of a pan-European constituent process to draft new Treaties for the European Union.[15]
