DING GUANGQUAN (14 October 1944 â€“ 18 January 2018) was a Chinese comedian. He mainly performed Xiangsheng (crosstalk), a form of traditional Chinese comedy. He was a senior actor in the China Coal-Mine Art Troupe and had accepted over 40 students in his years teaching.[1]

Many of Ding's foreign students are now stars of comic dialogue on the Chinese stage today, such as Mark Rowswell (Dashan), Julien Guadfroy, and Liam Bates (Li Mu).[2]

Ding's master was the famous Xiangsheng master, Hou Baolin, whom he studied under starting in 1973.
