JUSTDIAL (sometimes stylised as JUSTDIAL or JD) is a company that provides local search for different services in India over the phone and online. Founded in 1996 by VSS Mani,[1][2][3] the company is headquartered in Mumbai, India.[4] In addition to its headquarters, Justdial has offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Pune.[5] In 2019 Justdial had 12,691 employees and a database of approximately 25.7 million listings and 500,838 active paid campaigns.[6]


History

In 1987, while working for a yellow pages company,[7] VSS Mani thought of replacing yellow pages with a database of information that users could call to receive current information about local business listings.[8] To launch his venture, Mani acquired the Mumbai landline phone number 2888-8888. After several years of seeking financial backing for his idea, Mani launched Justdial in 1996 with a seed capital of Rs. 50,000, five employees, a few rented computers, and borrowed furniture.[9][10]

In 2007 an Internet version of the database called Justdial.com was launched.[11]

On 20 May, 2013 Justdial went public at a price between INR 897 and 898.[12] Of the total 17.5 million shares, 13.5 million of them were offered to the public, while the rest were given to fifteen previous investors at INR 530 per share. To encourage retail investment, Justdial had promised that they would buy back shares from retail investors at the IPO price if Justdial's share price fell sharply within the first six months.[13] By the close of the market on the day of the IPO, the majority of new investments had come from foreign institutional investors. On 5 August of the next year, Justdial's share price reached a high of INR 1,894.70, subsequently decreasing to the triple digits in 2015.[14]
