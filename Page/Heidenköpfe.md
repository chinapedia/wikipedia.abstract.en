The HEIDENKÖPFE (plural) are a group of three summits (HEIDENKOPF I, HEIDENKOPF II und HEIDENKOPF III) near Dahlem in Germany that are about . They lie within the mountain region of North Eifel in the counties of Euskirchen and Vulkaneifel in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia (NW) and Rhineland-Palatinate (RP).


Geography

Location

The _Heidenköpfe_ lie within the Ripsdorf Forest, part of the North Eifel, and also within the northern part of the High Fens-Eifel Nature Park and southern part of the Volcanic Eifel Nature Park. They are on average about 2 kilometres east of Dahlem (NW), 3.5 kilometres south-southeast of Schmidtheim (NW), 3.5 kilometres northwest of Esch (RP) and 3 kilometres (as the crow flies) west of Waldorf (NW). The forested _Heidenköpfe_ rise only gently above the aforementioned villages, which are not far below them.

Among the streams on the _Heidenköpfen_ are the Kyll tributary of the Glaadtbach (_Schmidtheimer Morbach_) which rises on _Heidenkopf I_ the Glaadtbach tributary of the Morbach which rises on _Heidenkopf II_ and the Ahr tributary of the Schaafbach (_Eichholzbach_) which has its source on _Heidenkopf III_.

Summits

The three _Heidenköpfe_ are as follows – with height in metres (m) above sea level (NHN):

-   _Heidenkopf I_ (ca.  ; ), NW; hillock; with Roman road
-   _Heidenkopf II_ (; ), NW; hill spur; with firing range
-   _Heidenkopf III_ (ca.  ; ), NW / RP; _kuppe_; with Roman road.


Roman road from Trier to Cologne

The old Roman road from Trier to Cologne used to run through the wooded region between _Heidenkopf I_ and _III_. A section of this has been exposed together with the _Vierherrenstein_, a stone marker that lies on the boundary between the local parishes 620 metres southwest of _Heidenkopf III_.[1]


Transport and hiking

The B 51 runs past the _Heidenköpfen_ to the northwest and west between Dahlem and Schmidtheim, and the B 421 to the southwest and south between Kyll and Jünkerath. The Kreisstraße 67 branches off the latter in Jünkerath and runs northeast to Esch and then continues to Waldorf. The Eifel Line (Eifel Railway) runs past the hills to the west through Schmidtheim, Dahlem and Jünkerath, from where the Venn Railway once branched off and headed for Belgium. From these transport axes there are several forest trails and tracks to the hills.
