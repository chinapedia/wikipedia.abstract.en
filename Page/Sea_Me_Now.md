Plot

Teddy tries to impress his ex-wife by organizing a day trip on his newly refurbished boat; Tina attempts to prove she's responsible enough to have a cellphone by taking care of Bob's prized eraser.


Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode an A-, saying, "I’m not sure that the show has really previously established Tina as someone who loses things constantly, but it feels so completely true to her character that I’m perfectly prepared to believe that’s featured in every episode up to this point. As with Teddy, this is a story that unfolds more or less entirely in Tina’s own head, with the rest of the family only taking a moment to mourn the inevitable demise of a much-loved eraser. There’s a lovely payoff though, as Tina tells her dad that a cellphone would just distract her from all that’s around her. Of course, as soon as that legitimately lovely moment passes, the family immediately turns on Bob, summarily stripping him of all screen privileges. It’s that lovely mix of the sweet and the silly, the ridiculous and the mundane, that makes “Sea Me Now” such a terrific episode."[1]

The episode received a 1.2 rating and was watched by a total of 2.79 million people.[2]
