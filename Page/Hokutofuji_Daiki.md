, is a sumo wrestler from Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. His debut in _maezumō_ was in March 2015, and his first _makuuchi_ division _honbasho_ was the Kyūshū tournament in November 2016. His highest rank has been _komusubi_. He has five _kinboshi_ or gold stars for a defeat of a _yokozuna_ and one special prize for Technique.


Career

Early career

He was a high school _yokozuna_ at Saitama Sakae High School (also the alma mater of Gōeidō) and won multiple major amateur champions before his senior year at Nippon Sport Science University. If he had entered professional sumo in either of those years he would have started as a _makushita tsukedashi_ and skipped the lower divisions, but his parents wanted him to complete his education. So instead he made his debut in March 2015 at the _maezumō_ level. He was unable to compete under his family name of Nakamura as that was already taken by Nakamura Oyakata (former _sekiwake_ Kotonishiki), so instead he used his given name, Daiki. He rose up the ranks quickly, winning the _yūshō_ or tournament championships in the _jonidan_ and _sandanme_ divisions with perfect 7-0 records. He became a _sekitori_ upon reaching the _jūryō_ division in July 2016, and he won the _jūryō_ championship in September with a 12–3 record, which saw him promoted to the top _makuuchi_ division. His rise to the top division in ten tournaments was the second fastest of modern times behind that of Jōkōryū who achieved the feat in nine tournaments in 2012. At this point he changed his _shikona_ from Daiki to Hokutofuji, which was derived from the _shikona_ of his stablemaster, former _yokozuna_ Hokutoumi, and Hokutoumi's own stablemaster, former _yokozuna_ Kitanofuji.

_Makuuchi_ career

Hokutofuji came through with a solid 9–6 record in his top division debut and recorded 9 wins again in January 2017. In March he recorded the first _make-koshi_ (losing record) of his career, but a 10–5 result in May saw him move up the rankings. In the July 2017 tournament he earned a _kinboshi_ or gold star in his first ever match against a _yokozuna_, defeating Kakuryū, [1] and finished with eight wins. On Day 4 of the September tournament he beat _yokozuna_ Harumafuji to claim his second _kinboshi_.[2] He was a runner-up to Hakuhō in the November 2017 tournament with an 11–4 record, and was awarded his first special prize, for Technique. He also defeated _yokozuna_ Kisenosato in this tournament, earning his third _kinboshi_ in his last three tournaments.[3] In January 2018 he won a fourth straight _kinboshi_ by defeating Hakuhō on Day 3,[4] but he finished the tournament with only four wins against eleven losses. In the May 2018 tournament he suffered a concussion during a false start at the _tachi-ai_ in his match against Ryūden on Day 10.[5] He withdrew from the rest of the tournament. Returning in July ranked at the bottom of the division at _maegashira_ 16, he secured a winning record.[6]

In March 2019 he made his sanyaku debut at komusubi rank. He was the third _komusubi_ from Saitama Prefecture after Wakabayama in September 1951 and Wakachichibu in March 1959. He is also the fourth _komusubi_ from Hakkaku stable following Kaiho, Hokutoriki and Okinoumi.[7]


Fighting style

Hokutofuji's performances to date suggest that he is an _oshi-sumo_ specialist who favours pushing techniques to fighting on the _mawashi_ or belt. He wins roughly half his bouts with a straightforward _oshi-dashi_, or push out.[8]
