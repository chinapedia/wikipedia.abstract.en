Asom_Paryatan_Bhawan.jpg ASSAM TOURISM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION or ATDC () is a state owned corporation of Assam, India. It deals with tourism services and development as a part of the Assam Tourism Department along with the Directorate of Tourism. The State Govt. of Assam set up the corporation on 9 June 1988.[1][2] The ATDC is headquartered at Guwahati () and has district offices across Assam. Its official slogan is "Awesome Assam."[3]


History of tourism in Assam

Once, this northeastern state of India was known as Pragjyotishpura, then Kamrupa. During Ahom rule the land was called Axom, which foreigners pronounced "Assam". Assam was ruled by many kingdoms from ancient times. In 1826, British took over Assam and made it a separate state. From ancient times, tourists have come to this land. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited Kamrupa during Bhaskarvarman in the 7th century.

In 1958, the Department of Tourism was established. In 1962, an information office opened in Kaziranga, and in 1965, an information office opened in Sivasagar.[4]

In 1987 (during the seventh Five Year Plan), the first ever tourism policy of Assam was notified and subsequently ATDC was formed with a paid up capital of 24 lakh. In the same year the state government declared tourism as an industry.[5]

In the mid-70s, Assam tourism started properties near Kaziranga and other places such as Aranya, Banani, Banashree, MV and Jolporee. After the creation of ATDC, some of them were handed over to ATDC to operate. From the beginning, ATDC created many tourist lodges, yatriniwas, parks, and wayside amenities with the brand name of "Prashaanti". In 2009, a "tourist arrival cum reception center" was opened in Guwahati, which is presently known as "Asom Paryatan Bhawan". In 2012, ATDC started a luxury cruise, MV Mahabaahu, in a joint venture.[6]

In 1995 the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) from Assam was withdrawn which had been imposed in 1962 after Chinese attack.[7]
