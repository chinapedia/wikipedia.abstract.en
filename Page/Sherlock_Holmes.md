SHERLOCK HOLMES ( or ) is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.

First appearing in print in 1887's _A Study in Scarlet_, the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in _The Strand Magazine_, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.

Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known,[1] with _Guinness World Records_ listing him as the "most portrayed movie character" in history.[2] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[3][4][5] numerous literary and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural icon, the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.


Inspiration for the character

(1859–1930), Sherlock Holmes' creator, in 1914]]

Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.[6] Conan Doyle once wrote, "Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?"[7] Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes' speech and behaviour sometimes follow that of Lecoq.[8] Holmes and Watson discuss Dupin and Lecoq at the beginning of _A Study in Scarlet_.

Conan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations.[9] However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: "You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it".[10] Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.[11]

Other inspirations have been proposed, such as _Maximilien Heller_, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris.[12][13][14] It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.[15] Michael Harrison has suggested that a German self-styled "consulting detective" named Walter Scherer may have been the model for Holmes.[16]


Fictional character biography

Family and early life

'' issue which contains Holmes's first appearance in 1887 (_A Study in_ _Scarlet_)]]

Details about Sherlock Holmes' life are scarce in Conan Doyle's stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.

An estimate of Holmes's age in "His Last Bow" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age.[17] His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his "ancestors" were "country squires". In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlock's interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.

Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students.[18] A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession,[19] and he spent several years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept John H. Watson as a fellow lodger.

The two take lodgings at 221B Baker Street, London, an apartment at the upper (north) end of the street, up seventeen steps.[20]

Life with Watson

illustration for "The Adventure of Silver Blaze"]]

Holmes worked as a detective for twenty-three years, with physician John Watson assisting him for seventeen.[21] They were roommates before Watson's 1888 marriage and again after his wife's death. Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Most of the stories are frame narratives, written from Watson's point of view as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's writing sensational and populist, suggesting that it fails to accurately and objectively report the "science" of his craft:

Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be "quite superficial", Watson is moved by Holmes's reaction:

Practice

Holmes' clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select profession circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raises Holmes' profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police[22] that, Watson writes, by 1895 Holmes has "an immense practice".[23] Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby, even during a vacation.[24] A Prime Minister[25] and the King of Bohemia[26] visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the government of France awards him its Legion of Honour for solving a case;[27] the King of Scandinavia is a client;[28] and he aids the Vatican at least twice.[29] The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times,[30] and declines a knighthood "for services which may perhaps some day be described".

The Great Hiatus

; drawing by Sidney Paget]] The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Wishing to devote more time to his historical novels, Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty in "The Final Problem" (published 1893, but set in 1891). Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes' death that they wore black armbands in mourning. However, there is no known contemporary source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949.[31]

After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote _The Hound of the Baskervilles_ (serialised in 1901–02, with an implicit setting before Holmes's death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote "The Adventure of the Empty House", set in 1894; Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies. "The Adventure of the Empty House" marks the beginning of the second set of stories, which Conan Doyle wrote until 1927. in East Dean]]Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in "The Final Problem" and his reappearance in "The Adventure of the Empty House"—as the Great Hiatus. The earliest known use of this expression is in the article "Sherlock Holmes and the Great Hiatus" by Edgar W. Smith, published in the July 1946 issue of _The Baker Street Journal_.[32]

Retirement

In "His Last Bow", Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation. The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in "The Second Stain", first published that year). The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the war effort. Only one other adventure, "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", takes place during the detective's retirement.


Personality and habits

Watson describes Holmes as "bohemian" in his habits and lifestyle. Described by Watson in _The Hound of the Baskervilles_ as having a "cat-like" love of personal cleanliness, Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. In many of the stories, Holmes dives into an apparent mess to find a relevant item. In "The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual", Watson says:

The detective starves himself at times of intense intellectual activity, such as during "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder"—wherein, according to Watson:

, whose illustrations in _The Strand Magazine_ iconicised Holmes and Watson]] While the detective is usually dispassionate and cold, during an investigation he is animated and excitable. He has a flair for showmanship, preparing elaborate traps to capture and expose a culprit (often to impress observers).[33] His companion condones the detective's willingness to bend the truth (or break the law) on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he feels it morally justifiable,[34] but condemns Holmes' manipulation of innocent people in "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton". Holmes derives pleasure from baffling police inspectors with his deductions and has supreme confidence—bordering on arrogance—in his intellectual abilities. While the detective does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work,[35] he is pleased when his skills are recognised and responds to flattery.

Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In "The Adventure of the _Gloria Scott_", he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: "I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year". The detective is similarly described in _A Study in Scarlet_.

As shooting practice during a period of boredom, Holmes decorates the wall of his Baker Street lodgings with a "patriotic" _VR_ (_Victoria Regina_) in "bullet-pocks" from his revolver.[36] Holmes relaxes with music in "The Red-Headed League", taking the evening off from a case to listen to Pablo de Sarasate play violin. His enjoyment of vocal music, particularly Wagner, is evident in "The Adventure of the Red Circle".

Drug use

'' portrait of Holmes for "The Man with the Twisted Lip"]] Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He uses cocaine, which he injects in a seven-percent solution with a syringe kept in a Morocco leather case. Although Holmes also dabbles in morphine, he expresses strong disapproval when he visits an opium den; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's "only vice", and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect.[37][38] In "The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter", Watson says that although he has "weaned" Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is "not dead, but merely sleeping".

Watson and Holmes both use tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes's smoking a vice _per se_, Watson—a physician—occasionally criticises the detective for creating a "poisonous atmosphere" in their confined quarters.[39]

Finances

The detective is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's solution, such as in "The Adventure of the Speckled Band", "The Red-Headed League", and "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet". In "The Problem of Thor Bridge", the detective says, "My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether". In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate. In "The Adventure of the Priory School", Holmes earns a ₤6,000 fee, an amount that surprises even Watson (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of ₤500).[40] However, in "The Adventure of Black Peter", Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.

Although when the stories begin Holmes needed Watson to share the rent for their residence, by the time of "The Final Problem", he says that his services to the government of France and "the royal family of Scandinavia" had left him with enough money to retire comfortably.

Attitudes towards women

As Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, "Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's calculating machine and just about as likely to fall in love".[41] Holmes says in _The Valley of Fear_, "I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind",[42] and in "The Adventure of the Second Stain" finds "the motives of women ... inscrutable .... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes ... their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs".[43] In _The Sign of the Four_, he says, "I would not tell them too much. Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them".[44]

Watson says in "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches" that the detective inevitably "manifested no further interest in the client when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems". In "The Lion's Mane", Holmes writes, "Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart," indicating that he has been attracted to women in some way on occasion, but has not been interested in pursuing relationships with them. Ultimately, however, in "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot", he claims outright that "I have never loved". At the end of _The Sign of Four_, Holmes states that "love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement."

Despite his overall attitude, Holmes is adept at effortlessly putting his clients at ease, and Watson says that although the detective has an "aversion to women", he has "a peculiarly ingratiating way with [them]". Watson notes in "The Adventure of the Dying Detective" that Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his "remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent".[45] In "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", the detective easily manages to become engaged under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, but also abandons the woman once he has the information he requires.

Irene Adler

Irene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in "A Scandal in Bohemia". Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who best Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing. The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:

Five years before the story's events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of Bohemia Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancée's family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case, and he refers to her from time to time in subsequent stories.


Knowledge and skills

Shortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, _A Study in Scarlet_ (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective's abilities:

Subsequent stories reveal that Watson's early assessment was incomplete in places and inaccurate in others, due to the passage of time if nothing else. At the end of _A Study in Scarlet_, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of Latin. Despite Holmes's supposed ignorance of politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately recognises the true identity of "Count von Kramm". His speech is peppered with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and the detective quotes a letter from Gustave Flaubert to George Sand in the original French. At the end of "A Case of Identity", Holmes quotes Hafez. In _The Hound of the Baskervilles,_ the detective recognises works by Martin Knoller and Joshua Reynolds: "Watson won't allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ". In "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans", Watson says that "Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus", considered "the last word" on the subject; to be able to do that, Holmes must have had a very specific and detailed musicological knowledge, which could not be of any use in detecting crime.[46] Holmes is also a cryptanalyst, telling Watson in "The Adventure of the Dancing Men": "I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers".[47]

In _A Study in Scarlet_, Holmes claims to be unaware that the earth revolves around the sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one's ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in _The Valley of Fear_, he says, "All knowledge comes useful to the detective", and in "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", the detective calls himself "an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles".

Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in "A Scandal in Bohemia", luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that an unmarried woman will save her most valued possession from a fire. Another example is in "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle", where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: "When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet .... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager".

Maria Konnikova points out in an interview with D. J. Grothe that Holmes practices what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never "multitasks." She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.[48]

Holmesian deduction

Though the stories always refer to Holmes' intellectual detection methodology as "deduction", he primarily relies on abduction: inferring an explanation for observed details.[49][50][51] "From a drop of water", he writes, "a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other".[52]

In "A Scandal in Bohemia", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had "a most clumsy and careless servant girl". When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:

In the first Holmes story, _A Study in Scarlet_, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to C. Auguste Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe's fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial".[53] Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box" and again in "The Adventure of the Dancing Men".

This methodology allows Holmes to learn a stranger's occupation and other details. He observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories Holmes is seen applying his method to walking sticks,[54] pipes,[55] hats,[56] and other objects.

Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective's guiding principle, as he says in _The Sign of the Four_ and other stories, is: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth".[57]

Despite Holmes' remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of "The Adventure of the Yellow Face").[58]

Forensic science

Though Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy (for example, Scotland Yard's fingerprint bureau opened in 1901).

The detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of trace evidence and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene (_A Study in Scarlet_, "The Adventure of Silver Blaze", "The Adventure of the Priory School", _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, "The Boscombe Valley Mystery"); using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals ("The Adventure of the Resident Patient", _The Hound of the Baskervilles_); handwriting analysis and graphology ("The Adventure of the Reigate Squire", "The Man with the Twisted Lip"); comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud ("A Case of Identity"); using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ("The Adventure of the Reigate Squire"); comparing bullets from two crime scenes ("The Adventure of the Empty House"); analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders ("The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"), and an early use of fingerprints ("The Norwood Builder").

Because of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an optical microscope at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis and toxicology to detect poisons; Holmes's home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty". Ballistics feature in "The Adventure of the Empty House" when spent bullets are recovered and matched with a suspected murder weapon.

Disguises

Holmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories ("The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", "The Man with the Twisted Lip", "The Adventure of the Empty House" and "A Scandal in Bohemia"), to gather evidence undercover he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others ("The Adventure of the Dying Detective" and, again, "A Scandal in Bohemia"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, "The stage lost a fine actor ... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime".[59]

Agents

Until Watson's arrival at Baker Street Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city's underclass; these agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a “human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal”,[60] and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes’ “agent in the huge criminal underworld of London...”.[61] The most well known of Holmes' agents are a group of street children he called "the Baker Street Irregulars".

Combat

Pistols

Holmes and Watson often carry pistols with them—in Watson's case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s).[62] Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, and in "The Adventure of the Empty House" Holmes pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran. In "The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist", "The Adventure of Black Peter", and "The Adventure of the Dancing Men", Holmes or Watson use a pistol to capture the criminals.

Other weapons

As a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane. He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick and uses his cane twice as a weapon.[63] In _A Study in Scarlet_, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman, and in "The Adventure of the _Gloria Scott_" the detective practises fencing. In several stories ("A Case of Identity", "The Red-Headed League", "The Six Napoleons") Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his "favourite weapon".

Personal combat

The detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In "The Yellow Face", Holmes's chronicler says, "Few men were capable of greater muscular effort." In "The Adventure of the Speckled Band", Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing, "'if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again."

Holmes is an adept bare-knuckle fighter; "The Adventure of the _Gloria Scott_" mentions that Holmes trained as a boxer. In _The Sign of the Four_, he introduces himself to McMurdo, a prize fighter, as "the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back." McMurdo remembers: "Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy." In "The Yellow Face", Watson says: "He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen". The detective occasionally engages in hand-to-hand combat with his adversaries (in "The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist" and "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty").

In "The Adventure of the Empty House", Holmes tells Watson that he used a Japanese martial art known as baritsu to fling Moriarty to his death in the Reichenbach Falls. "Baritsu" is Conan Doyle's version of bartitsu, which combines jujitsu with boxing and cane fencing.[64]


Legacy

The detective story

Although Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role.[65] The investigating detective (such as Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey) became a successful character for a number of authors.

"Elementary, my dear Watson"

The phrase "ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are "elementary", and occasionally calls Watson "my dear Watson", the phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" is never uttered by him in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle.[66] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in "The Adventure of the Crooked Man" when Holmes explains a deduction: {{"'}}Excellent!' I cried. 'Elementary,' said he."[67][68]

William Gillette is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, "Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow", allegedly in his 1899 play _Sherlock Holmes_. However, the script was revised numerous times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others.[69]

The exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909;[70] there is some indication that it was clichéd even then.[71][72] The phrase "Elementary, my dear fellow, quite elementary" appears in P. G. Wodehouse's novel, _Psmith in the City_ (1909–10),[73] and "Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary" in his 1915 novel _Psmith, Journalist_ (neither spoken by Holmes).[74] The exact phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" is used by protagonist Tom Beresford in Agatha Christie's 1922 novel _The Secret Adversary_. It also appears at the end of the 1929 film _The Return of Sherlock Holmes_, the first Holmes sound film.[75] The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in The Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.[76]

The Great Game

's view of 221B Baker Street]]

Conan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the "canon" by Holmes aficionados. Early canonical scholars included Ronald Knox in Britain[77] and Christopher Morley in New York.[78] Morley founded The Baker Street Irregulars—the first society devoted to the Holmes canon—in 1934.[79]

The Sherlockian game (also known as the Holmesian game, the Great Game, or simply the Game) attempts to resolve anomalies and clarify details about Holmes and Watson from the canon. The Game, which treats Holmes and Watson as real people (and Conan Doyle as Watson's literary agent), combines history with aspects of the stories to construct biographies and other scholarly analyses of these aspects. Ronald Knox is credited with inventing the Game.[80]

One detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes's birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Morley and William Baring-Gould (author of _Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street: A Life of the World's First Consulting Detective_) contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in "His Last Bow" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation.[81] This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January.[82][83] Laurie R. King also speculated about Holmes's birth date. She instead argues that details in "The Adventure of the _Gloria Scott_" (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.[84]

Holmes's emotional and mental health have long been subjects of analysis in the Game. At their first meeting, in _A Study in Scarlet_, the detective warns Watson that he gets "in the dumps at times" and doesn't open his "mouth for days on end". Leslie S. Klinger has suggested that Holmes exhibits signs of bipolar disorder, with intense enthusiasm followed by indolent self-absorption. John Radford (1999) speculated on Holmes's intelligence.[85] Using Conan Doyle's stories as data, he applied three methods to estimate the detective's intelligence quotient and concluded that his IQ was about 190. Snyder (2004) examined Holmes's methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology.[86]

Societies

and a deerstalker cap on Picardy Place in Edinburgh (Conan Doyle's birthplace)]] In 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded. Both are still active, although the Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved in 1937 and revived in 1951. The London society is one of many worldwide who arrange visits to the scenes of Holmes adventures, such as the Reichenbach Falls in the Swiss Alps.

The two societies founded in 1934 were followed by many more, first in the U.S. (where they are known as "scion societies"—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark. There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan (whose society has 80,000 members).[87] Fans tend to be called "Holmesians" in Britain and "Sherlockians" in the United States, though recently "Sherlockian" has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location.[88][89][90][91]

Museums

For the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes's living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material. After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland by the author's son, Adrian.[92] Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public.

In 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened on Baker Street in London, followed the next year by a museum in Meiringen (near the Reichenbach Falls) dedicated to the detective.[93] A private Conan Doyle collection is a permanent exhibit at the Portsmouth City Museum, where the author lived and worked as a physician.[94]

Other honours

The London Metropolitan Railway named one of its 20 electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale.[95][96]

A number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson's Mews is near Crawford Place.[97]

In 2002, the Royal Society of Chemistry bestowed an honorary fellowship on Holmes for his use of forensic science and analytical chemistry in popular literature, making him (as of 2018) the only fictional character thus honoured.[98]


Adaptations and derived works

The popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. According to _The Alternative Sherlock Holmes: Pastiches, Parodies, and Copies_ by Peter Ridgway Watt and Joseph Green, the first known period pastiche dates from 1893. Titled "The Late Sherlock Holmes", it came from the pen of Conan Doyle's close friend, J. M. Barrie.

A common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the "giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared" in "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire"). Other adaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series _Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century_, and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman's "A Study in Emerald" (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer's _The Seven-Per-Cent Solution_, a 1974 _New York Times_ bestselling novel in which Holmes's cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It was made into a film of the same name in 1976 and popularised the pastiche-writing trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, or Jack the Ripper) into tales featuring Holmes, something Conan Doyle himself never did.

Related and derivative writings

In addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle's 1898 "The Lost Special" features an unnamed "amateur reasoner" intended to be identified as Holmes by his readers. The author's explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are the early "The Field Bazaar", "The Man with the Watches", and 1924's "How Watson Learned the Trick", a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes. The author wrote other material, especially plays, featuring Holmes. Much of it appears in _Sherlock Holmes: The Published Apocrypha_, edited by Jack Tracy; _The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_, edited by Peter Haining; and _The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes_, compiled by Richard Lancelyn Green.

In terms of writers other than Conan Doyle, authors as diverse as Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Dorothy B. Hughes, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, A. A. Milne, and P. G. Wodehouse have all written Sherlock Holmes pastiches. Notably, famed American mystery writer John Dickson Carr collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle's son, Adrian Conan Doyle, on _The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes_, a pastiche collection from 1954. In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, _The House of Silk_, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle's work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate.[99] A sequel, _Moriarty_, followed in 2014.[100] The popular “MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories” series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published in London by Steve Emecz’ MX Publishing, features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which have been “Compiled for the Benefit of the Restoration of Undershaw,” (the former estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle which now houses Stepping Stones School).[101] [102] According to The Strand Magazine, contributors include “Mike Hogan, Kelvin Jones, Jim French, Arthur Hall, Steve Ehrman, Greg Hatcher, Jayantika Ganguly, Paul Freeman, Dick Gillman, Maurice Barkley, Daniel D. Victor, Martin Rosenstock, Peter Coe Verbica, Hugh Ashton, Will Murray, Robert Perret, Thaddeus Tuffentsamer, G.L. Schulze, Tim Symonds, and a poem by Derrick Belanger” as well as “Forewords in both volumes by Nicholas Meyer, Roger Johnson, and David Marcum.”[103]

Some authors have written tales centered on characters from the canon other than Holmes. M. J. Trow has written a series of seventeen books using Inspector Lestrade as the central character, beginning with _The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade_ in 1985. Carole Nelson Douglas' Irene Adler series is based on "the woman" from "A Scandal in Bohemia", with the first book (1990's _Good Night, Mr. Holmes_) retelling that story from Adler's point of view. Martin Davies has written three novels where Baker Street housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is the protagonist. Mycroft Holmes has been the subject of several efforts: _Enter the Lion_ by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M. Wright (1979), a four-book series by Quinn Fawcett, and 2015's _Mycroft_, by former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. John Gardner, Michael Kurland, and Kim Newman, amongst many others, have all written tales in which Holmes's nemesis Professor Moriarty is the main character. Anthologies edited by Michael Kurland and George Mann are entirely devoted to stories told from the perspective of characters other than Holmes and Watson.

Laurie R. King recreated Holmes in her Mary Russell series (beginning with 1994's _The Beekeeper's Apprentice_), set during the First World War and the 1920s. Her Holmes, semi-retired in Sussex, is stumbled upon by a teenaged American girl. Recognising a kindred spirit, he trains her as his apprentice and subsequently marries her. As of 2018, the series includes sixteen base novels and additional writings.

_The Final Solution_, a 2004 novella by Michael Chabon, concerns an unnamed but long-retired detective interested in beekeeping who tackles the case of a missing parrot belonging to a Jewish refugee boy. Mitch Cullin's novel _A Slight Trick of the Mind_ (2005) takes place two years after the end of the Second World War, and explores an old and frail Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic; this was also adapted into a film, 2015's _Mr. Holmes_.

There have been a host of scholarly works dealing with Sherlock Holmes, some working within the bounds of the Great Game, and some written with the understanding that Holmes is a fictional character. In particular, there have been three major annotated editions of the complete series. The first was William Baring-Gould's 1967 _The Annotated Sherlock Holmes_. This two-volume set was ordered to fit Baring-Gould's preferred chronology, and was written from a Great Game perspective. The second was 1993's _The Oxford Sherlock Holmes_ (general editor: Owen Dudley Edwards), a nine-volume set written in a straight scholarly manner. The most recent is Leslie Klinger's _The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes_ (2004–05), a three-volume set that returns to a Great Game perspective.

Adaptations in other media

'' by Conan Doyle and actor William Gillette|left]]

_Guinness World Records_ has listed Holmes as the "most portrayed movie character",[104] with more than 70 actors playing the part in over 200 films. His first screen appearance was in the 1900 Mutoscope film, _Sherlock Holmes Baffled_.[105] The detective has appeared in many foreign-language versions, including a Russian miniseries broadcast in November 2013.[106] With 24 episodes per season, by the end of season two of _Elementary_ Jonny Lee Miller became the actor who had portrayed Sherlock Holmes the most in television and/or film beating Jeremy Brett with forty-one television episodes and Eille Norwood with forty-seven silent films.[107]

William Gillette's 1899 play _Sherlock Holmes, or The Strange Case of Miss Faulkner_ was a synthesis of several Conan Doyle stories. In addition to its popularity, the play is significant because it, rather than the original stories, introduced one of the key visual qualities commonly associated with Holmes today: his calabash pipe.[108] The play also formed the basis for the Gillette's 1916 film, _Sherlock Holmes_. In his lifetime, Gillette performed as Holmes some 1,300 times. In the early 1900s, H. A. Saintsbury took over the role from Gillette for a tour of the play. Between this play and Conan Doyle's own stage adaptation of "The Adventure of the Speckled Band", Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times.[109]

as Holmes]] Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson in fourteen U.S. films (two for 20th Century Fox and a dozen for Universal Pictures) from 1939 to 1946, and in _The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_ on the Mutual radio network from 1939 to 1946 (before the role of Holmes passed to Tom Conway). While the Fox films were period pieces, the Universal films abandoned Victorian Britain and moved to a then-contemporary setting in which Holmes occasionally battled Nazis.

The 1984–85 Italian/Japanese anime series _Sherlock Hound_ adapted the Holmes stories for children, with its characters being anthropomorphic dogs. The series was co-directed by Hayao Miyazaki.[110]

Between 1979 and 1986, Soviet television produced a series of five television films, _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson_.[111] The series were split into eleven episodes and starred Vasily Livanov as Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Watson. Livanov was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire[112] for a performance ambassador Anthony Brenton described as "one of the best I've ever seen".[113]

as Holmes in the TV series _Sherlock Holmes_ (1984)]] Jeremy Brett played the detective in seven series of _Sherlock Holmes_ for Britain's Granada Television from 1984 to 1994. Watson was played by David Burke (in the first two series) and Edward Hardwicke (in the remainder). Brett and Hardwicke also appeared on stage in 1988–89 in _The Secret of Sherlock Holmes_, directed by Patrick Garland.[114]

Bert Coules penned _The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_[115] starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams/Andrew Sachs as Watson,[116] based on throwaway references in Conan Doyle's short stories and novels.[117] He also produced original scripts for this series, which was also issued on CD.[118] Coules had previously dramatised the entire Holmes canon for BBC Radio Four.[119][120]

The 2009 film _Sherlock Holmes_ earned Robert Downey Jr. a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Holmes and co-starred Jude Law as Watson.[121] Downey and Law returned for a 2011 sequel, _Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_. In March 2019 a release date of 21 December 2021 was set for the third film in the series.[122]

as Holmes in _Sherlock_]] Benedict Cumberbatch plays a modern version of the detective (with Martin Freeman as John Watson) in the BBC One TV series _Sherlock_, which premiered in 2010. In the series, created by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, the stories' original Victorian setting is replaced by present-day London. Cumberbatch's Holmes uses modern technology (including texting and blogging) to help solve crimes.[123] Similarly, _Elementary_ premiered on CBS in 2012. Set in contemporary New York, the series features Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as a female Dr. Joan Watson.[124]

The 2015 film _Mr. Holmes_ starred Ian McKellen as a retired Sherlock Holmes living in Sussex, in 1947, who grapples with an unsolved case involving a beautiful woman. The film is based on Mitch Cullin's 2005 novel _A Slight Trick of the Mind_.[125][126]

Holmes has also appeared in video games, including the _Sherlock Holmes_ series of eight main titles. According to the publisher, Frogwares, the series has sold over seven million copies.[127]

Copyright issues

The copyright for Conan Doyle's works expired in the United Kingdom and Canada at the end of 1980, was revived in 1996 and expired again at the end of 2000. The author's works are now in the public domain in those territories.[128][129] All works published in the United States before 1923 are in the public domain; this includes all the Sherlock Holmes stories, except for some of the short stories collected in _The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes_. Conan Doyle's heirs registered the copyright to _The Case-Book_ in 1981 in accordance with the Copyright Act of 1976.[130][131]

On 14 February 2013, Leslie S. Klinger (lawyer and editor of _The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes_) filed a declaratory judgement suit against the Conan Doyle estate in the Northern District of Illinois asking the court to acknowledge that the characters of Holmes and Watson were public domain in the U.S.[132] The court ruled in Klinger's favour on 23 December, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its decision on 16 June 2014.[133][134] The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, letting the appeals court's ruling stand. This final step resulted in the characters from the Holmes stories, along with all but nine of the stories themselves (those present in _The_ _Case-Book_ other than "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone", "The Problem of Thor Bridge", and "The Adventure of the Creeping Man"), being in the public domain in the U.S.[135] American copyright on the remaining protected stories expires between 2020 and 2023.
