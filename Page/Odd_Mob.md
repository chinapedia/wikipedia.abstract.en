ODD MOB (sometimes stylised as ODD MOB) is an alias of DJ / producer Harry Hope from Brisbane, Australia. Odd Mob most well known for the viral hit "Is It a Banger?", which placed at number 70 in the 2014 Triple J Hottest 100,[1] and "Into You" featuring fellow Aussie singer / songwriter Starley, which topped the ARIA Club Tracks chart for 7 weeks.[2] and was championed by Annie Mac on her Radio 1 show.

Harry has always produced a wide range of electronic music. With a string of original works including; ‘Down For Love’ which had huge Triple J support, and ‘Intrinsic’ which bookmarked a turning point in production for ODD MOB with support pouring in from all corners of the globe, Odd Mob has since dropped a brand new work titled 'All Of Your Heart', which is co-written by fellow Aussie song writer, Alex Burnett. Never downplaying his club roots, Harry has continued to develop various singles, an EP, and an entire ‘Oddities’ brand to experiment with various elements of his highly skilled production. A shining example of his club work, was the release of the electro house thumper ‘Gassed Up’, quickly catching the attention of DJ Snake and Jauz, who sampled the track forming a new work of the same name. Odd Mob has remixed for the likes of A-Trak, Motez (producer), Starley (singer), POOLCLVB,  and Lorde.
