_REACH OUT!_ is an album by American pianist Hal Galper's Quintet, released on the Danish SteepleChase label in 1977.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states, "Hal Galper was on a tear during the 1970s, writing a number of adventurous post-bop compositions and getting regular opportunities to record them ... This is easily one of [his] best recordings".[4]
