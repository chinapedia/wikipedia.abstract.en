The Harlem Repertory Theatre was founded in 2004 by Keith Lee Grant, who serves as the Artistic Director of the Company. It is a non-profit theatre group which explores diverse and challenging themes such as race, class, and politics. Most of the actors are people of color from the New York area. It was established to fulfill Langston Hughes’ 1938 vision for a professional theatre in Harlem. Its first season in Aaron Davis Hall at the City College campus were the Broadway musicals HAIR, THE WIZ, and a new musical piece called VODU. Subsequent seasons included an eclectic range of musicals, plays and a Shakespeare comedy.


Mission Statement

"The Harlem Repertory Theatre is a non-profit 501 (c)(3) theater committed to producing artistically and intellectually challenging productions that explore the experiences of a diverse range of ethnic, social and cultural communities. Moreover, The HRT stages new works and established classic musicals and plays from bold and innovative perspectives that will challenge and/or reflect the Harlem community's cultural and social values. Critical themes of race, class and politics will often be addressed in our productions as we hope to inspire, entertain and educate our audiences through the diverse repertory of popular and obscure plays and musicals that we stage each season."

The HRT staff is committed to offering first-rate and affordable theatrical performances to the greater Tri State area; consequently when it is possible — the admission fees to our productions will range from a ten-dollar suggested donation to requesting that our patrons simply, "pay what you can".

In conclusion, The HRT is committed to fulfilling Langston Hughes’ 1938 vision for a professional theatre in Harlem:

'''''"...On the opening night... a beaming Langston renew(ed) his promise of a Harlem repertory theatre: 'We want to build a theatre for you folks, a theatre for which you may write, in which you may act. This is your theatre.' "

'''Langston Hughes April 21, 1938'[1]Keith_Lee_Grant.jpg

Reception

Reviews

Overall, the company has received positive reviews, most notably towards its musical productions. Daniel M. Gold of the _New York Times_ reviewed _Flahooley_, stating that "the Harlem Repertory Theater demonstrates how to entertain on a shoestring" and under Grant's direction, "has been trimmed to a 90-minute burst of energy and imagination."[5] Linda Armstrong of the _New York Amsterdam News_ called both _Flahooley_ and _Finian's Rainbow_ "marvelous theater performed in an intimate setting," urging other to attend the production as well. She praised Grant, admiring how he "allows the performers of the Harlem Repertory Theatre to display their versatility, as cast members play multiple roles in the productions. " [6]

Awards and Nominations

Since 2008, the Harlem Repertory Theatre has received five AUDELCO "Viv" Awards.[7] Currently, its revival of In the Heights is nominated for "Best Revival."[8]
