EXPLOSIVE ANTIMONY is an allotrope of the chemical element antimony that is so sensitive to shocks that it explodes when scratched or subjected to sudden heating.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The allotrope was first described in 1855.[7][8]

Chemists form the allotrope through electrolysis of a concentrated solution of antimony trichloride in hydrochloric acid, which forms an amorphous glass.[9][10][11][12] This glass contains significant amounts of halogen impurity at its boundaries.

When it explodes the allotrope releases of energy per gram.[13] White fumes of antimony trichloride are produced and the elemental antimony reverts to its metallic form.
