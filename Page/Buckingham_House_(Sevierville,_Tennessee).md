History

The land was home to Cherokees until European settlers, led by John Sevier, chased them away between 1776 and 1785.[1] It was subsequently purchased from Sevier by Thomas Buckingham, who served as the first sheriff of Sevier County.[2]

With his brother Ephriam, Thomas Buckingham built this brickhouse in 1795, making it the oldest remaining house in Sevier County.[3] It was designed in the Federal architectural style.[4] It overlooks the French Broad River.[5]

By 1890, an additional ell, with two rooms and a porch, was built.[6]

The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since March 18, 1971.[7]
