Dnp_ukr2013_08.JPG The MENORAH CENTER (, ) is a cultural and business center of the Jewish community in Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine. Some sources declare it to be the biggest multifunctional Jewish community center in Europe[1] or in the world.[2] The heart of the complex is the historic Golden Rose central synagogue, built in the 19th century.

The dedication ceremony of the Menorah center took place on October 16, 2012 with guests that included the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Amar, Israel Minister of Information and Diaspora Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, representatives of Jewish institutions (including Hillel, the Jewish Agency, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee etc.), Ukrainian state and local authorities, and diplomatic corps.


Idea

The idea to create Menorah center, as one of the biggest such centers in the world, belongs to the President of the Dnipropetrovsk Jewish community Gennadiy Bogolyubov Europe[3] and the President of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine (also the founder of European Jewish Union) Ihor Kolomoyskyi. They both provided full financial support for the project implementation. The supposed concept of the Menorah center construction is to combine three functional elements (spirituality, culture and business) in one complex building.


General description

The center is built in the shape of a seven-branched synagogue candelabrum (menorah). It consists of seven made of precious marble[4] towers, highest one of which is 20 stories (77 m.) tall.[5] The construction has total floor area of about 50,000 sq.m. There are synagogue, museums, office premises, shopping spaces, publishing house, art galleries, kosher restaurants and cafes, conference halls, banquet halls, a luxury hotel, youth hostel, classrooms, tourist information center, visa center of Israel. General project design was made by architect Alexander Sorin.

Signs and labels in Menorah are written in four languages - English, Ukrainian, Russian and Hebrew. The official address of the center is SHOLOM-ALEIKHEMA ST., 4/26, DNIPRO, DNIPROPETROVSK OBLAST, 49000, UKRAINE.

One of the center's declared priorities is to use business profits for funding charitable projects.[6] The presumed purpose is to serve Jewish community of about 30,000 in Dnipro and its other population disregarding background.[7]
