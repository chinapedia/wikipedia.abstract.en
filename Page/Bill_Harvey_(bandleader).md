WILLIAM G. HARVEY (October 1918 – October 6, 1964)[1] was an American rhythm and blues saxophonist and bandleader.

Born in Winona, Mississippi, he moved with his mother to Memphis, Tennessee as a child.[2] He became the leader of one of the most successful performing bands in Memphis immediately after World War II, establishing a residency at Mitchell's Hotel on Beale Street. In 1950, he signed a deal with Don Robey's Peacock Records in Houston, Texas, and his band featured on many of the successful R&B records released by Peacock and Duke Records during the 1950s, including those by Marie Adams, Big Mama Thornton, Bobby "Blue" Bland, and Little Junior Parker.[3] He also led Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown's touring band.[4] In 1952, he signed with B. B. King to become the blues singer and guitarist's bandleader, a role he continued for the next four years.[5][6][7]

Harvey suffered from diabetes and, after having both his legs amputated, died in Memphis in 1964, aged 46.[8]
