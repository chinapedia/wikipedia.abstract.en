GALILEE is an unincorporated community in Terrell Rural Municipality No. 101, Saskatchewan, Canada. The community is located on Highway 36 about 50Â km south of the city of Moose Jaw. Very little remains of the community other thank an old general store and a private residence.[1] It is thus regularly described as a ghost town by travelers.[2][3]
