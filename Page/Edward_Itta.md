Itta served as the Mayor of North Slope Borough, Alaska, the northernmost borough in the United States, for two consecutive terms from 2005 until 2011.[1] On November 27, 2012, President Barack Obama appointed Itta to the seven-member United States Arctic Research Commission, a federal agency which functions as the government's Arctic policy and research commission.[2][3] He served on the Commission until the expiration of his term on July 29, 2015.[4]

Additionally, Itta served as the President of the Inuit Circumpolar Council of Alaska, President of the Barrow Whaling Captains Association, vice chairman of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, and a representative for Alaska on the Outer Continental Shelf Policy Committee.[5]

In November 2008, Itta was re-elected to a second term with more than 53% of the vote.[6] His nearest opponent, former North Slope Borough mayor George Ahmaogak Sr., received nearly 40% in the 2008 mayoral election.[7]
