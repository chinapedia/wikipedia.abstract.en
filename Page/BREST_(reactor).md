The BREST reactor is a Russian concept of lead-cooled fast reactor aiming to the standards of a generation IV reactor. Two designs are planned, the BREST-300 (300 MWe) and the BREST-1200 (1200 MWe). Main characteristics of the BREST reactor are passive safety and a closed fuel cycle.[1]

The reactor uses nitride uranium-plutonium fuel, is a breeder reactor and can burn long-term radioactive waste. Lead is chosen as a coolant for being high-boiling, radiation-resistant, low-activated and at atmospheric pressure.[2]


BREST-300

The construction of the BREST-300-OD in Seversk (near Tomsk) was approved in August 2016.[3][4]

The first BREST-300 will be a demonstration unit, as forerunner to the BREST-1200.
