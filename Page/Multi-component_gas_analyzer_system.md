A_selection_of_instruments_used_for_monitoring_volcanoes.jpg A MULTI-COMPONENT GAS ANALYZER SYSTEM (MULTI-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes.[1] A Multi-GAS package includes an infrared spectrometer for CO₂, two electrochemical sensors for SO₂ and H₂S, and pressure–temperature–humidity sensors, all in a weatherproof box weighing approximately 3 kg,[2] as well as radio transmitters to transmit data to remote locations. The instrument package is portable, and its operation and data analysis are simple enough to be conducted by non-specialists.[3]

Multi-GAS instruments have been used to measure volcanic gas plumes at Mount Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano Italy, Villarrica (volcano) Chile, Masaya Volcano Nicaragua, Mount Yasur and Ambrym Vanuatu, Miyake-jima and Mount Asama Japan, Soufrière Hills Montserrat, with permanent installations at Etna and Stromboli.[4]

Multi-GAS measurements of CO₂/SO₂ ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.[5]
