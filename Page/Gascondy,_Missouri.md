GASCONDY is an extinct town in southern Osage County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1]

The townsite was on the east side of the Gasconade floodplain along the railroad line between Freeburg to the west and Belle in northern Maries County to the east.[2]

A post office called Gascondy was established in 1907, and remained in operation until 1942.[3] The community most likely derives its name from the Gasconade River.[4]
