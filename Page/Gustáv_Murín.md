GUSTÁV MURÍN (1959) is a Slovak author and journalist. He has written critically on corruption in Slovak politics.[1] His _Small World_ was published in France as _Le monde est petit_.

Murin was accused by his peers of suffering from Unwarranted Self-importance and mild paranoid-delusions. Murin himself considers his at times eccentric opinions as valid positions. [2]

He runs a blog referenced mostly by Slovakian conspiracy theorists websites and fringe/fake news outlets. [3] In 2018 he was employed by the Slovak state run media agency RTVS to run an educational programme about Europe.
