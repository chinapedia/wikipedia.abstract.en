ALFRED LAMOND (25 May 1886 – 10 March 1967) was an Australian politician who was a Labor Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1924 to 1933, representing the seat of Pilbara.

Lamond was born in Wytwarrone, a rural locality near Apsley, Victoria, to Margaret (née Barnes) and Angus Lamond. He came to Western Australia in 1905, and began working as a prospector in the Marble Bar district. He later worked as a publican (at Port Hedland) and shearer.[1] Lamond entered parliament at the 1924 state election, winning Pilbara from Henry Underwood of the Nationalist Party. He was re-elected at the 1927 and 1930 elections, but did not contest the 1933 election.[2] After leaving politics, Lamond again worked as a publican in Port Hedland for a period, and then was a clerk for the Public Works Department. He died in Perth in March 1967, aged 80. He had married Elsie Ann Clements in 1924, with whom he had five children.[3]
