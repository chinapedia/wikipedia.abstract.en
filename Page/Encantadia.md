Synopsis

Encantadia is a vast and enchanted realm. It comprises three major kingdoms: Lireo, Sapiro and Hathoria and one autonomous territory, Adamya.

At the beginning, Encantadia was at peace, there was only one gemstone, the Mother Gem, given by their deity, Emre. It ensured the balance of nature in Encantadia. But greedy encantados such as a fairy named Adhara, wanted to seize the power of the gem. Also, distrust among the four territories made a fragile political climate in their realm. The other territories think that Lireo, the queendom of fairies, wield too much power since their queen and founder Cassiopeia is the keeper of the Mother Gem. They think that too much power could corrupt the fairies. To balance the powers to each kingdom and to make it harder to seize the powers all at once, the keeper of the Mother Gem, Cassiopeia, made the fateful decision and cleaved the gem. It resulted in a violent explosion and the once single gem became four parts. Each gemstone was given to the four major territories of Encantadia.

Lireo, in the east, is the matriarchal queendom of diwatas and lambanas (fairies and pixies). They cared for Brilyante ng Hangin (Gemstone of Air). It is the home of the temple of their supreme deity, Emre.

Sapiro, in the north, is the kingdom of healers and valiant warriors. They kept the Brilyante ng Lupa (Gemstone of Earth). Their land is blessed with fertile soil and minerals like no other kingdom in their world.

Hathoria, in the west, is the kingdom of militaristic miners and blacksmiths that develop weapons and war machinery. They held the Brilyante ng Apoy (Gemstone of Fire).

Adamya, in the south, is the territory of wise pacifist lamang-lupas (dwarves and hobbits). They kept the Brilyante ng Tubig (Gemstone of Water). This territory surrounded by the Adamyan Ocean, thrives in fishing and farming. It is also the only unfortified territory in Encantadia.

Cassiopeia thought that this would bring peace to their land but instead it brought chaos. Hathoria, led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started a war to claim the other gems that they may gain power and rule over their whole world. He wanted the natural resources brought by the gemstones for the advancement of his own kingdom, firmly believing that their kingdom is more deserving to keep all the four gemstones. After seizing the Gemstone of Water from Adamya, the Hathors waged war with the Sapiro, in pursuit of the Gemstone of Earth. King Arvak seized the Gemstone of Earth from King Armeo of Sapiro before killing him. Later, King Arvak was killed by the Prince Raquim of Sapiro, Armeo's cousin. Before Arvak died, Raquim claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from Arvak's possession. The death of King Arvak weakened the Hathor force and made them retreat. But Hathoria, in retaliation, managed to massacre the Sapiryan royal family and destroy the kingdom. The kingdom of Sapiro fell and was left in ruins, its citizens scattered into different tribes in the northern mountains. Prince Raquim immediately brought the three gemstones to Queen Mine-a of Lireo, the current keeper of Gemstone of Air, for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Since then, the monarch of Lireo not only rules the kingdom but also is tasked to be the protector of the four gemstones.

Many years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, when Queen Mine-a will choose her successor from her daughters, the four Sang'gres (Royal Blood Fairies), Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya. She and Imaw, an elder from Adamya, can feel imminent danger lurking, and as she is being called to Devas (the world of the blessed dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chooses and crowns Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion. Pirena's treachery set the chain of events that transpired for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the Gemstone of Fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost. Hathoria now plans to rise up from hiding and bring Lireo to its demise, with the end in view of ruling over the whole of Encantadia. Fortunately, Queen Mine-a before her death willed the remaining gemstones to her daughters. the youngest, Danaya became the keeper of the Gemstone of Earth. Her third daughter, Alena, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Water and her second daughter and new queen of Lireo, Amihan, became the keeper of the Gemstone of Air.

Pirena feigned reconciliation with her sisters after their mother's death. She hid her connivance with Hathoria from her sisters. Because of Pirena's lies and manipulations, she was successful in destroying the relationship of her sisters and usurping the throne from Amihan through the help of King Hagorn of Hathoria. But her treachery came back to her as she discovered too late that King Hagorn was just using her to gain access to the gemstones. With the Gemstone of Fire and Water back in Hathorian hands, the destined savior of Encantadia, Amihan's lost daughter, Lira, must unite the four sisters to gain back the lost gemstones and to bring balance again to their world. They will also find an ally in a warrior named Ybarro, which was later revealed to be the lost and only surviving member of the Sapiryan royal family, Prince Ibrahim, destined to unite and bring back the glory of the fallen kingdom of Sapiro. The sisters will soon learn that the greatest magic of all is forgiveness and love and that only through unity can they stop the evil that spread through their realm.

But with the Gemstone of Fire and Water under Hathorian hands, the sisters found it hard to reclaim Lireo from Hathorian rule. They will find their answer in the most unlikely of all beings. A lost human boy that was kidnapped into Encantadia named Paopao became Amihan's saviour. They shall soon discover that the boy wields an unknown Gemstone, the Gemstone of Quintessence/Soul, it was catapulted during the explosion the night the Mother Gem was cleaved. It was buried in the earth, hidden from the knowledge of all encantados, until Paopao accidentally discovered the gemstone. The new gemstone gave the sisters the leverage and hope to go against the now powerful Hathorian throne. Fortunately, the sisters managed to bring down the kingdom of Hathoria and bring peace to their realm. They also succeeded in uniting the gem fragments to form the Mother Gem again. They thought they have achieved peace but a new threat came their way.

In the beginning, the world of Encantadia was created when the five major bathaluman (deities) Arde, his brother Emre, Ether, Haliya and Keros were cast out of the heavens for remaining neutral during the celestial civil war. They arrived in a strange, uninhabited land and claimed it for themselves. The bathalumans decided to name the new world, Encantadia. Working together, the deities transformed the barren land into a paradise, populating it with both offspring and creations like the many creatures that inhabit the Encantadian wilds to ease the pain of their exile.

Relations between the masters of Encantadia were genial at first and the beings of Encantadia lived in harmony and unity devoid of malice, until Ether and Arde fell in love. They also got jealous of the many worshipers Emre has. They planned to get rid of Emre to be free from him by absorbing the powers of the Haliya and Keros. Enraged at the two for succumbing to their baser instincts and violating the terms of their exile, Emre cursed them by turning Ether into a giant snake for her treachery. Arde was banished to limbo, transformed into a dragon tasked to forever safeguard the boundaries between the world of the living and the world of the damned, Bala-ak. Emre likewise left Encantadia and made Devas, the world of the blessed dead, his home, leaving Ether to fend for herself. Keros and Haliya each put themselves in exile to be away from all the chaos. Keros lived alone in the island of Binyaan while Haliya lived on Encantadia's second moon.

Abandoned and cursed, Ether raged for many days. Because of her horrific and feral form, most of the citizens of Encantadia grew to fear Ether and shunned her. Others, in awe of her new power and pity of her plight, came to worship the bathaluman, who in turn granted them her power and protection. They became the first citizens of the kingdoms that shall unite and will become the empire of Etheria. The empire was made up of four Heras (royal houses), with the members of each house possessing a unique ability given by Ether associated with their house.

Hera Andal, the ruling royal house and Etheria's capital and residence of the Monarch, Empress Avria. It's denizens are known to have knowledge in black magic, dark arts and witchcraft. They possess dominion over life and death through their extensive knowledge of the healing arts and sorcery. They also mastered the transfer of dying souls to living beings.

Hera Volo, the royal house of Etheria's military and infantry that have special abilities in the category of time, space and speed (such as accelerating or enhancing the speed of their movements, teleportation, time travel and manipulation of time). It is headed by Etheria's military general, Hera Juvila. They made Etheria's greatest treasure, the Golden Hourglass that can be used for time-travel and to rewrite history.

Hera Sensa, the royal house of Etheria's scholars. They are psychics, mind readers, telepaths, and possess other powers or abilities involving the mind. It is headed by Avria's ever loyal adviser, Hera Andora.

Hera Ae-ga, the mysterious royal house composed of only women. They can manipulate and dictate emotions/feelings, they are also skilled in archery. They live in tree houses in Etheria's jungles. It is headed by Hera Odessa.

The four territories of Encantadia were once vassals of Etheria. Because of their might and power, Etherians became cruel and wanted to conquer the whole of Encantadia in the name of their goddess, Ether. The four territories banded together and with the help of Emre (through his gift, the Mother Gem), Etheria was destroyed completely and was forgotten from the memories of all encantados. But Avria could not be defeated easily even as her empire succumbed, as the empress swore that Etheria would return to power by the blood and spirit of those who made her empire fall. Meanwhile, Etheria's most powerful weapon, the Golden Hourglass, was lost and ultimately forgotten as time passed.

Through the machinations of the goddess, Ether, by using the blood and spirit from the dead from the Great War, The prophecy was fulfilled and the Golden Hourglass was re-discovered. Etheria came back to the present time, Etheria rose again from the ashes and is becoming the mighty empire it used to be. They will try to merge their past glory into the present and change history. But unlike before, the Etherians now know better. They now know that as long as the gemstones are in the hands of the fairies, they have no chance of winning but by using their personal weaknesses, it is easier to destroy the sisters and get their respective gemstones and by doing so their empire could be rebuilt again in the present.

Also their deity, Ether and her lover, Arde can finally usurp the divine throne of Emre in Devas. The Herans of Etheria tricked the sisters into going against each other. The events will challenge the trust and loyalty of the sisters to each other and to their duty as protectors of the gems and their realm. The fate of their world rests in their unity, trust and love. The sisters must also convince the other exiled deities, the moon goddess, Haliya and the destruction deity, Keros to side with Emre in a celestial war while trying to find the next generation of Encantados that will be worthy to inherit the powers of the gemstones and the duty to protect their land.


Production

Development

Encantadia is a term coined from the Filipino words "enkanto", "enkanta", "enkantada", or "enkantado" (which was in turn derived from the Spanish term encant(ad){o/a}) which means enchanted beings endowed with supernatural powers.[4] The series was created by GMA Network, the same network that produced the fantasy-themed series _Mulawin_ and _Darna_. It was directed by Mark Reyes and Gil Tejada, Jr., and written by Suzette Doctolero.[5][6] Originally, the series was intended as GMA Films' entry to the 2004 Metro Manila Film Festival but they later decided to make _Encantadia_ a daily fantasy soap opera due to its huge production and budget. Encantadia was Doctolero's first head writing project with the network in 2005, and also served as her training for writing a fantasy story for the first time.[7] According to her, it was inspired by the story of Maria Makiling, a _diwata (fairy)_ in Philippine folklore, in four different persona.[8] It was also inspired by different stories around the world combined into one.[9] The first three installment were consecutively shown from 2005 to 2006.[10][11] In 2010, a second saga or fourth installment was scheduled to be produced by GMA Network, but it was not push through until Atty Gozon, CEO of GMA Network pushed it back for 2012, but was scrapped.[12] In 2015,the director, producer and the writer were given a go signal by the network to make the new Encantadia.[13] In January 2016, it was announced that the fourth installment will be a reboot (often called as requel or retelling-sequel) of the old series.[14]

Setting

According to Mark Reyes, the sets of Encantadia in 2005 are located in various places in the Philippines. The Kingdom of Adamya is located at Calatagan, Batangas.[15] The cave set of Hathorian Kingdom is located at the Kalinawan Cave in Tanay, Rizal. Lireo's forest is located at Daranak Falls and Batlag Falls in Rizal.[16] A 1,900 square meter warehouse in Pasig City served as an indoor set with an improvised pond.[17] The said warehouse was also a setting change for Lireo, Sapiro, Hera Andal, Hera Sensa and others. The Kingdom of Sapiro set is located inside the historic walled city of Intramuros (Old Manila) in the heart of Manila.[18] In its second and third installment, the series used the same locations.

In 2016, a 3000 square meter warehouse in Makati City was converted to a set for the Lireo Kingdom and its forest.[19] The fallen Sapiro Kingdom and the Island of Cassiopeia were shot in Fortune Island in Batangas. Another warehouse set was converted as the Kingdom of Hathoria, while the mortal world were shot in various locations around Manila.[20] The forest of Encantadia were shot in Tanay, Rizal, Pundaquit in Zambales as well as Batlag Falls and Daranak Falls.[21]

Musical scoring

The main theme of the series is its own soundtrack titled _"Tadhana"_(destiny) described as a chant/hymn, composed and sung by Filipino folk singer Bayang Barrios.[22][23] According to Barrios, when she arrived in the recording studio, the hymn structure was already done by Allan Feliciano. The chant's theme is inspired by a drought and deforestation. One of the factors that contributed to the success of the 2005 series is its musical scoring, it was highly commended in the 2005 Asian Television Awards for "Best Original Music Score".[24] In the sequel, Etheria, aside from "Tadhana", Feliciano also arranged a soundtrack titled as _"Hade!!"_ (to attack) which refer as the Etherian war song; sung also by Barrios. Unlike "Tadhana", it is a lyrical song formed in Enchanta. Based on the lyrics, the song is about the creation of Encantadia, the five kingdoms including Etheria, and warfare. In the end, the composer appears to question the unending violence in the land including the lack of love and peace.[25] Sub-tracks were also included in the series such as _"Asshenti"_, an Etherian love song sung by Barrios and the Lirean Hymn, _"Ivo"_(life) arranged by Ariel Hugo, which was sung by Karylle. In the 2016 series, it uses the main soundtrack "Tadhana", which was modernized and beat has been altered to a rock-twist to fit the new generation.[26] Moreover, "Ivo" was also used as recorded by Gabbi Garcia.[27]

_"Ang Mahiwagang Puso"_ (Enchanted Heart) written by Tats Faustino, sung by Karylle and Jerome John Hughes was used as a soundtrack to the original version of the series.[28] Karylle also recorded _"Hiling"_ (Wish) but was rarely used in the series. _"Pangarap ni Lira"_ (Lira's wish), composed by Suzette Doctolero, arranged by Eric Torralba and sung by Jennylyn Mercado was also part of the soundtrack.[29] Other soundtracks include _"Isang Bagong Mundo"_ (A whole new world) performed by Jennylyn Mercado, arranged by Eric Torralba and written by Suzette Doctolero; _"Sa Pakpak ng Paru-paro"_ (Fairy's Wings) composed by Mark A. Reyes and arranged by Eric Torralba.[30]

_"Maghihintay Ako"_ (I'll Be Waiting), sung by Gabbi Garcia and Christian Bautista and _"Sa Pangarap Lang"_ (Through a Dream) sung by Mikee Quintos are being used in the 2016 series.[31][32] Mikee Quintos also recorded _"Ang Awit ni Lira"_ (Lira's Hymn) for the requel.[33]


Overview

Encantadia is an enchanted place in a different realm. All of the characters existing in this world are called _Encantados_. It was discovered and created thousand years ago by five supernatural beings, Haliya, Arde, Emre, Keros and Ether who were referred to as _bathala_ (Gods) on the present times.[34] The world they created was settled upon by low-class working individuals called "barbaro". Because of this, the three Bathala created four classes of individuals: the _diwata's_ (fairies) of Lireo Kingdom; mystical creatures of the Adamyan territory; the warriors and healers called _sapiryans_ of the Sapiro Kingdom and the blacksmiths of the Hathoria Kingdom.[35] The four kingdoms promised allegiance and worship to Emre, which caused Arde and Ether's jealousy and hatred, resulting to a plan to assassinate him.[36][37] Emre discovered this plan and cursed both of them: Arde to become a dragon who was sent to guard _valaak_(hell) and Ether to turn into snake to forever remind her of being a traitor.[38] With this, the encantados are divided between the gods resulting to factions.[39] Some encantados followed Ether and established the fifth Kingdom of Encantadia called, _Etheria_, which had later fallen due to the greed of their Queen Avria to conquer the whole Encantadia causing the rest to unite against their Kingdom.[40]

The Gems

The world of Encantadia is being powered and guarded by a powerful gem referred as _Inang Brilyante_ (mother gem) protected by Cassiopeia, the first Queen of Lireo.[55] The gem has powerful characteristics and abilities, and is considered as the most powerful weapon of Encantadia.[56] With this, it is being sought by greedy encantados driving Cassiopeia to break it into four elemental gems that hold balance to the realm: fire, air, water and earth.[57] She later handed them to the four kingdoms of Encantadia. King Arvak of Hathoria wanted to acquire all gems, starting a rebellion leading to the Great Encantadian War wherein he was killed. Prince Raquim of Sapiro was able to recover the fire and water gem from King Arvak, and decided to bring the two gems and the Sapiro's earth gem to Lireo for safekeeping.[58] Since then, the four powerful gems are guarded by the Queen of Lireo who then handed them to her four offspring: Pirena, the keeper of the fire gem; Amihan for the air gem, and Alena and Danaya for the water and earth gem respectively.[59] On the 2016 series, a fifth gem was introduced as a result of Cassiopeia's intense breakage of the mother gem, which propelled to the sea shore wherein a lost mortal became the keeper.[60][61]

-   _Fire Gem (Brilyante ng Apoy)_ – The gem grants its owner the power to control fire, warmth and light. In this sense, the beholder can intensify sunlight and conjure fire. This gem has the ability of shapeshifting into another person. It can also create volcanic eruptions.[62]
-   _Air Gem (Brilyante ng Hangin)_ – The gem grants its owner the power to control the air, wind and coldness. In this sense, the beholder can change air currents, conjure oxygen in areas without it and transform into the air itself. It also grants the holder the ability to fly and shapeshift into wind. The gem can also be employed in detecting the presence of nearby beings by tracing the sound of their breaths.[63]
-   _Water Gem (Brilyante ng Tubig)_ – The gem grants its keeper the power to control water. It enhances its keeper's strength and enables the person to control biosonar, liquids and sea creatures. It also enables its keeper to summon rain and portray an image through water.[64]
-   _Earth Gem (Brilyante ng Lupa)_ – The gem grants its owner earth-based powers, enabling the person to control the earth, vegetation and nature. In this sense, the beholder can conjure earthquakes, communicate with plants and animals, shapeshift into any flora and fauna and heal herself. Without the presence of the gem of earth, plants would wilt, animals would die, and beings in Encantadia would weaken.[65]
-   _Spirit Gem (Brilyante ng Diwa)_ - In the 2016 series, a fifth gem, also called _Brilyante ng Diwa_ (Gem of Spirit) was introduced as a result of a fragment from Cassiopeia's intense breakage of the Mother gem. Its powers and abilities are all the abilities of the four gemstone and has power to give life and control spirits and the spirit realm [66]
-   _Purple Gem (Brilyanteng Lila)_ - Also in the 2016 series, a sixth gem _Brilyanteng Lila_ (Purple Gem) was also introduced, a cube shaped amethyst used by Emre to tempt Lira with power, alongside with riches. He said that the sixth gem has equal power to the first five gems. It has the power of balance of nature. The first five gems are to create and maintain, the final gem is for destruction and rebirth. Its powers is to balance all the works (anti-matter) of all the other gems. Lira declined the gem and was kept until now by Emre. This gem is not part of the Inang Brilyante (Mother Gem).

Enchanta

Encantadia uses a fictional language called _Enchanta_.[67] It was created and conceptualized by Suzette Doctolero to make the viewers feel that the world of Encantados be somehow realistic and genuine. Doctolero created its vocabulary from many Indo-European languages with some influences of Philippine languages especially Tagalog.[68] It can be traced from words like _"corre"_, to love (from the root "cor" meaning heart) and _"avoya"_, to travel (voyage).[69] The language is also notable of being spoken as it sounds like its from some kind of European country because of the tone and the phonotactics.[70] Most characters from the Encantadia saga know how to speak Enchanta, but it was Cassiopeia that had spoken the language most in the whole series, from the fact that she is the first diwata (fairy) of Lireo and ancestor of all the royal-blooded diwatas.[71][72]

Wars in Encantadia

In its known history, the world of Encantadia has seen four major wars (so there are minor wars like Sapiro-Hathorian war) that has broken and threatened the peace of the realm.

Plot

Encantadia (2005)

The story unfolds in Lireo, the kingdom where Ynang Reyna (Queen Mother) Minea lives with her daughters Amihan, Alena, Danaya, and Pirena.[73] The four Sangg'res are tasked to be the new keepers of the brilliantes. Their skills in war and their powers as the royalty of the diwatas are believed to be the strength of Lireo.[74] As long as the gemstones are kept properly, the balance of nature in Encantadia remains. But everything changed when Pirena, the oldest of the four Sang'gre's consumed by her greed and jealousy, plotted the downfall of her own sister Amihan who succeeded their mother as Queen.[75] This resulted into the War of the four Gems, or the war between the Hathoria Kingdom and the rest. With this situation, Lira, the lost daughter of Amihan returned to Encantadia and tried to fulfill her mission of mending the broken relationships of the strong-willed gemstone keepers.[76]

Etheria (2005–06)

Back when Encantadia was a young world, there was a great empire called Etheria, ruled by Reyna Avria, who wanted to control the neighboring kingdoms of Lireo, Sapiro, Adamya and Hathoria. However, the four kingdoms banded together and attempted to defeat the forces of Etheria in the Great Encantadian War. After Etheria had fallen, Avria swore that Etheria would return to power once the last Sang'gre is born. The prophecy was then fulfilled due to the birth of Cassandra. Etheria rose again from the ashes and in order to save the present, the four Sang'gres of Lireo travelled back to the past in ancient Encantadia, find the lost Sang'gre, and destroy the Ginintuang Orasan (Etheria's powerful weapon) to stop Avria's centuries-old plan to dominate the realm.[77]

Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006)

This chapter depicts the continuing story of the four _Sang'gres_, Pirena, Amihan, Alena (now Queen of Sapiro) and Danaya (now Queen of Lireo) along with King Ybrahim of Sapiro, in the enchanted world of Encantadia, as they face the repercussions of their previous journey through Encantadia's history. The Four Herans of the Etherian Kingdom are plotting revenge against the Sang'gre's who, for the 2nd time took down their beloved Kingdom.[78]

Encantadia (2016)

After the Great Encantadian War that defeated Etheria, the three kingdoms were able to live in peace for a thousand years, but the day came when the Hathors (inhabitants of Hathoria), led by King Arvak, gave in to their greed and started the Lirean war to claim the other gems, that they may gain power and rule over the whole continent. Later, King Arvak was killed by a Sapirian warrior named Asval but before he died, prince Raquim of Sapiro claimed the Gemstones of Water, Earth and Fire from him and handed them to the Queen of Lireo for safekeeping. The four gems have not been separated since. Two Thousand years have passed and the story unfolds in Lireo, where Queen Mine-a chose her successor from her daughters Pirena, Amihan, Alena and Danaya because they feel imminent danger lurking, and as the gods called her to Devas (the world of the dead), she has to leave the kingdom of Lireo in good and capable hands. She put her daughters to the test to see their capabilities and know who is best fit to be the next queen. Mine-a chose and crowned Amihan, which to Pirena's dismay, led to her rebellion and the onset of the so-called War of the four Gems. The chain of events that transpired made way for the separation of the gemstones. Pirena, after having stolen the gemstone of fire, sided with the Hathors and gave them back the power they've lost.Pirena then fools her sisters and ruled over Lireo, she bore a daughter named Mira while Amihan bore Lira who then took refuge in the mortal world. There were numerous times Ether helped Hathoria in defeating Lireo, but failed to succeed at. The last fight of Hathoria and Lireo resulted to the death of Queen Amihan, and Pirena's reunion with her other sisters. Danaya succeeded Amihan to the throne of Lireo, Ybrahim took oath as King of Sapiro while Pirena rebuilt Hathoria and became queen. The five gems were merged into one, but new threat had come to their land.[79]

Spin-off film

Mulawin: The Movie (2005)

With the power of Mulawin's "Tree of Life" dwindling down and the Mulawin race in peril, the Diwatas of Encantadia and the _Tres Aves_ (a legendary trio of heroes with special abilities) rushed to aid the Mulawin. The Mulawins and the Lireo soldiers led by Ybarro/Ybrahim faces the Ravenas until they defeated them. They return to Avila after a victory and a deadly battle. Aguiluz is seen lying in a royal bed in Lireo with Queen Amihan putting the _"gintong binhi"_ to his mouth that can get his life back.[80]
