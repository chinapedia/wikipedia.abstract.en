This article describes the grammar of the Old Irish language.


Grammatical processes

Initial mutations

In the system of initial consonant mutations, the initial consonant of a word is modified in one or another way, depending on the nature of the preceding word: _la tech_ "towards a house" vs. _fo thech_ "under a house", _i tech_ "into a house", with the alternation in the initial consonant of _tech_ "house" triggered by the preceding preposition.

There are three types of mutation:

-   Lenition, a weakening of the initial consonant. This generally turns plosives into fricatives, among other effects.
-   Nasalisation, originally a prepending of a nasal consonant to the word, which caused further changes.
-   Aspiration and gemination, causing either gemination of the initial consonant, or the insertion of .

The mutations became an important part of the grammar and remain, with little change, in Modern Irish (see Irish initial mutations). They were often crucial in distinguishing various grammatical forms, which would be homophones if not for the mutations. For example, in the case of the possessive determiner _a_, only the initial mutation of the following word distinguishes the meanings "his", "her", and "their":

  No change                             Lenition                                     Nasalization                            Aspiration/gemination
  ------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----------------------
  _ech_ "horse"                         _a ech_ "his horse"                          _a n-ech_ "their horse"                 _a ech_ "her horse"
  _bo_ "cow"                            _a bo_ "his cow"                             _a m-bo_ "their cow"                    _a bo_ "her cow"
  _tech_ "house"                        _a thech_ "his house"                        _a tech_ "their house"                  _a tech_ "her house"
  _fer becc_ "small man" (nominative)   _dá fer becc_ "two small men" (nominative)   _fer m-becc_ "small man" (accusative)

  : Meanings distinguished by initial mutations

Another grammatical feature signalled by mutations is relative clause attachment, in which lenition indicates the beginning of a relative clause, often in place of any explicit relative pronoun (although in some cases the verbal ending also changes to a special relative form).

In general, there is no way to predict from the form of a given word the type of mutation that it will trigger. (Note that the spelling of the initial consonant does not always change to indicate mutation in Old Irish although it generally does starting in Middle Irish).

Initial mutations were originally sandhi effects, and depended on the shape of the original final syllable in Primitive Irish. It was grammaticalised by the loss of final syllables in the transition from Primitive Irish to Old Irish. In Old Irish, the process was already grammatical to a large degree, and was limited to applying across words within a single syntactic phrase (e.g. between a noun and a modifying adjective, or between a preposition and the rest of the prepositional phrase). Initial mutations did not apply across phrase boundaries generally, but there are some instances where this does occur in the earliest Old Irish attestations.

Lenition

Lenition is the weakening of a consonant according to a particular pattern. It applied to consonants appearing between vowels in Primitive Irish. When a preceding word ended in a vowel, the first consonant of the following word was lenited.

Lenition was not indicated in the spelling except in the case of initial voiceless stops, which were written _ph th ch_ when lenited. In later Old Irish, initial _f s_ come to be written _ḟ ṡ_ when lenited, with a dot (a so-called _punctum delens_) above the letter.

Lenition occurs after:

-   Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:
    -   Nominative and vocative singular of all feminines
    -   Dative singular of all genders
    -   Nominative, vocative, accusative and genitive dual of all masculines and feminines
    -   Nominative, vocative and accusative plural of all neuters (but inconsistently after _-a_)
-   Certain prepositions
-   Certain conjunctions
-   Certain infixed pronouns

Nasalisation

Nasalisation, also known as eclipsis in Modern Irish grammar, is the prepending of a nasal consonant to the word. It was caused by a preceding word ending in a nasal consonant. Due to later changes involving clusters of nasals and other consonants, in particular the coalescing of nasal-stop clusters to voiceless plosives (such as > ), nasalisation may also manifest itself as voicing in Old Irish.

Nasalisation was not indicated in the spelling except for initial voiced stops and vowels, where _n-_ is prefixed (_m-_ before _b_).

Nasalisation occurs after:

-   Certain case forms within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive. These include, at least:
    -   Nominative, vocative and accusative singular and dual of all neuters
    -   Accusative singular of all masculines and feminines
    -   Genitive plural of all genders
-   Certain prepositions
-   Certain conjunctions
-   Certain infixed pronouns

Aspiration and gemination

Originally two different effects, aspiration and gemination came to be triggered in the same environments and thus can be treated as one type of mutation.

Aspiration involved prepending an additional to a vowel-initial word. It was primarily caused by syllables formerly ending in , which lenited to between vowels. In gemination, an initial consonant was geminated by a preceding word originally ending in , or after a vowel. By analogy, words originally ending in and came to aspiration before vowel-initial words as well.

Gemination was only occasionally indicated, and as geminated consonants were in the process of reducing to single consonants in Old Irish times, the mutation effect itself was waning. Aspiration was not indicated at all.

Aspiration/gemination occurs after:

-   Within a noun phrase, either of the noun or a preceding article or possessive, all forms that end in a vowel but do not trigger lenition or nasalisation. This includes, at least:
    -   Genitive singular of all feminines
    -   Vocative and accusative plural of all genders
-   Certain prepositions
-   _ní_ and _ba_

Palatalisation

Palatalisation as such is phonological, but it also has a grammatical aspect to it. Certain case forms of nouns automatically trigger palatalisation of the final consonant of a word, as do forms of verbs. Consequently, the quality of the final consonant can often vary between different forms of the same word.

Palatalisation also occurs when a syllable that originally contained a front vowel undergoes syncope. Since Old Irish generalised the palatal or nonpalatal quality across an entire consonant cluster, when the front vowel was lost, the palatalisation of the preceding consonants "extended" to the entire resulting consonant cluster, consisting of both the consonants before the syncopated vowel and the consonants after it. This could lead to alternations between palatalisation in the syncopated forms and nonpalatalisation in the unsyncopated forms of a word. For example, the noun _dorus_ "door" originally had a front vowel _e_ in the second syllable (Proto-Celtic _*dworestu_), but this did not cause palatalisation due to the u-affection of the final vowel. However, when the noun was syncopated in certain case forms, the palatalisation reappeared and spread also to the final _s_, seen in the genitive singular _doirseo_ and dative plural _doirsib_ .

Palatalisation can sometimes affect the immediately preceding vowel:

-   _ía_ → _é_.
-   _áe_, _óe_ → _aí_, _oí_. This is purely an orthographical distinction, and is not adhered to strongly in the manuscripts. It's used more often in normalised spellings for clarity.

Vowel affection

Vowel affection is the changing of the height of a vowel to more closely match the height of the vowel in a following syllable. It is similar to Germanic umlaut, but more pervasive. It was originally a relatively automatic process, but because the final vowels were later mostly lost in the transition to Old Irish, the process became unpredictable and grammaticalised. Three different kinds of vowel affection existed in Old Irish, _lowering_, _raising_ and _u-insertion_.

LOWERING was caused by a (former) low vowel _a_ or _o_ in the following syllable, and affected the underlying short vowels _i_ and _u_, changing them to _e_ and _o_ respectively. It occurred regardless of the preceding consonants, and was thus rather common.

RAISING was the reverse development: when followed by a (former) high vowel, short _i_ or _u_, in the following syllable, the vowels _e_ and _o_ were changed to _i_ and _u_. It did not occur in all cases, as it was limited by the intervening consonants. It occurred only when at most one consonant stood between the syllables, and the consonant had to be voiced (this included sonorants). Thus, while the noun _cenn_ was raised to _cinn_ in the genitive singular form (along with palatalisation), _ech_ was not raised and retained its original vowel in its genitive singular form _eich_ .

The underlying vowel of a word remained when the vowel _e_ formerly followed. For example, in masculine o-stems, the vocative singular form had _e_ in the ending, but the other forms had other vowels which caused either raising or lowering. In neuter o-stems, _all_ forms had raising or lowering endings, none originally contained _e_. This can make it difficult to ascertain what the original underlying vowel was.

U-INSERTION was a third effect, caused by a (formerly) following _u_. It involved inserting the vowel _u_ (or _o_, as an orthographic variant) after an existing vowel, and occurred with the long vowel _é_ and the short vowels _a_, _e_ and _i_. The results were as follows:

-   _a_ → _au_.
-   _e_ → _iu_ if raising can take place, _eu_/_eo_ otherwise.
-   _i_ → _iu_.
-   _é_ → _éu_/_éo_, sometimes also _íu_.

U-insertion did not necessarily occur in all cases where it might be expected, in particular when the _u_ that might cause the effect was still present. For example, the accusative plural of _ech_ may be _euchu_/_eochu_, but _echu_ is also found, lacking u-insertion. For _fer_, the accusative plural is _firu_, never _*fiuru_.


Nouns

Old Irish has 3 genders: masculine, feminine and neuter; 3 numbers: singular, dual and plural; and 5 cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive and dative. The dual is predominantly preceded by the cardinal number "two". The full range of forms is only evident in the noun phrase, where the article causes noun initial mutation, and where the initials of following adjectives are mutated according to the underlying case ending, though at times such mutations were not written. In the following, L shows lenition, N shows nasalisation, and H shows aspiration/gemination. In addition, there was some syncretism in forms regardless of mutations: certain forms were always identical. These were:

-   Nominative/vocative/accusative of all neuter nouns in all numbers.
-   Nominative/vocative/accusative dual of all nouns.
-   Vocative/accusative plural of all nouns.
-   Dative dual/plural of all nouns.

o-stems

The o-stems could be masculine or neuter, and were the most widespread kind of noun, thus this class is well attested. They descend from the Proto-Indo-European thematic inflection.

In the neuter variant, the genitive and dative forms were the same as those of the masculine variant, while the nominative, vocative and accusative differed.

: Neuter o-stems

io-stems

The io-stems were originally simply o-stems with a before the endings. Later sound changes deleted this consonant, but its presence caused some of the case endings to be preserved where they were deleted in the plain o-stem inflection. The final consonant is either always palatalised, or never.

The iā-stems were originally a variant of the ā-stems, but were preceded by a which caused changes similar to those in the io-stem inflection. Again, the final consonant could be always palatalised, or never.

: Feminine iā-stems

ī-stems

The ī-stems were always feminine, and were a variant of the iā-stem inflection in which a few case forms lacked an overt ending. In these forms, the final consonant was always palatalised. The forms with an ending could be either palatalised or not, depending on the noun. The ī-stem inflection continues the so-called _devī_- or _ī/yā_-inflection of Proto-Indo-European.

There were two sub-variants. The original, "long" variant had endings in the accusative and optionally in the dative singular, while the newer "short" variant had no ending and only palatalisation in these forms, by analogy with the ā-stems.

: Feminine ī-stems

i-stems

The i-stems could have any gender. The masculine and feminine variants were identical except for one detail: the nominative singular of feminine i-stems caused lenition, while it did not for masculine i-stems. The plural forms could either be always palatalised, or never (depending on the noun), while in the singular and dual, the palatalisation depended on the ending.

u-stems

The u-stems could be masculine or neuter. Feminine u-stem nouns had originally existed, but they had all been converted into ā-stems by the time Old Irish was written. None of the endings triggered palatalisation. However, palatalisation did occur when a syllable (formerly) containing a front vowel was contracted.

Velar stems

The velar stems, also called "guttural stems", belonged to the larger class of "consonant stems", which mostly shared the same endings. They were masculine or feminine, and had a stem ending in a velar consonant, _ch_, _g_ () or _c_ . The final consonant itself was lost in the nominative and vocative singular. Word-final palatalised _-ich_ was voiced to _-ig_, partially merging the two types.

Dental stems

The dental stems were also consonant stems, and had a stem ending in a dental consonant, _th_, _d_ () or _t_ (). The final consonant itself was lost in the nominative and vocative singular. Unstressed word-final _-th_ was generally converted to _-d_ early on, so that the two types became indistinguishable in most forms.

: Masculine/feminine r-stems

s-stems

The s-stems were all neuter, with one exceptional "ns-stem", which was masculine. The final consonant had disappeared everywhere, leaving the name a bit of a misnomer. The class is called "s-stem" because of its relationship to nouns of this class in other Indo-European languages.

: Masculine s-stems

n-stems

The n-stems were masculine, feminine or neuter, though the neuters behaved differently from the masculines and feminines. There were several subclasses among the masculine and feminine n-stems:

-   Lenited final _n_
    -   Final vowel in nominative singular
    -   No final vowel in nominative singular
-   Unlenited _n(n)_

The nouns with lenited final _n_ included agent nouns ending in _-am_/_-em_, among other nouns. The nominative singular could be either endingless or end in _-u_ or _-e_; those with a vowel had three possible dative singular forms.

Irregular nouns


Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, and number, and have positive, comparative, and superlative forms. Demonstrative adjectives have proximal, medial, and distal forms.


Verbs

Verbs stand initially in the sentence (preceded only by some particles, forming a "verbal complex", and very few adverbs). The verb can be either suffixed for tense, person, mood and aspect (often portmanteau suffixes), or these can be shown by vowel changes in the stem (e.g. present "says", past "said", future "will say"). Before this core "verb phrase" are placed various other preverbal clitic particles, e.g. negative _ni-/ní-_, perfective _ro-_ or one or more preverbal particles that add meaning of the verb stem (compare , , , , etc. in Latin verbs). Personal pronouns as direct objects are infixed between the preverb and the verbal stem. In an overall sense, the verb structure is agglutinative. A single verb can stand as an entire sentence in Old Irish, in which case emphatic particles such as and are affixed to the end of the verb.

Verbs are conjugated in present, imperfect, past, future and preterite tenses; indicative, subjunctive, conditional and imperative moods; and active and passive voices. The only verbal form lacking in Old Irish is the infinitive, this covered, as in the modern Gaelic languages, by the verbal noun. Old Irish inherits a large amount of Indo-European verbal morphology, including:

-   extensive ablaut variations, made significantly more complicated by vowel affection and syncope
-   reduplication
-   primary and secondary endings
-   thematic and athematic endings
-   deponent verbs
-   multiple ways of forming each of the various tenses and moods, and no general cross-tense/mood conjugational classes, i.e. in general a series of principal parts must be memorised for each verb, much as in Latin or Ancient Greek.
-   _n_-infix verbs

Independent and dependent forms

Most verbs have, in addition to the tenses, voices, and moods named above, two sets of forms: an independent and a dependent conjugation. The independent conjugation occurs when the verb occurs absolutely sentence-initial with no preverbs, while the dependent conjugation occurs when the verb is preceded by one or more preverbs. The formation of the independent and dependent conjugations depends on whether a verb is SIMPLE or COMPLEX. A complex verb is a verb that is always combined with a preverb, while all other verbs are simple verbs. The dependent conjugation of a simple verb is essentially the same as the independent conjugation of a complex verb, though different terminology is used:

                 Independent               Dependent
  -------------- ------------------------- -----------------------
  Simple verb    Absolute inflection       Conjunct inflection
  Complex verb   Deuterotonic inflection   Prototonic inflection

The absolute and conjunct inflections are distinguished primarily by the endings, e.g. _biru_ "I carry", _berid_ "he carries" vs. _ní-biur_ "I do not carry", _ní-beir_ "he does not carry" (with negative prefix _ní-_). The difference between absolute and conjunct endings is thought to reflect an additional particle _*-es_ added to the absolute verbal form. Final _-i_ in the conjunct forms was apparently lost early on (cf. a similar change in Latin).

The difference between deuterotonic and prototonic inflections involves a stress shift. The stress is always placed on the second preverb from the beginning, due to the Celtic version of Wackernagel's law. Consequently, when a preverb is attached to a verb that already has one, the stress shifts one preverb to the left. This stress shift is accompanied by (sometimes radical) changes in the verbal stem and all but the first preverbal particle(s), which merge with the stem, e.g. _do⋅berat_ "they bring/give", _as⋅berat_ "they say" vs. _ní-taibret_ "they do not bring/give", _ní-epret_ "they do not say". In the _s_-subjunctive, the allomorphy is even more extreme, especially in the third-person singular: indicative _as⋅boind_ "he refuses" vs. _ní⋅opaind_ "he does not refuse", subjunctive _as⋅bó_ "he may refuse" vs. _ní⋅op_ "he may not refuse". In many cases, from a synchronic perspective, the changes appear utterly random (_do⋅rósc(a)i_ "he surpasses" vs. _ní-derscaigi_ "he does not surpass") or even unrecognisable (_imm⋅soí_ "he turns around" vs. _ní-impaí_ "he does not turn around"). However, the forms usually result from a series of regular sound changes.[1]

Classification

Two main classifications of Old Irish verbs exist, both based on the formation of the present indicative: the Thurneysen classification and the McCone classification. Both systems classify verbs broadly between weak and strong, the distinction being that weak verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a vowel, while strong verbs have a 3rd person singular conjunct form ending in a consonant. This distinction, like the strong-weak distinction found in the Germanic languages, reflects the PIE split between primary and secondary verbs. McCone's system additionally has a separate class for so-called "hiatus" verbs, in which the root itself ends in a vowel rather than the verb having a vocalic suffix, as in the "true" weak verbs. Thurneysen groups these with the weak verbs.

Old Irish verbs have, however, up to five principal parts, so that for the complete conjugation of a verb all five inflectional stems must be known. These are:

-   Present stem: forms the present and imperfect indicative, and the imperative.
-   Subjunctive stem: forms the present and past subjunctive
-   Future stem: forms the future
-   Preterite active stem: forms the active preterite forms
-   Preterite passive stem: forms the passive preterite forms

Subjunctive stem types

The subjunctive comes in two variants, both continuing the PIE _s_-aorist subjunctive.

  Type              Verb types
  ----------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _a_-subjunctive   Weak and hiatus verbs, strong verbs with a root ending in any other consonant
  _s_-subjunctive   Strong verbs with a root ending in a dental or velar consonant or in _-nn_

In the _s_-subjunctive, the _s_ is attached directly to the root. The endings are partly athematic, especially the 3rd singular, with original suffix _*-s-t_ that leads to truncation of the root: cf. _as·boind_ "he refuses" < , prototonic _·op(a)ind_ < ; subj. _as·bó_ < , prototonic _·op_ < ; 2 sg. subj. _as·bóis_ < , prototonic _·obbais_ < with thematic _*-s-es_.[2]

Future stem types

The future comes in four variants.

  _s_-future   Verbs that have an _s_-subjunctive                                                                                      Formed like _s_-subjunctive, sometimes with additional reduplication. Same endings as _s_-subjunctive, except 1st sg. absolute.
  _a_-future   H1 hiatus verbs, S1 and S2 strong verbs with root ending in _b_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _r_, a few other weak or hiatus verbs   Same endings as _a_-subjunctive. Either reduplicated or with _é_ in the root.
  _i_-future   H2 and S3 hiatus verbs with root-final _i_                                                                              Same endings as W2 present, except 2nd sg. Either reduplicated or with _íu_ in the root.

Preterite active stem types

The preterite active comes in four variants:

  Type                     Verb types                                                                                              Remarks
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  _s_-preterite            All weak and hiatus verbs, and _gaibid_ "take", _ibid_ "drink                                           Reduplication in most hiatus verbs.
  _t_-preterite            All strong verbs with root ending in _l_ or _r_, some ending in _g_, and _em-_ "take", _sem-_ "pour".
  Reduplicated preterite   Some strong verbs
  Long vowel preterite     Some strong verbs                                                                                       Originally also reduplicated, but the reduplication was lost and various other changes resulted.

Preterite passive stem types

The preterite passive occurs only in one type, with a _t_-suffix, originally to the zero-grade root. It originates in the PIE verbal adjective in _*-tós_.

Example

The following is an example of a strong present-tense verb (class B I), showing the absolute, conjunct deuterotonic and conjunct prototonic forms.

Prepositions

Prepositions inflect for person and number, and different prepositions govern different cases, sometimes depending on the semantics intended.


Syntax

Old Irish has VSO word order shared by most Insular Celtic languages. Other orders are possible, especially under Bergin's Law. Verbs are all fully conjugated and have most forms typical of Indo-European languages. Personal pronouns, when used as direct objects, are prefixed to the verb with which they are associated (after other prefixes, and therefore are often referred to as infixes). Prepositions have the same status as the Latin prepositions, including the property of being verb prefixes.
