The waveguide D BAND is the range of radio frequencies from 110 GHz to 170 GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum,[1][2] corresponding to the recommended frequency band of operation of the WR6 and WR7 waveguides.[3] These frequencies are equivalent to wave lengths between 2.7 mm and 1.8 mm. The D band is in the EHF range of the radio spectrum.
