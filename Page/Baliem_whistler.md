The BALIEM WHISTLER or BALIM WHISTLER (_Pachycephala balim_) is a species of bird of the whistler family Pachycephalidae that is endemic to New Guinea.[1]


Taxonomy and systematics

The Baliem whistler was formerly considered as a subspecies of the Australian golden whistler and also of the mangrove golden and the yellow-throated whistler. It has since been re-classified as a separate species by the IOC in 2016.[2] Many other authorities do not yet recognize this split and re-classification.[3]


Distribution

The Baliem whistler is found in the Snow Mountains of Papua Province in Indonesia.
