Research

Greenfield is known for her research relating to cultural psychology and change, inspired by 35 years of work in Chiapas, Mexico. She is interested in how culture influences human development and shapes the way individuals think. Greenfield was awarded the 2005 R. L. Shep Award for best book of the year for _Weaving Generations Together: Evolving Creativity in the Maya of Chiapas_.[9] This work aimed to understand patterns of cultural inheritance across generations. More recently, her project titled Bridging Cultures looks at the cross cultural aspects of education and focusing primarily on Latino immigrants.

Greenfield's research, in collaboration with Joshua Smith, explored the structure of communication in early language development through diary reports and formal observations of two boys' usage of one-word verbal communication.[10][11]

Another line of research addressed the question of whether cross-cultural differences undermine the validity of ability tests applied outside of their culture of origin. In her publication, _You can't take it with you: Why ability assessments don't cross cultures_,[12] Greenfield discussed how to detect and adjust for cultural misunderstandings in assessments of intellectual ability.

Her book _Mind and Media_ examined the effects of television, video games and computers on child development. In this volume, she debated how social media and television might impact a child's psychological understanding of their surroundings, which could motivate them to be more or less socially active.[13]

Her research has been funded by many organizations including the National Science Foundation, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Spencer Foundation, the Markle Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, the Russell Sage Foundation, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), the Foundation for Psychocultural Research, and NATO.


Personal life

Greenfield married physician Sheldon Greenfield in 1965, with whom she had two children, a daughter named Lauren, born in 1966, and a son named Matthew, born in 1968.
