The coffeehouse was originally a factory for chocolates and quince candy. Outside the bar is a sculpture of Carlos Gardel,[1][2] and a fountain where tourists leave love locks. An open tango show is performed from Monday to Saturday at 1 pm.[3][4] In 2009 the Departmental Board of Montevideo recognized the contribution of the Bar Facal to the national culture and the national gastronomy with a plaque that is in the wall. There is also a plaque of the Mayor's office in Medellín.

In 2010 a light-emitting diode screen was installed, the first curved screen in the country.[5]
