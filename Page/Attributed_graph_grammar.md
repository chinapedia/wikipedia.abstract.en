In computer science, an ATTRIBUTED GRAPH GRAMMAR is a class of graph grammar that associates vertices with a set of attributes and rewrites with functions on attributes. In the algebraic approach to graph grammars, they are usually formulated using the double-pushout approach or the single-pushout approach.


Implementation

AGG, a rule-based visual language that directly expresses attributed graph grammars using the single-pushout approach has been developed at TU Berlin for many years.[1]
