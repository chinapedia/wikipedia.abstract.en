AMBER is fossilized tree resin, which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.[1] Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.[2] Amber is used in jewelry. It has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine.

There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions.[3] Amber occurring in coal seams is also called RESINITE, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.[4]


Etymology

The English word _amber_ derives from Arabic [5] (cognate with Middle Persian _ambar_[6]) via Middle Latin _ambar_ and Middle French _ambre_. The word was adopted in Middle English in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as _ambergris_ (_ambre gris_ or "grey amber"), a solid waxy substance derived from the sperm whale. In the Romance languages, the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber (_ambre jaune_), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.[7]

The two substances ("yellow amber" and "grey amber") conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is too dense to float, though less dense than stone.[8]

The classical names for amber, Latin _electrum_ and Ancient Greek (_ēlektron_), are connected to a term ἠλέκτωρ (_ēlektōr_) meaning "beaming Sun".[9][10] According to myth, when Phaëton son of Helios (the Sun) was killed, his mourning sisters became poplar trees, and their tears became _elektron_, amber.[11] The word _elektron_ gave rise to the words _electric, electricity_, and their relatives because of amber's ability to bear a static electricity charge.[12]


History

Theophrastus discussed amber in the 4th century BC, as did Pytheas (c. 330 BC), whose work "On the Ocean" is lost, but was referenced by Pliny the Elder (23 to 79 AD), according to whose _The Natural History_ (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name _Germania_):[13]

Amber_Fisher.jpg Earlier[14] Pliny says that Pytheas refers to a large island - three days' sail from the Scythian coast and called Balcia by Xenophon of Lampsacus (author of a fanciful travel book in Greek) - as _Basilia_ - a name generally equated with _Abalus_. Given the presence of amber, the island could have been Heligoland, Zealand, the shores of Bay of Gdansk, the Sambia Peninsula or the Curonian Lagoon, which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe. It is assumed that there were well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the "Amber Road"). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans exported amber to Pannonia, from where the Veneti distributed it onwards.

The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy used to work amber; the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide (Museo Archeologico Nazionale della Siritide) at Policoro in the province of Matera (Basilicata) displays important surviving examples. Amber used in antiquity as at Mycenae and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of Sicily.

Gouttes-drops-resine-2.jpg, the source of amber]] Pliny also cites the opinion of Nicias ( 470–413 BC), according to whom amber Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of _succinum_ (_sūcinum_, from _sucus_ "juice").[15] In Book 37, section XI of _Natural History_, Pliny wrote:

He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that "in Syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of _harpax_ [from ἁρπάζω, "to drag"] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues".

Pliny says that the German name of amber was _glæsum_, "for which reason the Romans, when Germanicus Caesar commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia". This is confirmed by the recorded Old High German word _glas_ and by the Old English word _glær_ for "amber" (compare _glass_). In Middle Low German, amber was known as _berne-, barn-, börnstēn_ (with etymological roots related to "burn" and to "stone"[16]). The Low German term became dominant also in High German by the 18th century, thus modern German _Bernstein_ besides Dutch _barnsteen_.

In the Baltic languages, the Lithuanian term for amber is _gintaras_ and the Latvian _dzintars_. These words, and the Slavic _jantar_[17] and Hungarian _gyanta_ ('resin'), are thought to originate from Phoenician _jainitar_ ("sea-resin").

Early in the nineteenth century, the first reports of amber found in North America came from discoveries in New Jersey along Crosswicks Creek near Trenton, at Camden, and near Woodbury.[18]


Composition and formation

Amber is heterogeneous in composition, but consists of several resinous bodies more or less soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with an insoluble bituminous substance. Amber is a macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene.[19] These labdanes are diterpenes (C₂₀H₃₂) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.

Heated above , amber decomposes, yielding an OIL OF AMBER, and leaves a black residue which is known as "amber colophony", or "amber pitch"; when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms "amber varnish" or "amber lac".

Formation

Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal. Sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber.[20]

For this to happen, the resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes. Exposure to sunlight, rain, microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi), and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin. For the resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them.[21]

Botanical origin

Bernstein_Bitterfeld,_Gedanit,_Bruchstücke_5658.jpg Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the _Agathis_ group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus _Hymenaea_,[22] while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from Sciadopityaceae family plants that used to live in north Europe.[23]

Physical attributes

Most amber has a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5 on the Mohs scale, a refractive index of 1.5–1.6, a specific gravity between 1.06 and 1.10, and a melting point of 250–300°C.[24]

Inclusions

Baltic-amber-fossils-inclusions.jpg The abnormal development of resin in living trees (_succinosis_) can result in the formation of amber.[25] Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped onto the ground, so the material may be useless except for varnish-making. Such impure amber is called _firniss_.

Such inclusion of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color. Pyrites may give a bluish color. _Bony amber_ owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin. However, so-called _black amber_ is really only a kind of jet.

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution X-rays.[26]


Extraction and processing

Distribution and mining

Baltic-amber-deposit-Yantarny.jpg amber mine "Primorskoje" in Jantarny, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]]

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger. Historically, the Samland coast west of Königsberg in Prussia was the world's leading source of amber. The first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the 12th century.[27] About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which became the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia in 1946.[28]

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of _blue earth_ have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.

Caribbean amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through bell pitting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.[29]

Treatment

The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil. The final luster is given by friction with flannel.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due.

Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of "ambroid" or "pressed amber". The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light.

Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum, as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called "true amber".


Appearance

Colours_of_Baltic_Amber.jpg

Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color "amber", amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as "cherry amber"), green amber, and even blue amber, which is rare and highly sought after.[30]

Yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees, and despite the name it can be translucent, yellow, orange, or brown colored. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah "straw" plus rubay "attract, snatch", referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for electricity, كهرباء _kahrabā'_), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry. Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as "bony amber".[31]

Ambre_bleu_dominicain_21207.jpg from Dominican Republic]] Although all Dominican amber is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.[32]

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.


Classification

Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. Terpenoids, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of isoprene (C₅H₈) units.[33] Phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.[34] The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.[35] The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.[36][37] There is also a separate classification of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.

Class I

This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids.[38] It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), while Ic uses _enantio_ labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, _enantio_ biformenes).[39]

Ia

Class Ia includes _Succinite_ (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and _Glessite_.[40] They have a communic acid base, and they also include much succinic acid.[41]

Baltic amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or _bony_ varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name _succinite_. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via IR spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.[42]

Ib

Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack succinic acid.[43]

Ic

This class is mainly based on _enantio_-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids.[44] Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.[45]

Dominican amber differentiates itself from Baltic amber by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.[46] Resin from the extinct species _Hymenaea protera_ is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not "succinite" but "retinite".[47]

Class II

These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as cadinene.[48]

Class III

These ambers are polystyrenes.[49]

Class IV

Class IV is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedrene-based sesquiterpenoids.[50]

Class V

Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and _n_-alkyl compounds. Their main variety is _Highgate copalite_.[51]


Geological record

HALAMB48.JPG The oldest amber recovered dates to the Upper Carboniferous period ().[52][53] Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers – it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants; however, there are no flowering plant fossils known from before the Cretaceous, and they were not common until the Late Cretaceous. Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the Early Cretaceous, ,[54] when it is found in association with insects. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Levant, from Lebanon and Jordan. This amber, roughly 125–135 million years old, is considered of high scientific value, providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled ecosystems.[55]

In Lebanon, more than 450 outcrops of Lower Cretaceous amber were discovered by Dany Azar,[56] a Lebanese paleontologist and entomologist. Among these outcrops, 20 have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods. Even older, Jurassic amber has been found recently in Lebanon as well. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan including the oldest zorapterans, clerid beetles, umenocoleid roaches, and achiliid planthoppers.[57]

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber) is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand, known as _blue earth_, occurring in the Lower Oligocene strata of Sambia in Prussia (in historical sources also referred to as _Glaesaria_). After 1945, this territory around Königsberg was turned into Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, where amber is now systematically mined.[58]

It appears, however, to have been partly derived from older Eocene deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as glacial drift. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern Asia and the southern part of North America. Heinrich Göppert named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests _Pinites succiniter_, but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called _Pinus succinifera_. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.

Paleontological significance

Amber is a unique preservational mode, preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms;[59] the chemical composition of the resin, however, is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.[60]

Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted. Insects, spiders and even their webs, annelids, frogs,[61] crustaceans, bacteria and amoebae,[62] marine microfossils,[63] wood, flowers and fruit, hair, feathers[64] and other small organisms have been recovered in Cretaceous ambers (deposited c. ).[65] The oldest amber to bear fossils (mites) is from the Carnian (Triassic, ) of north-eastern Italy.[66]

The preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in Michael Crichton's 1990 novel _Jurassic Park_ and the 1993 movie adaptation by Steven Spielberg.[67] In the story, scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of dinosaurs from prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber, from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs. Scientifically this is as yet impossible, since no amber with fossilized mosquitoes has ever yielded preserved blood.[68] Amber is, however, conducive to preserving DNA, since it dehydrates and thus stabilizes organisms trapped inside. One projection in 1999 estimated that DNA trapped in amber could last up to 100 million years, far beyond most estimates of around 1 million years in the most ideal conditions,[69] although a later 2013 study was unable to extract DNA from insects trapped in much more recent Holocene copal.[70]


Use

Altamira_Ambre_MHNT.PRE.2012.0.615.jpg amber from Altamira in the Muséum de Toulouse]] Amber has been used since prehistory (Solutrean) in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments, and also in folk medicine.

Jewelry

Halssnoer_van_barnstenen_kralen.png Amber has been used as jewelry since the Stone Age, from 13,000 years ago.[71] Amber ornaments have been found in Mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across Europe.[72] To this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces.[73][74] Amber's place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value; Palanga Amber Museum is dedicated to the fossilized resin.

Historic medicinal uses

Amber has long been used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties.[75] Amber and extracts were used from the time of Hippocrates in ancient Greece for a wide variety of treatments through the Middle Ages and up until the early twentieth century. Traditional Chinese medicine uses amber to "tranquilize the mind", and there is limited evidence that it has a sedative effect in mice.[76]

With children

Amber necklaces are a traditional European remedy for colic or teething pain due to the purported analgesic properties of succinic acid, although there is no evidence that this is an effective remedy or delivery method.[77][78][79] The American Academy of Pediatrics and the FDA have warned strongly against their use, as they present both a choking and a strangulation hazard.[80][81]

Scent of amber and amber perfumery

In ancient China, it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, oil of amber is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with nitric acid to create "artificial musk" – a resin with a peculiar musky odor.[82] Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic "pinewood" fragrance, modern products, such as perfume, do not normally use actual amber due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as "amber" are often created and patented[83][84] to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil.[85]

The modern name for amber is thought to come from the Arabic word, ambar, meaning ambergris.[86][87] Ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or the plant resin labdanum, but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.[88] The term "amber" is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

"Amber" perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, benzoin resin, copal (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, Dammara resin and/or synthetic materials.[89]
