Elections to Liverpool Town Council were held on Saturday 26 December 1835.

This was the first election to Liverpool Town Council. It was conducted under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. As this was the first election to the Council, all three seats for each of the sixteen wards were up for election. The candidate in each ward with the highest number of votes was elected for three years, the candidate with the second highest number of votes was elected for two years and the candidate with the third highest number of votes was elected for one year. All of the sixteen wards were contested.

The terms Whig and Reformer are used interchangeably. The local press, at the time, referred exclusively to Reformers.

After the election of Councillors on 26 December 1835 and the Aldermanic election in January 1836, the composition of the council was:

  Party   Councillors    Aldermen   Total
  ------- -------------- ---------- -------
          Reformers      44         15

          Conservative   4          1

By-elections

No. 12, Lime Street, 7th January 1836

Caused by the disqualification of Joseph Langton (Reformers, Lime Street, elected 26 December 1835) because he did not sign the councillors' declaration. Mr. Langton was the manager of the Bank of Liverpool and the directors of the bank did not think him being a town councillor was compatible with his role as manager of the bank. [18] [19]
