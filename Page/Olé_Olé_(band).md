OLÉ OLÉ were a popular Spanish band of the 1980s. The group went through three phases of popularity broadly coinciding with three female vocalists. The group began with singer Vicky Larraz (1982-1985). After Larraz went solo came Marta Sánchez (1986-1991) in years that saw increasing success in Latin America.[1] After Sánchez also went solo came the third singer :es:Sonia Santana (1992-1993).


The beginnings of the group: Vicky Larraz 1982-1985

The story of "OLÉ OLÉ" began in 1982, when the CBS label decided to create a new techno-pop group in the Mecano line. The one in charge of choosing the members was Argentine producer Jorge Álvarez, who also produced the first MECANO records. This is how Luis Carlos Esteban met, who came from the group "TRASTOS", Emilio Estecha, from the group "PLÁSTICO" and Juan Tarodo †. As a singer they chose Vicky Larraz. The Argentine Gustavo Montesano joined shortly after. In his country he had been part of the rock group CRUCIS. The release of "Olé Olé" was with "_No Controles_", the song that Nacho Cano gave to the group. "_No Controles_" was published in February 1983 and became an immediate success and launched the group to popularity. This song was also a success in Italy.

The second single was a song that followed the same techno-pop line, "_Dame_." Gustavo Montesano joined the recording and promotion of the same.

After these two singles of advance his album was published with the same name, «OLÉ OLÉ», produced, like all the following ones, by Jorge Álvarez and with arrangements by Luis Cobos. The songs were composed by Luis Carlos Esteban and Gustavo Montesano.

His next success was the group's version of the song "L'amour est un oiseau rebelle", from the opera "Carmen" by Bizet, "_Conspiración_". An English version, "Conspiracy", was also recorded on this topic, which was published in Europe, which allowed them to make a promotional tour through different countries of the continent. «_Conspiración_» was his first number 1 on the list of The Top 40. The fourth and last single from this album was «_Adrenalina_». They made an extensive tour around the country, making known this work, which was a success and increased its sales.

"Voy a mil", the band's second album, appeared in 1984 and was presented with the single of the same title. It became a new success and in it VICKY LARRAZ demonstrates again his vocal power and great energy in each of his performances. The second single was the "Caminemos" version. Only two singles of this work were extracted. Techno-pop songs like "Un Golpe de Suerte", "SPasos de Mujer" or "Desaparecidos", among others, were hidden for the public. The album was a success, although to a lesser extent than the first.

After finalizing the tour of that year, VICKY LARRAZ and Luis Carlos Esteban decided to leave the group. _Vicky_, a restless artist with great creativity, felt very limited her artistic potential within the group, where she could not compose. In this way he started a solo career. Luis Carlos Esteban became one of the most renowned producers and composers in Spain.


Success in Latin America: Marta Sánchez 1985-1991

The success had accompanied the group from its beginnings, but at that moment they underwent a test of fire: they had to show that they could survive the abandonment of a charismatic singer, VICKY LARRAZ, and one of its main composers, Luis Carlos Esteban. But again fortune was on their side and they had the support of a new record house, Hispavox. The new voice, MARTA SÁNCHEZ, came from the _Cristal Oskuro_ group.

At the end of 1985 they presented the new singer with the release of the single and maxi "_Lilí Marlén_" (version of the German song "Lili Marleen"), which began playing on all radio and television stations, highlighting the symbolic relief _Vicky Larraz_ gave _Marta Sánchez_ when the group went to the TVE program "Tocata", of which _Vicky_ was a presenter at that time. The success returned to them to smile and this caused the launching of its third album in 1986, under the title of "_Bailando sin Salir de Casa_".

This was also called the second single extracted from the album, a track composed by Marcelo Montesano, Gustavo's brother, who would take the place of Luis Carlos Esteban as the group's keyboardist and composer.

The third single was a ballad composed by Gustavo Montesano, "Déjame sola", one of the most appreciated songs on the album. The fourth and last single was again a theme of Marcelo, "Yo No me subo al coche de cualquiera"

The album became a golden record (more than 50,000 copies sold). _Marta Sánchez_ was beginning to be a well-known singer and the group had worked with her new formation.

_Marta_ decided to dye herself of platinum blonde overnight. This scares the company and its partners, but it serves as a new approach to the image and title of the band's fourth album, "Los Hombres Las prefieren Rubias." In the spring of 1987, "Sola (con un extraño) began to sound. », Which became his new number 1 and placed the album in the top 20 of the best selling albums in Spain. They came to surpass the platinum disc (more than 150,000 copies sold). The second single was "Yo soy infiel", a song full of energy that _Marta_ interprets showing that she was a complete artist whose voice improved over time.

At this point, the band had already abandoned its electronic sound from its beginnings. And he had headed towards a much simpler pop.

At the beginning of 1988 the last single of the album was extracted, "_Secretos_", a dance subject that became an instant success: it reached the number 1 of the list of the 40 Main ones in its second week.

But in addition to the songs extracted as singles, other songs on the album were also played on radio and television, such as the Italian version of the song "_La Bámbola_", which achieved notable success, "_Ansiedad_" or "Poema en el avión".

The new album, "_Cuatro hombres para Eva_", became another success and again beat the platinum record. Most of the songs were tailored to Marta's new sexy image. The clearest example was "_Supernatural_" her new single, which became number 1 throughout the summer of 1988. In these months "OLÉ OLÉ" was the group that performed the most concerts throughout the country. At that time, the conquest of Spanish America also began, where the group began to acquire a remarkable popularity.

The other singles that gave life to the album would be "_Vecina_", "_Solo es un viaje_" and "_Búscala_". The version made on this occasion was the bolero "Quizás, quizás, quizás". «Olé Olé» and _Marta Sánchez_ were the most popular group of the moment together with MECANO.

After finishing the tour of this album, Emilio Estecha decided to leave the group to devote himself to computer science.

Its sixth album took the concise title «1990». They went to the United States to record under the orders of Jorge Álvarez, their regular producer and NILE RODGERS, a reputed American producer who had been part of the CHIC group and had produced singers like MADONNA. NILE RODGERS composed and produced for "Olé Olé" two songs, "_Te lo daré Todo_" and "_Soldados del Amor_." This last one became the first single of the new disc and in one of the successes of the summer of 1990, also placing the album in the top 5 of the list of sales in Spain. «1990» was the best-selling album of «Olé Olé», surpassing double platinum (more than 200,000 copies) .

The presentation of the disc on television was carried out in Concha Velasco's program "Viva el espectáculo", where Marta performs the first three singles of the album, "_Soldados del amor_", "_Con solo una mirada_" and, before an emotional one and grateful presenter, «La Chica ye-ye», song that Concha popularized in the 60s. The fourth single, already at the beginning of 1991, was «_Te Lo Daré Todo_». They made a concert tour in the summers of 1990 and 1991, both in Spain and Latin America. In addition, an English version of "1990" was recorded, with 5 songs in that language, although it was not promoted. Also at the end of 1990 «OLÉ OLÉ» was chosen to travel to the Persian Gulf and to act before the Spanish troops highlighted in the Gulf War. _Marta_ performed various songs and encouraged the soldiers, as Marilyn Monroe did in the Korean War in 1954 or Rosa Morena in the Green March in 1975.12 13 The concert was broadcast on TVE at Christmas that year.

At the end of 1991 Marta Sánchez decided to start her solo career.

Again, and after 6 successful albums, «OLÉ OLÉ» was left without a singer.


Third singer: Sonia Santana 1992-1993

The OLÉ OLÉ boys were very clear that they were a group and that if they had survived the abandonment of their first singer, they could overcome the departure of _Marta Sánchez_. So, they called a national contest in the magazine El Gran Musical to choose their third singer. However, neither Marcelo nor Gustavo agreed with the fact that the election was done like this and they proposed the singer Esther Álvarez, with whom they even recorded some models.

The lucky one was SONIA SANTANA, a young Canarian singer. With her they recorded in 1992 In the open, which was his seventh and last album.

"_Al Descubierto_" was a record that was a step towards the maturity of the group without losing the essence of their music. The melodious and sweet voice of _Sonia_ accompanied songs such as "_No mueras posibilidad_" or "_Volaba yo_", which were the first two singles of the album.

As a third single promoted "_Pero También Te Deseo_", an elegant theme and the OLÉ OLÉ style. The fourth single, "_Adiós_", was barely promoted. It was a song composed by Marcelo Montesano about the phenomenon of immigration. The followers of OLÉ OLÉ remained unconditional and accepted _Sonia_ as a future bet for the group.

The group obtained a relative success, reached the gold disc by 50,000 sold copies and realized a tour in Spain and America presenting / displaying the work.

But this time there was no luck. Disconnects between Sonia and the boys led to the dismissal of the singer, leaving the group again without a voice.

This time there was no continuation and this was the end of an outstanding career that spanned more than ten years of Spanish pop. Its components were dedicated since then to various solo projects, tasks linked in most cases to the production and composition of songs for other artists.


Olé Olé 2016: "Duetos sin control" and tour in 2017

In November 2016 OLÉ OLÉ meets again and publishes "Duetos sin control", a record of great hits reviewed and performed by _Vicky Larraz_ along with other artists such as _Paloma San Basilio_, _Modestia Aparte_, _Falete_, _Daniel Diges_ or _Rocko_ . It is published under the Rama Lama Music label and has been produced by Alejandro de Pinedo. The group is led by Vicky Larraz along with Gustavo Montesano, Marcelo Montesano and Emilio Estecha. Also participating are his other two singers, Marta Sánchez and Sonia Santana. Marta Sánchez performs the song "Búscala" 24 with Vicky Larraz and Sonia Santana sings with Vicky "Yo soy infiel". In February 2017 he edits "In control", again his great hits, but this time played only by Vicky Larraz. Only the duet "Búscala" is maintained with Marta Sánchez. This return also means his return to the stages scheduled for 2017 .25 On March 16, 2017 OLÉ OLÉ performs in the Joy Eslava hall in Madrid.26

In June 2017 an EP is published in digital format entitled "_Olé Olé 2.0_" that includes two new revisions of his greatest hits, "_Déjame sola_" and "_Supernatural_", again produced by Alejandro de Pinedo. On June 30, 2017 Olé Olé performs in Madrid at the World Pride 2017.
