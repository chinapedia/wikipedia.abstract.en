Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode a B+, he explained his rating by saying, "The episode is judicious in how it has the other Belchers intersect with Tina’s story, bringing in Bob for some endearingly plausible emotional support just at the moment Tina needs it most. Beyond that, though, the episode has a lot of trust that Tina is strong enough, both in and out of universe, to carry a story all by herself. The fact that Tina can be exactly that is now the most normal thing in the world is the greatest achievement on display tonight, even if it was first accomplished long before this."[1]

The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.18 million people.[2]
