The MELBOURNE HUNT CLUB is an Australian fox hunting club founded in 1852.


History

The club was founded by Mr George Watson in 1852 with hounds brought to Australia from Ireland.[1]

The kennels were originally at Kirk's Bizaar, in Bourke Street, Melbourne, subsequently they moved to St Kilda, Caulfield, Deer Park, Oakleigh, Cranbourne and finally to their current location in Packenham.[2]

The club maintains the oldest continual pack of hounds in Australia.[3]


Hunt country

The club hunts areas in South and East Gippsland, as well as the Casterton - Hamilton area.[4]
