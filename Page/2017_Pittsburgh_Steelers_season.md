The 2017 PITTSBURGH STEELERS SEASON was the franchise's 85th season as a professional sports franchise and as a member of the National Football League. It was the 18th season under leadership of general manager Kevin Colbert and the eleventh under head coach Mike Tomlin. It was also the Steelers' first season since the death of Dan Rooney.

The Steelers clinched the AFC North division title for the second consecutive season with a 39–38 win over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 14, and secured a first-round playoff bye for the first time since 2010 following a 34–6 win over the Houston Texans in Week 16. In the Divisional Round however, the Steelers suffered a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 45–42 after falling behind 28–14 at halftime. After their loss, the Steelers were criticized for looking past the Jaguars and anticipating a rematch with the New England Patriots.[1][2] With a record of 13–3, the Steelers posted their best mark since 2004.

With the loss and 9-game regular season winning streak snapped, the Steelers dropped to 2–1 and with the Ravens' loss to the Jaguars moved into a tie on top of the AFC North.

The loss was the Steelers' third straight against the Bears, and dropped the Steelers to a record of 1–12 all-time against the Bears in Chicago.

Week 4: at Baltimore Ravens

After their first loss of the season, the Steelers traveled to Baltimore to play the Ravens. The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3–0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6–0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13–0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19–0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter.

The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19–3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19–9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26–9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3–1. The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent.

The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012. It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002. Seventeen points marked the largest margin of victory for the Steelers in Baltimore in series history, and the largest such margin against any team in Baltimore since the Steelers defeated the Colts in Memorial Stadium by twenty-six points in the 1976 NFL Playoffs.

Week 5: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars

After a huge road win, the Steelers returned home for a game against the Jaguars. In the first quarter the Steelers scored first as Chris Boswell kicked a 29-yard field goal for a 3–0 lead and the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Jags got on the board when Leonard Fournette ran for a 2-yard touchdown to make it 7–3. The Steelers drew closer before halftime though as Boswell kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 7–6. After the break, the Steelers would retake the lead in the third quarter when Boswell kicked a 20-yard field goal to make it 9–7. Though the Jags would score 23 unanswered points well into the fourth quarter when Ben Roethlisberger was intercepted twice: Telvin Smith returned one 28 yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT) as the Jags moved ahead 13–9. This would be followed up by a Barry Church interception that was returned 51 yards for a touchdown to make it 20–9 to finish the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Jason Myers tacked on a 47-yard field goal to make it 23–9. Later on, the Steelers' rush defense stalled as Fournette ran for a 90-yard touchdown to make the final score 30–9.

With the loss, the Steelers dropped to 3–2. The 21-point loss was the largest home loss in Mike Tomlin's career as the team's head coach. Ben Roethlisberger also set a new career high of 5 interceptions in a single game with 2 of them being pick 6s.

The team failed to score a touchdown at home for the first time since their 11–10 victory over the Chargers in 2008.

Week 6: at Kansas City Chiefs

The Steelers moved back ahead in the second quarter when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 3-yard touchdown making the score 9–3.

In the highly defensive second half, the Steelers managed to score more field goals starting in the third quarter when Boswell went for 2 more, from 41 and 49 yards out, to increase the Steelers' lead from 9 to 12 and making the score change from 23–14 to 26–14.

After a tough win on the road, the Steelers went back home for their second game of the season against the Ravens. Pittsburgh scored first in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell for a 20-yard pass to make it 7–0 and the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Steelers moved up 14–0 when Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens got on the board when Joe Flacco found Chris Moore on a 30-yard pass to make it 14–7. The Steelers then moved ahead by double digits again when Chris Boswell put up a 52-yard field goal to make it 17–7. The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17–14. The Steelers closed out the half with another field goal kicked by Boswell from 43 yards out to make it 20–14 at halftime. In the third quarter, it was all Ravens when they took the lead after scoring 3 times: First when Justin Tucker managed to nail a 47-yard field goal to make it 20–17. This would be followed by Javorius Allen's 1-yard touchdown run as they took the lead 24–20. Flacco then found Patrick Ricard on a 6-yard pass as the Ravens moved up by double digits 31–20. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers managed to come within 2, starting with a 24-yard field goal kicked by Boswell shortening the Ravens' lead to 31–23. This would then be followed up by Roethlisberger connecting with Roosevelt Nix on a 1-yard pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make it 31–29. The Ravens managed to pull away when Allen ran for a 9-yard touchdown to make it 38–29. The Steelers then completed the comeback when Bell ran for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 38–36. This would be followed by Boswell kicking a 46-yard field goal to make it 39–38. The Ravens then got the ball back, but Flacco was sacked by T. J. Watt as time expired, sealing the win for the Steelers.

With the win, the Steelers improved to 11–2 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also managed to win their 9th straight game over a divisional opponent. They would win 8 in a row during a single season for the first time since 2004.

Pittsburgh notched their first 3-game win streak over the Ravens since defeating them three times during the 2008 season (including the playoffs). The teams' 77 combined points marked the most in series history. The team also swept the Ravens for the first time since 2008. With the division clinched, the team would win consecutive titles for the first time since the 2007 and 2008 seasons.

The Steelers' second consecutive 11+ point comeback victory marked the first time the Steelers had accomplished this feat since coming back from down 14 against the Denver Broncos on December 7, 1997 and then again from down 14 against the New England Patriots on December 13, 1997.

Week 15: vs. New England Patriots

After another close win, the Steelers stayed home for a game against the Patriots. The Pats scored first in the first quarter when Rex Burkhead ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 7–0. The Steelers tied the game up later on when Ben Roethlisberger found Eli Rogers on an 18-yard pass to make it 7–7. In the second quarter, the Steelers took the lead when Chris Boswell kicked a 51-yard field goal to make it 10–7. The Pats would tie it up again when Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 32-yard field goal to make it 10–10. The Steelers then moved ahead when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 4-yard pass to make it 17–10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Pats drew closer when Tom Brady found Brandin Cooks on a 4-yard pass to make it 17–16 (with a failed PAT). The Steelers then moved further ahead when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 24–16 following a Brady interception. In the fourth quarter, Gostkowski's 46-yard field goal made it 24–19. Dion Lewis then ran for an 8-yard touchdown (with a successful 2-point conversion) to make it 27–24. The Steelers managed to make it deep into Patriots territory on the ensuing drive. However, an apparent touchdown pass to tight end Jesse James was controversially overturned after replay, and Roethlisberger was intercepted two plays later, sealing the win for the Pats.[4]

With their 8-game winning streak snapped, the Steelers fell to 11–3.

Week 16: at Houston Texans

NFL ON CHRISTMAS DAY After a tough loss at home, the Steelers traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In the first quarter, it was all Steelers when Chris Boswell kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 3–0. They would then make it 10–0 when Ben Roethlisberger found Justin Hunter on a 5-yard pass. In the second quarter, the Steelers would increase their lead when Roosevelt Nix ran for a 1-yard touchdown followed up by Boswell kicking a 36-yard field goal to make it 17–0 and then 20–0 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Steelers continued their dominance when Le'Veon Bell ran for a 10-yard touchdown to make it 27–0. In the fourth quarter, the Texans finally got on the board when T. J. Yates found DeAndre Hopkins on a 3-yard pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make it 27–6. The Steelers were able to seal the game when Roethlisberger found JuJu Smith-Schuster on an 18-yard pass to make the final score 34–6.

With the win, the Steelers improved to 12–3, marking the tenth 12-win season in franchise history. With the Jaguars' loss to the 49ers on Sunday, the team was able to clinch a first-round bye in the AFC playoffs. The team also finished the regular season at 7–1 on the road for only the fourth time in franchise history (1978, 2004, 2010).

Week 17: vs. Cleveland Browns

After a huge win on the road, the Steelers returned home for their last regular season game against the Browns. The Steelers would score first in the first quarter when Darrius Heyward-Bey ran for a 29-yard touchdown to make it 7–0. They would make it 14–0 in the second quarter when Landry Jones found JuJu Smith-Schuster on a 20-yard pass. The Browns managed to get on the board when Duke Johnson Jr. ran for a 2-yard touchdown to make it 14–7. The Steelers pulled away when Stevan Ridley ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 21–7. DeShone Kizer then found Rashard Higgins on a 56-yard pass to make the score 21–14 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Browns tied the game up when Kizer and Higgins connected again on a 5-yard pass to make it 21–21. The Steelers managed to pull away when Smith-Schuster returned the subsequent kick 96 yards for a touchdown to make it 28–21. The Browns then came within 4 when Zane Gonzalez put up a 51-yard field goal to make it 28–24. In a highly defensive and scoreless fourth quarter, this would be the final score of the game.

With the win, the Steelers finished their season at 13–3, marking their most wins since 2004, and tied for the third-most wins in team history. The team also won its 10th straight game over a divisional opponent. They also swept the division for the first time since 2008 and became the first AFC North team to sweep the division since the Ravens in 2011.

AFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. (#3) Jacksonville Jaguars

The Steelers faced the Jaguars in the Divisional Round in a rematch of week 5 and once again, played down to their competition. The Jags jumped out to leads of 7–0 and 14–0 when Leonard Fournette ran for touchdowns from a yard and then 18-yards out. In the second quarter, they made it 21–0 when T.J. Yeldon ran for 4-yard touchdown. The Steelers got on the board when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 23-yard pass to make it 21–7. Though the Jags pulled away when Telvin Smith returned a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown to make it 28–7. Though the Steelers made it 28–14 at halftime when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 36-yard pass. In the third quarter, the Steelers scored the only points when Roethlisberger found Bell on a 19-yard pass to make it 28–21. In the fourth quarter, the Jags pulled away when Fournette ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 35–21. The Steelers came within a touchdown again when Roethlisberger and Brown connected again on a 43-yard pass to make it 35–28. Though again, the Jags pulled away when Tommy Bohanon and Blake Bortles connected on a 14-yard pass to make it 42–28. Bell then ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the score 42–35. However, the Jags sealed the game with Josh Lambo's 45-yard field goal to make it 45–35. With the ball back in the final seconds, the Steelers scored on their last play of the game and season when Roethlisberger threw the ball to Juju Smith-Schuster to make the final score 45–42.

With the loss, the Steelers finished their season 13–4. Ben Roethlisberger is also the first QB in NFL history to throw 5 touchdown passes in a postseason game and lose.

This would also be the last game that running back Le'Veon Bell would play for the Steelers, as he would sit out the 2018 season due to a contract dispute, then sign with the New York Jets once he became a free agent at the start of 2019.
