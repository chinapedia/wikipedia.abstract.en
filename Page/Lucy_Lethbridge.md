LUCY LETHBRIDGE (born February 1963, Hammersmith, London) is a British author of non-fiction books for children and adults.


Career

Lethbridge is the author of a history of the largest single occupation in 20th century Great Britain: _Servants: A Downstairs View of Twentieth Century Britain_ (Bloomsbury, March 2013).[1] She examines the difficult and changing relationships between employers and domestic workers in the 19th and 20th centuries.[2][3] Servants in the 19th and 20th century were found in all but the very poorest houses, ranging from a single "skivvy" in a poor household, to country houses whose staff numbered in the hundreds. Lethbridge has drawn from a wide range of both oral and written accounts to create a book that is "empathetic, wide-ranging and well-written".[4][5]

Drawing on the same research, Lethbridge has also published _Spit and Polish: Old-Fashioned Ways to Banish Dirt, Dust and Decay_[6]> and _Mind your manors : tried-and-true British household cleaning tips_. Both how-to books contain traditional household hints and by-gone tricks for looking after homes. These range from the useful to the ridiculous and sometimes the revolting (e.g. "hang the skin of a freshly killed bear in your bedroom.")[7]

Lethbridge has collaborated on a number of history books for children in the "Who was..." series from Short Books, Inc. _Ada Lovelace, the Computer Wizard of Victorian Britain_, won the Blue Peter Book Award for non-fiction in 2002.[8] Other titles include _Annie Oakley : sharpshooter of the Wild West_, _Henry Smith : his life & legacy_, _Florence Nightingale_, _St. Francis of Assisi : the patron saint of animals_, and '' Napoleon''.[9]

Lethbridge writes for magazines including _The Observer,_ _The Sunday Telegraph_, _The Independent on Sunday_ and _The Times Literary Supplement_. She preceded Sue Gaisford as the Literary Editor of _The Tablet_[10] and has been a London correspondent for _ARTnews_ in New York.[11] She has been the literary editor of _The Catholic Herald_,[12] and has edited the collection _A Deep but Dazzling Darkness: An Anthology of personal experiences of God_ with Selina Oâ€™Grady.[13]
