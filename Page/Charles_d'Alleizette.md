AYMAR CHARLES D'ALLEIZETTE (23 January 1884, in Paris – 9 April 1967) was a French military administrator and botanist.

He was a member of the French military from around 1904 to 1942, during which time, he was stationed in Madagascar (1906), Tonkin (1908) and Algeria (1911–22). From 1943 to 1948 he worked in the laboratory of phanerogams at the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and afterwards, served as curator of the herbarium at Clermont-Ferrand.[1][2]

Throughout his career, he collected botanical specimens, and his personal herbarium of 55,000 items is now property of the Faculty of Sciences at Clermont-Ferrand. He held a particular interest in Orchidaceae native to Europe and northern Africa, and he is credited with providing descriptions of many orchid hybrids.[3][4] The botanical genera _Alleizettea_ and _Alleizettella_ commemorate his name.[5]
