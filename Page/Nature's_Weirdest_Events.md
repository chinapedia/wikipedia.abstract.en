The show looks at weird events from around the world, with introduced footage typically taken from eyewitnesses before the facts are given.

Reception

Series four of the show was given a mediocre review by Sam Wollaston of _The Guardian_, who was unsure whether the swimming pigs of Pig Beach were surprising, and asked "could it be that, having reached series four, they're running out of Weird Natural Events? A resource running low or, less politely, a barrel being scraped?"[20]


Merchandise

DVD

A single-disc DVD containing the first two episodes of the series was released on 12 March 2012.[21]
