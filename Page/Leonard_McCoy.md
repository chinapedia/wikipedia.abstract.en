DR. LEONARD HORATIO "BONES" MCCOY is a character in the American science fiction franchise _Star Trek_. [1] First portrayed by DeForest Kelley in the original _Star Trek_ series, McCoy also appears in the animated _Star Trek_ series, six _Star Trek_ movies, the pilot episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, and in numerous books, comics, and video games.[2] Karl Urban assumed the role of the character in the 2009 _Star Trek_ film[3] and its sequels: _Star Trek Into Darkness_ (2013) and _Star Trek Beyond_ (2016).


Depiction

McCoy was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 20, 2227.[4] The son of David, he attended the University of Mississippi[5] and is a divorcé.[6] McCoy later married Natira, the priestess of Yonada, characterized in the episode, "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky". In 2266, McCoy was posted as chief medical officer of the USS _Enterprise_ under Captain James T. Kirk, who often calls him "Bones".[7] McCoy and Kirk are good friends, even "brotherly". The passionate, sometimes cantankerous McCoy frequently argues with Kirk's other confidante, science officer Spock,[8] and occasionally is prejudiced against Spock's Vulcan heritage.[9] McCoy often plays the role of Kirk's conscience, offering a counterpoint to Spock's logic.[10] McCoy is suspicious of technology,[11] especially the transporter.[12] As a physician, he prefers less intrusive treatment and believes in the body's innate recuperative powers.[13] The character's nickname, "Bones", is a play on _sawbones_, an epithet for physicians[14] qualified as surgeons.[15]

When Kirk orders McCoy's commission reactivated in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (1979);[16] a resentful McCoy complains of being "drafted".[17] Spock transfers his _katra_—his knowledge and experience—into McCoy before dying in _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ (1982).[18] This causes mental anguish for McCoy, who in _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_ (1984) helps restore Spock's katra to his reanimated body.[19] McCoy continues to serve on Kirk's crew aboard the captured Klingon ship in _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ (1986).[20] In _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_ (1989), McCoy (through the intervention of Spock's half-brother Sybok) reveals that he helped his father commit suicide to relieve him of his pain. Shortly after the suicide, a cure was found for his father's disease, and McCoy had carried the guilt about it with him until Sybok's intervention.

In _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ (1991), McCoy and Kirk escape from a Klingon prison world, and the _Enterprise_ crew stops a plot to prevent peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire.[21] Kelley reprised the role for the "Encounter at Farpoint" pilot episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1987), insisting upon no more than the minimum Screen Actors Guild payment for his appearance.[22]

In the _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ episode "The Survivor", McCoy mentions he has a daughter, Joanna. Although Chekov's friend Irina in the original series episode "The Way to Eden" was originally written as McCoy's daughter, it was changed before the episode was shot.[23]

Reboot film series

Leonard_"Bones"_McCoy_(from_Star_Trek_2009).JPG as McCoy in _Star Trek_ (2009)]] In the 2009 _Star Trek_ film, which takes place in an alternate, parallel reality,[24] McCoy and Kirk become friends at Starfleet Academy, which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says "left [him] nothing but [his] bones." This line, improvised by Urban,[25] explains how McCoy earned the nickname _Bones_. McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the USS _Enterprise_. He later becomes the chief medical officer after Doctor Puri is killed during an attack by Nero. McCoy remains aboard to see the _Enterprise_ defeat Nero and his crew, with Kirk becoming the commanding officer of the ship.

_The Guardian_ called Urban's portrayal of McCoy in the 2009 film an "unqualified success",[26] and _The New York Times_ called the character "wild-eyed and funny".[27] Slate.com said Urban came closer than the other actors to impersonating a character's original depiction.[28]


Development

Kelley had worked with _Star Trek_ creator Gene Roddenberry on previous television pilots,[29] and he was Roddenberry's first choice to play the doctor aboard the USS _Enterprise_.[30] However, for the rejected pilot "The Cage" (1964), Roddenberry went with director Robert Butler's choice of John Hoyt to play Dr. Philip Boyce.[31] For the second pilot, "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (1966), Roddenberry accepted director James Goldstone's decision to have Paul Fix play Dr. Mark Piper.[32] Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship's doctor, he did not put Kelley's name forward to NBC; the network never "rejected" the actor as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.[33]

Kelley's first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in "The Man Trap" (1966). Despite his character's prominence, Kelley's contract granted him only a "featuring" credit; it was not until the second season that he was given "starring" credit, at the urging of producer Robert Justman.[34] Kelley was apprehensive about _Star Trek_{{'}}s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was "going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made".[35] Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original _Star Trek_ series and voiced the character in the animated _Star Trek_.[36]

Kelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but whose family could not pay for a medical education,[37] in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy: a doctor's "matter-of-fact" delivery of news of Kelley's mother's terminal cancer was the "abrasive sand" Kelley used in creating McCoy's demeanor. _Star Trek_ writer D. C. Fontana said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley's input.

"Exquisite chemistry" among Kelley, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain James T. Kirk and science officer Spock, respectively. Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, referred to Kelley as her "sassy gentleman friend"; the friendship between the African-American Nichols and Southern Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through _Star Trek_.

For the 2009 _Star Trek_ film, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman saw McCoy as an "arbiter" in Kirk and Spock's relationship.[38] While Spock represented "extreme logic, extreme science" and Kirk symbolized "extreme emotion and intuition", McCoy's role as "a very colorful doctor, essentially a very humanistic scientist" represented the "two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together."[39] They chose to reveal that McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the "bias" in their friendship and why he would often be a "little dismissive" of Spock.[40] Urban said the script was "very faithful" to the original character, including the "great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility" with which Kelley imbued the character.[41] New Zealand-born Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy's accent [42] and reprised the role in its sequels _Star Trek Into Darkness_[43] and _Star Trek Beyond_.


Cultural impact

McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself, but is a foil to Spock.[44] He is Kirk's "friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest".[45] Spock and McCoy's bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo "we simply didn't realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our Arrowsmith and our Alien".[46] Urban said McCoy has a "sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing", and that "Spock's logic and McCoy's moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one."[47]

Kelley said that his greatest thrill at _Star Trek_ conventions was the number of people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character.[48] He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, "You can win awards and that sort of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry".

In a humor column for the _Canadian Medical Association Journal_, the ethicist Michael Yeo described the character of McCoy as "TV’s only true physician" and "someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy".[49]

"He's dead, Jim!"

Twenty times on the original _Star Trek_, McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, "He's dead", "He's dead, Jim", or something similar. The phrase so became a catchphrase of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone[50][51][52]—and it appeared in the first sentence of at least one obituary[53]—but disliked repeating such lines and refused to say it in _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ when Spock is near death. Kelley and James Doohan (Scotty) agreed to swap their lines, so McCoy warns Kirk against opening the engineering doors while Scotty says, "He's dead already".[54]

The USC literature professor Henry Jenkins cites Dr. McCoy's "He's dead, Jim" line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities.[55]

"I'm a doctor, not a(n)..."

Another of McCoy's catchphrases is his "I'm a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)..." statements,[56] delivered by Kelley 11 times, and three times (by Karl Urban) in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as the "classic moment" when he is confronted with the unusual silicon-based Horta alien in "The Devil in the Dark" (1967), saying, "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."[57]

Kelley himself parodied the phrase for a _Trivial Pursuit_ commercial, in which the question is asked "How many chambers does a human heart have?" Kelley appears on screen and replies "How should I know? I'm an actor, not a doctor!".[58][59]
