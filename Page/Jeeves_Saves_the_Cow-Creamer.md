Plot

Aunt Dahlia sends Bertie to "sneer" at an antique, silver cow creamer, in order to keep its price down. He accidentally brings the antique to the attention of rival collector Sir Watkyn Bassett, who buys it. Dahlia sends Bertie to get the creamer back at all costs. Jeeves steals the unique silver cow creamer, using it as the car/motor mascot and hiding it as a hood/bonnet ornament and radiator cap on Wooster's car.

Sir Roderick Spode is appalled when he learns that Madeline Bassett is engaged to Gussie Fink-Nottle. Gussie is naturally terrified of Spode, and even the smallest misunderstanding will put his life in jeopardy. Spode has two jobs—he is the leader of the Black Shorts,[4] a tiny multi-aged group dressed in black shorts, but also designs and sells women's underwear, being the proprietor of a lingerie shop called _Eulalie Soeurs_. He is perpetually in fear that his followers in his first role will discover his second one and it is the threat of this disclosure which is used by Jeeves to stop him assaulting Bertie. Jeeves reveals the secret pseudonym "Eulalie" and finds a way of keeping Spode from beating Bertie into a jelly.
