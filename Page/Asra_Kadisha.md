ASRA KADISHA (the Committee for the Preservation of Gravesites) is an organization for the preservation of Jewish cemeteries and gravesites throughout the world.[1] The organization attempts to avoid desecration of ancient gravesites by preventing construction in their vicinity.[2] It was established by Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik in 1959 as a response to excavations at Beit She'arim National Park, and has been headed for many years by Rabbi Dovid Shmidel.[3]

According to Rabbi Shmidel, Rabbi Soloveitchik was asked by Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum to create Asra Kadisha.[4]
