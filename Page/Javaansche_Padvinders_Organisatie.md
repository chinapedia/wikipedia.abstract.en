Scouting came to Indonesia in 1912, as a branch of Dutch Scouting. After 1916 it was called the _Nederland Indische Padvinders Vereeniging_ (Netherlands Indies Scout Movement). Other Scouting organizations were established by the _Indonesia Scouts_ in 1916. As the Dutch East Indies, Indonesia had been a branch of the Netherlands Scout Association, yet Scouting was very popular, and had achieved great numbers and standards.[1]
