"YESTERDAY'S HERO" is a pop song by John Paul Young. The song was written by George Young and Harry Vanda and was released in February 1975 as the lead single from Young's debut studio album, _Hero_ (1975).

The song became a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 8 in Australia, No. 1 in South Africa and No. 41 in the United States.


Overview

"Yesterday's Hero" is a song about the fleeting nature of pop stardom. It drew on Vanda & Young's own experiences as former teen idols.^([1][2][16])

The song gave Young his first top ten hit,^([10]) reaching No. 8 on the Australian singles chart^([10]) and staying at No. 1 on the Melbourne charts for six weeks before being replaced by Hush's "Boney Maroney". The single sold strongly in the United States, where it reached No. 44 on the Cash Box Top 100 in February 1976.^([17])

One of the key factors in the Australian success of "Yesterday's Hero" was the film clip made to promote it, which enabled the song to be given heavy exposure on _Countdown_, which had just switched to its new one-hour Sunday evening format, following the official start of colour TV broadcasting on 1 March 1975.^([2][18][19]) Young's debut performance on _Countdown_ had him miming "Yesterday's Hero" while dressed in a sailor's suit surrounded on an island stage with a studio audience of screaming teen girls.^([20]) He was dragged off the stage three times by audience members and the microphone cord was ripped out but the song continued uninterrupted.^([20]) ABC TV producer, Michael Shrimpton believes his show, _Countdown_, played a big part in making "Yesterday's Hero" and Young a teen pop success.^([18])
