GEORGE BEVAN is a former college American football player for the LSU Tigers football team. He played as a linebacker from 1967 to 1969, although he missed the majority of his first two seasons after rupturing an Achilles tendon in the 1967 season opener.[1] As a senior in 1969, he was named a first-team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association[2] and Football Writers Association of America.[3] He was a second-team selection by the Associated Press,[4] Central Press,[5] and Newspaper Enterprise Association.[6] The Associated Press and United Press International each named Bevan a first-team All-Southeastern Conference linebacker.[7][8]

Bevan was selected in the seventeenth round of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, but he did not play professionally.
