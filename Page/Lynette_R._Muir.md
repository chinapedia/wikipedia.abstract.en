LYNETTE R. MUIR, or LYNN MUIR (1930 - 2 July 2007) was reader in the Department of French Language and Literature at the University of Leeds. She was described as "one of the foremost European scholars in the fields of medieval French drama and Arthurian romance."[1]

In 1975, Muir was central to co-ordinating the staging of 42 pageants from the York Mystery Plays on the Leeds University campus.[2] In 1977-82, Muir was the director of Leeds's Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies: in 1978, she oversaw a change in its name to Centre for Medieval Studies and procured dedicated space for the Centre for the first time in 1979.[3]
