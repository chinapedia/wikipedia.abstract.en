Biography

Yuri Herrera studied Political Science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, obtained a master's degree in Creative Writing at the University of Texas, El Paso and a Ph.D., 2009, in Hispanic Language and Literature at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the editor of the literary magazine _El perro_ and a Mellow Postdoctoral Fellow at Tulane University.

His first novel, _Trabajos del reino_, won the 2003 Premio Binacional de Novela Border of Words made Herrera into one of the most famous writers of Latin America. The novel was also published in Spain (Periférica, 2008) and won the Premio Otras Voces, Otros Ámbitos, being considered the best work of fiction published in Spain by a jury of 100 people, including editors, journalists and cultural critics.[1]

Elena Poniatowska characterised his prose as "stunning" and the novel as an entrance "to the golden gate of Mexican literature".[2] Gabriel Wolfson describes Herrera's work as "amazing, constructed from exchanging cultured language for popular talk, emphasizing the importance of names, and using the forcefulness of certain terms while wisely omitting others".[3]

His second novel, _Señales que precederán al fin del mundo_ (2009; translated as _Signs Preceding the End of the World_ by Lisa Dillman, And Other Stories, 2015), has led Herrera to being considered one of the most relevant young Mexican writers in the Spanish language. He has collaborated in magazines as _Letras libres_ and _El Comité 1973_ among many others.


Style

Discussing the style Herrera uses in his texts, he declared: "I like to say that style isn't surface, style is a form of knowledge".[4]

Narrative

Working with space is one of the main characteristics of Herrera's work. Speaking about _Kingdom Cons_, he explained that Ciudad Juárez is the model he used for the space, however it's a version of Juárez modified for his convenience. Likewise, his novel _Signs Preceding the End of the World_ makes no mention of any actual city, Herrera explains: "I wanted the novel not to be read only as a novel about Mexican migration, even though the scenery and setting resembles certain places of Mexico and the border between Mexico and the United States."[5] Herrera is an avid reader of Cervantes' _Don Quixote_ and uses many elements of indigenous Aztec mythology in his books, especially evident in _Sings_. Although his books never define clearly the cities and regions where they are situated, Herrera's narratives refer to highly political contexts. He states: "Literature cannot take full responsibility for creating good or bad men and women, but what it can do is give you the tools to make yourself into a conscious citizen. In this sense, I believe literature always entails a political responsibility."[6]
