Development

Adam Sussman, VP Publishing Americas and Asia for EA Mobile, commented upon the game's announcement: "Our alliance with Hasbro continues to benefit EA Mobile customers with our ability to bring favorite popular board game properties to the mobile platform".[5] The game was part of an expansion in the Spring of 2008, along with Trivial Pursuit, Risk, and Yahtzee Adventures, which saw new twists on classic Hasbro titles.[6]


Commercial performance

The game was reported to be within the AppStore list of Top 100 downloads on December 2, 2009,[7] December 9, 2009,[8] December 11, 2009,[9] December 13, 2009,[10] December 15, 2009,[11] and February 10, 2010.[12] The game was among the top ten of Pogo.com games, in terms of worldwide visitors and minutes played.[13]


Critical reception

Levi Buchanan of IGN wrote that the game's cosmetic changes from the original were "fun", but he didn't see a concrete reason for choosing this version over the classic edition.[14] George Roush from IGN commented that the game was good, despite the disappointing AI and die physics.[15] Slide To Play thought the game was a "solid" adaption of the board game, and thought it was a "bargain" considering the low price tag.[16] Gadget Review thought the game was a "waste of money".[17] 148Apps disliked the auto-auction feature, though liked the game's customisability.[18]
