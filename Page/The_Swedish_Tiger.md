Plot

In October 1908, James Bellamy has invited Axel Ryttsen to 165 Eaton Place, who is James' friend and a dashing Swedish military officer. Sarah Moffat falls in love with Torkel Kraft (Ryttsen's valet), who removes valuable household objects from the Bellamy house in order to pay off Ryttsen's gambling debts. They use Sarah as a patsy. Sarah thinks, that she is helping Kraft and Kraft promises her that she will go to Sweden with her lover. But they leave Sarah alone with the music: "one hapless servant girl who will certainly be dismissed".[1][2] Sarah has to explain all things to the police and is finally fined by a court and sacked from the Bellamy household.
