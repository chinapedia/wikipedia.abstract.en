Recognition

Screenings

_Actrius_ screened in 2001 at the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in an American Cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director. The film had first screened at the same location in 1998.[4] It was also shown at the 1997 Stockholm International Film Festival.[5]

Reception

In _Movie - Film - Review_, _Daily Mail_ staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were "competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers", the film "is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident".[6] Noting that there were "occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness", they did not "justify comparisons to _All About Eve_", and were "insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with _Rashomon_".[7] He also wrote that _The Guardian_ called the film a "slow, stuffy chamber-piece", and that _The Evening Standard_ stated the film's "best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers".[8] MRQE wrote "This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story."[9]
