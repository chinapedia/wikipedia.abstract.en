The 2017 JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS SEASON was the franchise's 23rd season in the National Football League and the first under head coach Doug Marrone. Marrone was hired after acting as the team's interim head coach for the final two games of the 2016 season. The team improved on their 3–13 record from 2016 and ended their 10-year playoff drought dating back to 2008 with a week 15 win over the Houston Texans. They also secured their first winning season since 2007 after a 30–24 win over the Seattle Seahawks. On December 24, 2017, they clinched their third division title, and their first AFC South title following a Tennessee Titans loss. They won the wild card game against the Buffalo Bills 10–3, then headed to Pittsburgh, beating the Pittsburgh Steelers 45–42 to advance to the AFC Championship to face the New England Patriots, the first time that they have made the AFC Championship Game since 1999. Despite leading for much of the game, the Jaguars would allow two 4th quarter touchdowns, and ultimately lost to the Patriots 24–20.

One of the biggest catalysts for the Jaguars success during the 2017 season was their defense. Jacksonville finished in the top of the league in multiple defensive categories, and were considered "historically good" by some analysts.[1] The Jaguars defense led the league in forced fumbles (17), completion percentage (56.8), passing yards allowed per game (169.9), passer rating (68.5) and defensive touchdowns (7). They also finished second in sacks (55), interceptions (21), total takeaways (33), yards allowed per game (286.1) and points allowed per game (16.8). Along with their spectacular defense, the Jaguars were also the top rushing offense in the NFL, averaging 141 rush yards per game.[2]
