History

The Hyderabad–Khokhrapar Branch Line was originally built as part of the _Hyderabad–Jodhpur Railway_ in 1892. The first section from Hyderabad to Shadipalli opened in 1892 and was originally constructed as a broad gauge railway line (this first section was also known as the _Hyderabad–Umarkot Railway_). In 1901, the first section was converted to metre gauge where it joined the second section between Shadipalli and Luni and on wards to Jodhpur.[2][3] In February 2006, the entire Hyderabad–Khokhrapar line was re-converted again back to the original to 1676 mm broad gauge line.
