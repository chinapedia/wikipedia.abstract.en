_ZOOM! THE BEST OF 1995â€“2016_ is a compilation album by the Welsh alternative rock band Super Furry Animals, released on 4 November 2016.[1] It is the band's third compilation album, after the B-sides/rarities collection _Out Spaced_ (1998), and _Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1_ (2004).


Background

The release collects all of the band's singles as well as some 'deep cuts' from their studio albums. "Organ Yn Dy Geg" is originally from the _Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyndrobwllantysiliogogogochynygofod (in space) E.P._. "The Citizen's Band" was originally a hidden track found in the pregap of _Guerrilla_, it is presented as an individually advertised track for the first time, it had never been released with copies of _Guerrilla_ released via digital markets and "Patience" is from the DVD version of _Rings Around the World_, and was only previously released on CD on the bonus disc for the U.S. release of _Rings Around the World_ which contained the seven DVD bonus tracks in 2002.

The title of the album is named for "Zoom!", the opening track from the band's 2005 album _Love Kraft_ which appears in a previously unreleased edit on this compilation where the sample of guitarist Huw Bunford jumping into a swimming pool at the start of the track is removed.


Packaging

The album's artwork was designed by longtime collaborator Pete Fowler and the sleeve notes were written by noted Welsh music journalist and author Simon Price.[2]
