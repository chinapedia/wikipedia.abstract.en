The RENNELL WHISTLER (_Pachycephala feminina_) is a species of bird in the family Pachycephalidae, which is endemic to the Rennell Island in the Solomon Islands. It was split from the Bismarck whistler by the IOC in 2016.[1]


Taxonomy and systematics

It has been variably considered a subspecies of a widespread golden whistler (_P. pectoralis_) or treated as a separate species, but strong published evidence in favour of either treatment is limited, and further study is warranted to resolve the complex taxonomic situation.[2]


Status

The Rennell whistler is assessed as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to its small population and habitat loss within a restricted range.[3]
