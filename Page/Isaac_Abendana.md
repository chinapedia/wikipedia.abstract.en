ISAAC ABENDANA (ca. 1640 â€“ 1699) was the younger brother of Jacob Abendana, and became _hakam_ of the Spanish Portuguese Synagogue in London after his brother died.[1]

Abendana moved to England before his brother, in 1662, and taught Hebrew at Cambridge University. He completed an unpublished Latin translation of the _Mishnah_ for the university in 1671.

While he was at Cambridge, Abendana sold Hebrew books to the Bodleian Library of Oxford, and in 1689 he took a teaching position in Magdalen College. In Oxford, he wrote a series of Jewish almanacs for Christians, which he later collected and compiled as the _Discourses on the Ecclesiastical and Civil Polity of the Jews_ (1706). Like his brother, he maintained an extensive correspondence with leading Christian scholars of his time, most notably with the philosopher Ralph Cudworth, master of Christ's College, Cambridge.
