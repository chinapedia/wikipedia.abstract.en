STRUCTURALLY NANOENGINEERED ANTIMICROBIAL POLYPEPTIDE POLYMERS (SNAPPs) are a type of artificially designed synthetic antimicrobial peptide. The development of the polymers is potentially a treatment for bacterial diseases.[1] The research takes a novel approach to combating bacteria; rather than poisoning them as antibiotics do, SNAPPs and other antimicrobial peptides tear the bacteria apart.[2]


Structure and characteristics

The molecule destabilizes the structure of the outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane in multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria with no resistance observed by the researchers through multiple bacterial generations.[3] While no human trials have been approved yet, the molecule has been tested _in vivo_ with the mouse peritonitis model, and was shown to be highly selective towards bacterial cell walls, leaving mammalian cells unharmed. Bacteria species tested include _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_, along with variants of _P. aeruginosa_ and _A. baumannii_.[4] SNAPPs work by literally tearing the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane apart, leading to cell death. Their structure physically resembles a star. At the core of their structure is a multi-functional initiator poly(amidoamine) with 16 or 32 primary amines. Lysine and valine amino acids are polymerized to the _N_-terminus of the core in order to form either an S16 (16 arm SNAPP) or S32 (32 arm SNAPP).[5] The polymerized peptide chains result in several positively charged primary ammonium cations, which help adhere the negatively charged end of the phospholipid bi-layer.[6]
