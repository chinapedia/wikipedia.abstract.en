LITTLE HORRINGER HALL is a Grade II-listed house in Horringer, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.[1]

There has been a hall in this location since the 17th century, and an earlier property was once the residence of Sir Richard Gipps.[2] The present house was built around 1750 from red brick. A pair of bay windows and a replacement front door were added in the 20th century.[3] It was the final residence of John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol after he sold the remaining lease of the nearby Ickworth House to the National Trust owing to financial difficulties.[4]
