_DOOM_ (typeset as _DOOM_ in official documents and stylized as _DOOM_ in other media)[1] is a 1993 first-person shooter (FPS) video game developed by id Software for MS-DOS. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history for having helped to pioneer, along with the 1992 game _Wolfenstein 3D_, the now-ubiquitous FPS gameplay type, and has been frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. _THE ULTIMATE DOOM_, an updated version featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

In _Doom_, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy",[2] fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell.[3] With one entire third of the game (nine levels) freely distributed as shareware, it was played by an estimated 15–20 million people[4] within two years of its release. _Doom_ made a massive global impact: it popularized the business model of online distribution;[5] it popularized the FPS genre of gameplay and spawned a gaming subculture; and it pioneered the technologies of immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive ("WADs") which are now called downloadable content (DLC). As a sign of its effect on the industry, FPS games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "_Doom_ clones". Its graphic violence and hellish imagery made it the subject of considerable controversy.

The _Doom_ franchise continued with the follow-up _Doom II: Hell on Earth_ (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including _Master Levels for Doom II_ (1995) and _Final Doom_ (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, those games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations and modernizations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices, even to machines that were not designed to run games. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the _Doom_ game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention, more than ten years after its foundation with the release of _Doom 3_ (2004), a retelling of the original game using the id Tech 4 engine, with an associated 2005 _Doom_ motion picture. A reboot of the series, also simply titled _Doom_ but this time powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016, and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.


Gameplay

_Doom_ is a first-person shooter presented with early 3D graphics. The player controls an unnamed space marine—later termed the Doomguy—through a series of levels set in military bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D sprites presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics. Levels are often labyrinthine, and a full screen automap is available which shows the areas explored to that point.

While traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and possessed undead humans, while managing supplies of ammunition, health, and armor. Enemies often appear in large groups, and the game features five difficulty levels which increase the quantity and damage done by enemies, with enemies respawning upon death and moving faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either moving toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and clawing. They will fight each other if one monster is accidentally harmed by another, though most monsters are not harmed by other monsters of the same kind. Levels can also include pits of toxic waste, ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a keycard, skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be opened. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a pistol, a chainsaw, a plasma rifle, and the BFG 9000, among others. The levels also feature power-ups such as items that give health or armor points, increase the player character's maximum ammunition or health, fill out the automap, give partial invisibility, or allow the player to survive in toxic waste. There are also items which apply time-limited effects such as invulnerability or a berserker status.

In addition to the main single-player game mode, _Doom_ features two multiplayer modes playable over a local network: "cooperative", in which two to four players team up to play through the main game, and "deathmatch", in which two to four players play against each other. Online multiplayer was later made available a year after launch through the DWANGO service.[6] _Doom_ also contains cheat codes that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities.[7][8][9][10]


Plot

_Doom_ is divided into three episodes: "Knee-Deep in the Dead", "The Shores of Hell", and "Inferno". A fourth episode, "Thy Flesh Consumed", was added in an expanded version of the game, _The Ultimate Doom_. The game itself contains very few plot elements, with the minimal story instead given in the instruction manual and short text segues between episodes.

In the year 2019, the player character (an unnamed space marine) has been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a superior officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The space marines act as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation's radioactive waste facilities, which are used by the military to perform secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. In 2022, Deimos disappears entirely and "something fraggin' evil" starts pouring out of the teleporter gateways, killing or possessing all personnel. The Martian marine unit is dispatched to investigate, with the player character left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside the base and is killed.

As the last man standing, the player character fights through the onslaught of demonic enemies to keep them from attacking Earth. In "Knee-Deep in the Dead", he fights through the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters. In "The Shores of Hell" he fights through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic Cyberdemon, the marine discovers the vanished moon is floating above Hell. "Inferno" begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. A hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has "proven too tough for Hell to contain". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in _The Ultimate Doom_ as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for _Doom II: Hell on Earth_. In "Thy Flesh Consumed", the marine fights the demons on Earth through a variety of disconnected high-tech bases and demonic temples, though ultimately the forces of Hell prevail in the invasion of Earth.


Development

Concept

In May 1992, id Software released _Wolfenstein 3D_, later called the "grandfather of 3D shooters",[11][12] specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.[13][14][15][16] Immediately following its release most of the id Software team began work on a set of episodes for the game, titled _Spear of Destiny_, while id co-founder and lead programmer John Carmack instead focused on technology research for the company's next game. Following the release of _Spear of Destiny_ in September 1992, the team began to plan their next title. They wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing, but were largely tired of _Wolfenstein_. They initially considered making another game in the _Commander Keen_ series, as proposed by co-founder and lead designer Tom Hall, but decided that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id, designer John Romero and lead artist Adrian Carmack, wanted to create something in a darker style than the _Keen_ games. John Carmack then came up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaigns the team played, combining the styles of _Evil Dead II_ and _Aliens_.[17][18] The concept originally had a working title of "Green and Pissed", but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film _The Color of Money_: "'What's in the case?' / 'In here? Doom.'"[19][20]

The team agreed to pursue the _Doom_ concept, and development began in November 1992.[21] The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud, and designer Hall.[22] They moved offices to a dark office building, which they named "Suite 666", and drew inspiration from the noises coming from the dentist's office next door. They also decided to cut ties with Apogee Software, their previous publisher, and to instead self-publish _Doom_.[23]

Development

in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]] Early in development, rifts in the team began to appear. At the end of November, Hall delivered a design document, which he named the _Doom Bible_, that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project.[24] His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal that aliens emerge from. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design over the course of the game.[25] John Carmack not only disliked the idea but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: "Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important." Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on the technological innovations of the game, dropping the levels and episodes of _Wolfenstein_ in favor of a fast, continuous world. Tom disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack.[26] Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the _Doom Bible_ to work with Carmack's technological ideas.[27] Hall was forced to rework it again in December, however, after the team decided that they were unable to create a single, seamless world with the hardware limitations of the time, which contradicted much of the document.[28]

At the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall's story about fighting off demons while "knee-deep in the dead". The press release proclaimed the new game features that John Carmack had created, as well as other features, including multiplayer gaming features, that had not yet even been designed.[29] Early versions of the game were built to match the _Doom Bible_; a "pre-alpha" version of the first level included Hall's introductory base scene.[30] Initial versions of the game also retain "arcade" elements present in _Wolfenstein 3D_, like score points and score items, but those were removed early in development as they were out of tone.[31] Other elements, such as a complex user interface, an inventory system, a secondary shield protection, and lives were modified and slowly removed over the course of development.[32][33]

in 2004|upright]] Soon, however, the _Doom Bible_ as a whole was rejected: Romero wanted a game even "more brutal and fast" than _Wolfenstein_, which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all.[34] Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the game design was removed.[35] By early 1993, levels were being created for the game and a demo was produced. John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs were uninspiring, too similar to _Wolfenstein_, and did not show off the engine's capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels for the game, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.[36][37]

Hall was upset with the reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer.[38][39] He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work.[40] In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee.[41] He was replaced in September, ten weeks before the game was released, by game designer Sandy Petersen.[42][43] The team also added a third programmer, Dave Taylor.[44] Petersen and Romero designed the rest of _Doom_{{'}}s levels with different aims: the team believed that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting.[45] In late 1993, after the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player multiplayer games matches, which Romero termed "deathmatch".[46] According to Romero, the game's deathmatch mode was inspired by fighting games such as _Street Fighter II_, _Fatal Fury_, and _Art of Fighting_.[47]

Engine

computer]] _Doom_ was programmed largely in the ANSI C programming language, with a few elements done in assembly language. Development was done on NeXT computers running the NeXTSTEP operating system.[48] The data used by the game engine, including both level designs and graphics files, are all stored in WAD files, short for "Where's All the Data". This allows for any part of the game's design to be easily changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system specifically to enable fans to be able to easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of _Wolfenstein 3D_, and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure along with releasing the map editor online.[49]

Unlike _Wolfenstein_, which had flat levels with walls at right angles, the _Doom_ engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height, though two traversable areas can not be on top of each other. The lighting system was based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly: rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using ray tracing, the game calculates the "light level" of a small section of a level based on its distance from light sources. It then modifies the color palette of that section's surface textures to mimic how dark it would look.[50] This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.[51] Romero came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine such as strobe lights.[52] He also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms.[53][54] After Romero's level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use binary space partitioning to quickly select the portion of a level that the player could see at an given time.[55][56][57] Taylor, along with programming other features into the game, added cheat codes; some, such as 'idspispopd', were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting the game.[58]

Adrian Carmack was the lead artist for _Doom_, with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be "nightmarish"; their intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered, so a mixed media approach was taken to the artwork.[59] The artists sculpted models of some the enemies, and took pictures of them in stop motion from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game; the images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack.[60] Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons, and had Gregor Punchatz build latex and metal sculptures of the others.[61][62] The weapons were toys, with parts combined from different toys to make more guns.[63] They scanned themselves as well, using Cloud's arm as the model for the player character's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in-game textures.[64]

Like they had for _Wolfenstein 3D_, id hired composer Bobby Prince to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in techno and metal styles; many of the songs were directly inspired by songs from popular metal bands such as Alice in Chains and Pantera.[65][66] Prince himself believed that more ambient music would work better for the game and produced numerous tracks in both styles in the hopes of convincing the team; Romero, however, still liked the metal tracks and put both styles in the game.[67] Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed; instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Unlike the music, the sound effects for the enemies and weapons were created by Prince for specific purposes; Prince designed them based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon, and then adjusted the sound effects to match the completed animations.[68] The sound effects for the monsters were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sound effects to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sound effects were playing at once.[69][70]


Release

Because id planned to self-publish the game, as the game neared completion they had to set up the systems to sell the game. Jay Wilbur, who had been brought on as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of _Doom_. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game, and as id would make the most money off of copies they sold directly to customers—up to 85 percent of the planned price—he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible, buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he reached out directly to software retailers, offering them copies of the first _Doom_ episode for free, allowing them to charge any price for it, in order to spur customer interest in buying the full game directly from id.[71]

_Doom_{{'}}s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop on the game, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that working on the game gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the development team at id uploaded the first episode of the game to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to—the University of Wisconsin–Parkside FTP network—that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network.[72]

Expansions and ports

The popularity of _Doom_ led to the development of an expanded version, _The Ultimate Doom_ (1995), which includes a fourth episode.[73] Additionally, numerous ports of the game have been released by other companies. An unofficial port of _Doom_ to Linux was released by id programmer Dave Taylor in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official.[74] Official ports of _Doom_ were released for Sega 32X, Atari Jaguar, and Mac OS in 1994, SNES and PlayStation in 1995, 3DO in 1996, Sega Saturn in 1997, Acorn Risc PC in 1998, Game Boy Advance in 2001, Xbox 360 in 2006, and iOS in 2009. A notable exception in the list of official ports is the Amiga platform, there is no official port of _Doom_ for AmigaOS due to the antiquated nature of Amigas graphics hardware at the time of the games initial release, despite the popularity of the platform among gamers at the time.[75][76][77] Some of these were bestsellers even many years after the initial release.[78] _Doom_ has additionally been ported unofficially to numerous platforms; so many ports exist, including esotera such as smart thermostats and oscilloscopes, that variations on "It runs _Doom_" or "Can it run _Doom_?" are long-running phrases.[79][80][81]

Mods

The ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game using WAD files turned out to be a popular aspect of _Doom_. Gaining the first large mod-making community, _Doom_ affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional game designers started their careers making _Doom_ WADs as a hobby, among them Tim Willits, who later became the lead designer at id Software.

The first level editors appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into _Doom_ WADs by fans, including _Aliens_, _Star Wars_, _The Simpsons_, _South Park_, _Sailor Moon_, _Dragon Ball Z_, _Pokémon_, _Beavis and Butt-head_, _Batman_, and _Sonic the Hedgehog_.[82] Some works, like the _Theme Doom Patch_, combined enemies from several films, such as _Aliens_, _Predator_, and _The Terminator_. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.

Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over bulletin board systems or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. FTP servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the _Master Levels for Doom II_, which was released in 1995 along with _Maximum Doom_, a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the _idgames_ FTP archive contains over 18,000 files,[83] and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of _Doom_ fans. Third party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a DOS game and all commands had to be entered on the command line to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, WizardWorks released the _D!Zone_ pack featuring hundreds of levels for _Doom_ and _Doom II_.[84] _D!Zone_ was reviewed in _Dragon_ by Jay & Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.[85]

In 2016, John Romero created and published two new Doom levels - E1M4b ("_Phobo's Mission Control_") and E1M8b ("_Tech Gone Bad_").[86][87]

In 2018, for the 25th anniversary of DOOM, Romero announced an unofficial 5th Episodic pack of 9 levels. The 5th episode is titled _Sigil of the Baphomet_. The music for the 5th episode is composed entirely by Buckethead.[88]


Reception

Within hours of _Doom_{{'}}s release, university networks were banning _Doom_ multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.[89] After being alerted by network administrators the morning after release that the game's deathmatch network connection setup was crippling some computer networks, John Carmack quickly released a patch to change it, though many administrators had to implement _Doom_-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing due to the overwhelming traffic.[90] The game became a major problem at workplaces, both occupying the time of employees and clogging computer networks. Intel,[91] Lotus Development, and Carnegie Mellon University were among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing _Doom_-playing during work hours. At the Microsoft campus, _Doom_ was by one account equal to a "religious phenomenon".[92] Doom was #1 on _Computer Gaming World_{{'}}s "Playing Lately?" survey for February 1994. One reader said that "No other game even compares to the addictiveness of NetDoom with four devious players! ... The only game I've stayed up 72+ straight hours to play", while another reported that "Linking four people together for a game of Doom is the quickest way to destroy a productive, boring evening of work".[93]

, Bill Gates, aware of the video game's popularity, showcased a video presentation while digitally superimposed into _Doom_]] In late 1995, _Doom_ was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system Windows 95 even with its million-dollar advertising campaigns.[94] Microsoft hired id Software to port Doom to Windows with the WinG API,[95] and Bill Gates briefly considered buying the company.[96] Microsoft developed a Windows 95 port of _Doom_ to promote the operating system as a gaming platform. The development team in this effort was led by then-employee Gabe Newell.[97] One Windows 95 promotional video had Bill Gates digitally superimposed into the game.[98]

Although Petersen said that it was "nothing more than the computer equivalent of Whack-A-Mole",[99] _Doom_ received critical acclaim and was widely praised in the gaming press, broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. Upon release, _GamesMaster_ gave it a 90% rating.[100] _Dragon_ gave it five stars, praising the improvements over _Wolfenstein 3D_, the "fast-moving arcade shoot 'em up" gameplay, and network play.[101] A common criticism of _Doom_ was that it was not a true 3D game, since the game engine did not allow corridors and rooms to be stacked on top of one another (room-over-room), and instead relied on graphical trickery to make it appear that the player character and enemies were moving along differing elevations.[102]

_Computer Gaming World_ stated in February 1994 that _Wolfenstein 3D_ fans should "look forward to a delight of insomnia", and "Since networking is supported, bring along a friend to share in the visceral delights".[103] A longer review in March 1994 said that _Doom_ "was worth the wait ... a wonderfully involved and engaging game", and its technology "a new benchmark" for the gaming industry. The reviewer praised the "simply _dazzling_" graphics", and reported that "DeathMatches may be the most intense gaming experience available today". While criticizing the "ho-hum endgame" with a too-easy end boss, he concluded that _Doom_ "is a virtuoso performance".[104]

_Edge_ criticized the "fairly simple" gameplay but praised the graphics and levels. The review concluded: "You’lI be longing for something new in this game. If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now, that would be interesting."[105] The sentiment attracted widespread mockery, and "if only you could talk to these creatures" became a running joke in gamer culture; however, a 2016 piece in the _International Business Times_ defended the review as anticipating the dialogue systems of games such as _Skyrim_, _Mass Effect_ and _Undertale_.[106]

In 1994, _PC Gamer UK_ named _Doom_ the third best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, "Although it's only been around for a couple of months, _Doom_ has already done more to establish the PC's arcade clout than any other title in gaming history."[107] In 1994 _Computer Gaming World_ named _Doom_ Game of the Year.[108]

In 1995, _Next Generation_ said it was "The most talked about PC game ever – and with good reason. Running on a 486 machine (essential for maximum effect), _Doom_ took PC graphics to a totally new level of speed, detail, and realism, and provided a genuinely scary degree of immersion in the gameworld."[109]

In 1996, _Computer Gaming World_ named it the fifth best video game of all time,[110] and the third most-innovative game.[111]

In 1998, _PC Gamer_ declared it the 34th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it "Probably the most imitated game of all time, _Doom_ continued what _Wolfenstein 3D_ began and elevated the fledgling 3D-shooter genre to blockbuster status".[112]

In 2001, _Doom_ was voted the number one game of all time in a poll among over 100 game developers and journalists conducted by GameSpy.[113]

In 2003, IGN ranked it as the 44th top video game of all time and also called it "_the_ breakthrough game of 1993", adding: "Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and BFG), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years."[114] _PC Gamer_ proclaimed _Doom_ the most influential game of all time in its ten-year anniversary issue in April 2004.

In 2004, readers of _Retro Gamer_ voted _Doom_ as the ninth top retro game, with the editors commenting: "Only a handful of games can claim that they've changed the gaming world, and _Doom_ is perhaps the most qualified of them all."[115] In 2005, IGN ranked it as the 39th top game.[116]

On March 12, 2007, _The New York Times_ reported that _Doom_ was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon.[117] The Library of Congress took up this video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list.[118][119]

In 2009, GameTrailers ranked _Doom_ as number one "breakthrough PC game".[120] That year _Game Informer_ put _Doom_ sixth on the magazine's list of the games of all time, stating that it gave "the genre the kick start it needed to rule the gaming landscape two decades later."[121] _Game Informer_ staff also put it sixth on their 2001 list of the 100 best games ever.[122] IGN included _Doom_ at 2nd place in the _Top 100 Video Game Shooters of all Time_, just behind _Half-Life_, citing the game's "feel of running and gunning", memorable weapons and enemies, pure and simple fun and its spreading on nearly every gaming platform in existence.[123]

In 2012, _Time_ named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time as "it established the look and feel of later shooters as surely as Xerox PARC established the rules of the virtual desktop," adding that "its impact also owes a lot to the gonzo horror sensibility of its designers, including John Romero, who showed a bracing lack of restraint in their deployment of gore and Satanic iconography."[124] Including _Doom_ on the list of the greatest games of all time, GameSpot wrote that "despite its numerous appearances in other formats and on other media, longtime fans will forever remember the original 1993 release of _Doom_ as the beginning of a true revolution in action gaming."[125]

The game was ported to numerous console gaming platforms both domestically and abroad where it maintained its popularity, receiving generally favorable critical reception.[126][127][128]

Commercial and spreading performance

With the release of _Doom_, id Software, quickly found itself making $100,000 daily.[129] Sandy Petersen later remarked that the game "sold a couple of hundred thousand copies during its first year or so", as piracy kept its initial sales from rising higher.[130] Experts estimate that the game sold approximately 2-3 million physical copies from its release through 1999.[131][132] According to PC Data, which tracked sales in the United States, the _Doom_ shareware edition sold 1.15 million copies by September 1999. The _Ultimate Doom_ SKU reached sales of 787,397 units by that date. At the time, PC Data ranked them as the country's eighth- and 20th-best-selling computer games since January 1993.[133] In addition to its sales, the game's status as shareware dramatically increased its market penetration. _PC Zone_{{'}}s David McCandless wrote that the game was played by "an estimated six million people across the globe",[134] while other sources estimate that 10–20 million people played _Doom_ within 24 months of its launch.[135]

Controversies

_Doom_ was notorious for its high levels of graphic violence[136] and satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. _Doom_ for the Genesis 32X was among one of the first video games to be given an M for Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board due to its violent gore and nature.[137] Yahoo! Games listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.[138] It was criticized by religious organizations for its diabolic undertones and was dubbed a "mass murder simulator" by critic and Killology Research Group founder David Grossman.[139] _Doom_ prompted fears that the then-emerging virtual reality technology could be used to simulate extremely realistic killing.

The game again sparked controversy throughout a period of school shootings in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be "like playing _Doom_", and "it'll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, World War II, Vietnam, _Duke Nukem_ and _Doom_ all mixed together", and that his shotgun was "straight out of the game".[140] A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a _Doom_ level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design _Doom_ levels, which later became known as the 'Harris levels', none have been found to be based on Columbine High School.

In the release versions before 1.2-1.4, the game has been banned in Germany due to a swastika in E1M4. The ban was lifted after id Software changed the _Swastika_, and said that "it was the homage of _Wolfenstein 3D_".


Legacy

_Doom_ franchise

_Doom_ has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a _Doom_ comic book, four novels by Dafydd Ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a _Doom_ board game and a live-action film starring Karl Urban and The Rock released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book _Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture_ by David Kushner.

The _Doom_ series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when _Doom 3_ would finally be announced. A retelling of the original _Doom_ using entirely new graphics technology and a slower pace survival horror approach, _Doom 3_ was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004, under the id Tech 4 game engine.

The series would again remain dormant for 10 years until a remake, simply titled _Doom_ and running on the new id Tech 6, was announced with a beta access to players that had pre-ordered _Wolfenstein: The New Order_. The game held its closed alpha multiplayer testing in October 2015, as closed and open beta access ran during March to April 2016. Returning to the series' roots in fast-paced action and minimal storytelling, the full game eventually released worldwide on May 13, 2016. The project initially started as _Doom 4_ in May 2008, set to be a remake of _Doom II: Hell on Earth_ and ditching the survival horror aspect of _Doom 3_. Development completely restarted as id's Tim Willits remarked that _Doom 4_ was "lacking the personality of the long-running shooter franchise".[141]

Clones

" was initially popular to describe the style of gameplay in _Doom_-like games, but was gradually replaced by "first-person shooter" after 1996. By 1998, the phrase "first-person shooter" had firmly superseded "_Doom_ clone".]] _Doom_ was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following _Doom_{{'s}} release, and they were often referred to as "_Doom_ clones" rather than "first-person shooters". The term "_Doom_ clone" was used to describe the style of gameplay in _Doom_-like games. While the term was initially popular, it was, after 1996, gradually replaced by "first-person shooter", and the phrase "first-person shooter" had firmly superseded "_Doom_ clone" around 1998. Some of these were certainly "clones", hastily assembled and quickly forgotten, while others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in _Doom_ such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. _Doom_{{'s}} principal rivals were Apogee's _Rise of the Triad_ and Looking Glass Studios' _System Shock_. The popularity of _Star Wars_-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted LucasArts to create their first-person shooter _Dark Forces_.[142]

The _Doom_ game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies, who released their own games using the technology, including _Heretic_, _Hexen: Beyond Heretic_, _Strife: Quest for the Sigil_, and _Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill_. A _Doom_-based game called _Chex Quest_ was released in 1996 by Ralston Foods as a promotion to increase cereal sales,[143] and the United States Marine Corps released _Marine Doom_.

When 3D Realms released _Duke Nukem 3D_ in 1996, a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on Ken Silverman's technologically similar _Build_ engine, id Software was nearly finished developing _Quake_, its next-generation game, which mirrored _Doom_{{'}}s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and reduced interest in its predecessor. (Wolfenstein 3D)

Community

In addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the deathmatch mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. _Doom_ was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode; _Maze War_, an FPS released in 1974, was running multiplayer deathmatch over ethernet on Xerox computers by 1977. The widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence in _Doom_ made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was possible over a phone line by using a modem, or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Because of its widespread distribution, _Doom_ hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term "deathmatch".[144]

Although the popularity of the _Doom_ games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game still retains a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and _Doom_-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as Doomworld. Interest in _Doom_ was renewed in 1997, when the source code for the _Doom_ engine was released (it was also placed under the GNU General Public License on October 3, 1999). Fans then began porting the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the Dreamcast. As for the PC, over 50 different _Doom_ source ports have been developed. New features such as OpenGL rendering and scripting allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.

Devoted players have spent years creating speedruns for _Doom_, competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit bugs in the _Doom_ engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both _Doom_ and _Doom II_ on the "Ultra-Violence" difficulty setting in less than 30 minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete _Doom II_ in a single run on the difficulty setting "Nightmare!", on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30 seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as "[just having to be] impossible").[145] Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.[146]

Online co-op and deathmatch play are still continued on fan created services.
