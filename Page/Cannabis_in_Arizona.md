Medical marijuana

Proposition 200 (1996)

in 1996, 65% of Arizona voters approved Proposition 200, a drug policy reform initiative containing a provision allowing the use of cannabis with a doctor's prescription.[1] The medical cannabis portion of the initiative was then essentially repealed by state legislators a few months later,[2] but the change was rejected by voters in a 1998 veto referendum (Proposition 300).[3] Ultimately the medical cannabis provision was ineffective, however, due to language that created significant conflict with federal law (use of the word "prescribe" instead of "recommend").[4]

Proposition 203 (2002)

Proposition 203 in 2002 to legalize the medical use of cannabis failed with 42.7% of the vote.[5]

Proposition 203 (2010)

Proposition 203 in 2010 to legalize the medical use of cannabis passed with 50.1% of the vote.[6] In 2012, the Arizona legislature passed a law that sought to forbid the access to medical cannabis on college campuses. However, in May 2018, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that this restriction was unconstitutional.[7]


Recreational cannabis

Proposition 205 (2016)

Proposition 205 in 2016 to legalize the recreational use of cannabis failed with 48.7% of the vote[8][9]

Among the largest contributors to defeat of the initiative (Proposition 205) were Discount Tire ($1 million), Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry ($918,000), Sheldon Adelson ($500,000), and Insys Therapeutics ($500,000).[10]


Advocacy

Opposition

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery is a leading opponent to cannabis reform efforts in the state of Arizona. He has made a number of controversial comments on the subject, including telling a military veteran who spoke in support of cannabis legalization "I have no respect for you... because youâ€™re an enemy".[11] Montgomery has also engaged in a multi-year legal battle seeking to overturn the state's medical marijuana law that was approved by voters in 2010.[12]
