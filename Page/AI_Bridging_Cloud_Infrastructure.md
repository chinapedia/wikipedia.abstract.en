AI BRIDGING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE (ABCI) is a planned supercomputer being built at the University of Tokyo for use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.[1][2] It is being built by Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. ABCI is expected to be completed in first quarter 2018 with a planned performance of 130Â petaFLOPS. Power consumption is targeting 3 megawatts, and a planned power usage effectiveness of 1.1. If performance meets expectations, ABCI would be the second most powerful supercomputer built, surpassing the current leader Sunway TaihuLight's 93 petaflops.[3] But still behind the Summit (supercomputer).


History

Bidding for ABCI design and construction is expected to close in December 2016, with construction to begin in 2017.[4]

In October 11, 2017 it was announced that Fujitsu got the contract for building ABCI.[5]


Design

The design of the ABCI is to be focused on low precision floating point, big data, and artificial intelligence applications; rather than Linpack performance.[6]


Projects

The ABCI is planned to be available to Japanese corporations, small businesses, and researchers; reducing their dependence on foreign cloud computing providers such as Microsoft and Google.[7]
