ZHENG CHURAN (born c.1989) is a Chinese women's rights activist and feminist. Together with four other activists, she was detained, in March 2015, shortly before events planned for International Women's Day.[1] They are collectively known as the Feminist Five. In November 2016, she became one of the BBC's 100 Women 2016.[2]


Protest

In 2015, she and four other activists (Wei Tingting, Wang Man, Wu Rongrong, and Li Tingting, collectively known as the "Gang of Five"[3]) were detained by the Chinese government just prior to International Women's Day, the day they planned to execute a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation.[4] All five women were released a few days later.[5] Had they been convicted, the women could have faced up to three years in prison for "creating a disturbance".[6]

The BBC highlights Zheng's contributions to organizing events, her support for women's rights, and for LGBT. She is also reported to have fought for women to be given menstrual leave.[7]

In December 2016, Zheng wrote an open letter to Donald Trump warning him to avoid sexist behaviour in the future.[8]

She and Xiao Meili operate an online store selling original designs about feminism on Taobao called 独品商店 (Dupinshangdian).

In 2018, she was the plantiff in a defamation case against 酷玩实验室, a Chinese independent media platform. They had previously accused Zheng Churan of running an international sex trafficking.[9] The case remains ongoing.

Zheng Churan continues to be a outspoken activist and prolific writer for feminist, LGBTQIA+, and human rights issues.[10][11]


Arrest of Wei Zhili

On March 20, 2019 at around 2 a.m., Wei Zhili, a pneumoconiosis workers activist and journalist and Zheng Churan's husband, was taken away by police. He was accused of "disturbing public order" and needing "education" after being "brainwashed".[12] He worked with Chinese laborers stricken with pneumoconiosis from unsafe working conditions to obtain government compensation.[13] For days after Wei Zhili's arrest, his wife and parents were not informed of his whereabouts.
