JOHN FINK (born February 11, 1940) is an American film and television actor.

In the 1970-1971 the NBC sitcom _Nancy_, Fink was cast as an Iowa veterinarian, Dr. Adam Hudson, who marries the daughter of the President of the United States. The short-lived series starred Renne Jarrett (born 1946) as the title character and Celeste Holm and Robert F. Simon in supporting roles.

He is known for his roles in two _Batman_ movies, _Batman Forever_ (1995) and _Batman & Robin_ (1997), and his other film credits include _Loving_ (1970), _The Carey Treatment_ (1972), _Home for the Holidays_ (1972), _The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case_ (1976), _Flatliners_ (1990), _What's Love Got to Do with It_ (1993) and _The Client_ (1994). He has also had minor roles in _Saved by the Bell_, _Ally McBeal_, _McMillan & Wife_, _Columbo_, and various other series since the 1970s.

While he was billed as a supporting actor in the 1978 _Battlestar Galactica_ pilot, a majority of his scenes were cut mainly because those scenes dealt with Serina's (Jane Seymour) "space cancer" B-story which had been excised from the final cut.
