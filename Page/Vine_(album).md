_VINE_ is an album by jazz saxophonist Chris Cheek. It was released by Fresh Sound New Talent.


Music and recording

The album was recorded at Avatar Studios, New York City, on December 20 and 21, 1999.[1] Mehldau plays Fender Rhodes instead of piano on five of the eight tracks.[2]

"So It Seems" has "winding melodies over a double-time feel and space-age chords that suggest club genres such as jungle and drum-n-bass."[3]


Reception

The AllMusic reviewer believed that Cheek's "sophistication as a writer takes a giant leap with _Vine_, his best album to date".[4]
