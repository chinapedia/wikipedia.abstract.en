Late in the round 15 match against , Logue gave away a crucial 50-metre penalty after he failed to correctly return the ball to Nick Riewoldt, who had fooled Logue into thinking that he had taken a mark inside forward 50; in fact, it was Tim Membrey who took the mark, and he would later kick a goal from the 50-metre penalty to give his side a nine-point win.[3][4] Logue later was criticised by coach Ross Lyon following the incident, being told to "sharpen up".[5]
