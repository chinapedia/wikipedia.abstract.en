Plot

In Britain, a virus has swept the country, turning people into zombies. The virus has spread from a breakout from a prison in the south of England. A squad of 8 combined special forces (British and American) goes into the quarantine zone to fetch out a scientist who is meant to have the possibility of making a cure. There are four possible locations he might be in. The group, made up of Perez, Paige, Rodrigo and several others, enter the first location by assault craft on the river. The encounter the first zombies and discover that they are not like the normal zombie genre and are more intelligent, utilizing items they would do in normal life, (postman delivering letters, traffic warden giving out tickets) but some are also able to fight back. The first location is overrun by zombies and they manage to fight their way out and find some combat vehicles that they use to get to the second location - a set of high rise flats. (Enroute they pass two teenage schoolgirls shouting for help from a house roof, but they carry on past).

The flats are over run with zombies and they make it to the room they need on the nearly top floor, the scientist not there again, but disaster soon strikes, when the biggest guy on the team, Jacob, is bitten during a struggle. Jacob commits suicide via gunshot, after Perez made the suggestion to kill him before he turned - as a mercy killing. They spent the night at the flats.

They have to abandon the vehicles heading for the third location, when they come across two stranded but seemingly innocent people on a road, next to a parked car, who are then shot to death, and this confuses Reeves, who then fights with Perez. Perez notices unseen assailants shoot at Reeves, fatally (this group is lead by one of the original prisoners who escaped during the prison riot). Unfortunately, the group has to retreat. Perez is affected by this, and keeps his dog tags.

They spot vehicles full of zombie soldiers who are highly intelligent with full use of their weapons and some sense of order. they hide out amongst a pile of dead zombie corpses, but the youngest soldier is captured and taken away on a truck. They follow the vehicles using the tracking signal from the captured soldier and discover a zombie army camp where there are a large number of zombie soldiers fully kitted out in NBC (Nuclear Biological and Chemical) hazmat suits and automatic rifles (Most seem to be British soldiers with SA80s). They discover their missing soldier being held in a container with other survivors - including the two girls from earlier and the scientist they are looking for.

After rescuing everyone in the container, they are confronted by the zombie soldiers and a firefight occurs with many survivors being killed by the zombies shooting them. (Unfortunately the elder girl is attacked and overrun by the zombies and they have to leave her behind). After managing to get away, they found out the scientist they picked up is claiming to know of a cure, but he is not very co-operative. He is severely beaten.

Meanwhile the Army Officer who sent them on the mission discusses the outbreak with the rest of his command staff and it turns out that his own son is infected and that they are still experimenting on other zombies.

After the group find somewhere to hold up to rest for a while, Paige admits to Rodrigo (her boyfriend) that she became infected during an earlier fight when some contaminated blood got in her mouth. He shares a passionate kiss with her anyway, knowing he will be infected like her. They stay behind from the group and head off into the countryside. They also discover that the girl might be immune to the virus.

Later, the group is down to three soldiers, the scientist and the young girl. They arrived at the pickup point where the Officer tells them that he has had to kill his son and there is no cure. The Officer blamed the scientist and would like a revenge. He then shoots the scientist and gets back to the helicopter whilst a firefight ensues between his security detail and the survivors. Perez is injured and the young soldier leaves after it turned out he was helping the officer with gathering intelligence due to being blackmailed as they were holding his parents captive. Perez decides to stay behind, to fight a horde, but is outmatched and devoured.

The captain and the girl are captured by the prison group and it turns out that the little girl is the daughter of the leader of the rioters who died after escaping earlier in the film. The captain decides to try to get to the free zone and goes to get help from a group of armed survivors who are near the border. They meet the survivors and discover the young soldier with them. The captain explains about the plan to bomb the quarantine zone and they agree to help him try to get to the border.

At the border they fight a very large group of zombies and are joined by the prison gang who decided to come and help after all. Once they get through to the border crossing, the Officer arrives and tells his men to kill everyone but a fight ensues between him and the captain (who has been bitten and turned into a zombie), the captain still attains a high level of function and kills the officer.

The film ends with the last of the two making it to a beach, but their ordeal may not be over with just yet.
