TORREBLANCA is a Mexican rock and pop band based in Mexico City led by musician and composer Juan Manuel Torreblanca.[1]


History

In 2007, Juan Manuel Torreblanca was selected by the Red Bull Music Academy to participate in forums and workshops in Toronto, Canada, where he also made several concerts. In 2008, Juan Manuel participated in the Sónar Festival. After the festival, he decided to form a band to make a new musical proposal.[2] Through MySpace he met Alejandro Balderas, who plays the flute, saxophones, clarinet and the transverse flute. Also they invited Jerson Vázquez on the drums and Carlos Zavala "El Abuelo" on bass, with whom Juan Manuel had fprmed previously the group _Un Teni._[3]

The new band with the name _Torreblanca_, taken from the last name of Juan Manuel, published an EP, _Defense_, with four songs, co-produced by Arturo "Turra" Medina and León Polar, LoBlondo from Hello Seahorse! and Natalia Lafourcade. After listening to them at Vive Latino festival, Quique Rangel from Café Tacuba decided to be the producer of their first LP, _Bella época_.[4][5]

In 2012 the song "Roma" was the theme of a Telcel ad campaign.[6] In 2014 Torreblanca published another production, _El polvo en la luz_ produced by Hector Castillo, receiving good critics.
