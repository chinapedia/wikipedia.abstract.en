Admiral SIR JOHN FORSTER "SANDY" WOODWARD (1 May 1932 – 4 August 2013) was a British admiral who commanded the British Naval Task Force in the South Atlantic during the Falklands War.


Early life

Woodward was born on 1 May 1932 at Penzance, Cornwall, to a bank clerk. He was educated at Stubbington House School, preparatory school in Stubbington, Hampshire. He then continued his education at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon.[1] Woodward married, in 1960, Charlotte McMurtrie (with whom he had a son and a daughter), but in 1993 they separated.[2]


Naval career

Having graduated from the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, Woodward joined the Royal Navy in 1946.[3] He became a submariner in 1954, and was promoted to lieutenant that May.[4][5] In 1960 he passed the Royal Navy's rigorous Submarine Command Course known as _The Perisher_,[6] and received his first command, the T Class submarine HMS _Tireless_.[7] Promoted to lieutenant-commander in May 1962,[8] he then commanded HMS _Grampus_[9] before becoming the second in command of the nuclear fleet submarine HMS _Valiant_.[10] In 1967, he was promoted to commander and became the Instructor (known as _Teacher_) of The Perisher Course. He took command of HMS _Warspite_ in December 1969.[11] He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1972.[12] In 1974, he became Captain of Submarine Training and in 1976 he took command of HMS _Sheffield_.[13]

He became Head of Naval Plans in the Ministry of Defence in 1978.[14] In July 1981, he was promoted to rear admiral and appointed as Flag Officer First Flotilla.[15]

Falklands War

In 1982, he commanded the _Hermes_ aircraft carrier group, Task Group 317.8, in the Falklands War.[16] (The Commander-in-Chief Fleet Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, served as the Task Force commander, CTF-317. The task group containing the amphibious ships which launched the actual invasion TG 317.0 was commanded by Commodore Michael Clapp, with Task Group 317.1 being the landing force itself.)

He worked out the timetable for the campaign, starting from the end and working to the start. Knowing that the Argentine forces had to be defeated before the (Southern Hemisphere) winter made conditions too bad, he set a latest date by which the land forces had to be ashore, that in turn set a latest date by which control of the air had to be achieved, and so on.[17]

Possibly the best known single incident was the sinking of the ARA _General Belgrano_. He knew that _General Belgrano_ (and particularly her Exocet armed escorts) were a threat to the task force and he ordered that she be sunk.[18] Admiral Sir George Zambellas credited "Woodward's inspirational leadership and tactical acumen ... [as] a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic".[19]

For his efforts during the war Woodward was knighted.[20] He wrote a book entitled _One Hundred Days_, co-authored by Patrick Robinson, describing his Falklands experiences.

Later career

In 1983, Woodward was appointed Flag Officer Submarines and NATO Commander Submarines Eastern Atlantic.[21] In 1984, he was promoted to vice admiral, and in 1985 he was Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments).[22] Before retirement in 1989 he also served, from 1987, as Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command[23] and Flag Aide-de-Camp to the Queen.

They were well received and were updated in 2003 and 2012 with updated recollections as well as responses to the memoirs and responses made by Commodore Michael Clapp.[24] In his later life Woodward wrote various opinion pieces for British newspapers regarding defence matters, particularly the Strategic Defence and Security Review.[25]

Woodward died of a heart attack on 4 August 2013 in Bosham, West Sussex, England.[26][27][28][29]
