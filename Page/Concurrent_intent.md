CONCURRENT INTENT is when there is a specific intent to commit one crime, and at the same time (concurrently) an intent to commit another.[1] An example is when a perpetrator plants a bomb or shoots an automatic weapon in a crowded place, with an intent to kill a specified target, the perpetrator can be found to have a concurrent intent to kill others who are not specifically targeted, but who are in the kill zone.[2] Cases de, fining concurrent intent in common law include _People v. Stone_ (2009) and _People v. Bland_ (2002), each of which involve a drive-by shooting into a crowd.[3]
