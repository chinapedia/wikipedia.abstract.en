After the war he settled in Bend, and became a professional writer, publishing 74 novels under various names, including one, _Range Boss_ (Pocket Books, 1949), that was the first work of fiction issued in paperback, without having first appeared in hardcovers.[9]

In 1952 Newton was one of the six founder members of Western Writers of America, Inc., serving as its first secretary-treasurer, and as a board member for ten years.[10]

In the late 1950s, Newton moved to Hollywood to work as a writer and story consultant for several television shows, before returning to Bend in 1965.[11]

During the 1970s, he gave classes in fiction writing at Central Oregon Community College, and at the Haystack summer school at Cannon Beach.[12]
