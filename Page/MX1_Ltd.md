History

RRsat was founded by David Rivel, an electronics, computers and communications engineer in 1981 as a communications provider, and in 2014 changed its name to RR Media to reflect its expanding global service offering.[25] In 2015, RR Media acquired Eastern Space Systems (ESS), a Romanian provider of content management and content distribution services[26] and satellite transmission services provider, SatLink Communications.[27]

Digital Playout Centre GmbH (DPC) was founded in 1996 by German media company, Kirch to provide playout, multiplexing, satellite uplinks and other broadcast services to Kirch's Premiere pay-TV platform (now Sky Deutschland) and other private and public German broadcasters. In 2005, SES Astra (a subsidiary of SES Global, now SES) bought 100% of DPC from Premiere[28] and the company renamed ASTRA Platform Services GmbH (APS).[29] In 2012, to reflect the company's expanding worldwide reach, the name was changed to SES Platform Services.[30]

In February 2016, it was announced that SES Platform Services had agreed, subject to regulatory approvals, to purchase RR Media.[31] The acquisition was completed in July 2016, with the merged company renamed MX1 and headed by Avi Cohen, the former CEO of RR Media.[32] In October 2017, Cohen was replaced as CEO by Wilfred Urner, the former CEO of SES Platform Services, CEO of SES subsidiary, HD+ and Head of Media Platforms and Product Development, SES Video.[33]
