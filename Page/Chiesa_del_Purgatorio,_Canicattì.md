The CHIESA DEL PURGATORIO is a Rococo-style, Roman Catholic church located on Piazza IV Novembre in the town of Canicattì, province of Agrigento, region of Sicily, Italy.


History

The site was occupied until 1798 by a prison. Construction of the church, or oratory, was patronized by Baron Gaetano Adamo and his brother Carlo; and construction was pursued from 1803 until 1806, when it was consecrated by the Bishop of Agrigento. Until 1880, it was occupied by the Confraternity del _Purgatorio_.

The façade is framed by pilasters and cornices of sandstone. The tympanum is crowned with decorative acroterial pyxes or urns. In the center is an oval window, surmounted by a medallion with a bas relief showing _Souls in Purgatory_ (1804) by Vincenzo Spinoso. Adajacent is a belltower embedded in a structure with a façade with niches and a statue.

The interior single nave is covered by a barrel vault. Many of the artworks are derived from other churches. In the choir are two altarpieces from the church of Santa Rosalia, depicting the martyrdoms of _St Bartholomew_ and _St Agatha_, both attributed to Gaetano Guadagnino.[1]
