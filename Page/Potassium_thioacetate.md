POTASSIUM THIOACETATE is an organosulfur compound and a salt with the formula CH₃COS^(−)K⁺. This white, water-soluble solid is used as a reagent for preparing thioacetate esters and other derivatives.[1]


Synthesis and reactions

Potassium thioacetate, which is commercially available, can be prepared by combining acetyl chloride and potassium hydrogen sulfide:

    CH₃COCl + 2 KSH → KCl + CH₃COSK + H₂S

It arises also by the neutralization of thioacetic acid with potassium hydroxide.


Use in preparation of thiols

In a common application, potassium thioacetate is combined with alkylating agents to give thioacetate esters:

    CH₃COSK + RX → CH₃COSR + KX (X = halide)

Hydrolysis of these esters affords thiols:

    CH₃COSR + H₂O → CH₃CO₂H + RSH

The thioacetate esters can also be cleaved with methanethiol in the presence of stoichiometric base, as illustrated in the preparation of 4-pentyne-1-thiol:[2]

    HC₂(CH₂)₃OMs + KSAc → HC₂(CH₂)₃SAc + KOMs
    HC₂(CH₂)₃SAc + HSMe → HC₂(CH₂)₃SH + MeSAc
