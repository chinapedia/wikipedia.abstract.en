The NORTH JERSEY SUPER FOOTBALL CONFERENCE is a football-only athletic league of high schools in New Jersey. The 115-team league was formed in 2016.[1][2]


Background

The NJSFC consists of nearly all of the football playing members of four conferences that were formed after a significant realignment in New Jersey high school athletics saw the creation of several new leagues.

The conferences that came together to form this league were:

-   The Big North Conference, which consists of many larger public and parochial schools in Passaic County and Bergen County.
-   The Hudson County Interscholastic League and the Super Essex Conference, which consist of schools entirely located within their respective counties regardless of size.
-   The Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference, which consists of schools located in Morris County, Sussex County and Warren County.

The league, which consists of over one hundred schools, is the largest such league in the United States.[3]

There are a total of six sections of the NJSFC, with most consisting of three or four divisions.
