The VALENTINE RIVER is a river in Cochrane District in northeastern Ontario, Canada.[1] It is in the James Bay drainage basin, and is a tributary of Lac Pivabiska, the source of the Pivabiska River.


Course

The Valentine River begins at Valentine Lake in geographic Stoddart Township[2] and flows northeast to take in the right tributary Little Valentine River. It heads north under Ontario Highway 11 and the Ontario Northland Railway Calstock–Cochrane branch (originally part of the National Transcontinental Railway), continues north to enter Fushimi Provincial Park, then arrives at Fushimi Lake as that lake's main tributary, where it enters geographic Bannerman Township[3] at the northeast of the lake. It leaves the park and lake at the northeast and heads east over The Chutes into Hanlan Lake, then southeast into geographic Hanlan Township[4] and past the settlement of Fontaine's Landing into Wolverine Lake. The river then continues east to its mouth at Lac Pivabiska, the source of the Pivabiska River. The Pivabiska River flows via the Missinaibi River and the Moose River to James Bay.
