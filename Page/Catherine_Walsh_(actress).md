CATHERINE WALSH (born 1970) is an Irish actor of stage and screen.


Early life

Born in Cork in 1970, Walsh was educated in the Presentation in the city. She was encouraged in her goal of becoming an actor. She auditioned for the National Youth Theatre and on the advise of one of her directors she then got training in theatre with the Samuel Beckett Centre, Trinity College Dublin.[1][2][3] Walsh's younger sister is the actor Eileen Walsh.[4]


Acting career

Walsh predominantly performs on stage.[5] She has gained a great reputation for her performances with accolades such as the review for her work in Bailegangaire:[6]

    _But astonishing too is the performance of Catherine Walsh – which was described by a colleague of mine this morning as flawless. Her physical stance, her movements, her delivery of lines all show that Mary is utterly trapped, perhaps more restricted by circumstances than Mommo is by senility and her bed. I had never understood fully the links between the telling of Mommo’s story and the transformation of Mary until I saw that change being embodied by Walsh._


Awards and criticism

Best Actress award for her performance in Eden at the Irish Times/ESB Theatre Awards 2001[7]
