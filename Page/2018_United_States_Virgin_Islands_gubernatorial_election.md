The 2018 U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 6, 2018 to select the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands who are chosen on the same ticket. The election was held concurrently with the 2018 United States midterm elections. As no candidate ticket received a majority of the General Election vote, the top two vote-getters proceeded to a runoff 14 days later on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. Democrat Albert Bryan Jr. and his running mate, Sen. Tregenza Roach, won the runoff election.[1]

The incumbent Governor Kenneth Mapp ran for reelection to a second term as an Independent politician with incumbent Lt. Gov. Osbert Potter.[2] Mapp faced off against former Virgin Islands Labor Commissioner Albert Bryan Jr., who won the August 4 Democratic primary; Bryan earned 39.23% of the vote in the primary, defeating Allison "Allie" Petrus (33.67%) and Angel E. Dawson Jr. (26.68%).[3] Also on the November ballot were Adlah "Foncie" Donastorg, Warren Mosler, Soraya Diase Coffelt, Moleto A. Smith, and Janette Millin Young.

On Election Day, November 6, Bryan earned 38.08% of the vote, with Mapp coming in second with 33.45%.[4] In the November 20 runoff, Bryan was elected governor with 54.54% of the vote to Mapp's 45.15%.[5]
