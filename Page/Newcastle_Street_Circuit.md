The NEWCASTLE STREET CIRCUIT is a temporary street circuit around the east end of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. The circuit hosts the Newcastle 500, the final round of the Supercars Championship.[1] The 14-turn, 2.652 kilometre circuit takes in Newcastle Beach and the foreshore around Nobbys Beach Reserve.[2]


Circuit

The circuit begins on Wharf Road, heading south-west towards the city. It then turns left at Watt Street, crossing over the Newcastle Light Rail tracks before ascending a 1:22 hill up Watt Street, before again turning left onto Shortland Esplanade 500m after turn one.[3] Once on Shortland Esplanade, the circuit snakes down the beachside road before reaching a 90° left at Zaara Street. This is followed by a 90° right onto Scott Street and another 90° left onto Parnell Place to the fastest stretch of circuit, Nobbys Road down past Fort Scratchley followed by a left-handed hairpin in the Camp Shortland carpark. From there a right hander onto Wharf Road completes the lap.

The originally proposed layout was altered with the omission of the section through Pacific Park and the alteration of the planned Nobbys' Reserve permanent course.[4][5] However, the circuit has attracted criticism from residents within the circuit precinct.[6]
