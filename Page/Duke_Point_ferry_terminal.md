DUKE POINT is a major ferry terminal owned and operated by BC Ferries that provides ferry service across the Strait of Georgia to Tsawwassen. Duke Point is the only major terminal in the BC Ferries system without a public transit connection.[1]

The terminal was built in 1997 to divert commercial vehicle traffic away from BC Ferries' other main Nanaimo dock, located at a point in the middle of the city known as Departure Bay, thus easing traffic jams through Nanaimo's city centre. In 2013, 42 percent of passengers traveling from Nanaimo to the mainland went through Duke Point.[2]

The ferry terminal marks the southern terminus of Highway 19, which connects the terminal to the Trans-Canada Highway just south of Nanaimo's city centre.


Incidents and accidents

On December 20, 2011, the Coastal Inspiration experienced a hard landing upon arrival at Duke Point terminal. The terminal berth sustained significant damage and the vessel's port side doors were also damaged. The terminal required extensive repairs, requiring a closure of over four months, with all service re-routed through Departure Bay,[3] finally re-opening on May 1, 2012.
