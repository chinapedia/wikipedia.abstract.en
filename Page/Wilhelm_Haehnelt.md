There he was promoted on 27 January 1896 to lieutenant, and served in the following years as a battalion adjutant and graduated from the Institute of War 1908. From October 1908 to February 1909 he was assigned to the aeronaut battalion and received his training as a balloon pilot. From 1 April 1909 to 30 September 1911 Haehnelt was assigned to Army General Staff. This was followed by a promotion to captain and his brief appointment as company commander. Following a temporary command of the air force, where he was trained as a pilot, Haehnelt was transferred on 1 October 1913 to the staff of the 4th Aviator Battalion to Strasbourg.

With the outbreak of World War I Haehnelt took command of the 4th _Feldflieger_ air battalion on the Western Front. From 26 September 1914 to March 1917 Haehnelt served as a staff officer of the air battalion and in the General Staff of the 5th Army where he worked and served thereafter until the end of 1917 in the staff of the commander of the pilots of the 2nd Army. He was also charged with inspections of the air force on behalf of the Intelligence Chief of the Supreme Command.

In January 1918, he was assigned directly under Ernst von Hoeppner, the Commanding General of the Air Force. He subsequently saw more command over pilots within the 2nd Army. He spent the last months of the war with special functions entrusted as the inspector of the air force and from September 15 to December 14, 1918 as commander of all aviation schools and auxiliary defense air battalions.

He held the same position then from May to December 1920 at the Military District Command III and the staff of the 3rd Division. On 31 December 1920, Haehnelt's position was eliminated as a result of the Treaty of Versailles and the consequent prohibition of air forces in Germany from active military service.
