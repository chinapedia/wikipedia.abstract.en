Parable of the vineyard

    _Now let me sing to my Well-beloved_

        _A song of my Beloved regarding His vineyard:_

    _My Well-beloved has a vineyard_

        _On a very fruitful hill._[3]

In relation to the "Parable of the Vineyard", the New Oxford Annotated Bible identifies the vineyard in as "Israel" (compare to ; ; ).[4]

    _He dug it up and cleared out its stones,_

        _And planted it with the choicest vine._

The "choicest vine" is an allusion of the people of Israel (; ; ).[5]

    _He built a tower in its midst,_

        _And also made a winepress in it;_

    _So He expected it to bring forth good grapes,_

        _But it brought forth wild grapes._[6]

The failing grapes are described as "wild" in the King James Version and the English Standard Version, "rotten" in the New American Bible (Revised Edition) and "sour" in the Good News Translation.[7] In Brenton's Septuagint Translation, the vineyard "brought forth thorns".[8]


The six woes

Verses 8 to 24 contain "the six woes". Anglican theologian Edward Plumptre suggests that the form of the woes preached by Jesus in is based on this passage.[9] After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, "six sins are particularised as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning".

The six woes of Isaiah relate to those responsible for:

-   Amalgamation of land (verses 8-10)
-   Drunkenness and revelry (verses 11-17)
-   Compound sinfulness, or "sin with a cart rope" (verses 18-19)
-   Use of language to justify evil (verse 20)
-   Self-conceit (verse 21)
-   Corruption (verses 22-23) associated with intoxication, cf. :

    _It is not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer_.

Verse 8

    ''Woe to those who join house to house;
    ''They add field to field,
    ''Till there is no place
    _Where they may dwell alone in the midst of the land!_ [10]

The law of Israel provided "very stringently and carefully, that as far as possible there should be an equal distribution of the soil, and that hereditary family property should be inalienable. All landed property that had been alienated reverted to the family every fiftieth year, or year of jubilee; so that alienation simply had reference to the usufruct of the land till that time."[11]

and the Jerusalem Bible's translation of make similar points:

    _You have narrowed the lands of the poor down to nothing_.[12]

Verse 20

    _Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil_

"This fourth woe relates to those who adopted a code of morals that completely overturned the first principles of ethics, and was utterly opposed to the law of God."[13]

Verse 21

    _Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!_

See also :

    _Do not be wise in your own eyes_


Verse 25

    ''For all this His anger is not turned away,
    _But His hand is stretched out still_.[14]

This is the first occurrence of a refrain which appears again in , , and .
