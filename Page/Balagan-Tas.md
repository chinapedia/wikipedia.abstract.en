BALAGAN-TAS (, ) is a cinder cone volcano in Russia. It was discovered by V.A. Zimin in 1939.[1]

This volcano is located in the Chersky range,[2] in the Moma river valley and is the only clearly Quaternary volcano in the area; the existence of another volcano active in the 1770s has not been confirmed.[3] The supposed Indighirsky volcano may be actually Balagan-Tas. Its location has often been given incorrectly.

Balagan-Tas is a volcanic cone with a crater of which little remains. It covers a surface area of . The crater is wide and deep, the cone is high and has a base diameter of . It may be considered a composite volcano. The volcano has generated three lava flows which cover a surface area of . They reach a thickness of .

The volcano has erupted alkali basalts typical for rift zone volcanoes. Its composition has been characterized as hawaiite. Titanium dioxide contents of 3.81% have been measured. The helium-3/helium-4 ratios approach these associated with mantle plumes.[4]

Balagan-Tas lies on an anticline. It is associated with faulting.[5] Further it is related to the Moma-Zoryansk rift and the Gakkel ridge, which extends to the Laptev sea.[6] The De Long Islands and a potentially Quaternary dyke complex of the Viliga river may also be related.[7] This tectonic activity is related to the interaction between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate.

Other volcanoes are found in the neighbourhood. Northwest of Balagan-Tas lies the Uraga Khaya volcano; it is located and is a lava dome formed by rhyolite. Its age is unclear, potassium-argon dating has yielded an age of 16.6 mya but its appearance indicates it may be considerably younger. A further volcano may exist northwest of this centre. A liparite dome named Majak is located at , but it may be the same as Uraga Khaya and the coordinates wrong.

Potassium-argon dating of Balagan-Tas has yielded an age of 266,000 Â± 30,000 years ago, comparable to Anyuj volcano.[8] Other sources consider the volcano late Holocene in age, or even as active during historical time.[9] Hot springs are found southeast of Balagan-Tas. They reach temperatures of , which together with the other activity indicates a hot upper mantle.[10] If reports of activity of the supposed Indighirsky volcano in the 1770s refer to Balagan-Tas, this volcano may have had historical activity, one of the few outside of Kamchatka in continental Asia.
