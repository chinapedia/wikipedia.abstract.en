Naming

The park was named after Dick Bell, a member of the Canadian House of Commons from 1957 to 1963, and again from 1965 to 1968. He served in the Conservative cabinet of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration from 1962 to 1963.


Rules of the park

Cyclists

Cyclists must dismount and must walk their bikes throughout the park.

Curfew

The city bylaw bans activity in the park after 11Â pm.[4] That includes leaving your car parked in the lot.[5]

Dogs

Historically, dogs have not been allowed in the park, nor in neighboring Andrew Haydon park. In 2009, the city allowed dogs on a leash as a one-year pilot project. This was to try and solve the "geese problem", which was caused by too many Canada geese in the summer that excrete all over the grass and paths.[6] This rule has since been extended indefinitely. Currently, dogs are allowed on a leash, but "are prohibited from being within five meters of all children's play areas and pools".[7]
