Synopsis

After a devastating war, the immortal tribe paid a heavy price to seal the ghost lord Qing Cang through the sacrifice of their God of War, Mo Yuan. 70,000 years later, in an attempt to re-seal the ghost lord who was about to break free, Bai Qian (Yang Mi)'s memories and powers were sealed by the ghost lord, and she was sent to the mortal realm to undergo a trial as part of her ascension to a High Goddess. Living as a mortal girl, she meets Ye Hua (Mark Chao) and the two fell in love, and Ye Hua gifts her the name of Su Su. In order to prevent the same tragedy (that happened to Sang Ji and Shao Xin) from befalling, Ye Hua attempts to fake his death while hiding Su Su from the Nine Heavens after she became pregnant. However, Ye Hua's plans were eventually thwarted and Su Su was brought to the Nine Heavens. Su Jin (Huang Mengying), who is jealous of Ye Hua's love for Su Su, intentionally creates a series of misunderstanding between them and causes Su Su to lose her eyes. Thinking that Ye Hua has betrayed her, the devastated Su Su jumps off from the Zhu Xian Terrace, an act fatal to all mortals. Instead of dying, the seal on her memories and powers is broken, restoring Su Su back to her goddess status. Unable to deal with the psychological trauma, Bai Qian consumes a potion to erase all her memories of the events after her powers were sealed, and she forgets Ye Hua.

Three hundred years later, Bai Qian and Ye Hua meet again as deities. Another lifetime, another world, Ye Hua recognizes Bai Qian as the woman he loves, but the latter remains indifferent. Ye Hua begins to pursue Bai Qian for the second time to regain her affections, and eventually succeeds when his love is requited. From beginning to end, time continues to flow and the lines of their fates continue to cross: an entanglement of three lives and three worlds and a road of peach blossoms.

| Huang Mengying[14]   | Su Jin               | The only descendant of the heavenly Su Jin Tribe. She was adopted by the Heaven Lord after her tribe was wiped out due to war. Her affections for Ye Hua were unrequited, but through her manipulations she becomes Ye Hua's grand-father's (Heaven Lord) concubine. Jealousy overwhelmed her when she realized Ye Hua loved Su Su and she plotted to frame her and steal her eyes by making it seem as if Su Su pushed her off the Zhu Xian Terrace. When Bai Qian recovered her memories as Su Su, she gouges Su Jin's eyes and uncovers her manipulations and crimes. Su Jin's punishment was to guard Qing Cang but eventually got banished to the mortal realm and to never be able to return to the nine heavens. |

He later realizes that the only one he ever truly loved was Si Yin.                                                                                                                                                           |

| Zhu Xudan[33]    | Xuan Nü           | Bai Qian's childhood friend. She has always envied Bai Qian's beauty and because of this, Bai Qian granted her the ability to morph her appearance to look exactly like Bai Qian whenever she wants. During Xuan Nü's stay at Kun Lun, she used her looks to seduce Li Jing and forced him to marry her. She then acted as a spy for the Ghost Tribe to steal the troop formation from Kun Lun, causing Mo Yuan's army to be defeated. Due to her crimes, she was cursed with the fate of never being able to bear a healthy child. |
|                  |                   | 70,000 years later, Xuan Nü kidnapped Mo Yuan's body and A Li, to exact revenge on Bai Qian while stealing an immortal body to revive her dead child. However, she was defeated by Ye Hua and her appearance was destroyed by Bai Qian. In a fit of shock and horror at seeing her original face, Xuan Nü strikes her eyes, blinding herself. She then dies while trying to retrieve the Divine Fungal Grass to revive her son.                                                                                                     |

When he finally breaks through the imprisonment, Qing Cang is killed by Ye Hua in a battle.                                                                                                                                      |

Novel plagiarism controversy

The source novel _Three Lives Three Worlds Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms_ (English version _To the Sky Kingdom_[53]) was suspected to be plagiarized from various sources. The allegation was that the author Tang Qi plagiarised the main characters, story organisation and many important details from a Chinese gay love novel tiled 桃花债 (the novel's title roughly translates to "Peach Blossom Debt") written by 大风刮过; and the prologue from an unfinished contemporary Chinese love novel 非我倾城 written by Gu Man.

The scandal was used as an example of popular media plagiarism in a report by CCTV.[54]
