ZHANG HU ( – ) was a Chinese poet of the mid-Tang dynasty. His courtesy name was CHENGJI.

After travelling to the capital of Chang'an, he was unsuccessful in seeking a position at court, and spent the latter half of his life travelling to famous places and composing poetry. The majority of his surviving poems are on historical topics and famous sights that he visited in his travels.


Biography

Zhang Hu was born in 792, in Qinghe (modern Qinghe County, Hebei or Shandong) or possibly Nanyang (modern Nanyang, Henan). His courtesy name was Chengji.

He flourished between 820 and 845.[1] Living early on in Gusu, in the Changqing era (821–824) he was summoned to the capital Chang'an on the recommendation of Linghu Chu. Linghu Chu had known Hu through the 810s, and his recommendation memorial was submitted along with 300 of Hu's poems.

However, he failed to find employment at court due to the opposition of Yuan Zhen, who claimed Hu lacked literary talent, and moved to Huainan where he spent his days visiting famous temples and places of scenic beauty and devoting himself to poetic composition.

Later, he retired to Danyang (modern Danyang, Jiangsu, where spent the rest of his days as a private citizen.

He probably died in 852 or 853.


Poetry

Roughly 350 of his poems survive, most being on famous temples and places of scenic beauty that he visited in travels.

He primarily wrote quatrains on historical topics.[2] There is an anthology of his poetry called the _ZHANG CHUSHI SHIJI_ ().

He wrote a dozen poems on the reign of Xuanzong,[3] of which the following notably deals with the emperor's relationship with an older sister of Yang Guifei:

Among his better-known poems is the __ "Jinshan-si" ():

Five of his poems were included in the _Three Hundred Tang Poems_.[4]
