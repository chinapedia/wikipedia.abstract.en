_BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD_ is an American adult animated sitcom created by Mike Judge.[1] The series originated from _Frog Baseball_, a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on _Liquid Television_. After seeing the short, MTV signed Judge to develop the short into a full series.[2][3] The series originally ran for seven seasons from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997.

Fourteen years following the end of the series, the series was revived for an eighth season which aired from October 27 to December 29, 2011. A theatrical feature-length film based on the series titled _Beavis and Butt-Head Do America_ was released in 1996 by Paramount Pictures.


Premise

The series centers on two socially incompetent teenage delinquents and couch potatoes named Beavis and Butt-Head (both voiced by Judge), who go to school at Highland High in Highland, Texas. They lack evident adult supervision at home and are dimwitted, undereducated and barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. They will usually deem things they encounter as "cool" if they are associated with heavy metal, violence, sex, destruction or the macabre. While inexperienced with females, they both share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could be even vaguely interpreted as sexual or scatological.

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique music videos using commentary improvised by Judge (much in the same way as _Mystery Science Theater 3000_; in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as _Jersey Shore_ and _True Life_, plus shows from other Viacom-owned networks such as Spike). The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.[4][5] Their staff at Highland High are often at a loss as to how to deal with them, and in many episodes they skip school altogether. Their actions sometimes result in serious consequences but often for others in which they themselves do not express any remorse.


Episodes


Reception

Critical reception

Over its run, _Beavis and Butt-Head_ drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.[6] It became the focus of criticism from some social critics, such as Michael Medved while others such as David Letterman and the _National Review,_ defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and Generation X. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of _South Park,_ cite the series as an influence and compared it to the blues.[7]

In 1997, Dan Tobin of _The Boston Phoenix_ commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed "stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh."[8] In 1997, Ted Drozdowski of _The Boston Phoenix_ described the 1997 _Beavis and Butt-Head_ state as "reduced to self-parody of their self-parody."[9] In December 2005, _TV Guide_ ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.[10] In 2012, _TV Guide_ ranked _Beavis and Butt-head_ as one of the top 60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.[11]

Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two—_Give Blood_/_Blood Drive_ and _Door to Door_—which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."[12]

Criticism and controversies

Early episodes depicted a juvenile obsession with fire and other dangerous behaviors, summed up with Beavis's chanting of "Fire! Fire!". The show was blamed for the death of two-year-old Jessica Messner in Moraine, Ohio, in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother, Austin, set fire to his mother's mobile home with a cigarette lighter, killing the two-year-old.[13] In response, MTV pulled the episode temporarily. The mother later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home.[14] However, neighbors claimed that the family didn't even have cable television, and was unable to view the show.[15]

As a result, all references to fire were removed from subsequent airings. The creators found a censorship loophole and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on..." and pausing before "fire" ("Liar! Liar!"). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion ("California" by Wax). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say "fire". However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes — even the original master tapes were altered permanently.[16] Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included "Stewart's House" and "Way Down Mexico Way". Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare, and the copies that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the _Mike Judge Collection_ DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain whether some of the earlier episodes still exist in their original, uncensored form.

When the series returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word "fire" once again uncensored.[17] During the first video segment, "Werewolves of Highland", the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word "fire" a total of 7 times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.[18]

In February 1994, watchdog group Morality in Media claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a highway in Jersey City, New Jersey, near the Holland Tunnel by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by _Beavis and Butt-Head_.[19] The group said that Settle was influenced by the episode "Ball Breakers", in which Beavis and Butt-Head load a bowling ball with explosives and drop it from a rooftop.[20] While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. It was later revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV, nor did he watch the show.

In "Lightning Strikes", the show parodies the desire to blame actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a thunderstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about Benjamin Franklin, who Butt-head describes as "some old dude with long hair and glasses". The reporter asks if it was Howard Stern, and when Butt-head answers "no", she asks if he has ever listened to Stern's radio program. The reporter continues to ask them questions until they mention that they had watched rock music videos earlier in the day. The reporter then concludes on the air that music videos are to blame for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00 p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:

    Beavis and Butt-Head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.

This was later changed to:

    Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do would cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put it another way: don't try this at home.

This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their Sega Genesis and Super NES games as well as their Windows game _Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity_.

They were famously lambasted by South Carolina Democratic senator Fritz Hollings as "Buffcoat and Beaver".[21] This subsequently became a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names. For example, one character on the show, Tom Anderson, originally called them "Butthole" and "Joe", and believed the two to be of Asian ethnicity (describing them to the police as "Oriental"). In later episodes, Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as "Penis and Butt-Munch". President Clinton called them "Beavis and Bum-head" in "Citizen Butt-head", as well as in the movie, where an old lady (voiced by Cloris Leachman) consistently calls them "Travis" and "Bob-head". In "Incognito", when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named "Crevis and Bung-Head". The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them "Beaver and Butt-Plug". In "Right On!", when the duo appear on the _Gus Baker Show_, host Gus Baker (a caricature of Rush Limbaugh) introduces them as "Beavis and Buffcoat".

Beavis and Butt-Head have been compared to idiot savants because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.


Film

In 1996, a full-length film featuring the duo titled _Beavis and Butt-Head Do America_ was released in theaters. The film features the voices of Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Cloris Leachman, Robert Stack, Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, Greg Kinnear (in an uncredited role) and David Letterman (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a "two thumbs up" from Siskel and Ebert. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $12 million to produce.

In the years following, many fans rumored the possibility of a sequel or follow-up to the film, tentatively titled _Beavis and Butt-Head: The Sequel_[22] or _Beavis and Butt-Head 2_.[23] On August 31, 2009, during the promotion of _Extract_, Mike Judge stated that he would like to see Beavis and Butt-Head on the big screen again.[24]


Revival

On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a _New York Post_ reporter that Mike Judge was creating a new _Beavis and Butt-Head_ series, that Judge would reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation would be hand-drawn. According to TMZ, MTV had not asked Tracy Grandstaff to reprise her role as Daria Morgendorffer.[25] Later, in a _Rolling Stone_ interview, Judge was asked if _Daria_ was coming back, and he said: "No. There's sort of a cameo in one episode. That'll be a surprise."[26]

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, criticize contemporary music videos.[27] In an interview with _Rolling Stone_, MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch _Jersey Shore_, Ultimate Fighting Championship matches, and amateur videos from YouTube, as well as give movie reviews. "The biggest change is obviously the references are updated, it's set in modern day, and there's going to be a movie review segment," Linn said, "Otherwise they're still true to their prior passions."[28][29]

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for _King of the Hill_, told a _Rolling Stone_ reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving _Beavis and Butt-head_. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of _King of the Hill_ would work well for _Beavis and Butt-head_; eventually he concluded, "Maybe we should just actually make some good _Beavis and Butt-head_ episodes." Later, a Lady Gaga video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a _Beavis and Butt-head_ revival: "I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring."[30]

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening _Jackass 3D_ opened the feature film with a 3-D _Beavis and Butt-head_ short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2010, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at Comic-Con International. A preview of the episode "Holy Cornholio" was also shown.[31] Judge told _Rolling Stone_ that at least 24 episodes (12 half-hour programs) will definitely air.[32] It was initially rumored that Judge was working on 30 new episodes for the network.[33]

The new episodes debuted in the United States and Canada on October 27, 2011. The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3 million total viewers.[34] This number eventually dwindled to 900,000 by the season's end, mainly due to its challenging time slot pitted against regular prime time shows on other networks.[35] From April 24, 2012 to May 1, 2013, the show remained on the bubble for renewal, with no official decision being made.[36] According to Mike Judge, MTV's modern demographic are females 12–14 years old, and the network is looking for other networks to ship the show to.[37]

The new shows aired in mainland Europe in April 2011.[38] The main title card displays the title as _Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-head_ with Judge's name replacing the MTV logo.

Comedy Central aired the show as part of their animation block over Christmas in December 2011 but was not picked up for a new season nor syndication. This would be the second time the show has aired on Comedy Central, the first being between subsequent airings in 2004 and 2005.[39]

Potential future

On January 10, 2014, Mike Judge announced that, while he is busy working on _Silicon Valley_, there is a chance of him pitching _Beavis and Butt-Head_ to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.[40] While giving an interview to Howard Stern on May 6, 2014, Judge mentioned that the show's ratings on MTV were second only to _Jersey Shore_, but the show didn't fit MTV's target demographic of young women, which is why the revived series has not been brought back on MTV. He also said that MTV was close to selling it to another network, but it became "lost in deal stuff".[41]

In interviews, Judge has stated his interest in producing a live-action film and Johnny Depp has expressed interest in the role of Beavis.[42] In May 2008, Judge said that he previously hated the idea, but now believes that "maybe there's something there."[43] During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2008, Judge said, "I like to keep the door open on _Beavis and Butt-Head_, because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he also added, "Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years." One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s," he said. "I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch." Judge added that he would not completely ignore the time that has passed in between.

In 2016, Judge told RadioTimes.com that "Maybe it could be a live-action someday" and went on to speculate that Beavis might be homeless by now.[44]

In March 2018, Judge told Rotten Tomatoes that the idea of doing a second _Beavis and Butt-Head_ movie had been brought up two months prior, stating that "It’s just a matter of coming up with an idea that feels like it’s worth doing."[45]


Home video

MTV Home Video, in collaboration with Sony Music Entertainment, released several episodes of the show on VHS from 1995 through 1999. A total of eleven VHS compilation tapes were released in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, each containing around eight episodes, but without the music video segments from the original broadcastings. These include the "Beavis and Butthead Do Christmas" and "Butt-O-Ween" specials, which were given stand-alone releases.

-   History of Beavis Part 2
-   History of Beavis Part 3
-   Sticky Situations
-   The Future of Beavis & Butt-head
-   Too Dumb For TV

When the series ended in the U.K., a further seven volumes were issued exclusively in Australia, meaning that over-all 28 volumes, all 200 original episodes were released on VHS except "Heroes", "Incognito", "Cow Tipping", "Canoe" and "True Crime".

-   History of Beavis Part 4
-   Dumb Ideas
-   Holy Rollers
-   School Jocks
-   Hit It Big
-   Still Stupid
-   Brushes With Death

A single LaserDisc volume titled _Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection_ was released on June 27, 1994. It contains all the episodes from _Work Sucks!_ on one side and the episodes from _There Goes the Neighborhood_ on the other side. The volumes _The Final Judgment_ and _Beavis & Butt-head Do Christmas_ were also released on DVD during the early days of the format.

Time Life

All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the Time Life organization. The DVD releases were titled _The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head_. The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.

The first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.

Sometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include 4 of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer. They also released VHS version of the Time Life collection.

_The History of Beavis and Butt-Head_

Paramount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled _The History of Beavis and Butt-Head_ which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the _History_ set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.[46] In all, half of the 32 episodes on _The History of Beavis and Butt-Head_ weren't included on later releases of the series, including all but two episodes on the first disc.

Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set is currently selling on eBay and Amazon for very high prices. Some brand new copies are being sold for over $300.

_The Mike Judge Collection_

MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment released on November 8, 2005 a three-disc DVD compilation titled _Beavis and Butt-Head: The Mike Judge Collection_, Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. The set was followed by Volume 2 and Volume 3. On January 27, 2008, MTV and Apple made all three collections available on the iTunes Store. A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled _Beavis and Butt-Head – Volume 4_, was released on February 15, 2012 in the U.S.[47]

On February 14, 2017, MTV released _Beavis and Butt-Head - The Complete Collection_, a 12-disc set containing all four previous released volumes of _The Mike Judge Collection_, along with a special collector's edition of _Beavis and Butt-Head Do America_.[48]

Many music video segments and content from other third parties were never released due to licensing issues with the rights holders. Early episodes featuring Beavis and Butt-Head engaging in unusually cruel and criminal activities were never released due to Mike Judge and MTV's dislike of them.[49]

_Mike Judge's Most Wanted_

A DVD set featuring Mike Judge's favorite episodes. The set includes 20 episodes plus "The Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head"; it also features the original "Frog Baseball" and scenes from season 8.

Marvel Comics

From 1994 to 1996, Marvel Comics published a monthly _Beavis and Butt-Head_ comic[50] under the Marvel Absurd imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by Beavis and Butt-Head or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics. In their review of a Ghost Rider comic, Beavis tries to avoid using the word "fire" to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, minor characters like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

_Daria_ spin-off

In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, _Daria_, was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for _Beavis and Butt-Head_ by Glenn Eichler and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for _Daria_.[51] In the first episode of _Daria_, she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-Head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale—the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland "unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too".
