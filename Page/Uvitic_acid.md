UVITIC ACID (5-METHYLISOPHTHALIC ACID) is an organic compound with the formula CH₃C₆H₃(COOH)₂.[1][2] The name comes from Latin _uva_ which means a grape. The acid is called so because it may be produced indirectly from tartaric acid, which is found in the grape.[3] Under normal conditions, the acid is a white crystalline substance.


Preparation

Uvitic acid is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene.[4]
