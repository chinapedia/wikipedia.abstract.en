Symposium

In a symposium organized by The Cathay Drug Co Inc and Zambon Italy, four international and two local doctors presented the latest available guidelines in UTI management to local specialists. During the symposium, Dr. George Zhanel of the University of Manitoba (Canada) Faculty of Medicine discussed antibiotic resistance in relation to UTI. Dr. Andrea Novelli of the University Hospital Careggi (Italy) gave an overview of antibiotics therapy. Professor Nicola Petrosillo of Lazzaro Spallanzani (National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Italy) spoke about the stewardship of community and hospital-acquired infections. Dr. Kurt Naber of the Technical University of Munich (Germany) presented international UTI treatment guidelines. Dr. Ricardo Manalastas, Jr. of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Medicine tackled UTI in relation to pregnancy and menopause. Dr. Edsel Salvana of the National Institute of Health, UP Manila presented local UTI treatment guidelines.

Introduced at the event was Monurol (Fosfomycin Trometamol), a unique and highly effective treatment positioned as a first line antibiotic treatment for UTI and acute cystitis (inflammation/infection of the urinary bladder). The novelty is its single dose regimen that assures excellent patient compliance. It also has extremely low global antibiotic resistance rates, assuring its effectiveness and the prompt relief of symptoms. A one-time, one-dose regimen is unique to the drug, as it maintains a very high urinary concentration for more than 72 hours after a single dose. This compares with common antibiotics that must be taken twice a day for seven to 14 days, depending on the severity of the infection.
