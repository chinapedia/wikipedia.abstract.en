GROK is a neologism coined by American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel _Stranger in a Strange Land_. While the _Oxford English Dictionary_ summarizes the meaning of _grok_ as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment",[1] Heinlein's concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that "the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term".[2] The concept of _grok_ garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities as diverse as polyamory (in particular the Church of All Worlds) and computer science.


Descriptions of _grok_ in _Stranger in a Strange Land_

Critic David E. Wright Sr. points out that in the 1991 "uncut" edition of _Stranger_, the word _grok_ "was used first _without any explicit definition_ on page 22" and continued to be used without being explicitly defined until page 253 (emphasis in original).[3] He notes that this first intensional definition is simply "to drink", but that this is only a metaphor "much as English 'I see' often means the same as 'I understand'".[4] Critics have bridged this absence of explicit definition by citing passages from _Stranger_ that illustrate the term. A selection of these passages follows:


Etymology

Robert A. Heinlein originally coined the term _grok_ in his 1961 novel _Stranger in a Strange Land_ as a Martian word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as "water", "to drink", "life", or "to live", and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality.

According to the book, drinking water is a central focus on Mars, where it is scarce. Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both _grok_ each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of divine immanence verbalized between the main characters, "Thou Art God", is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term _grok_.

Heinlein describes Martian words as "guttural" and "jarring". Martian speech is described as sounding "like a bullfrog fighting a cat". Accordingly, _grok_ is generally pronounced as a guttural _gr_ terminated by a sharp _k_ with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow IPA transcription might be ). William Tenn suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenn's very similar concept of _griggo_, earlier introduced in Tenn's story "Venus and the Seven Sexes" (published in 1949). In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence "very possible".


Adoption and modern usage

In computer programmer culture

Uses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in computer culture, such as a 1984 appearance in _InfoWorld_: "There isn't any software! Only different internal states of hardware. It's all hardware! It's a shame programmers don't grok that better."

The Jargon File, which describes itself as a "Hacker's Dictionary" and has been published under that name three times, puts _grok_ in a programming context:

The entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File, dating from the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the _Linux Bible, 2005_ characterizes the Unix software development philosophy as "one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea".

The book _Perl Best Practices_ defines _grok_ as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to _re-grok_ code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into one's memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, _to grok_ means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor caches memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something that a human (or maybe a Martian) would do.

The main web page for cURL, an open source tool and programming library, describes the function of cURL as "cURL groks URLs".[5]

The book _Cyberia_ covers its use in this subculture extensively:

The keystroke logging software used by the NSA for its remote intelligence gathering operations is named GROK.[6]

One of the most powerful parsing filters used in ElasticSearch software's logstash component is named _grok_.

In counterculture

Tom Wolfe, in his book _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ (1968), describes a character's thoughts during an acid trip: "He looks down, two bare legs, a torso rising up at him and like he is just noticing them for the first time ... he has never seen any of this flesh before, this stranger. He groks over that  ..."[7]

In his counterculture Volkswagen repair manual, _How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot_ (1969), dropout aerospace engineer John Muir instructs prospective used VW buyers to "grok the car" before buying.[8]

The word was used numerous times by Robert Anton Wilson in his works _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ and _Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy_.

The term inspired actress Mayim Bialik's women's lifestyle site, Grok Nation.
