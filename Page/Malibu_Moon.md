MALIBU MOON (Foaled February 23, 1997) is a Thoroughbred stallion bred in Kentucky.[1] Retired young to stud following a racing injury as a two-year-old, Malibu Moon has since sired multiple grade I stakes winners, two Eclipse Award winners, and is the sire of Orb, winner of the 2013 Kentucky Derby.


Background

Bred in Kentucky by B. Wayne Hughes, Malibu Moon is a bay sired by A.P. Indy out of the Mr. Prospector mare Macoumba.[2]

Macoumba was a grade I winner in France, winning the Prix Marcel Boussac, before she was imported to the United States by B. Wayne Hughes.[3] Macoumba's dam, Maximova, was a Gr.I winner herself, winning against males in the 1982 Prix de la Salamandre. Maximova also produced five stakes winners as a broodmare.[4]

Malibu Moon is a half-brother to stallion Parker's Storm Cat, who is best known as the sire of the turf runner Ben's Cat.[5] Malibu Moon's half-sister Curriculum is the dam of notable turf sire Temple City.[6][7]


Race career

Malibu Moon had a short racing career, but showed initial promise. His first race was a maiden special weight as a two year old at Hollywood Park, and despite brushing the gate at the start he made his way through the crowd in the stretch to finish second. His second and final start was also a maiden special weight at Hollywood Park, in which he finished first. He suffered a slab fracture in his knee in May of his two-year-old season, which forced his early retirement.[8]


Stud career

Malibu Moon first entered stud in 2000 for a low stud fee of $3,000 at Country Life Farm in Maryland. After producing Eclipse Champion two-year-old Declan's Moon and graded winner Perfect Moon in his first two crops, he was relocated in 2004 to the Castleton Lyons Farm in Kentucky to service a wider range of mares, and his fee was raised to about $10,000.[9] He was then relocated again in 2008 to Spendthrift Farms, where he stands at a stud fee of $75,000.[10]

As of 2017, Malibu Moon sired over 100 black-type stakes winners and 40 graded stakes winners. His progeny have collectively earned over $99 million.[11] Malibu Moon has also been recognized as a broodmare sire, particularly as the broodmare sire of Eclipse Champion Stellar Wind.[12]
