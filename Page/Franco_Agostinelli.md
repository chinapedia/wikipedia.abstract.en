Biography

Franco Agostinelli was born on 1 January 1944 in Arezzo, a _comune_ in Tuscany, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 9 June 1968 Telesforo Giovanni Cioli, the Bishop of Arezzo, in the Parish of San Marco alla Sella after studying at the seminary of Arezzo.[1]

After graduating from the Pontifical Lateran University, where he received his licentiate in dogmatic theology in 1970, Agostinelli continued his studies at the Pontifical Alphonsian Academy, where he received a degree in moral theology in 1972. He first served in the Diocese of Arezzo as the vicar coadjutor of the cathedral and then as a parish priest of the Parish of the Sacred Heart. In 1984, he became the episcopal vicar for pastoral care and director of the catechetical office. He served as rector of the diocesan seminary from 1992 to 1994, and in 1997, he was appointed vicar general of the Diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro and was confirmed in the position in 1999 by the new bishop, Gualtiero Bassetti.[2]

On 17 November 2001, Agostinelli was appointed the Bishop of Grosseto, and received his episcopal consecration from Pope John Paul II on 6 January 2002 in St. Peter's Basilica, with Cardinals Leonardo Sandri and Robert Sarah acting as co-consecrators. On 3 February 2002, he took possession of the _Laurentian_ cathedra, officially taking charge of the diocese.[3]

During a pastoral visit launched in 2007, he came to the attention of the national Italian press. While visiting the _quartiere_ of Barbanella in the city of Grosseto, he visited the local community of Arcigay. Agostinelli maintained that it was his practice to appraise himself of all Catholic and non-Catholic institutions within his diocese.[4] Acrigay interpreted the visit as an endorsement of homosexual relationships by the bishop. At the meeting, Aurelio Mancuso, the national president of Arcigay, was present along with numerous journalists.[5]

Following attention by the media, Agostineli renounced the visit, saying that it had been exploited, and said that he would carry out another visit without any political or media interference.[6] Agostinelli continued to demonstrate openness to dialogue with homosexual communities, meeting with other organizations over the years.

On 29 September 2012, he was appointed the Bishop of Prato by Pope Benedict XVI and was installed in the diocese on 25 November 2013.[7]
