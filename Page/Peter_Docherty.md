PETER DOCHERTY (born 14 February 1929) is an English footballer who played as an outside forward in the Football League for Darlington.[1]

Docherty signed for First Division club Fulham in September 1949,[2] but he never represented them in the league, and returned to his native north-east of England and signed for Darlington a year later.[3] Standing in for regular outside left Gordon Galley, Docherty scored on his senior debut, on 7 October 1950 in a 1â€“1 draw at home to Tranmere Rovers in the Third Division North. He kept his place for the next match, and made his third and final appearance in February 1951.[4]
