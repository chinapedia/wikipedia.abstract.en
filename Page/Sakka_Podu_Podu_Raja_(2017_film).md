_SAKKA PODU PODU RAJA_ is a 2017 Indian Tamil-language action comedy film directed by Sethuraman and produced by VTV Ganesh. The film features Santhanam, Vaibhavi Shandilya and Vivek in the leading roles. Featuring cinematography by Abinandhan Ramanujam and edited by Anthony, the film began production in October 2016.[1] This film is a remake of the 2014 Telugu movie _Loukyam_, starring Gopichand, Rakul Preet Singh, Sampath Raj, Mukesh Rishi and Brahmanandam.


Plot

Santa (Santhanam) kidnaps the sister of a powerful gangster (Sampath Raj) and thus, she escapes from a forced marriage and unites with her boyfriend. Meanwhile, Santa meets Yazhini (Vaibhavi Shandilya) and falls head over heels for her. Though Yazhini refuses at first, she slowly falls for him. When Sampath searches for Santa, the news on him loving Yazhini comes as a shocker. The rest of the film is how Santa convinces the gangster and marry Yazhini in a screenplay which is mixed with gravity-defying stunts and bland comedy.

In November 2016, the team approached A. R. Rahman to work on the film as music composer.[6] After the composer turned down the request, VTV Ganesh also enquired with Anirudh Ravichander before signing on Harris Jayaraj.[7] Later, Santhanam announced that actor STR will make his debut as composer in the film. Sharing the news on his Twitter page on Sunday, Santhanam wrote: "It's my godfather and wonderful human Silambarasan, who is going to compose music for first time for this film 'Sakka Podu Podu Raja'."
