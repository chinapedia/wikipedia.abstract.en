CARLOS ROSARIO INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL is a charter school for adults in Washington D.C..


History

The Carlos Rosario Adult Education Center was started in the 1930s at Gordon Junior High, 35th and T Streets NW in Burleith, Washington, D.C..

Its first program, "Program of English Instruction for Latin Americans," (PEILA) was started by Marcelo Fernandez. In 1972, Sonia Gutierrez was named director of PEILA. In 1978, PEILA was merged with Gordon Junior High and Americanization School forming the Gordon Center.

In 1992, the Gordon Center was renamed to Carlos Rosario Center in memory of Carlos Manuel Rosario. The school functioned until 1996 and had 1,600 students during that year.

In 1996, the District of Columbia closed the Carlos Rosario Center due to a district-wide financial crisis that eliminated all DCPS adult education programs. Afterwards, Sonia Gutierrez raised $150,000, while working from her basement, to reopen the center as a private, non-profit school.

In 1997, the Carlos Rosario International Career Center opened as a non-profit organization under Sonia Gutierrez's leadership.It was located at the Calvary Baptist Church in Chinatown.[1] [2]

In 1998, Gutierrez won approval from the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board to establish the Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School. It was the first adult charter school in the United States.[3]

In 2004 Carlos Rosario opened a new building at 1100 Harvard Street, Columbia Heights, NW. In 2006 Carlos Rosario Career Center and Carlos Rosario Charter School merged to become Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School.

The school continued to grow and expand under Gutierrez's leadership. In 2013, the Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School opened the Sonia Gutierrez Campus,[4][5] a workforce development satellite site located in Eckington, Washington, D.C., a neighborhood in the northeast of Washington, D.C., to serve an additional 500 people.

With the opening of this second campus, the school provides services to more than 2,500 students. Its support services and courses include English as a Second Language, GED in Spanish and English, technology essentials, citizenship and career training.[6]
