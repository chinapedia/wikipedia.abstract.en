PAUL RICHARD BENTLEY (born 25 July 1942) is a British stage, film and television actor, perhaps best known for playing the High Septon in the television series _Game of Thrones_. He is also a writer.


Early life

Bentley was born in Sheffield and brought up in Surrey. He attended Wimbledon College, a Jesuit grammar school, and Kingston Polytechnic. He then attended Birmingham University, achieving a BA in English literature and an MA in Drama and Theatre Arts.[1] His M.A. dissertation, on the stage history of Wagner's _Parsifal_, involved a research visit to the Wagner Festival Theatre at Bayreuth, Germany.


Career

After university Bentley moved to Munich, hoping to become an opera director. He began acting in English programmes on the Bavarian radio station Bayerischer Rundfunk. He also appeared in the film _The Last Escape_, in which he played a British spy in Bavaria in World War Two.[2]

He returned to England in 1970 and continued acting, mainly in repertory theatre, at venues including the Byre Theatre at St. Andrews, the Leicester Haymarket Theatre, the Duke's Playhouse at Lancaster, and the Newcastle Playhouse.

In 1973 Bentley wrote the book and lyrics for _Shylock_, a musical version of _The Merchant of Venice_, performed at the 1974 Edinburgh Festival. He played the title role; the composer and director was Roger Haines.[3] _Shylock_ won a Scotsman Fringe First Award.[4] In 1977 an updated version called _Fire Angel_,[5] set in a 20th century New York City Mafia nightclub, appeared at Her Majesty's Theatre, London.[6] Bentley was the alternate leading man, his first West End part. A revised version of the original _Shylock_ was produced at the Leicester Haymarket Studio Theatre in 1981[7] and at the Manchester Library Theatre in 1982.[8] Bentley again played the title role and Haines directed both productions.

Bentley's second West End show was in Tommy Steele's _Singin' In The Rain_ at the London Palladium.[9] In 1985 he went to Dublin to play Captain Corcoran in _H.M.S. Pinafore_, which transferred to the Old Vic in 1986[10] and for which Bentley was nominated for an Olivier Award for the Outstanding Performance of the Year by an Actor in a Musical.[11] This success led to four back-to-back West End shows lasting five years: _Lend Me A Tenor_, _Follies_, _Cats_ and _Aspects of Love_. Next came an off-West-End _Assassins_ followed by a national tour of _Aspects of Love_,[12] then _Phantom of the Opera_ in Manchester[13] and back to London for _Company_, _Kiss Me Kate_ and _Dame Edna – the Spectacle_.[14] Bentley has other radio, television and film credits but most of his work has been in theatre.

In 1994 Bentley was asked by the Danish composer Poul Ruders to write the libretto for his opera _The Handmaid's Tale_ based on Margaret Atwood's novel,[15] which won a Cannes Classical Award and Reumert Prize.[16][17] In _A Handmaid's Diary_, Bentley tells the story of the opera from the first phone call to the first night (directed by Phyllida Lloyd).[18] Ruders' and Bentley's second opera was _Kafka's Trial_.[19][20] Librettos for three other composers followed: Ana Sokolovic's _The Midnight Court_,[21] Dominique Le Gendre's _Bird of Night_[22] and James Rolfe's _Inês_.[23]

Bentley has also written a novel, _The Man Who Came After Hyacinth Bobo_, about the Fourth Crusade and the Siege of Constantinople, published in Greek[24] and English,[25] plus occasional newspaper and magazine articles. Bentley's latest works include _Inquisition_, a play about the famous Jesuit scientist Teilhard de Chardin, and a radio play in which Jane Austen meets Lord Byron.


Personal life

Paul Bentley married Annie Healey in 1979. They met at the Byre Theatre, St. Andrews, where Annie was an assistant stage manager. They have two daughters, Emma and Rebecca, who both work in the theatre. Bentley's sister, the novelist Ursula Bentley, died in 2004.[26]

Bentley took part in _Mastermind_ on BBC TV (15 March 1992) where his specialist subject was The Life and Works of King Ludwig II of Bavaria.[27] He lost in this first round with a score of 29.

He is a member of the Wagner Society and the Society for the Promotion of Byzantine Studies. He was the Founder Chairman of the British Association for Modern Mosaic from 1999 to 2005[28] and remains a member. He is the editor of the website _Mosaic Matters_,[29] a website about mosaics, and he also edits the British Teilhard Network.
