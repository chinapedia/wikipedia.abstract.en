The YAROSLAVSKY SUBURBAN DIRECTION OF MOSCOW RAILWAY () is one of ten directions used for suburban railway connections between Moscow, Russia, and surrounding areas, mostly in Moscow Oblast. The Yaroslavsky Suburban Direction connects Moscow with the stations in the northeast, in particular, with the towns of Mytishchi, Korolyov, Fryazino, Shchyolkovo, Pushkino, Krasnoarmeysk, Sergiyev Posad, Strunino, and Alexandrov. The stations the direction serves are located in Moscow, as well as in Mytishchinsky, Shchyolkovsky, Noginsky, Pushkinsky, and Sergiyevo-Posadsky Districts of Moscow Oblast, as well as Alexandrovsky District of Vladimir Oblast and the towns of Korolyov, Fryazino, and Krasnoarmeysk. The suburban trains have their northern terminus at Moscow Yaroslavskaya railway station in Moscow. In the northwestern direction, the suburban trains terminate at the stations of Bolshevo, Fryazino Passazhirskaya, Monino, Shchyolkovo, Fryazevo, Pushkino, Sofrino, Krasnoarmeysk, Sergiyev Posad, Alexandrov, and Balakirevo.[1] The direction is served by the Moscow Railway.

The suburban direction follows the railway which connects Moscow with Yaroslavl and continues to Arkhangelsk in the north and Vladivostok in the south. It is electrified (dc current) between Moscow and Balakirevo (and further to Danilov). Between Moscow and Balakirevo, there are at least two tracks.[2] The distance between Yaroslavsky railway station and Balakirevo is . In Fryazevo, the railway connects to Gorkovsky suburban direction of Moscow Railway. The stretch between 81 km and Alexandrov coincides with the Greater Ring of the Moscow Railway.


History

The construction of the railway between Moscow and Sergiyev Posad was completed in 1862. In 1869, it was extended to Yaroslavl. The railway line between Mytishchi and Fryazevo was open in several installments: In 1895, to Shchyolkovo, in 1929 to Monino, in 1930 to Ivanteyevka, in 1935 to Fryazino, and in 1970 to Fryazevo.[3]

In the 1920s, Yaroslavsky suburban direction became the first suburban direction in the Soviet Union to be electrified. In 1929, the electrification was completed between Moscow and Mytishchi. In 1930, the electrification was extended to Pushkino and Shchyolkovo, in 1931 to Sofrino, and in 1932 to Zagorsk (currently Sergiyev Posad). In the 1930s, some suburban trains run to Mytishchi and then were separated, with one part running to Pushkino, and another one to Shchyolkovo. The far distance passenger trains were still moved by steam locomotives. In 1937, the electrification was extended to Alexandrov. However, the stretch between Moscow and Zagorsk used dc current with 1500 Volts, and the one between Zagorsk and Alexandrov used dc current with 3000 Volts, therefore it was not suitable for suburban trains. In 1949, first suburban trains able to work with both voltages appeared, subsequently the railway platforms between Zagorsk and Alexandrov were raised to serve these trains, and in 1949 direct suburban trains from Moscow started to serve Alexandrov.[4] During World War II, the wires were removed, and suburban trains were moved by steam locomotives, however, in 1943 the suburban direction was re-electrified.[5] In 1934, a stretch between Mytishchi and Chkalovakaya was electrified. In 1936, the electrification was extended to Monino, in 1948 to Fryazino. A stretch between Monino and Fryazevo was constructed electrified. In 1994, the electrification was extended to Krasnoarmeysk, and direct trains from Moscow started running.[6]

In 1900, a railway line connecting Beskudnikovo and Losinoostrovskaya was constructed. This was done in order to facilitate the railway traffic between Moscow and Kimry (Savyolovo), since Moscow Savyolovskaya railway station was not open yet.[7] After a tram line from central line to Medvedkovo was built, in 1966 a direct connection to Losinoostrovskaya was discontinued, and the whole railway line was demolished in 1987.[8]

In 1930, a railway line between Mytishchi and Pirogovo was constructed. It was closed down in 1997 and subsequently demolished.[9]
