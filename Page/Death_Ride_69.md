The band also featured contributions from Mark Blasquez, Ethan Port, Wrex Mock, Dave Haas and Buc Bono.

History

Death Ride 69 was founded in Washington, D.C. by Linda LeSabre and Don Diego. The later relocated to Los Angeles and were joined by Dave Haas and Wrex Mock. The band's self-titled debut album was released in 1988 by Little Sister Records and contained all the tracks from their _Elvis Christ_ EP.[2] LeSabre reformed the band as a trio with Ethan Port, formerly of Savage Republic and Buc Bono and issued another EP titled _Red Sea_ in 1989.[3]

The band went on hiatus in the early nineties and reformed as a duo with Mark Blasquez joining LeSabre.[4] They were signed to Fifth Colvmn Records and issued their second full-length album _Screaming Down the Gravity Well_ in 1996.[5] Marco Gariboldi of _Fabryka_ called the album "a crescendo of harsh guitars, distortions and hammering drums directed by the high and charismatic voice of Linda" and "a very good album by an underrated and forgotten band."[6][7]
