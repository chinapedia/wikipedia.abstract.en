_BELLADONNA OF SADNESS_ is the debut studio album by American singer Alexandra Savior, released on April 7, 2017 by Columbia Records.


Background and recording

The recording process for _Belladonna of Sadness_ was captured by film director Ben Chappell in the video "Alexandra Savior – An Introduction", which featured on Savior's YouTube channel. In June 2016, Savior stated in an interview that the studio setup for the album mostly consisted of collaborators Alex Turner and James Ford, with the three occasionally augmented by bassist Zachary Dawes.


Reception

_Belladonna of Sadness_ was released to mostly positive reviews. Paste praised Savior's singing, comparing her style to Françoise Hardy and Lana del Rey.[1]

In a mixed review, Pitchfork praised the "eerie, campy" quality of songs like "Bones" and "Mystery Girl," but criticized the album as too closely resembling her collaborators' body of work, deeming it "an Alex Turner album passed off as Savior’s simply because she sang it."[2]
