CSI-GARRISON WESLEY CHURCH (built in 1853)[1] located in Trimulgherry is among[2] the oldest churches in Secunderabad under the auspices of the Protestant Church of South India (CSI) within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak. Situated in Lal Bazar civilian area of the Secunderabad Cantonment, the CSI-Garrison Wesley Church is in near vicinity of the Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME), and the church has continued to attract not only its regular worshipers but also the new visitors from the nearby military stations of the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force through its regular Sunday Mass as well as its annual Good Friday, Easter and Christmas programmes.[3]

Though the Sunday Mass was begun initially in accordance with the Wesleyan Methodist traditions since the beginnings in 1881,[4] it now follows the Church of South India liturgy as the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS), the co-founders[5] of the church, had unionized[6] itself into the Church of South India that was formed on 27 September 1947[7] at the CSIâ€“St. George's Cathedral, Chennai. Wesleyan Methodists form a substantial majority of the parishioners of the Diocese of Medak,[8] wherease Anglicans form a very small minority; together they regard the Medak Cathedral as theirs and look to their Bishop for divine leadership.


Renovation and rededication

Renovation

Since the edifice had been standing for more than 150 years, efforts were initiated in 2013[9] during the then Presbyter-in-charge Pastor, The Reverend S. P. Vidyasagar[10] to raise awareness about the aging rafters and garner majority opinion from the members of the church who stood for restoration of the church _in lieu_ of demolition and reconstruction of a new edifice. The Pastorate Secretary Mr. D. Sudesh Kumar, inspired[11] the church to raise contributions in order to restore the edifice and willing members then responded by making significant contributions to take up the restoration works at a cost of Indian Rupees 10 million (1 crore),[12] entrusting the work to a Tamil Nadu restoration architect M/s. APTSORBH, Mr. Rajan Proprietor.[13]

Rededication

After the efforts put in by the Pastorate Committee for nearly two years, the newly restored edifice was rededicated on 21 December 2014 by The Most Reverend G. Dyvasirvadam who by then had become Moderator of the Church of South India Synod which was directly overseeing the ecclesiastical affairs of the Diocese of Medak. The Congregation recognizes the Initiative by Rev. S.P. Vidyasagar and the pastorate Committee led by Mr. D. Sudesh Kumar. Rev. S.P. Vidyasagar who retired in 2014 and subsequently Rev. Jyothy was posted at CSI Garrison Wesley Church, the Rededication Mass was witnessed by the entire Congregation with a procession in the Lalbazaar area in the presence of then Vice Chairman, Rev. A. C. Solomon Raj, who is now the Bishop in Medak.

Recognition

In 2015,[14] the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage awarded its Heritage Award to six[15] establishments, one of which was the CSI-Garrison Wesley Church, recognizing the efforts put in for renovating and restoring the church.[16]
