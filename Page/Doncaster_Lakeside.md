Coordinates DONCASTER LAKESIDE is a recreational area and shopping complex centred on a lake, around 3 km or 2 miles SE of Doncaster town centre, in the area of Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council. In recent years it has been expanded and modernised. Barratt Developments have built two developments in the area - 'Serenity@Lakeside' and 'Belle Vue' - under the David Wilson Homes and Barratt Homes brands, respectively. After completion, the area has settled vegetation, paths, bridges, notice boards and public gatherings.


Exercise

A popular path for walkers, joggers and cyclists surrounds the lake. It follows the perimeter of the lake and is about 2 miles or 3.5 kilometres long.

Swans

This lake is home to a flock of mute swans which have the gene for leucism.

In around 1800 some swans were brought in from Poland and were called Polish swans. At first, they were thought to be a new species, which was named _cygnus immutabilis_. Compared to normal mute swans, these swans are whiter, and their legs are pinkish, not dark. Later, modern science discovered the variant in the swans' DNA and confirmed that it was not a new species but a different allele.

Bats

  After sunset the resident bats show their themselves. Pipistrelle, Noctule, Daubentons, Brandts and Natterers have been heard on walks around Lakeside.[2]
