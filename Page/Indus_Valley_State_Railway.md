The INDUS VALLEY STATE RAILWAY was a railway founded in 1871 to provide a rail link between Kotri and Multan and to replace the Indus Steam Flotilla.[1][2] The opening of the line thus connected Karachi with Lahore.


History

The survey of the Indus Valley railway line began in 1869 and was undertaken by John Brunton, the Chief Resident Engineer of Scinde Railway, and assisted by his son William Arthur Brunton. The Empress Bridge, opened in 1878, carried the IVSR over the Sutlej River near Bahawalpur. The Indus and Sutlej rivers were seen as major impediments in the expansion of the railways. The IVSR had reached Rohri in 1879 and a steam ferry would transport eight wagons at a time across the Indus River between from Rohri to Sukkur. This was found to be cumbersome and time-consuming. The opening of Lansdowne Bridge in 1889 solved this bottleneck, as rail traffic could now travel from Karachi uninterrupted to Lahore. The Indus Valley State Railway was merged in 1886 to form the North Western State Railway. Today, this line forms a section of the Karachi-Peshawar Railway Line.
