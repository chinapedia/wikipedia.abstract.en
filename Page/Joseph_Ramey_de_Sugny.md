Marie Gabriel Joseph de Ramey was born in Paris. His father was Marie "Jacques" Henri de Ramey, the Viscount of Sugny (after the death of his elder brother, the Count of Sugny). Joseph's uncle was the politician Francisque-Joseph Ramey, the Count of Sugny (1825-1908). His mother, born Marie Louise "Isabelle" Le Bègue, was the daughter of the banker-politician Charles Le Bègue de Germiny (1799 - 1871). Both Joseph's own marriages would be to women from well placed families.[3]

He joined the navy at Toulon in 1873. He studied at the Prytanée National military academy and at the French Naval Academy. de Ramey was appointed a Midshipman Class 2 in August 1875 and embarked on his first posting, aboard the frigate "Renomée".

In the meantime, he became a knight of the Légion d'Honneur on 19 December 1886.[6] His hydrographical researches also led to his being attached to the Naval Hydrographic Service (_"Service hydrographique et océanographique de la Marine"_ / SHOM).
