The MEN'S EIGHT competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics, also referred to as MEN'S COXED EIGHT (M8+), took place at the rowing basin on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was held from 18 to 25 July and was won by the team from East Germany.


Background

Whilst the East German team was considered to be the favourite, the event was wide open and many teams could have won it.[1] The United States had in the past dominated the event and up until and including the 1964 Summer Olympics, they had won nine out of ten Olympic golds.[2] Whilst their dominance had since waned, they were still considered possible medal contenders, as they had won the 1974 World Rowing Championships. East Germany had won the 1973 European Rowing Championships (the event was discontinued after 1973), and the 1975 World Rowing Championships, and they had won bronze at the 1972 Olympics. The New Zealand team had won the event at the previous Summer Olympics, had won bronze at the last two World Rowing Championships, and four of their 1972 Olympic rowers plus their cox returned to Montreal.[3] Other medallist at these major rowing events were Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain.[4][5]
