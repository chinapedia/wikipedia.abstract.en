_THE CALLOUS HEART_ is the second extended play (EP) by English horror punk band Creeper. Recorded with producer Neil Kennedy at The Ranch Production House in Southampton, it was originally released in the UK on 18 September 2015 as the band's first release since signing with major label Roadrunner Records in June 2015. The EP was later issued internationally on 15 January 2016.

Written by vocalist Will Gould and guitarists Ian Miles and Sina Nemati, _The Callous Heart_ was supported by the release of music videos for "Lie Awake", "The Honeymoon Suite" and "Allergies". The EP was Creeper's last release to feature Nemati, who left the band in December 2015. Media response to the release was generally positive, with some critics noting a progression from 2014's _Creeper_.


Background

Following the release and promotion of their self-titled debut EP, Creeper announced on 8 June 2015 that they had signed a recording contract with major label Roadrunner Records.[1] As part of the announcement, they also released the first track and music video from their upcoming second EP, entitled "Lie Awake", which was described in the Roadrunner press release as "the first instalment of a two part story of life, love and obsession".[2] Speaking to _Upset_ magazine shortly after the news was announced, vocalist Will Gould described "Lie Awake" as "the ultimate Creeper song",[3] as well as explaining to _Kerrang!_ that "I wrote this at a time when we were on tour and struggling to sleep. I would lie awake worrying about this life, my lifestyle, my relationships with people back home and the things I've missed out on!"[4] "The Honeymoon Suite" was released as the second song from the EP on 10 August, with the video marking the second part of the story which began with "Lie Awake".[5]

Prior to its release, _The Callous Heart_ was made available for free online streaming on the band's website for 48 hours.[6] The EP was officially released on 18 September 2015, with the band celebrating the release with a launch show at The Old Blue Last in London.[7] A third music video, for the song "Allergies", was released on 23 September.[8] In promotion of the EP, Creeper supported influential horror punk band Misfits on a UK tour in August, followed by a number of shows with emo group Moose Blood in September.[9] In October, they also joined newly formed hardcore punk band Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes on tour in the UK.[10] _The Callous Heart_ was released internationally on 15 January 2016, when it was made available digitally for the first time outside of the UK.[11]


Critical reception

Media response to _The Callous Heart_ was generally positive. Reviewing the EP for _Upset_ magazine, Ali Shutler praised all five tracks and dubbed the release "bewitching".[12] Speaking about the style of the music on the EP, Shutler added that "The storytelling transport that gave _Creeper_ its charm is alive and well here, but instead of scratching tales by candlelight, Creeper are standing, arms outstretched, ready and willing to pull you into this world. And what a world it is."[13] _Kerrang!_ awarded the EP four out of five,[14] while Cassie Whitt of _Alternative Press_ described the style of "The Honeymoon Suite" to bands such as AFI and Tiger Army.[15]
