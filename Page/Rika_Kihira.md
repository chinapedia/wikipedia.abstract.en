RIKA KIHIRA (; born July 21, 2002) is a Japanese figure skater. She is the 2019 Four Continents champion, 2018–19 Grand Prix Final champion, 2018 NHK Trophy champion, 2018 Internationaux de France champion, 2018 CS Ondrej Nepela Trophy champion, the 2017–18 Japan Junior national champion and a two-time senior national medalist. She finished within the top ten at the 2018 World Junior Championships.

Kihira is one of nine women to have landed the triple Axel jump in a senior international competition. She is the first ever woman to land a triple axel-triple jump combination in an international competition organized by the International Skating Union[1]. To date, along with Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, she is one of only two women who have attempted the maximum number of triple jumps allowed in senior international competition: four in the short program and eight in the long program (see Zayak rule). At the 2018 NHK Trophy and at the 2019 Four Continents Championships, she cleanly landed eight triple jumps in the long program.[2][3] At the 2018-19 Grand Prix Final[4] and the 2019 World Team Trophy[5] competitions, she cleanly landed four fully rotated triple jumps in the short program. By the end of the 2018-2019 season, however, she had not cleanly landed all her triple jumps in the short and the long program in the same competition.


Personal life

Kihira was born on July 21, 2002 in Nishinomiya, Japan.[6]


Career

Kihira began learning to skate in 2007.[7] In the 2015–16 season, she competed on the advanced novice level, winning gold at the Triglav Trophy.

She is coached by Mie Hamada and Yamato Tamura in Takatsuki, Osaka.[8]

2016–17 season: International junior debut

Kihira made her Junior Grand Prix (JGP) debut in the 2016–17 season. In early September, she won the silver medal in Ostrava, Czech Republic, with a total score 0.08 less than Anastasiia Gubanova of Russia. Later that month, she outscored World junior champion Marin Honda by 15.49 points for the gold in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Kihira landed a triple Axel jump in the free skate.[9] She qualified to the 2016–17 JGP Final in Marseille, France, where she finished fourth.

2017–18 season

Kihira began her season winning a gold medal at the Asian Trophy in Hong Kong. She was able to land a triple Axel in her free skate.[10]

Kihira was assigned JGP events in Latvia and Italy. In her first event at JGP Riga, Kihira placed sixth in the short program after stepping out of her triple flip and falling on her triple Lutz. She finished second overall behind Daria Panenkova after winning the free skate. In her next event at JGP Egna, she won the bronze medal behind Sofia Samodurova and Alena Kostornaia after placing second in the short program and third in the free skate. The results qualified her for her second JGP Final in Nagoya, Japan over Mako Yamashita through a tie breaker.[11] At the 2017 JGP Final, she became the first ever woman to land a triple Axel-triple jump combination in an international competition organized by the International Skating Union. She was the only non-Russian competitor and finished fourth overall, following a popped Axel and an underrotation on another jump.[12]

Kihira won the gold medal at Junior Nationals. She placed sixth in the short program, but rebounded in the free skate with a triple Axel and triple Axel-triple toe loop-double toe loop.[13]

On the senior level, Kihira won the bronze medal at Japanese Nationals, after placing fifth in the short program and second in the free skate. As she was age-ineligible to compete as a senior, she was sent to the 2018 World Junior Championships, where she placed eighth.[14]

2018–19 season: Grand Prix Final & Four Continents gold

Making her senior debut, Kihira began the season at the 2018 Ondrej Nepela Trophy, an ISU Challenger Series event. Kihira placed first in both programs and won the gold medal, despite falling on her triple Axel attempt in the short program.

Making her Grand Prix debut at 2018 NHK Trophy, Kihira was fifth in the short program after underrotating and falling on her triple Axel again. She placed first in the free skate with a solo triple Axel, a triple Axel-triple toe loop, and eight triple jumps in total. She won the gold medal overall. In doing so, she finished ahead of compatriot and reigning Japanese national champion Satoko Miyahara and 2015 World Champion Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, who also performed a triple Axel in her free program. She admitted afterward: "When I finished my short program, I didn’t think I would be up here today. The short program motivated me to be good today."[15] At the Internationaux de France, Kihira singled the triple Axel in the short program, placing third. In the free skate she underrotated her sole triple Axel attempt, but still placed first and captured her second Grand Prix gold medal. Kihira stated that she was glad to have won, but was unsatisfied with her performance.[16]

The 2018–19 Grand Prix Final was regarded by many commentators as a contest between Kihira and reigning Olympic champion Alina Zagitova, who had been forced to withdraw from the Ondrej Nepela Trophy earlier due to visa issues.[17] Kihira won the short program with a world record score of 82.51, landing the triple Axel in the short program for the first time that season. She then placed first in the free skate with a score of 150.61 and won the gold medal, despite downgrading and falling on her opening triple Axel.[18]

Kihira entered the 2018 Japanese National Championships as a favourite to take the national title, but she struggled with boot problems in the competition, and made multiple errors in the short program that left her in fifth place going into the free skate. She placed first in the free skate, her only mistake being a downgraded Euler in her three-jump combination. However, she won the silver medal overall in front of training mate and four-time national champion Satoko Miyahara. The gold medal went to Kaori Sakamoto.[19]

At the 2019 Four Continents Championships, Kihira initially "hesitated" at including the triple Axel in the short program, but chose to do so, and singled it. She placed fifth in the short.[20] In the free program, Kihira landed one triple Axel and substituted a double Axel-triple toe loop combination for the second, winning both the free program and the overall championship decisively. She observed: "During this season, I learned how to keep my concentration in my free skating no matter what happens in my short program."[21]

Kihira was one of three Japanese ladies assigned to the 2019 World Championships, held in Saitama, and based on her season up until that point was widely considered the favourite to win the title. In the short program, she once again singled her triple Axel attempt, leaving her in seventh place and outside of the final group of six skaters.[22] She came second in the free skate, earning a silver small medal, but a mistake on her second triple Axel meant she missed the main podium. In fourth overall, she was 0.31 points behind bronze medalist Evgenia Medvedeva and 1.27 points behind silver medalist Elizabet Tursynbaeva. It was the only podium Kihira missed in the season, and the only international competition she did not win.[23]

Kihira concluded the season as part of Team Japan at the 2019 World Team Trophy. She landed the triple Axel in the short program for only the second time that season, setting another world record of 83.97. However, Kihira fell twice in the free, once on her opening triple Axel, and the other on her triple Lutz+triple Toeloop combination, placing 5th. Team Japan won the silver medal overall.[24]


Skating technique

Kihira is regarded by analysts to be a complete skater, praised for both her technical and artistic skills. “You can talk about the triple axel all you want, but there is a little bit of everything there," remarked Kurt Browning. Tara Lipinski also noted her all-around ability: “We focus so much on her jumps, which are incredible. But what’s interesting to me is she’s mature beyond her years. She has such a solid base and foundation when it comes to her skating skills and ice coverage and extension." [25]

Kihira is known for her difficult jump layouts. She is the first female skater to land eight fully rotated triples in a program. She has landed triple Axels and triple Axel-triple toe loops in international competition, being the only female skater to achieve the latter. She was the youngest lady to land the triple axel in an ISU-sanctioned competition, until Alysa Liu. She has also executed a triple Axel-triple toe loop-double toe loop in domestic competition. She is training the quad toe loop and quad salchow.

Kihira also notably has correct technique on all her jumps. Her toe jumps (toe loop, flip, and lutz) have the proper toepick assist. Her lutz has the correct takeoff edge, which is uncommon among the top ladies skaters. Her coach Mie Hamada recalled that Kihira used to have an outside edge on her flip, a flaw that she was able to fix.

Kihira also used to have problems with under-rotating her jumps. However, she was able to mostly get her under-rotations under control by her senior debut.
