History

Early history

Carl_van_Manders_gård.JPG The house, then a two-storey building, was built in the middle of the 17th century. The artist Karel van Mander III lived in it for a few years after his return to Copenhagen from Italy in the late 17th century.

1776–1859: The Royal Club

Gottlieb Schreck purchased the building in 1775. He adapted the building for use by Fich's Club (Fichs Klub), a gentlemen's club for members of the bourgeoisie founded in 1776. It had 25 members at the time of its creation but the number of members had grown to approximately 8+ in 1778. The activities included concerts. It was renamed The Royal Club (Kongens Klub) by royal resolution of 16 November 1782. The name was associated with the building even after the club moved out in about 1850.

The Funen portrait photographer Jens Petersen opened a Photographic studio in the building when he moved his business from Svendborg to Copenhagen in 1863. He was appointed to royal photographer in 1864 and was that same year by Georg Emil Hansen sent to Jutland as war photographer during the Second Schleswig War. In 1864, he moved his studio to the Harsdorff House in Kongens Nytorv.

The photography studio Hansen, Schou & Weller was from 1872 based in the building. Niels Christian Hansen had founded the company in 1862, Albert Schou had become a partner in 1867 and Clemens Weller in 1869. In 1885, it moved to new premises in the Schimmelmann Mansion in Bredgade.[1]

1910 and later: Ole Haslund's Antique Store

The art dealers Ole Haslund and Svend Heyman acquired the building in 1910. They created an antique store of international reputation in the building.. The antiques were mostly acquired on trips to Spain, Italy, France and Belgium. In 1918–19Haslund and Heyman, assisted by the architect H. P. Jacobsen, expanded the complex with an extra floor. With Heymans 's death in 1932, Haslund became the sole owner of the company. In 1940, he ceded all shares in the company to the Haslund Art Foundation. In 1942, the company moved to new premises at Amagertorv 14.[2]
