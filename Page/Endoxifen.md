ENDOXIFEN, also known as _N_-DESMETHYL-4-HYDROXYTAMOXIFEN, is a chemical that is under development for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.[1] It is also being evaluated as an antipsychotic for treatment of mania and other psychotic disorders.[2]

Endoxifen is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group. It is an active metabolite of tamoxifen and has been found to be effective in patients that have failed previous hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant).[3][4][5] The prodrug tamoxifen is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme to produce afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen) and endoxifen.[6]
