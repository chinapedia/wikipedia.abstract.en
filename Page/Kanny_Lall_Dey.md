At the International Exhibition of 1862 at London, Kanny Lall contributed a collection of medicinal oils and drugs and received two medals. He also contributed to the Great Exhibition of 1878 at Paris. He also contributed descriptions to the Pharmacopoeia of India. Wishing that Indian medical officers would gain a knowledge of India's _Materia Medica_, he set about preparing a text on the topic in 1877. At the Calcutta Exhibition of 1883-84, he was a judge for about fifteen sections.[2][3]

Dey was titled Rai Bahadur in 1872 and recognized in 1863 by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and made an Honorary Member, a "distinction which is reserved ... for the world's fifty most eminent men of science related to pharmacy."
