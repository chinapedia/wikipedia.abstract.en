New headquarters

Ten years after its opening, Fundación Proa faced a renewal process that concluded in 2008 with the opening of its new headquarters. It is an old building Italianate facade and three floors with four exhibition halls, a multimedia auditorium, a specialized library, a restaurant and terrace, plus spaces for action and opening to the public and a transparent facade to communicate experiences from inside to the neighborhood. The project and direction of works is the Caruso-Torricella Milan studio, the same as in 1996 transformed the old building into an iconic landmark for contemporary art in Buenos Aires.

In the remodeling project, on both sides of the historic and restored front of the house that originally hosted the Fundación Proa in La Boca, two facades of glass incorporated contemporary style, both technologically and visually.
