History

The Leaders outwardly act as the 'figurehead' and the main representative of the party. Within the party, they must ensure political consensus. At election time the Leader is always the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the party list. In the Reformed Political Party the Leader is always the Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives.
