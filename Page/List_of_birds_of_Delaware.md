This LIST OF BIRDS OF DELAWARE includes species credibly documented in the U.S. state of Delaware and accepted by the Delaware Bird Records Committee (DBRC). As of September 2018 there were 420 species on the official list.[1] Of them, 93 are classed as accidental and six were introduced to North America. One species whose record is under review by the DBRC is not included.

Only birds that have occurred as wild individuals in Delaware are listed; this includes introduced species which have established self-sustaining populations in the wild. Birds thought to have occurred only as escapes from captivity are not included.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the _Check-list of North American Birds_, 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS).[2][3] Common and scientific names are also those of the _Check-list_.

The following tags have been used to annotate some species:

-   (A) ACCIDENTAL - occur seldom and unpredictably and require documentation for reports to be accepted by the DBRC to enter the official record
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species established by direct or indirect human intervention
