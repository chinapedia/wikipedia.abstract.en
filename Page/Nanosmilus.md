_Nanosmilus_ is a nimravid from the Oligocene (Whitneyan to Arikareean stages) of Nebraska. As a member of Feliformia, it is related to the superficially similar-appearing true cats. As such, it and nimravid genera in general are often referred to as FALSE SABER-TOOTHED CATS. No larger than a small bobcat, it is the smallest known saber-toothed mammal currently recognized by science. It is most closely related to its fellow nimravid _Eusmilus_.


Description

_Nanosmilus_ was first discovered in 1880, by Edward Drinker Cope, and described from fragmentary material. It wasn't until more complete skulls were discovered that _Nanosmilus_ became better known to science. For many decades, it was thought to be a member of the genus _Eusmilus_ and was labelled as _Eusmilus cerebralis_. Its similarities to _Eusmilus_ are such that they were often considered to be members of the same genus as recently as 2013; however, a 2016 phylogenetic analysis found it to be a separate taxon.[1] _Nanosmilus_ is more primitive than _Eusmilus_ in regards to its anatomy. Its skull is narrower than both _Hoplophoneus_ and _Eusmilus_ and its sagittal crest, which is smaller, separates into a "V" shape above the glenoid facet, which is different to the sagittal crest's divergence points in _Eusmilus_ and _Hoplophoneus_ respectively. It also differs from these genera in having narrower frontals, among other features. Its orbits are large, indicating that it had good eyesight. Unlike _Eusmilus_, _Nanosmilus_ was not equipped with the phalanges on its lower jaws that its later relative _Eusmilus_ has to protect its saber-teeth, and it likely was more vulnerable to tooth breakage due to the lack of this protective adaptation. Despite its small size, _Nanosmilus_ was still more than capable of killing animals as large as modern domestic pigs or deer, indicating it was already a specialist at hunting animals much larger than itself.[2][3]
