AFRICAN FASHION WEEK HOUSTON (AFWH) is the city's premier international fashion series that highlights the essence of African culture and aesthetics on the runway through a series of fashion shows, events, educational seminars, industry-focused workshops and special campaigns. [1]

The annual week-long experience aims to promote world-class designer collections that push the envelope on style, while staying true to the traditions and inspiration of the African continent, and the diaspora.[2]

Founded in 2014 by business and tech entrepreneur Nkem Oji-Alala, AFWH has continued to progress in the world of cultural fashion due to a unique approach of connecting with the visions of selected designers to curate their collections with the utmost attention to detail, precision, and boldness on the runway.[3]

Furthermore, as reflected across many African cultures, the organization believes in the value of community. AFWH supports aspiring professionals looking to enter the world of fashion through partnerships with notable educational institutions within the Greater Houston area. In addition, the organization frequently endorses both charitable and cultural organizations that are dedicated to welfare, growth and spirit of society. In every season, and in every tradition, African Fashion Week Houston is the ultimate connection for fashion and culture â€“ on the runway.[4]

Created by Nkem Oji-Alala in 2014, the goal was to create a fashion lifestyle brand with an emphasis on producing tangible & high-energy event concepts through the Greater Houston area.[5]
