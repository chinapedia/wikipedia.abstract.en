Biography

Engelhard is a Franciscan sister.[4] In 1961, Engelhard started at Mallersdorf Abbey as a student.[5] The nuns also helped take care of her sick mother.[6] Engelhard wanted to be a nun after her experience, but her father felt she could pursue more lucrative career choices.[7] So she thought about studying agriculture and then at the suggestion of the headmistress, studied brewing.[8] She began her apprenticeship in 1966 and in 1969, she took her vows to join the convent.[9] In 1975, she became the brewmaster in Mallersdorf Abbey, taking over from another sister who had been brewing there since the 1930s.[10] In 1977, she was brewing 3,300 pints a year.[11] Today, Mallersdorf brews about 80,000 gallons of beer a year.[12] The beer brewed at Mallersdorf is not exported and is only consumed locally.[13] The beer is untreated and needs to be drunk while it is still fresh.[14]
