The NEWS MEDIA ASSOCIATION is the voice of national, regional and local news media organisations in the UK and was created in 2014 by a merger between the Newspaper Society and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. The NMA exists to promote the interests of news media publishers to Government, regulatory authorities, industry bodies and other organisations whose work affects the industry.

The Newspaper Society, which represented local papers in the United Kingdom, was founded in 1836 and the Newspaper Publishers' Association, which represented national publishers, in 1904.[1] The two organisations had been sharing offices since 2006.

David Newell, NMA CEO, was appointed an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2017 for services to the newspaper and publishing industries.

The new organisation represents digital as well as print based media. It supports the Independent Publishers' Forum.[2]
