ET-188 was a IBM PC XT compatible computer made by the Yugoslav company Novkabel (Novosadska fabrika kabela - Novi Sad Cable Factory) from Novi Sad (now Serbia) in the 1980s. Novkabel already had experience in developing computer systems (ERA 20, ERA 60 and others) which was used to make ET-188 as an original design, compatible with IBM PC XT.[1] To save space and to lower the cost, ET-188 used 8MHz Intel 80188 CPU, with integrated timer, DMA and interrupt controller. This also made it faster than the original XT. ET-188 was offered to the public in 1985 and advertised in the Yugoslav computer press.[2]

An improved ET-188A model was in May 1986 presented to the public at the Belgrade Technical Fair (Beogradski sajam tehnike) with more RAM and a new redesigned case.[3] Among other things, ET-188A was used for education in classrooms throughout Vojvodina province.[4]
