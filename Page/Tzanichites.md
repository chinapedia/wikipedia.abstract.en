The TZANICHITES () were an aristocratic family of Laz origin,[1] from TZANICHA (; ), central Chaldia region of Pontus. According to the historian Anthony Bryer, after 1355 the Tzanichites took the positions that the Kabazites family had occupied in the Trebizond Empire; that of _doukes_ of Chaldia. The most famous of the Tzanichites were: Theodore, John, Sevastos, Stephen, Michael and two Constantines.
