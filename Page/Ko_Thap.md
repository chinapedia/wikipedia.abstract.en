KO THAP (, "Thap Island", sometimes spelled _Tub_) is an island in Krabi Province, Thailand. This island is a member of the Poda Archipelago, which is composed of Poda Island, Tub Island, Mor Island and Kai Island. Locals refer to Tab Island as Koh Tub.[1]


Activities

Aside from having beaches, a coral reef surrounds the area, which has attracted snorkeling and other outdoor activities.[2]


Separated Sea

At low tide, the three islands link together, forming a "Tha-le Waek" (Separated sea). Tourists can walk across the beach to all of the islands.[3]
