JORGE NICOLÁS FIGAL (born 3 April 1994) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a defender for Primera División side Independiente.[1][2]


Career

Figal's career began with then-Primera B Nacional side Independiente in 2014, with his debut for the first-team coming on 4 May against Gimnasia de Jujuy; a match Independiente lost 1–0.[3][4] Figal made five more appearances in all competitions in his first season with the club as they were promoted into the Primera División. His top division debut came on 10 August 2014 in a 3–0 home victory versus Atlético de Rafaela. Eighteen more appearances came in the rest of 2014 and in the following season, 2015, before he was loaned out to Primera División club Olimpo in February 2016.[5]

In his ninth appearance for Olimpo, Figal scored his first professional goal against Rosario Central, a team he received his first red card of his career against in September 2014, on 2 April. He returned to Independiente in June ahead of the 2016–17 Argentine Primera División campaign.[6][7] On 14 September 2017, Figal was banned from football for nine months after failing a drugs test, testing positive for diuretic. The ban was backdated, meaning he was unavailable for selection until 4 January 2018; six months after the announcement.[8][9] He returned to action on 24 January, playing the full ninety minutes in a draw with Rosario Central.[10]
