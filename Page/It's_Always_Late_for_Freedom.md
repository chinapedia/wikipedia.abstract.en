Film reviews

-   The film expresses the obvious and fundamentally negative aspects of juvenile incarceration[27]

By Omid Tofighian

It’s Always Late for Freedom is a film about the most sensitive moments associated with transition and the most potent emotions it evokes. The film is about a ‘rite of passage’ or, more accurately, a ‘baptism of fire’ that three children are initiated through. On a more theoretical level, the film can also be interpreted as a simile expressing the trials and tribulations of societies or nations during the course of progress.

Mehrdad Oskouei’s documentary must not simply be seen as only a tale about the lives of children in a juvenile detention centre. It is also a reflection of some of the most compelling problems faced by individuals as they struggle toward maturity and the strongest emotions felt as they grapple with social and personal evolution. Stages of development and their corresponding emotions are depicted through the experiences of Oskouei’s three protagonists, Vahid, Ali and Sajad. By describing the ordeal of three boys in a house of correction he is simultaneously prescribing possibilities for instilling hope; gaining knowledge through feelings of regret; and understanding the significance of innocence in the face of injustice.
