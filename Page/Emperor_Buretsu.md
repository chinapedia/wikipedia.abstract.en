Legendary narrative

Buretsu is considered to have ruled the country during the late-fifth century and early-sixth century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

Buretsu was a son of Emperor Ninken and his mother is . His name was . He had no children.


Buretsu's reign

Buretsu's contemporary title would not have been _tennō_, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Buretsu might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".

Buretsu is described as an essentially wicked historical figure. _Nihonshoki_ likened him to Di Xin of the Shang dynasty, but the record in _Kojiki_ has no such indication. There are several theories on this difference. Some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor Emperor Keitai, who took over under questionable circumstances. In history textbooks available before and during World War II, part of Buretsu's record was intentionally omitted.

If Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Buretsu is the last Emperor of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.[4]

The actual site of Buretsu's grave is not known.[5] The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Buretsu's mausoleum. It is formally named _Kataoka no Iwatsuki no oka no kita no misasagi_.[6]
