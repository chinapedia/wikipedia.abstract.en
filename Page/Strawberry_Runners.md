Strawberry_Runners_in_Burlington_VT_2017.jpg STRAWBERRY RUNNERS is an American rock band, and the primary music project of songwriter, Emi Night. The band started in Denver, Colorado and is now based primarily in Philadelphia.[1] Strawberry Runners' songs tell the story of Night's childhood growing up in the Ohio River Valley.[2] Originally named "Summer Salt", the band made their debut at Plan-It-X Fest (music festival put on by Plan-It-X Records) in Bloomington, Indiana in the summer of 2011. Night played a handful of solo concerts under this name throughout 2011 and 2012, before reforming the band and officially changing their name in 2013.

Strawberry Runners was named "One of Ten Bands About to Blow Up" by _Wired_ in 2015,[3] after making NPR's Austin 100 list ahead of the 2015 SXSW music festival.[4]
