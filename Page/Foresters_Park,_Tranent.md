FORESTERS PARK is a sports ground and former greyhound racing track in Tranent, East Lothian, Scotland.[1]

Facilities include two floodlit training areas, a 3G pitch and climbing wall. The sports ground is administered by East Lothian Council.

The Tranent greyhound track was built around the football ground at Foresters Park in 1936.[2] The opening night for greyhound racing was 7 July 1936.[3] and racing took place two evenings per week with the gate money being shared with the landlords, the Tranent Juniors F.C.[4] The greyhound racing which was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) ended in the mid-fifties.
