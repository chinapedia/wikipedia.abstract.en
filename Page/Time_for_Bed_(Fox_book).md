Reception

_Booklist_ wrote "Although the rhyme at times limps rather than lilts, there's a warmth to this that makes the whole more than the sum of its parts. Of course, one of the important parts is the art.."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ wrote "Charming illustrations and comfortable rhymes characterize this appealing bedtime book."[2]

It has also been reviewed by _Kirkus Reviews_,[3] _Publishers Weekly_,[4] and Common Sense Media.[5]
