_CORYMBIA PARACTIA_, commonly known as the CABLE BEACH GHOST GUM,[1] is a member of the genus _Corymbia_ native to Western Australia.[2]

The tree, which often has several stems, typically grows to a height of but can reach . The bark is smooth and white in colour which sheds in thin scales[3] but persists on the lower trunk. The leaves have a broad lanceolate shape with margins that are sometimes twisted.[4] It blooms between April and May or October and December[5] producing clusters of white flowers along leafless stems that later form ovoid glabrous fruits.[6]

The species is confined to a small area on the Kimberley coast, near Broome,[7] where it grows in skeletal soils in the area between the coastal beach sand dunes and the red pindan soils.[8]
