History

Telespazio VEGA Deutschland was established in 2012 when Telespazio Deutschland and VEGA Space GmbH were merged. The roots of Telespazio Deutschland may be traced back to the Thomson CSF Group (now Thales), having been active in space missions since the early 1970s. VEGA, on the other hand, had its first contract with ESOC in 1978. So Telespazio VEGA has around 40 years experience in spaceflight.
