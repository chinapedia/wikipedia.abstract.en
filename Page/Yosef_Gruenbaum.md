YOSEF GRUENBAUM (born September 22, 1949) () is an Israeli researcher, academic, biochemist and professor in medicine based in Jerusalem, Israel. He is known for his research on nuclear lamins and their associated proteins in health and disease.[1] He is the Chairman of the _Silberman Institute of Life Sciences_ at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an adjunct professor at the Northwestern University, Chicago.[2][3]


Biography

Gruenbaum was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1949, to Yehuda and Shulamit Gruenbaum who were Jewish German immigrants. He attended Hebrew University of Jerusalem and earned his bachelor's degree, in chemistry and physics, in 1973. Gruenbaum received his masters degree in material sciences in 1976 and PhD in 1982 under the supervision of Aharon Razin. He went on to do a post-doctorate at University of California, San Francisco with Prof. John Sadat and then got tenured at the Hebrew University where he has been teaching and researching since. He also traveled to Baltimore and Basel where he held yearly positions and did research with Professor Bob Goldman, Kathy Wilson and others.[4]

He is married to Pnina Gruenbaum and has four kids.


Academic career

Gruenbaum started his academic career in 1985 as a lecturer at _Silberman Institute of Life Sciences_ of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1991, he became senior lecturer and associate professor in 1996. He is serving as the Chairman and senior professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem since 1999. He is also serving as adjunct professor at School of Medicine, Northwestern University since 2005.[5]

Gruenbaum received a number of honors including _Fogarty-NIH Award_ for distinguished foreign post-doctoral fellow from UCSF in 1984. In 1985, he received _Alon Fellowship_ for distinguished young Israeli scientists. Gruenbaum was honored with _The Gruss Lipper Fellowship_ in 2004 and _William T. Golden scholar in residence_ in 2005 by Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. In 2005, Yosef Gruenbaum received his honorary degree from Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.[6]
