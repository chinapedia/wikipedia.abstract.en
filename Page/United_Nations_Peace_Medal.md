The UNITED NATIONS PEACE MEDAL is a commemorative medal produced by the United Nations to promote peace. First made by Franklin Mint in 1971,[1] a new design is produced annually, with limited editions offered for sale in gold, silver, and bronze.[2] Gold medals may be formally presented by UN officials as a diplomatic gift to heads of state, former UN Secretaries-General, and dignitaries visiting the UN Headquarters.[3][4]
