TINDER LIVE [1][2][3] is a stand-up comedy show created and hosted by comedian Lane Moore[4][5][6] where she goes on the dating app Tinder and interacts with Tinder matches in real time.[7][8] During the show, Moore projects Tinder profiles in front of an audience and panelists help her dissect profiles before swiping left (no) or right (yes).[9]

Called one of the best comedy shows in NYC, _The New York Times_ described it as "truly addictive entertainment...[it's] ingenious. Moore transforms the banter on a dating app into compelling long-form improvisation. Ms. Moore, a cagey and humane performer, has developed an instinct for turning the raw materials of sexually charged chat with ordinary strangers into honed and generous jokes. “Tinder Live” has a comic momentum and energy that is unusual. The way she manipulates tone and pace reveals an artist supremely confident in her form, not to mention a flirt par excellence."[10]

Moore's comedy show was also called one of the best comedy shows in NYC by _The Village Voice_,[11] _Time Out_, _Brooklyn Magazine_, and _HelloGiggles_ who noted the show "has all the addictive, fun qualities of a television game show. One of her show’s segments include going through Tinder profiles with the audience to come to a vote on whether to swipe left or right. This could be this generation’s version of _The Dating Game_." [12]

_New York Magazine_ listed it as one of the best comedy shows, saying, "With enviable bravery, host Lane Moore utilizes Tinder to find herself a date...hilariously assessing the worthiness of profiles." [13] CBS called it one of the five best comedy shows in NYC and _Brightest Young Things_ called it "the greatest show on earth."[14]

Tinder Live has been praised for its positivity, with _Vice_ saying, "Moore expertly steered the crowd from mean-heartedness to substance with each match." [15] _Brooklyn Based_ similarly said, "In anyone else’s hands this show could feel mean-spirited, or perhaps like an invasion of privacy, but Moore makes it cathartic, a bracing comedic espresso shot." [16]

Vulture [17] listed Tinder Live! in a guide to the best NYC comedy shows along with legendary shows like Assscat 3000, Whiplash, and the Comedy Cellar. _Gothamist_ praised the show as one of their 5 Things To Do In NYC, saying it, "[transforms] the otherwise bleak and sometimes even downright horrific modern-day dating experience into a hilarious long-form improv show." [18]

The comedy show, which began in late 2013, performs upon request at bars, comedy clubs, and colleges around the United States.[19]
