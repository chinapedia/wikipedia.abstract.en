_I BELIEVE_ is a 2016 Singaporean short film directed by then 24-year-old student director Leroy Lim. It tells the story of an unlikely friendship between an autistic youth and a popular role-model, and teaches a precious lesson on love and acceptance.

The short gave the director a chance at a full-length feature film, having been picked up by mm2 Entertainment, a leading producer of notable movies such as _Ah Boys to Men_ (2012) and _1965_ (2015). It will also have its first overseas screening under the Reasonably Different category at the AS Film Festival, an international film and visual art festival managed by people with Asperger Syndrome, in Italy in December 2016.

Produced as one of the entries by 20 groups of aspiring young filmmakers for the 2016 edition of the 20/20 â€“ The Temasek Short Film Project series, organised by Temasek Holdings and facilitated by mm2 Entertainment, it was the most-watched film, garnering more than 130,000 views across Facebook and YouTube over a four-month period.[1][2][3][4][5]
