Taxonomy

This species was described under the name _Hypselodoris fregona_ from the Caribbean Sea in 2013.[1] Although Johnson & Gosliner transferred all eastern Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean species of _Hypselodoris_ to the genus _Felimare_ in 2012, the authors of this species argue against this decision.[2][3]


Distribution

This species was described from Pointe sur baie de Baille Argent, Guadeloupe, . Distribution of _Felimare fregona_ includes Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Curaçao, Guadeloupe and Panama.[4]
