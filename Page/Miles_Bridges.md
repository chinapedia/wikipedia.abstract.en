Early life

Miles was born on March 21, 1998 to Cynthia and Raymond Bridges.[1] His father Raymond, a two-time basketball state champion at Flint Northern High School, taught him the game at the age of two.[2] According to Miles, his sister Tara Rushing was an important figure in his childhood.[3] Bridges attended middle school at Woodland Park Academy in Grand Blanc, Michigan.[4] At age 12, he practiced at a local YMCA with future high school teammates and coach Keith Gray.[5][6]

As a freshman, Bridges played varsity basketball with Flint Southwestern Academy in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. There, he played alongside future George Mason signee Jaire Grayer and future Mississippi Valley commit Jovan Embry. He stood 6 ft 4 in (1.93) at 14 years of age and was a center.[7] Bridges averaged 10 points, 11 rebounds, and three blocks per game, leading his team to the regional semifinals and a 17–6 record.[8] He was soon offered an athletic scholarship by Oakland University.[9] In July 2013, Bridges transferred to Huntington Prep School in Huntington, West Virginia. He was encouraged to make the decision by former Flint Powers Catholic all-state guard JaVontae Hawkins, who had transferred to Huntington Prep as well.[10] Hawkins said, "Just getting away from the violence and distractions in Flint will help him grow and mature because he will be focused and away from his family."[11] As a sophomore, he averaged 9.8 points per game, 9.9 rebounds per game, 2.7 steals, and 3.3 Assist per game, while leading the Irish to a (29-5) overall record.

College career

He declined offers from schools such as Kentucky, Kansas, and Oregon.[12] He announced that he would play for Michigan State on October 3, 2015.[13] Head coach Tom Izzo labeled him a "blue-collar superstar" and expected him to easily fit into the team.[14][15]

In his debut vs. Arizona on November 12, 2016, Bridges scored 21 points and recorded seven rebounds.[16] On November 24, he scored 22 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to help defeat St. John's.[17] On December 1, Tom Izzo announced that Miles Bridges would miss "as least a couple of weeks" due an injured ankle.[18] Bridges returned to action on January 4, 2017 after missing seven games.[19] He scored a career-high 33 points in a January 24 loss to Purdue.
