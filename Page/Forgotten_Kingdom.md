_FORGOTTEN KINGDOM_ is folk singer-songwriter Jim Causley's fifth studio album excluding his work with The Devil's Interval and Mawkin:Causley.

_Forgotten Kingdom_ is Causley's first album of entirely self-written material although does include references to traditional song throughout. It was intended to celebrate ten years since the release of Causley's debut album _Fruits of the Earth_ in 2005 but the release was delayed due to poor health on the part of original producer Phil Beer. Production of the album was then completed by Show of Hands regular producer Mark Tucker at The Green Room studios in East Devon.

_Forgotten Kingdom_ is Causley's most ambitious solo recording project to date and has the largest line-up of guest musicians of any of his albums. This guests include many well known names from the British folk scene who happen to be based in Devon such as Seth Lakeman and Show of Hands as well as some local stalwarts of the more traditional folk music scene in the county. The theme of the album centres on the history of Devon and its neighbouring counties but also looks at Causley's own personal connection to the county and his experience of growing-up within it. The "forgotten kingdom" alluded to in the title is the Celtic Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia which Causley previously referenced in his 2011 album; _Dumnonia_ which was a collection of traditional songs from Devon. Not all of the songs on _Forgotten Kingdom_ have a traditional folk feel to them and several hint at Causley's songwriting having more modern and expansive influences.

The album received highly positive reviews from _The Guardian_, _BBC Music Magazine_ and _fRoots_ magazine among others, as well as airplay on radio shows such the Mark Radcliffe _Folk Show_ on BBC Radio 2 and the Tom Robinson show on BBC Radio 6 Music. In the _fRoots_ review, Colin Irwin confirmed his previously stated opinion that Causley is one of the finest folk singers of his generation.
