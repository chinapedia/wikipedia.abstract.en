_CYRTANTHUS OBLIQUUS_, the KNYSNA LILY, is a species of plant in the amaryllis family with spiraling leaves and large pendulous flowers. It is native to coastal grassland from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape, South Africa.[1]

It is adapted to a dry winter period (March to August) in its native range, and is able to survive in hot, dry conditions. Its thick, greyish leaves are also adapted to this sunny environment.[2] It is a popular container plant. It can be multiplied by removing and planting side bulbs, when these appear.[3]
