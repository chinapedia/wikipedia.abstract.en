NIKLAS NIKOLAJSEN (born 1975) is an early adopter, investor and FinTech entrepreneur in the field of cryptocurrencies and cryptofinance.[1][2][3] Although a citizen of Denmark, Nikolajsen has been a Swiss resident since 2011.

A computer science graduate from Copenhagen, Denmark, he has worked professionally as a software architect and developer from 1998 until 2012; during the later years of his career mostly in the financial sector.

In 2013, he co-founded Bitcoin Suisse AG, a (2016) leading broker, asset manager and financial service provider in the field of crypto finance. This company became the first Bitcoin financial service provider to provide services to a public entity (the town of Zug).[4][5]

In 2014, he co-founded the _Digital Finance Compliance Association_ and joined its board, promoting the Zug-based "Crypto Valley" concept,[6] and working towards a friendly Swiss regulatory framework for digital finance with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.

Since 2010, Nikolajsen has been a frequent commentator and outspoken proponent of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, particularly in Switzerland.

In 2016 Niklas Nikolajsen was named a top-100-influential Swiss banker by the Swiss financial magazine BILANZ.[7]
