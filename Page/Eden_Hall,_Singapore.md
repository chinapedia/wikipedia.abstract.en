Eden_Hall,_Singapore_-_20151104-02.jpg EDEN HALL on Nassim Road, is the British High Commissioner's official residence in Singapore.

It was built in 1904 for Ezekiel Saleh Manasseh, a merchant who sold rice and opium, and originally came from Baghdad, and it was designed by the architect R. A. J. Bidwell, who also designed the Raffles Hotel and the Goodwood Park Hotel.[1]

The architect Leonard Manasseh, nephew of Ezekiel Saleh Manasseh, was born there in 1916.[2]

Ezekiel Manasseh died in the Changi Prison hospital in May 1944, during the Japanese occupation, and in 1957, his stepson Vivian Bath retired to Australia and sold Eden House to the British Government for the nominal sum of Â£56,000, stipulating that there must be a plaque at the bottom of the flagpole, "May the Union Jack fly here forever".[3]
