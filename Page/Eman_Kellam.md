Career

YouTube Beginnings

Olaniyan started creating content on his YouTube channel "EmansBlogs" in 2012.[4] He started creating video blogs in his kitchen discussing topics that were popular and relevant at that point in time. It was not, however, until 2014 when he uploaded his most viewed video, "Pranking My African Dad",[5] in which he told his father that he had impregnated a 14-year-old girl, that his channel went viral and started to pick up speed and gain subscribers. This video has had over 5 million Views as of July 2018 and has been discussed and shared across various platforms including WorldStarHipHop[6] and Bossip.[7] In January 2016, he appeared on the CBBC Channel as Lifebabble talent on the Scottish BAFTA award nominated show _Lifebabble_.[8][9]

French Montana "Check Come" Collaboration

On 5 November 2016, French Montana premiered his highly anticipated album _MC4_ on the Apple Music show OVO Sound Radio.[10] The show was curated by multi award winning artist Drake, Noah "40" Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib in which who Drake also founded the OVO Sound record label with. Olaniyan and his father appeared on the show in a skit linked to a song on _MC4_ called "Check Come". The skit was taken from Olaniyan's infamous "Pranking My African Dad" prank. Olaniyan confirmed via Twitter that he knew him and his father would be featured and claims he had known and been sworn to secrecy for over two years. So it would be a funny surprise for his and French Montana's followers.[11]

Covering a range of topics that would relate to children growing up in the digital age. Own It launched nationally on Tuesday 7 February 2018.[12]
