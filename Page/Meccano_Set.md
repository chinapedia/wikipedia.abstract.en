The MECCANO SET is an overhead gantry located above a busy controlled at-grade road intersection located at the boundary between and in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The intersection is a junction where the Hume Highway, Henry Lawson Drive and Woodville Road intersect.

In December 1962 a large overhead gantry with directional signs and traffic lights, was erected by the Department of Main Roads.[1] It was quickly nicknamed the Meccano Set with reference to the children's construction toy Meccano. At that stage, the intersection was a junction for through traffic between Brisbane and Melbourne. Although this was superseded by the Cumberland Highway in August 1988, it remains an important intersection.[2][3]

In early 2019, the overhead structure was replaced with a new identical pre-fabricated version and was completed in June 2019.[4][5]
