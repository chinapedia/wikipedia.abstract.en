BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST are an English folk music duo comprising singer/oboist/fiddler Paul Sartin and piano accordionist Paul Hutchinson. The pair have a reputation for slapstick spoken, physical and musical comedy as well as fine musicianship.[1]


Origins

Sartin and Hutchinson met in the mid-1990s when they were both members of the folk-rock band Life Of Reilly, who existed to write music to satirise the construction of the Newbury bypass. After a few performances they left the band to form a duo.[2] They initially set out working for ceilidhs and social dances, working with caller Andrew Shaw on a project exploring the work of 18th century composer Nathaniel Kynaston, which led to two albums – _Mr Kynaston’s Famous Dance volume 1_ (2000) and _volume 2_ (2002). Another album drawn from social dance repertoire - _John Playford’s Secret Ball_ – followed in 2001.[3]

During 1996 and 1997 Sartin and Hutchinson formed the core of the Breezeband, backing Scottish singer Ian Bruce. Two recordings were released - _A Kind and Gentle Nature_ (WildGoose 277) and _Annie Laurie_ (Ruglen 103), while the band played some UK dates and undertook a tour of Germany.[4][5][6]

As Belshazzar's Feast their other early recordings were song and tune sets, showcasing a developing concert repertoire – _One Too Many_ in 1996, _Drop The Reed_ in 1998 - albeit displaying the same irreverent twist that distinguished them from the social dance norm.[7] They toured America and Belgium during this time, mostly playing for social dances.[8][9][10]

The duo formed the basis of ceilidh outfits Belshazzar's Dance Band (Sartin, Hutchinson plus Mark Powell), and – briefly – Bazza's Dog, an amalgamation of Belshazzar's Feast, Hoover the Dog, and Mark Powell.[11]


Career

After a period of hiatus where other work took precedence, they relaunched Belshazzar's Feast in 2008 with the album _Food of Love_.

Their first winter/Christmas-themed album – _Frost Bites_ [12] – followed in 2009, which earned them a nomination for Best Duo at the 2010 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.[13] A second winter-themed album, _Stocking Fillers_, was released in 2012.[14]

Another album of concert material, _Find The Lady_, was released in 2011.[15] This album had elements of the pair's spoken comedy included in some, but not all, of the tracks.

Belshazzar's Feast generally undertake two tours per year, one in the spring and one in the run up to Christmas. In addition, when not touring, they work together for charity organisation Superact, putting music into places where a formal concert would not work – for example hospitals or care homes.[16] They were the support band for Bellowhead’s tour of the UK in 2009.[17]

They celebrated twenty years of working together in 2014 with a live album, _The Whiting’s On The Wall_.[18] This had between-song patter in separate tracks from the music. The cover art for this album was produced by Simon Drew.


Humour

The duo performs three distinct types of humour as part of their act.

Their spoken between-song patter often includes word-based puns based on song titles or the text of the lyrics. They also have an element of physical comedy, either indicated with their instruments, facial expressions or body language, or by inviting audience members up to the stage.[19] In addition, humour appears in their music, for example by slipping pieces of well-known tunes – e.g. the _Postman Pat_ theme or the Christmas carol _Silent Night_ – into the middle of their material without warning.[20]


Associated acts

In addition to having played together in Life of Reilly, both Sartin and Hutchinson have been active in many other projects and groups. Sartin has been part of Dr Faustus, Bellowhead and Faustus in addition to his work as a composer, arranger and conductor. Hutchinson has played with Pagoda Project,[21] Hoover The Dog [22] and the Playford Liberation Front.[23] In addition, Hutchinson is a composer,[24] arranger and workshop leader (Marlborough College, Cecil Sharp House, Dartington and Benslow Music Centre).[25][26]

Time marched on, like the construction of a new bit of the A34, and after they’d broken the ice and played a few band gigs, they realised they got on like a house on fire. So they quit Life of Reilly to form a duo.”_

And they’d be so offended!’” ''
