He is also known for creating the 2012 campaign _Keep Calm and Speak Catalan_, based on the poster keep calm and carry on, against the education reform project undertaken by the Spanish Minister of Education, José Ignacio Wert (after its threat to "_hispanize Catalan students_"), a fact considered by most of the Catalan parliamentary spectrum as a threat to education in Catalan language.[6][7][8]
