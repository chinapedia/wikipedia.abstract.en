ALUMINIUM SULFACETATE is a chemical compound of aluminium with formula .[1][2]


Uses

It is a double salt of aluminium sulfate and aluminium acetate. It can be used as a mordant, which is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics[3] that typically contains a polyvalent metal ion like aluminium or iron,[4] In mixtures with basic aluminium diacetate or aluminium sulfacetate, aluminium triacetate has been used as a mordant with alizarin dye.[5] In 1899, Albert Ganswindt recommended that the use of impure sulfacetates that are empyreumatic liquids "should be abandoned" in favour of pure preparations.[6] Empyreuma is an obsolete chemical and medical term referring to "the smell and taste associated with burning vegetable and animal matter",[7] and likely results in this case from the use of pyroligneous acid (wood acid) or wood acid lime in the preparation of the mordant.[8]


Preparation

A common approach to preparing aluminium sulfacetate is by reaction of aluminium sulfate with lead(II) acetate. The relative amount of each reagent controls the composition of the resulting mixture.[9] When the stoichiometric ratio of lead acetate to aluminium sulfate exceeds 3:1, the process is theoretically driven to completion and aluminium triacetate is the sole product. With less lead acetate, a mixture of aluminium triacetate and aluminium sulfacetate results that becomes increasingly rich in the latter as the reagent mole ratio approaches 2:1. This approach is used to form various mixtures for mordant applications:[10]

      +   3   →   2   +   3

Basic aluminium sulfacetates can also be prepared, , with hydroxide anions replacing some acetate ions. The extreme cases are aluminium sulfacetate itself (_n_ = 0) and the double salt of aluminium sulfate and aluminium hydroxide (_n_ = 4 case, ). Aluminium sulfacetate is made from the hydrates of aluminium sulfate and lead acetate:[11]

      +   2   →     +   2   +   24

The _n_ = 1 and _n_ = 2 cases, both of which are basic aluminium sulfacetates, are prepared using sodium bicarbonate along with the regents:[12]

    2   +   3   +   2   →     +   3   +     +   2   +   45

      +     +   2   →     +     +     +   2   +   21

The _n_ = 3 case, also a basic aluminium sulfacetate, is prepared using acetic acid instead of lead acetate, along with sodium bicarbonate:[13]

      +     +   4   →     +   2   +     +   19
