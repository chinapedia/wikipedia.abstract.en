  <1911          Healthcare in United Kingdom is generally available only to the wealthy, unless one is able to obtain free treatment through charity or teaching hospitals.[1]
  1911-1946      A National Insurance Act is introduced in which a small amount is deducted from an employeeâ€™s wage and in return they are entitled to free healthcare. However this scheme only benefits employed individuals.[2]
  1946 onwards   Following the Second World War, major social reforms aim at a universal healthcare system as main purpose. A respective National Health Service (NHS) is established for England (NHS England), Scotland (NHS Scotland), and Wales (NHS Wales) as independent institutions. Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is also established.
  Present time   Today, the healthcare system in the United Kingdom is still fragmented, with England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. In a 2014 report ranking developed-country healthcare systems, the overall healthcare system of the United Kingdom was ranked the best in the world in the following categories: Quality of Care (i.e. effective, safe, coordinated, patient-oriented), Access to Care, Efficiency, and Equity.[3]
