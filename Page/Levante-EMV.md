_LEVANTE-EL MERCANTIL VALENCIANO_ is a newspaper from the Valencian Country that belongs to the Prensa Ibérica printing group, which publishes also the newspaper _Información_ in Alacant. It had a brief precedent in _Avance_ (30 March – 15 April 1939) and it was the bulletin of the Valencian section of the FET y de las JONS. The newspaper later belonged to the _Movimiento_ (official Francoist political movement) press. From 1977 it belonged to the _Medios de Comunicación Social del Estado_ (Social Communication Media of the State) and in 1984 it was purchased by the private enterprise Prensa Valenciana.[1]

Its ideology could be placed in the center-left[2] even though it holds its independence. In Castelló it is published as _Levante de Castelló_. It has different editions that correspond to different areas of the Valencian region (Valencia, L'Horta, Safor and so on). It is nowadays the most read newspaper in the Valencian region.[3]
