8,9-DEHYDROESTRADIOL, or Δ⁸-17Β-ESTRADIOL, also known as ESTRA-1,3,5(10),8-TETRAEN-17Β-OL-3-ONE, is a naturally occurring steroidal estrogen found in horses which is closely related to equilin, equilenin, and estradiol, and, as the 3-sulfate ester sodium salt, is a minor constituent of conjugated estrogens (Premarin).[1] It is also an important active metabolite of 8,9-dehydroestrone, analogously to conversion of estrone or estrone sulfate into estradiol.[2][3]
