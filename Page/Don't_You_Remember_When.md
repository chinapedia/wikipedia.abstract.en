"DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue, that was released as a single by Vera Lynn on 20 February 1976 on the EMI record label,[1] as a comeback single[2] in the UK as well as in Europe.[3][4][5][6][7] The song was recorded at the Marquee Studios, London and was produced by de Paul and she also sang backing vocals on the track.[8][9] Ringo Starr, who was de Paul's boyfriend at the time,[10][11] played the tambourine on the song.[12][13][14][15][16] De Paul also produced the B-side of the single, "That Old Feeling", written by Lew Brown and Sammy Fain.[17][18] The English keyboard player, pianist and composer Tony Hymas, who had worked with de Paul before on her _Love Bomb_ album and who went on to be a member of the duo Ph.D., arranged the song.[19] The song received favourable reviews, with the _Record Mirror_ writing that the song is "a perfect vehicle for her with a well-honed nostalgic lyrics and lots of big long notes".[20]

De Paul was interviewed about how she wrote the song with Barry Blue especially for Vera Lynn, after appearing on Lynn's TV show, as well as details about its recording in an article in the UK music magazine, _Music Week_.[21] Lynn and de Paul held a press reception at the Dorchester Hotel in February 1976 to announce the release of the single.[22][23] The two ladies had also met previously at the Dorchester Hotel when they were both recipients of Ivor Novello Awards on 22 May 1975; de Paul receiving the Best Television Theme award for the song "No, Honestly", and Lynn receiving a special award for services to the music industry.[24] Lynn performed the song on her TV show.[25]

The song appeared on CD for the first time in 2007 as a remastered track on the Vera Lynn compilation album, _The Singles Collection_, that was released worldwide to coincide for her 80th birthday on the EMI Gold record label[26][27][28] and on Parlophone in digital download format.[29] The extensive sleeve notes for the CD states "The last tracks not to appear on an album were issued in the same year and really are the diamonds among the collected pearls on this collection. Singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul wrote the song "Don't You Remember"... This was backed by yet another Sammy Fain classic "That Old Feeling"".[30][31] The French music site Purebreak charts mentions the song and album as of Lynn's most important releases.[32] The German radio station, Radio Rund Hamm, listed its release on its pop history site.[33]

In more recent years, the song has become popular at funerals and memorials due to the reminiscing tone and nostalgia of the lyrics.[34]
