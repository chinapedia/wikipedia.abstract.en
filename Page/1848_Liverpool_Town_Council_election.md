Elections to Liverpool Town Council were held on Wednesday 1 November 1848, with the exception of Castle Street and Scotland wards where the elections were held on 2 November because the Aldermen for these wards were not able to act as returning officers. One third of the council seats were up for election, the term of office of each councillor being three years.

Eight of the sixteen wards were uncontested.

This was the first year that the local press referred to "Liberals" rather than "Reformers"

The main issue at this election was whether the Corporation estate and the docks should be subject to Rates (tax).

After the election, the composition of the council was:

  Party   Councillors      ±     Aldermen   Total
  ------- -------------- ------- ---------- -------
          Conservative   33      0          15
          Reformers      15      0          1



Election result

Because half of the wards were uncontested, these statistics should be taken in that context.
