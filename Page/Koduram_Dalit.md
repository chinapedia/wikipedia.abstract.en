KODURAM DALIT (5 March 1910 - 28 September 1967) was an Indian poet in Hindi and Chhattisgarhi languages.[1][2][3][4]

He was born in Tikri village, district Durg (then Madhya Pradesh, now part of Chhattisgarh state), in a poor family. After completing his studies from Bilaspur and Durg, he worked as a teacher and principal in the education department of Madhya Pradesh.[5]

Dalit believed in Gandhian principles and wrote poetry, stories, children's stories and folk songs in Hindi and Chhattisgarhi languages.[6][7][8] _Siyani Goth_ and _Bahujan Hitaay Bahujan Sukhaay_ are two of his popular poem collections.[9][10]

A high school in Nawagarh (Bemetara, Chhattisgarh) is named after him - Koduram Dalit Mahavidyala.[11]
