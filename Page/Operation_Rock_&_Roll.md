_OPERATION ROCK & ROLL_ was a 1991 concert tour featuring Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Motörhead, Dangerous Toys and Metal Church. It ran from 9 July 1991 until 19 August 1991 in the United States and Canada. This tour was in honor of the US forces involved in Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War. This would also be Judas Priest's final tour with Rob Halford until 2004.

Judas Priest continued to tour in support of _Painkiller_, with Alice Cooper supporting _Hey Stoopid_, Motörhead supporting _1916_, Dangerous Toys supporting _Hellacious Acres_ and Metal Church supporting _The Human Factor_.[1]


Rob Halford incident

On the 19 August 1991 show in Toronto, the last date of the tour, an incident occurred when Rob Halford was to make his entrance onstage from behind the drum riser on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle as the band were set to perform, when he crashed into it, breaking his nose in the process. He was left unconscious as "Hell Bent for Leather" was being performed. Crew members struggled to search for Halford in the heavy induced fog, not knowing where he is. After a short while, guitarist Glenn Tipton stumbled upon him on the ground and was then assisted by the crew members. He regained consciousness afterwards and finished the show with a plaster on the bridge of his nose. After the show, he was transferred to the local medical clinic where he was treated for a concussion.[2]

In the 2004 _Reunited_ documentary, Tipton explained the incident, "That time when Rob made his entrance on the bike, it was so much dry ice and smoke and pyrotechnics that the actual center of the stage got stuck. It didn't go up all the way, 'cause we -- Rob went down on the ramp on the bike, and, _so_ lucky, he'd actually just caught the top of his head, you know, I mean it could've literally have killed him. And it knocked him off. So we started the number not knowing what had gone on because there was so much dry ice and smoke, until I stepped on Rob, [Laughs] I actually stepped on Rob, 'What's this? On the stage', you know, 'some Priest prop.' And it was Rob and he was stunned so we played the first song which was...I'm not sure whether it was "Electric Eye" or...without him and uh...anyway true to professional form he rallied around and joined us on stage in the second number."[3]
