and Peppard in TV's _Banacek_ (1974) ]] GEORGE PEPPARD JR. (; October 1, 1928 – May 8, 1994) was an American film and television actor.

Peppard secured a major role when he starred alongside Audrey Hepburn in _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ (1961),[1] and later portrayed a character based on Howard Hughes in _The Carpetbaggers_ (1964). On television, he played the title role of millionaire insurance investigator and sleuth Thomas Banacek in the early-1970s mystery series _Banacek_. He played Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, the cigar-smoking leader of a renegade commando squad, in the hit 1980s action show _The A-Team_.[2]


Early life

George Peppard, Jr. was born October 1, 1928, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of building contractor George Peppard, Sr. and opera singer Vernelle Rohrer.[3] He graduated from Dearborn High School in Dearborn, Michigan in 1946.

Peppard enlisted in the United States Marine Corps July 8, 1946, and rose to the rank of corporal, leaving the Corps at the end of his enlistment in January 1948.[4]

During 1948 and 1949, he studied civil engineering at Purdue University where he was a member of the Purdue Playmakers theatre troupe and Beta Theta Pi fraternity.[5] He then transferred to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1955.[6] He also trained at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.[7]

In addition to acting, Peppard was a pilot. He spent a portion of his 1966 honeymoon training to fly his Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.[8][9]


Acting

Peppard made his stage debut in 1949 at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After moving to New York City, Peppard enrolled in the Actors Studio, where he studied the Method with Lee Strasberg. He did a variety of jobs to pay his way during this time, such as working as a disc jockey, being a radio station engineer, teaching fencing, driving a taxi and being a mechanic in a motorcycle repair shop.[10]

He worked in summer stock in New England and appeared at the open air Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.

His first work on Broadway led to his first television appearance, with Paul Newman, in _The United States Steel Hour_ (1956), as the singing, guitar-playing baseball player Piney Woods in _Bang the Drum Slowly_.

He made his film debut in _The Strange One_ (1957).

MGM

Peppard had signed to play a role on Broadway in _The Pleasure of His Company_ (1958) when he auditioned successfully for MGM's _Home from the Hill_ (1960). He ended up appearing in _Pleasure of His Company_ for six months before making _Home from the Hill_. Part of the arrangement of the latter involved signing with MGM for a long term contract.[11]

_Home from the Hill_ was a prestigious film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Robert Mitchum, who played Peppard's father. It was a success at the box office, although the film's high cost meant that it was not profitable.

Peppard's next film for MGM was _The Subterraneans_, an adaptation of the novel by Jack Kerouac. It flopped and Peppard said "I couldn't get arrested" afterwards.[12]

Stardom

'' (1961)]] His good looks, elegant manner and superior acting skills landed Peppard his most famous film role as Paul Varjak in _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ with Audrey Hepburn, based on a story by Truman Capote. This 1961 role boosted him briefly to a major film star.

That year a newspaper article dubbed him "the next big thing". Peppard said he had turned down two TV series and was focused on being a film star. His contract with MGM was for two pictures a year, allowing for one outside film and six TV appearances a year, plus the right to star in a play every second year.[13]

He was meant to appear in _Unarmed in Paradise_ which was not made.[14] Instead MGM cast him in the lead of their epic western _How the West Was Won_ in 1962 (his character spanned three sections of the episodic Cinerama extravaganza). It was a massive hit.

He followed this with a war story for Carl Foreman, _The Victors_ in 1963, then, most notably, _The Carpetbaggers_, a 150-minute saga of a ruthless, Hughes-like aviation and film mogul based on a best-selling novel by Harold Robbins. It turned out to be one of the biggest box-office hits of 1964.

"My performances bore me", said Peppard in a 1964 interview, adding that his ambition was to deliver "one great performance. And I must say I feel a little presumptuous to shoot for that. But that's the goal, like a hockey goal. I figure I've got a choice ... not of the outcome but of the objective. And my objective is that one performance."[15]

For MGM he appeared in _Operation Crossbow_. He was meant to follow this with an adaptation of the play _Merrily We Roll Along_ but it was never made.[16]

Peppard started choosing tough-guy roles in big, ambitious pictures where he was somewhat overshadowed by ensemble casts; for example, his role as German pilot Bruno Stachel, an obsessively competitive officer from humble beginnings who challenges the Prussian aristocracy during World War I in _The Blue Max_ (1966). For this role, Peppard earned a private pilot's license and did much of his own stunt flying, although stunt pilot Derek Piggott was at the controls for the famous under-the-bridge scene.

"I'm an actor not a star," he said around this time, adding that he looked for "three things" in a film, "a good director, a good part and a good script. If I get two out of three of those I'm satisfied."[17] He was cast as the lead in _Sands of the Kalahari_ (1965) but walked off the set after only a few days of filming.[18]

Film critic David Shipman writes of this stage in his career:

Decline

A string of Peppard films that followed made little or no impact, including _Tobruk_, _P.J._, _The Executioner_, _House of Cards_ and _One More Train to Rob_, as well as a romantic comedy called _What's So Bad About Feeling Good?_, co-starring Mary Tyler Moore.

In 1968 he announced he had co-written a script _Watch Them Die_, which he planned to direct, but not play a starring role.[19] It was never made.

Among other disappointments during this period were a pair of westerns, 1970's _Cannon for Cordoba_, in which Peppard played the steely Captain Rod Douglas, who has been put in charge of gathering a group of soldiers on a dangerous mission into Mexico, and 1967's _Rough Night in Jericho_ in which he was billed over Dean Martin and Jean Simmons, a reflection of his status at that time in his career.

Television

Peppard then decided to turn to television. After developing projects for two years, including making a number of pilots, he had a notable success with _Banacek_ (1972–1974), part of _The NBC Mystery Movie_ series, starring in 90-minute whodunits as a wealthy Boston playboy who solves thefts for insurance companies for a finder's fee.[20] Sixteen regular episodes were produced over two seasons. Both have been released on DVD along with the pilot episode. He also delivered one of his most critically acclaimed, though rarely seen, performances in the TV movie _Guilty or Innocent: The Sam Sheppard Murder Case_ (1975), as Sam Sheppard.

Peppard appeared in the short-lived (half a season) _Doctors' Hospital_ (1975) and several other television films. He starred in the 1977 science-fiction film _Damnation Alley_, which has gone on to attain a substantial cult following. Peppard's role in the film was reportedly turned down by Steve McQueen because of salary issues. With fewer interesting roles coming his way, he acted in, directed and produced the drama _Five Days from Home_ in 1979.

Low point

Peppard later said the low point of his career came over a three-year period around the time of _Five Days from Home_. "It was a bad time", he said. "I was heavily in debt. My career seemed to be going nowhere. Not much work over a three-year period. Every morning I'd wake up and realize I was getting deeper and deeper into debt".[21]

He had to sell his car and take out a second mortgage on his home to finance _Five Days from Home_. Eventually, he got his money back and was able to concentrate on his career.

In a rare game show appearance, Peppard did a week of shows on _Password Plus_ in 1979. Out of five shows, the first was never broadcast on NBC, but aired much later on GSN and Buzzr, because of on-camera comments made by Peppard regarding personal dissatisfaction he felt related to his treatment by the NBC officials who supervised the production of _Password Plus_.[22]

_Dynasty_

In 1980, Peppard was offered, and accepted, the role of Blake Carrington in the television series _Dynasty_. During the filming of the pilot episode, which also featured Linda Evans and Bo Hopkins, Peppard repeatedly clashed with the show's producers, Richard and Esther Shapiro; among other things, he felt that his role was too similar to that of J. R. Ewing in the series _Dallas_. Three weeks later, before filming was to begin on additional episodes, Peppard was fired and the part was offered to John Forsythe; the scenes with Peppard were re-shot and Forsythe became the permanent star of the show.[23]

"It was a big blow," Peppard noted subsequently, adding he felt Forsythe ultimately did "a better job (as Blake Carrington) than I could have done."[24] Ironically, this led to him being available to be cast in NBC's _The A-Team_, the number one rated television show in its first season in 1982.

_The A-Team_

In 1982, Peppard auditioned for and won the role of Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith in the television action adventure series _The A-Team_, acting alongside Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz. In the series, the A-Team was a team of renegade commandos on the run from the military for "a crime they did not commit" while serving in the Vietnam War. The A-Team members made their collective living as soldiers of fortune, but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.

As "Hannibal" Smith, Peppard played the leader of the A-Team, distinguished by his cigar smoking, confident smirk, black leather gloves, disguises, and distinctive catch phrase, "I love it when a plan comes together." The show ran five seasons on NBC from 1983 to 1987, made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. It has been reported that the role was originally written with James Coburn in mind, but Coburn declined, and thus it went to Peppard. Peppard was reportedly annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship, refused to speak directly to Mr. T. Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict), and for this, Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player.[25]

Later career

In his later years, Peppard appeared in several stage productions. In 1988, he portrayed Ernest Hemingway in the play _PAPA_, which played a number of cities including Boise, Idaho; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco. Peppard financed it, and played in it. In 1992, he toured in _The Lion in Winter_, in which he played Henry II to Susan Clark's Eleanor of Aquitaine.

_Man Against the Mob_

Peppard's last series was an intended occasional series of television movie features entitled _Man Against the Mob_ set in the 1940s. In these TV detective films, Peppard played Los Angeles Police Detective Sgt. Frank Doakey. The second film _Man Against the Mob: The Chinatown Murders_ was broadcast in December 1989. A third film in this series was planned, but Peppard died before it was filmed.


Personal life

Peppard was married four times, and was the father of three children.

-   Helen Davies (1954–1964): two children, Bradford and Julie. Ms. Davies never remarried. She appeared in one movie.
-   Elizabeth Ashley (1966–1972), his co-star in _The Carpetbaggers_ and _The Third Day_: one son, Christian. As per their 1972 divorce settlement, Peppard paid Ashley $2000 a month in alimony for four years, up to $400 a month for psychiatric care, and $350 a month in child support for their son Christian Peppard.[26] Ashley's two awards were nullified in 1975 when Ashley married James McCarthy, later divorced (1975-1981).
-   Sherry Boucher (1975–1979), a realtor from Springhill, Louisiana, who remarried John Lytle.
-   Alexis Adams (1984–1986), also known as Joyce Ann Furbee, a bit part TV actress, who never remarried.

Peppard resided in a Greek revival-style white cottage in Hollywood Hills, California, with elegant porches on three sides, and a guest house in the back, and was living there at the time of his death. Later owned by designer Brenda Antin who spent a year renovating it, the small home was purchased by writer/actress Lena Dunham in 2015 for 2.699 million dollars.[27]

Peppard, born and raised in Dearborn, Michigan, Dearborn's most famous resident after Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford and legendary long serving Congressman John Dingell, wanted to go home, and George is buried simply and plainly with his mother and father in the local Northview Cemetery in Dearborn. In April 2017, Peppard's name resurfaced in the media after the cemetery was vandalized for the third time and 37 stones overturned. The Peppard family stone was not damaged. The cemetery was subsequently restored.[28]


Later years and death

Peppard overcame a serious alcohol problem in 1978, and subsequently became deeply involved in helping other alcoholics. He had smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for most of his life until he quit after being diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992, having part of one lung removed in an operation shortly after the formal diagnosis.[29]

Despite health problems in his later years, he continued acting. In 1994, shortly before his death, Peppard completed a pilot with Tracy Nelson for a new series called _The P.I._ It aired as an episode of _Matlock_ and was to be spun off into a new television series, with Peppard playing an aging detective and Nelson his daughter/sidekick.

While battling lung cancer, Peppard died on May 8, 1994, in Los Angeles from pneumonia.[30] He was buried in Northview Cemetery, Dearborn, Michigan.
