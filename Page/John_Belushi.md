JOHN ADAM BELUSHI (January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor, and singer who is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude"[1] that he displayed as one of the seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show _Saturday Night Live_ (_SNL_). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow _SNL_ star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.[2]

Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own successful comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called "The West Compass Trio". Belushi performed with The Second City after Bernard Sahlins discovered him. He met Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis there and also met Aykroyd, who later become one of his close associates.

In 1975, Belushi was recommended to _SNL_ creator/showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his notable performances such as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. After his breakout and best-known film role as John "Bluto" Blutarsky, the lead in _National Lampoon's Animal House_ (1978), Belushi later appeared in films such as _1941_, _The Blues Brothers_, and _Neighbors_. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, the Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name.

In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that affected his comedy career; he was dismissed and rehired by Michaels on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug intoxication caused by a woman who injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine known as a speedball. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.


Early life

Belushi's mother, Agnes Demetri (Samaras), was the daughter of Albanian immigrants, and his father, Adam Anastos Belushi, was an Albanian emigrant from Qytezë.[3] Born in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, Belushi was raised in Wheaton, a suburb west of Chicago, along with his three siblings: younger brothers Billy and Jim, and sister Marian.[4][5] Belushi was raised in the Albanian Orthodox Church and attended Wheaton Community High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin.

In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavolonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, "Listen to Me Now"/"Jolly Green Giant". Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage.


Career

The Second City and National Lampoon

Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, The West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955–1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City improvised comedy enterprise, who went to see them performing in 1971 and asked Belushi to join the cast.[6] At Second City, he met and began working with Harold Ramis and Brian Doyle-Murray.[7]

In 1972, Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in _National Lampoon Lemmings_,[8] a parody of Woodstock, which played Off-Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. Belushi started working as a writer, director and actor for _The National Lampoon Radio Hour_, a comedy radio show which was created, produced and written by staff from _National Lampoon_ magazine.[9] During a trip to Toronto to check out the local Second City cast in 1974, he met Dan Aykroyd.[10] Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976.

_Saturday Night Live_

In 1975 Chevy Chase and writer Michael O'Donoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called _Saturday Night_, later _Saturday Night Live_ (_SNL_). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushi's physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition.[11]

Over his four-year tenure at _SNL_, Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent Samurai Futaba, Henry Kissinger, Ludwig van Beethoven, the Greek owner of the Olympia Café, Captain James T. Kirk, and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on _Weekend Update_, during which he coined his catchphrase, "But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!"[12] With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as music guests.[13] Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing "Feeling Alright" together.

Like many of his fellow _SNL_ cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs in order to deal with the constant pressure of comedy. His unpredictable temper caused him to be fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times.[14] In _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 _SNL_ cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking. "Belushi was the 'live' in _Saturday Night Live_", they wrote, "the one who made the show happen on the edge ... Nobody embodied the highs and lows of _SNL_ like Belushi."[15]

Expansion into films

In 1978, he performed in the films _Old Boyfriends_ (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), _Goin' South_ (directed by Jack Nicholson), and _Animal House_ (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, _Animal House_ received generally mixed reviews from critics, but _Time_ and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for $2.8 million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. _Animal House_ was also largely responsible for defining and launching the gross-out genre of films, which became one of Hollywood's staples.[16]

Following the success of The Blues Brothers on _SNL_, Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, started assembling studio talents to form a proper band. These included _SNL_ saxophonist "Blue" Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat & Tears. At Shaffer's suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.'s and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphis's Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well.[17] In 1978 The Blues Brothers released their debut album, _Briefcase Full of Blues_, with Atlantic Records. The album reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released, "Rubber Biscuit", which reached number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Soul Man", which reached number 14.

In 1979, Belushi left _Saturday Night Live_ with Aykroyd to pursue a film career. They made three movies together, _1941_ (directed by Steven Spielberg), _Neighbors_ (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably _The Blues Brothers_ (directed by John Landis). Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, _The Blues Brothers_ received generally positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $115.2 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), _Made in America_, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track "Who's Making Love" peaked at No 39.

The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following his departure from _SNL_ was the romantic comedy _Continental Divide_ (directed by Michael Apted). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago home town hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains.

By 1980, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars, and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of '' Neighbors''. Blues Brother band member and sax player Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Steve Cropper.

At the time of his death, Belushi was pursuing several movie projects,[18] including _Moon Over Miami_ with Louis Malle, _National Lampoon's The Joy of Sex_ with Penny Marshall, and _Noble Rot_ with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former _SNL_ writer Don Novello. He was also scheduled to work with Aykroyd on _Ghostbusters_ and _Spies Like Us_.

Belushi also made a "Guest Star Appearance" on an episode of the television series _Police Squad!_ (1982), which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode aired, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.[19]


Death

The day before he died, Belushi visited his longtime manager Bernie Brillstein and asked for money. Brillstein said no, suspecting Belushi wanted money for drugs.[20] Later in the day, when Brillstein had another visitor, Belushi returned and again asked for money. Brillstein complied, reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of another person.

On March 5, 1982, upon arriving for a scheduled workout, Belushi's trainer Bill Wallace found him dead in Bungalow 3 at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.[21] Belushi was 33 years old.[22] The cause of death was combined drug intoxication involving cocaine and heroin, a drug combination known as a speedball. In the early morning hours on the day of his death, he was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as Catherine Evelyn Smith.[23][24] His death was investigated by forensic pathologist Michael Baden,[25] among others, and, while the findings were disputed, it was officially ruled a drug-related accident.

In an interview with the _National Enquirer_ two months later, Smith admitted that she had been with Belushi the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the article "I Killed Belushi" in the _National Enquirer_ edition of June 29, 1982, the case was reopened. Smith was arrested, extradited from Ontario, Canada, and charged with first-degree murder. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served 15 months in prison.

Belushi's wife arranged for a traditional Orthodox Christian funeral that was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest. He was interred at Abel's Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard.[26] His tombstone has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, "I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on". His mother's tombstone at Elmwood Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois, has Belushi's name inscribed on it and thus serves as a cenotaph.[27]


Tributes, legacy, and popular culture

John_Belushi_2008_stamp_of_Albania.jpg Belushi's life was detailed in the 1984 biography _Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi_ by Bob Woodward and 1990's _Samurai Widow_ by his wife Judith.

The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album _Among the Living_, titled "Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)."[28] Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song "John Belushi" for their 1988 album _Tacy sami_, with references to his Albanian ancestry.

Belushi has been portrayed by actors Eric Siegel in _Gilda Radner: It's Always Something_, Tyler Labine in _Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork & Mindy_ (which also features his friendship with Robin Williams), Michael Chiklis in _Wired_ and John Gemberling in _A Futile and Stupid Gesture_. Future _SNL_ star Chris Farley, whose humor was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, similar to combined drug intoxication, contributing to comparisons between Belushi and Farley.[29]

His widow later remarried and is now Judith Belushi Pisano. She and co-biographer Tanner Colby produced _Belushi: A Biography_, a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of John Belushi's life that was published in 2005.

Belushi's career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian's overdose and learned how to better deal with clients who abuse drugs or alcohol from handling Belushi.[30] John_Belushi's_Star.jpg In 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard.[31] In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of _Final 24_, a documentary following Belushi during the last twenty-four hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full biography documentation of Belushi's life.

According to his _SNL_ fellow, Jane Curtin, who appeared on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of women writers and comics while working on _SNL_. "So you'd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women."[32]

During the pre-production of _Ghostbusters_, Ivan Reitman remarked Slimer was sort of like Bluto in the film _Animal House_, like the ghost of John Belushi.[33] Since then, Slimer has been described as "The Ghost of John Belushi" by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews.

At the conclusion of the first live _SNL_ episode (Robert Urich/Mink DeVille on March 20, 1982) two weeks after Belushi's death, Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him.[34] The ABC Network's similar sketch comedy series _Fridays_ aired a live episode the night of Belushi's death. Just before the final credits rolled cast member Maryedith Burrell paid tribute to him by saying, "We're all going to miss John Belushi".

Belushi was scheduled to present the first annual Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: "My partner would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was a bit of a Visual Effect himself."[35]

In 2015, Belushi was ranked by _Rolling Stone_ as the greatest _SNL_ cast member of all time.[36]

Joe Medjuck says: "_One day, during preproduction, we were all sitting around talking about the Onionhead concept, and Ivan remarked that the character was sort of like Bluto in Animal House – like the ghost of John Belushi, in a way, Danny, who was obviously a good friend of John's, never argued with that. Even so, we never officially said that and we never mentioned it in the script. It was just one way to look at the character, because Onionhead's grossness is like Bluto's in Animal House. We certainly never expected anyone to recognize him as such, although somehow the word did get out and we received some calls from a few newspapers saying they'd heard we had the ghost of John Belushi in our movie._"
