Inspired, Venkatachalam marries off Sarala to Anandan, deciding that if Sarala is not cured within two years, the marriage will dissolve and Anandan can marry any other woman he wants.

Release and reception

_Ellam Unakkaga_ was released on 1 July 1961.[8][9] According to film historian Randor Guy, the film was not a commercial success as viewers reacted negatively to seeing Ganesan and Savitri as lovers onscreen, the duo having acted as siblings in _Pasamalar_, released earlier that year. However, he praised it for the performances of the cast, the music, the dance sequences choreographed by P. S. Gopalakrishnan, and Adurthi Subba Rao's direction.[10]
