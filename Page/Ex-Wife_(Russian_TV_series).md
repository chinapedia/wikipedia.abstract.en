_EX-WIFE_ (; _Byvshaya zhena_) is a 2013 Russian television series whose lead character, Natasha, played by Nelli Uvarova, works in a government department that seeks to collect unpaid alimony. The bailiffs of the office pursue deadbeat fathers (there's no example of a woman owing alimony) in a Russian city. In the first episode, Natasha quits a singing gig in order to join the department as an intern, and hopes to collect from her own ex-husband. Real-life tough guy (a mixed martial artist) Oleg Taktarov plays as Natasha's protective boss.

In a review of Russian television shows, _The Verge_ called it "most inventive twist on a cop show".[1]

It has twelve episodes in its single season.[2]
