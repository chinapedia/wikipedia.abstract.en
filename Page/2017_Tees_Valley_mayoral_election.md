The inaugural TEES VALLEY MAYORAL ELECTION was held on 4 May 2017 to elect the mayor of the Tees Valley Combined Authority. The mayor was elected by the supplementary vote system. Subsequent elections will be held in May 2020 and every four years after.[1][2]

North East England is a Labour stronghold and prior to the election, the Labour candidate Sue Jeffrey was considered the overwhelming favourite.[3] The eventual victory of the Conservative candidate Ben Houchen was reported as a shock and a poor result for Labour following their losses in the local elections that same day.[4]
