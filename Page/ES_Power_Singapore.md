ES POWER[1][2][3] is an electricity retailing service started by Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte. Ltd.[4] in 2016. Environmental Solutions claims that ES Power is the first electricity service in Singapore to offer complete carbon offset to its customer. Carbon offsets are given through carbon credits which, in turn, are used to invest in non-renewable energy related projects around the globe, especially in developing countries. ES Power presently operates in Singapore and its customer base is exclusively in Singapore.


History

Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte. Ltd. was founded in 1999 and its headquarter is located in Singapore. The company has its sales and support offices in India, Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, Singapore and Philippines.

In an effort to give consumers more options to manage their electricity cost, EMA Singapore has progressively opened the electricity market to competitors since 2001.[5] Previously consumers were bound to purchase electricity from SP Services (SPS).[6] Presently ES Power also offers customized power tariff plans and consumers can purchase electricity under the power tariff plan of their choice.


Intended Customers

The retailing service is offered only to Commercial and Industrial (C&I) customers who are referred as 'Contestable Customers' according to EMA. Until 1 July 2015, a customer was 'contestable' only if the combined monthly electricity consumption across all offices in Singapore was more than 4000 kWh. However, the government has now reduced the consumption limit to 2000 kWh. At present, according to the government figures, a total of approximately 89500 accounts or 33000 C&I Customers are contestable.

EMA plans to cover remaining small consumers, mainly household, under the liberalized market and achieve full retail competition in coming years. There are roughly about 1.3Â million small consumers in Singapore.

ES Power sells electricity to its customers and offers equivalent carbon credits to offset the carbon emission due to electricity generation.
