In Greek mythology, PLOUTO or PLUTO (Πλουτώ "Wealth") was, according to the late 8th–early 7th century BC Greek poet Hesiod, and the probably nearly as old _Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter_, one of the many Oceanid daughters of Oceanus and Tethys.[1] Hesiod calls her "soft eyed", and the _Homeric Hymn_ has her as one of the "deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus" who were the playmates of Persephone when she was abducted by Hades.
