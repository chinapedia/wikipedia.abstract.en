ARIMNESTOS (; fl. early 5th century BCE) was the commander of the Plataean contingent at the battles of Marathon and Plataea during the Greco-Persian Wars.[1]


Battle of Plataea

Plutarch relates that Arimnestos was responsible for selecting the location of the Battle of Plataea, after receiving guidance from Zeus Soter in a dream. He shared this insight with the Athenian general Aristides, who in turn showed the site to the Spartan regent Pausanias, the overall commander of the Greek forces.[2]

He was present at the death of Callicrates later during the battle.[3]

He was depicted by painted portrait in the Temple of Athena Areia built on the site of the battlefield by the Athenians, beneath a statue of the goddess made by Pheidias to commemorate the victory.[4]


In fiction

Arimnestos is the protagonist and narrator in the _Long War_ series by Christian Cameron.[5]
