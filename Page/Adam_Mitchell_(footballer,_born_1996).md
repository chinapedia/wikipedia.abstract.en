ADAM THOMAS MITCHELL (born 1 June 1996) is a New Zealand footballer who plays as a defender for ISPS Handa Premiership club Team Wellington.


Club career

Born in Vrgorac, Croatia, to a New Zealand father and Croatian mother, thus having both New Zealand and Croatian citizenship.[1] He grew up in Hobsonville in west Auckland, and began playing for Waitakere City before later moving to Central United (2013[2]), starting as a midfielder before becoming a centre back. He was also a member of Wynton Rufer's Wynrs academy as a youngster.[3]

Mitchell played three seasons in the New Zealand Football Championship, two seasons with Wanderers SC and one with WaiBOP United.[4] Mitchell captained the Wanderers SC team that was formed to give the under-20s regular game time in the NZFC.[5] He was also team-captain at WaiBOP United.[6]

In summer 2016, he moved abroad, to Europe, where after trials, he signed a contract with Serbian giants Red Star Belgrade. He signed on 25 May 2016, a 1+2 years contract with Red Star.[7] Due to his young age, in order to increase his chances to play, at final days of the Serbian 2016 summer transfer-window, he was loaned to OFK Beograd.[8] He debuted with OFK in the 2016–17 Serbian First League on 10 September, in a home game against Inđija, a 1–0 win.[9]

On 13 February 2017, he moved to Slovenian side NK Celje.[10]

In the 2017–18 season he was a regular in the U23 squad of the Football League Championship side Bolton Wanderers. Following his release at the end of the season and a period training with Walsall and Swedish club Kalmar FF, on 12 February 2019 Mitchell signed with New Zealand club Team Wellington until the end of the season.[11][12]


International career

Mitchell represented New Zealand at U-17 and U-20 levels.[13] He was part of the squad that won the 2013 OFC U-17 Championship,[14] and was part of New Zealand's squad for the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup and the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup.[15]

Mitchell was called up to the New Zealand national team twice in 2015 under Anthony Hudson as an injury replacement.[16] He made his debut under Fritz Schmid on 24 March 2018 in a friendly game against Canada.
