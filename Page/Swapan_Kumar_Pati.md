SWAPAN KUMAR PATI (born 1968) is an Indian quantum chemist, a professor of the department of chemistry at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research and the head of the Quantum Theory Molecules to Materials Group at the institute.[1] He is known for his studies on electronic optical and magnetic phenomena in molecular systems[2] and is an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences,[3] National Academy of Sciences, India[4] and The World Academy of Sciences.[5] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2010, for his contributions to chemical sciences.[6]


Biography

University_of_Kalyani_(1).jpg Born on 7 December 1968 in Paschim Medinipur district in the Indian state of West Bengal,[7] S. K. Pati did his graduate studies in chemistry at Midnapore College of the Vidyasagar University and passed a master's degree from Kalyani University.[8] Subsequently, he moved to Bengaluru to pursue his doctoral studies at Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute of Science[9] and completed his post-doctoral work at University of California, Davis and Northwestern University. On his return to India, he joined the Theoretical Sciences Unit of the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research as a member of faculty where he serves as a professor and the head of the Quantum Theory Molecules to Materials Group.[10]


Legacy

Pati's researches fall into five major areas; Quantum Magnetism, Optical and Opto-electronic Properties, Transport in Nanostructures and Biomolecular Systems, Hydrogen Storage in Organic Molecular Solids and New Carbon based Materials[11] and his studies are reported to have widened the understanding of electronic optical and magnetic phenomena in molecular systems.[12] The process developed by him for the preparation of Julolidine conjugates[13] have earned him a patent.[14] His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles;[15][16] Google Scholar, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 292 of them.[17] He is a member of American Physical Society, American Chemical Society and The World Academy of Sciences. He sits in the editorial board of _Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research_ and has served as an advisory board member of Journal of Materials Chemistry of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Journal of Physical Chemistry of American Chemical Society, both during 2009-11.[18]
