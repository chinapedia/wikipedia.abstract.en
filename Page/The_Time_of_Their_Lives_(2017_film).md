_THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES_ is a British road comedy film directed and written by Roger Goldby and starring Joan Collins as Helen Shelley and Pauline Collins as Priscilla. Joan Collins abandons her usual glamour to play a faded and forgotten movie star living in an old folks home in London, who determines to somehow travel to her ex-lover’s funeral in France in the hopes of staging a comeback. She coerces downtrodden housewife Priscilla (Pauline Collins) into accompanying her on the eventful journey, during which the odd duo become involved with a reclusive artist, played by Franco Nero. At the outset the selfish, egocentric, manipulative Helen seems to have little in common with the timid Priscilla, however during the course of their adventure the two women undergo life changes that bond them together.

The film was released on 10 March 2017 in the United Kingdom, followed by Australia, France and Nordic countries by Universal Pictures and Independent Film Company.[1][2][3]
