In addition to being one of the co-founders of ECES, he is also part of ECES Management Board. Prior to his involvement with ECES he was at the forefront of the establishment of the Partnership between the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on electoral assistance and the Coordinator of the dedicated Joint EC UNDP Task Force.


History

The European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES) was launched in December 2010 during the European Development Days forum at the Panel on Democracy and Human Rights organized by the European Commission. Since then, ECES has implemented electoral assistance activities in more than 35 countries, predominantly in Africa and the Middle East, mostly through the funds of the EU and EU member states.

Mission

ECES’ work focuses on:

ECES also established a collaboration with the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, a world ranked university, to promote accessible, customized and innovative capacity building programmes for electoral stakeholders, including the Master on Electoral Policy and Administration - MEPA. The ECES-SSSA’s partnership facilitates the enrollment of EMB representatives and election practitioners in MEPA or in one of its 19 modules, structured around the Electoral Cycle Approach.

The electoral outcome of 2010 elections showed the electoral process itself is not a guarantee of democracy and stability.
