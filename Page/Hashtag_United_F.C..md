HASHTAG UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB is a semi-professional football club based in Tilbury, Essex, England. They are currently members of the and play at the Chadfields Stadium.

Founded in 2016 by YouTube personality Spencer Owen, the club originally played exhibition matches against professional football clubs' staff teams, Sunday league teams and non-league teams. The games were filmed and highlights were uploaded to their YouTube channel, where they quickly gained a significant online following. In 2017 Owen began talks with the FA over the possibility of Hashtag joining the non-league pyramid. The club subsequently entered the league system at the beginning of the 2018–19 season, joining the Eastern Counties League.


History

Hashtag United Football Club was formed in March 2016 by Spencer Owen, a football YouTuber who went by the name Spencer FC. Owen had begun making YouTube videos in 2013 as a student at the University of Reading, and the team initially consisted of friends from school and university.[1]

From their foundation, the team primarily played five, seven and eleven-a-side exhibition matches, which were filmed and uploaded to their YouTube channel. By September 2016, the team's Instagram account had over 100,000 followers, their Twitter account 41,000, and a 'penalty challenge' video uploaded to YouTube had accumulated over one million views. Hashtag United played various teams including a Comedians XI whom they beat 19–1, Google, the GB Deaf Team, Barawa and a Manchester City staff team, with opponents fielding former professional footballers such as Paul Dickov, Graeme Le Saux and Ray Parlour, and celebrities including Omid Djalili. At one point in 2016, the club was close to signing professional footballer Adebayo Akinfenwa.[2] In 2017 the club won the EE Wembley Cup, a competition that Spencer FC had won in 2015 and 2016;[3] the team included Northampton Town youth team player Scott Pollock, who went on to sign professional terms with his parent club.[4]

Ahead of the 2018–19 season, the club joined the English football league system, initially being placed in Division One of the Spartan South Midlands League, before being moved to the Eastern Senior League after appealing that it was more suited to their Essex roots.[5] After joining the pyramid, Spencer Owen stepped down as manager and was replaced by former East Thurrock United assistant manager Jay Devereux. Their first competitive match was a 3–2 away loss to Little Oakley on 4 August 2018.[6] The club's first league season saw them reach the semi-finals of Division One Knock-Out Cup.[7] They went on to win the Division One South title, earning promotion to the Essex Senior League.[8]
