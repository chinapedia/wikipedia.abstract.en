G (named _gee_ )[1] is the seventh letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.


History

The letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of 'C' to distinguish voiced from voiceless . The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, who taught around 230 BCE. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both and before open vowels, had come to express in all environments.

Ruga's positioning of 'G' shows that alphabetic order related to the letters' values as Greek numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the Roman censor Appius Claudius, who found it distasteful and foreign.[2] Sampson (1985) suggests that: "Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by the dropping of an old letter."[3] The 3rd-century-BC addition of the letter G to the Roman alphabet is credited to Spurius Carvilius Ruga.[4]

George Hempl proposed in 1899 that there never was such a "space" in the alphabet and that in fact 'G' was a direct descendant of zeta. Zeta took shapes like ‚äè in some of the Old Italic scripts; the development of the monumental form 'G' from this shape would be exactly parallel to the development of 'C' from gamma. He suggests that the pronunciation > was due to contamination from the also similar-looking 'K'.[5]

Eventually, both velar consonants and developed palatalized allophones before front vowels; consequently in today's Romance languages, and have different sound values depending on context (known as hard and soft C and hard and soft G). Because of French influence, English orthography shares this feature.

Typographic variants

LowercaseG.svg include a double-storey and single-storey G.]] The modern lowercase 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-storey (sometimes _opentail_) 'g' and the double-storey (sometimes _looptail_) 'g'. The single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop, thus closing the loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey form (g) had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed bowl or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper closed bowl. The double-storey version became popular when printing switched to "Roman type" because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an "ear".

Generally, the two forms are complementary, but occasionally the difference has been exploited to provide contrast. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, opentail has always represented a voiced velar plosive, while was distinguished from and represented a voiced velar fricative from 1895 to 1900.[6][7] In 1948, the Council of the International Phonetic Association recognized and as typographic equivalents,[8] and this decision was reaffirmed in 1993.[9] While the 1949 _Principles of the International Phonetic Association_ recommended the use of for a velar plosive and for an advanced one for languages where it is preferable to distinguish the two, such as Russian,[10] this practice never caught on.[11] The 1999 _Handbook of the International Phonetic Association_, the successor to the _Principles_, abandoned the recommendation and acknowledged both shapes as acceptable variants.[12]

Wong et al. (2018) found that native English speakers have little conscious awareness of the looptail 'g' (Looptail_g.svg).[13][14] They write: "Despite being questioned repeatedly, and despite being informed directly that G has two lowercase print forms, nearly half of the participants failed to reveal any knowledge of the looptail 'g', and only 1 of the 38 participants was able to write looptail 'g' correctly."


Use in writing systems

English

In English, the letter appears either alone or in some digraphs. Alone, it represents

-   a voiced velar plosive ( or "hard" ), as in _goose_, _gargoyle_ and _game_;
-   a voiced palato-alveolar affricate ( or "soft" ), generally before or , as in _giant_, _ginger_ and _geology_; or
-   a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant () in some words of French origin, such as _rouge_, _beige_ and _genre_.

In words of Romance origin, is mainly soft before (including the digraphs and ), , or , and hard otherwise. Soft is also used in many words that came into English THROUGH medieval or modern Romance languages from languages without soft (like Ancient Latin and Greek) (e.g. _fragile_ or _logic_). There are many English words of non-Romance origin where is hard though followed by or (e.g. _get_, _gift_), and a few in which is soft though followed by such as _gaol_ or _margarine_.

The double consonant has the value (hard ) as in _nugget_, with very few exceptions: in _suggest_ and in _exaggerate_ and _veggies_.

The digraph has the value (soft ), as in _badger_. Non-digraph can also occur, in compounds like _floodgate_ and _headgear_.

The digraph may represent

-   a velar nasal () as in _length_, _singer_
-   the latter followed by hard () as in _jungle_, _finger_, _longest_

Non-digraph also occurs, with possible values

-   as in _engulf_, _ungainly_

-   as in _sponge_, _angel_

-   as in _melange_

The digraph (in many cases a replacement for the obsolete letter yogh, which took various values including , , and ) may represent

-   as in _ghost_, _aghast_, _burgher_, _spaghetti_

-   as in _cough_, _laugh_, _roughage_

-   √ò (no sound) as in _through_, _neighbor_, _night_
-   in _hiccough_

-   in _ugh_

Non-digraph also occurs, in compounds like _foghorn_, _pigheaded_

The digraph may represent

-   as in _gnostic_, _deign_, _foreigner_, _signage_

-   in loanwords like _champignon_, _lasagna_

Non-digraph also occurs, as in _signature_, _agnostic_

The trigraph has the value as in _gingham_ or _dinghy_. Non-trigraph also occurs, in compounds like _stronghold_ and _dunghill_.

Other languages

Most Romance languages and some Nordic languages also have two main pronunciations for , hard and soft. While the soft value of varies in different Romance languages ( in French and Portuguese, in Catalan, in Italian and Romanian, and in most dialects of Spanish), in all except Romanian and Italian, soft has the same pronunciation as the .

In Italian and Romanian, is used to represent before front vowels where would otherwise represent a soft value. In Italian and French, is used to represent the palatal nasal , a sound somewhat similar to the in English _canyon_. In Italian, the trigraph , when appearing before a vowel or as the article and pronoun _gli_, represents the palatal lateral approximant .

Other languages typically use to represent regardless of position.

Amongst European languages, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, and Slovak are an exception as they do not have in their native words. In Dutch, represents a voiced velar fricative instead, a sound that does not occur in modern English, but there is a dialectal variation: many Netherlandic dialects use a voiceless fricative ( or ) instead, and in southern dialects it may be palatal . Nevertheless, word-finally it is always voiceless in all dialects, including the standard Dutch of Belgium and the Netherlands. On the other hand, some dialects (like Amelands) may have a phonemic .

Faroese uses to represent , in addition to , and also uses it to indicate a glide.

In Maori (Te Reo MƒÅori), is used in the digraph which represents the velar nasal and is pronounced like the in _singer_.

In older Czech and Slovak orthographies, was used to represent , while was written as ( with caron).
