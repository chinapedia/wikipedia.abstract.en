The CHADIC LANGUAGES form a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They are spoken in parts of the Sahel. They include 150 languages spoken across northern Nigeria, southern Niger, southern Chad, Central African Republic and northern Cameroon. The most widely spoken Chadic language is Hausa, a lingua franca of much of inland Eastern West Africa.


Composition

Newman (1977) classified the languages into the four groups which have been accepted in all subsequent literature. Further subbranching, however, has not been as robust; Blench (2006), for example, only accepts the A/B bifurcation of East Chadic.[1]

-   WEST CHADIC. Two branches, which include

    (A) the Hausa, Ron, Bole, and Angas languages; and
    (B) the Bade, Warji, and Zaar languages.

-   BIU–MANDARA (Central Chadic). Three branches, which include

    (A) the Bura, Kamwe, and Bata languages, among other groups;
    (B) the Buduma and Musgu languages; and
    (C) Gidar

-   EAST CHADIC. Two branches, which include

    (A) the Tumak, Nancere, and Kera languages; and
    (B) the Dangaléat, Mukulu, and Sokoro languages

-   MASA

Origin

Several modern genetic studies of Chadic speaking groups in the northern Cameroon region have observed high frequencies of the Y-Chromosome Haplogroup R1b in these populations (specifically, of R1b's R-V88 variant). This paternal marker is common in parts of West Eurasia, but otherwise rare in Africa. Cruciani et al. (2010) thus propose that the Proto-Chadic speakers during the mid-Holocene (~7,000 years ago) migrated from the Levant to the Central Sahara, and from there settled in the Lake Chad Basin.[2]


Loanwords

Chadic languages contain many Nilo-Saharan loanwords from either the Songhay or Maban branches, pointing to early contact between Chadic and Nilo-Saharan speakers as Chadic was migrating west.[3]

Although Adamawa languages are spoken adjacently to Chadic languages, interaction between Chadic and Adamawa is limited.[4]
