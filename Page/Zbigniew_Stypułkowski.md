ZBIGNIEW STYPUŁKOWSKI (March 26, 1904 – March 30, 1979) was a Polish lawyer and politician, Member of the Council of National Unity. He was sentenced by the Soviets in the infamous Trial of the Sixteen in 1945.


Biography

In 1944 he took part in the Warsaw Uprising. In March 1945 he was arrested by the NKVD and brought to Moscow. After 3 months of interrogations, he was sentenced to 4 months in prison in a staged trial of 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State held by the Soviet Union in Moscow. In August he came back to Poland. Fearing arrest, he escaped from Poland in November 1945.

The arrest, imprisonment, and trial of Polish leaders is described in his 1951 book _Invitation to Moscow_. The book was soon translated into French (_Invitation à Moscou_), Italian (_Invito a Mosca_), Portuguese (_Convite de Moscobo_), Spanish (_Invitation a Moscou_), Burmese and Arabic. The Polish version of the book was published outside Poland in 1951 (_W zwierusze dziejowej_). In 1991 the book was re-published in Warsaw. Hugh Trevor-Roper, professor at the University of Oxford, wrote that the book was "of unique value" and that "there is no other evidence known to me from which we can learn, as here, the psychology and method behind these Communist trials".[1] He died and was buried in London.

In 1927 Stypułkowski married Aleksandra Rabska, a fellow lawyer and legal partner and later, a notable émigré political commentator and activist. They had a son, Andrzej, who also became an émigré activist in the United Kingdom.
