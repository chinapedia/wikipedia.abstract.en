History

Metcalfe's Skinny was set up in 2009 by Itsu and Pret a Manger founder Julian Metcalfe as part of an overall Metcalfe's Food company business which also produced a number of grocery and snack items for Itsu.

In June 2015 the larger group was split into separate businesses,[1] with Metcalfe's Skinny becoming a business in its own right and the Itsu Grocery brand becoming a subsidiary of the main Itsu brand.

In January 2016 Kettle Chips bought a 26% stake in the business,[2] with Kettle Chips owner Snyders - Lance purchasing the remaining 74% stake in September 2016,[3] leading to founder Metcalfe leaving the business.
