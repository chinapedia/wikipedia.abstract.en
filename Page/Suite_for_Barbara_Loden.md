_SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN_ (French: _Supplément à la vie de Barbara Loden_) is a 2012 book by Nathalie Léger. The book was first offered in English translation by UK publishers Les Fugitives in 2015 with a translation by Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon; the following year it was published in the U.S. by Dorothy, a publishing project.[1][2]

Léger was inspired to write the piece after being asked to write an encyclopedia entry on Barbara Loden's only film as director, the 1970 film _Wanda_. Delving into research she found herself with enough material to write a short book, a mix of novel, biography, and art criticism.[3]

An excerpt from the book was published in the fall 2016 issue of _The Paris Review_.[4]
