_IRIS IBERICA_ SUBSP. _ELEGANTISSIMA_ is a species in the genus _Iris_, it is also in the subgenus of Iris and in the Oncocyclus section. It is a subspecies of _Iris iberica_ and is a rhizomatous perennial, from Armenia, Turkey and Iran. It has large, thin and falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves, slender stem with a single flower between April and May. It has a white, cream or pale yellow ground, which is covered in dark veining or speckling in violet, mauve, purple or brown shades. The larger standards are paler, normally white and less veined. The falls, have darker veining and a dark signal patch and brown or purple beard. It is commonly known as _Iris elegantissima_, especially in Europe and Russia. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, but normally needs some protection during the winter period.


Description

It is classed as an mezo-xerophyte (meaning it likes medium to dry habitats),[1] and has stoloniferous rhizomes which are about 3 cm long. Underneath the rhizomes, it has very long secondary roots.[2]

It has large,[3] ribbon-like,[4] and falcate (sickle-shaped),[5][6] leaves, that can grow up to between long,[7]

It has a slender stem or peduncle, that starts to grow in March,[8] up to between tall.[9][10][11]

The stem holds a terminal (top of stem) flower,[12] the plant normally has 2–3 stems,[13] each with flower buds,[14] blooming in Spring,[15] between late March,[16] or April and May,[17][18] or June.[19]

The large flowers, are in diameter,[20][21] they have a white,[22][23][24] cream,[25] or pale yellow ground,[26][27][28] has dark,[29] veining or speckling in violet,[30] mauve,[31] purple or brown shades.[32][33] Compared to _Iris iberica_ which can have blue veining and marking.[34]

Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.[35][36] The darker veined,[37][38] scallop shell shaped,[39] falls are deflexed (bending over to an almost flat position),[40][41] and up to long.[42] in the center of the falls, is a velvet-like,[43] dark,[44] brown to purple,[45] or black signal patch.[46] Also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are brown to purple.[47] Also over the falls, the iris has a deflexed style branches that almost covers the signal spot.[48] The almost vertical,[49] and larger standards,[50] are creamy,[51] or white,[52] with pale,[53] or thin violet veins.[54] They are up to long,[55][56] and can be described as white cotton handkerchiefs.[57]

The flowers produce pollen, which has been precisely measured, the long axis is long and the short axis is 111 microns long.[58]

After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule between June to July.[59][60] Then the plant dies back, losing the leaves and stems, to rest underground during the winter.[61]

Biochemistry

As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.[62] It has a chromosome count: 2n=20,[63][64][65] and has an unnamed alkaloid (as of 1961), contained within its rhizome.[66]

A study in 2014, was carried out on various species of iris DNA, it found that _I. iberica_ ssp. _elegantissima_ had a purity value of 2.80, compared to 1.26 of _Iris aucheri_.[67]


Taxonomy

The Latin specific epithet _elegantissima_ refers to 'elegantissimus' meaning very elegant,[68] it is a superlative of 'elegans'.[69]

It was first discovered in Transcaucasus,[70] and then first published and described by Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnowsky in Vestn. Tiflissk. Bot. Sada Vol.11 on page 2 in 1915.[71][72] In 1972, it was then re-classified as a subspecies of _Iris iberica_ by A. L. Takhtadzhyan and A. A. Fedorov, and published as _Iris iberica_ subsp. _elegantissima_ (Sosn.) Fed. & Takht. in Fl. Erevana Vol.331 in 1972.[73][74][75]

Although it is often referred to as _Iris elegantissima_ Sosn. in Russia and Armenia.[76][77][78] but elsewhere it is referred to as a subspecies.[79][80][81]

It was verified as _Iris iberica_ subsp. _elegantissima_ by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 22 February 2006, then altered in 11 December 2007.[82] It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life,[83] and is an accepted name by the RHS.[84]


Distribution and habitat

It is native to temperate Asia.[85]

Range

It is found in Armenia,[86][87][88] (including Shirak,[89] Yerevan,[90][91][92] Aparan, Mount Aragats and Sevan.[93]) in north western Iran,[94][95][96] (including Maku,[97]) and in north eastern Turkey,[98][99][100] (or East Anatolia,[101]) including near Lake Van Basin,[102] Erzurum,[103] and Ararat.[104]

It was listed as found in Azerbaijan, in 2004,[105] but this either a cultivated form or mistaken form of _Iris iberica_, which is naturally found there.[106]

Habitat

It grows on the lower and middle mountain belts,[107] on semi-desert slopes,[108][109][110] or dry rocky, (marl) slopes,[111][112][113] and steppes,[114][115][116]--> (with lots of annuals and long grasses.[117]) and in coniferous forests.[118][119]

They can be found at an altitude of above sea level.[120][121][122]


Conservation

It is a rare species,[123] and was included in the Red Data Book of Armenia,[124][125][126] but not included in the Annexes of CITES and that of the Bern Convention.[127] It is at risk due to various factors, including urbanization, land development for arable purposes (framing) and the intensive collection (of the flowers) for selling.[128]

The species grows and is monitored within Sevan National Park, Khosrov State Reserve and Erebuni State Reserve in Armenia.[129][130] Erebuni was formed in 1981, with the purpose of protecting 100 varieties of wild wheat and their habitat. Various rare or endangered species of plant can be found within the reserve, including _Actinolema macrolema_, _Aegilops crassa_, _Gladiolus atroviolaceus_, _Hordeum spontaneum_, _Iris elegantissima_ (_I. iberica_ subsp. _elegantissima_), _Merendera trigyna_, _Stipa vavilovii_, _Triticum araraticum_, _Triticum boeoticum_ and _Triticum urartu_.[131]

It is also grown in Yerevan Botanic Garden in Armenia.[132]


Cultivation

'Oncocyclus Section' Irises are in general easier to grow than 'Regalia Section' irises.[133] _I. iberica_ subsp _elegantissima_ is hardy to European Zone 4,[134] (meaning hardy to −5 to −10oC (23 to 14oF).[135] In the UK, it needs to be covered through the winter,[136] within an alpine house.[137][138]

The irises grow within fertile,[139] highly drained soil,[140][141] in full sun,[142] but needs protection from rain in the late summer and winter.[143][144][145] In the US, the rhizomes are susceptible to being dug up by squirrels.[146]

Propagation

Irises can generally be propagated by division,[147] or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves.[148] Oncoyclus irises dislike division, but it should only be carried out when the plant is overcrowded. Although hand pollination and germinating seedlings gives better results.[149]


Toxicity

ArmenianStamps-127-128.jpg Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.[150]


Culture

On 19 December 1997, as part of _Flora and Fauna of Armenia_ (III issue) in the 'Irises' series, 2 stamps had images of the irises,[151] (See images on the right), also on 12 August 1993, a commemorative stamp was issued in Azerbaijan, from the Flowers series, _Iris elegantissima_.[152]
