TANG SHI (; born 24 January 1995) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for Guangzhou Evergrande in the Chinese Super League.[1]


Club career

Tang Shi started his football career with Wuhan Optics Valley and joined Shandong Luneng's youth academy in 2009 after Wuhan's disbandment.[2][3] He refused to sign a professional contract with Shandong and transferred to Série A side Botafogo's youth academy in May 2014.[4][5][6] He was then given a trial with Real Madrid Castilla thanks to a youth training partnership between the two clubs; however, he remained at Botafogo's youth academy after the trial.[7]

On 29 July 2015, Tang transferred to Campeonato de Portugal side Gondomar.[8] He made his debut for the club on 23 August 2015 in a 3–0 win against Vila Real.[9] He made thirty appearances and scored twelve goals for the club in the 2015-16 season. On 1 July 2016, Tang was loaned to Primeira Liga side Paços de Ferreira after signing with China League One side Meizhou Hakka.[10] He made his debut for the club on 25 October 2016 in a 4–0 win against C.D. Nacional in the 2016-17 Taça da Liga.[11]

After playing just two cup matches for Paços de Ferreira, Tang terminated his contract and was loaned to Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan for one season in February 2017.[12] On 5 March 2017, he made his debut for the club in the first match of the season in a 2–1 away loss against Guangzhou Evergrande.[13] He was a regular starter at the beginning of season as the benefactor of the new rule of the league that at least one Under-23 player must be in the starting line-up. However, his playing time was on the decline during the season,[14] and he eventually lost his position to Ba Dun after manager José González was sacked by the club in June 2017.[15] Tang played 14 league matches for the club in the 2017 season.

On 24 December 2017, Tang transferred to top tier side Guangzhou Evergrande.[16] He made his debut on 18 March 2018 in a 1–0 home win over Henan Jianye, coming on for Yu Hanchao in the 79th minute.[17] He scored his first goal for the club on 2 May 2018, netting the opener in the 23rd minute in the 2018 Chinese FA Cup against Guizhou Hengfeng which Guangzhou eventually lost in the penalty shoot-out.[18]
