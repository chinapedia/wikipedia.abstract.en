KIDNAPPING, CAUCASIAN STYLE! (; informally referred to as the KIDNAPPING, CAUCASIAN STYLE 2) is a Russian comedy film by director Maxim Voronkov. A remake of the 1967 film of the same name, it has a humorous plot revolving around bride kidnapping, an old tradition that used to exist in certain regions of the Northern Caucasus.

Dedicated to the memory of Ilya Oleynikov, the film premiered on August 21, 2014.[1][2] As was the case with the original, filming was done in the Crimea, not in the North Caucasus.[3]

The movie was met with strongly negative reviews in the Russian media, with some considering it being one of the worst films ever made, and it was a box office bomb.

Realizing that he had been deceived, Shura rushes to rescue his beloved.
