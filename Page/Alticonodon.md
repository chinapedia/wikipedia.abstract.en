_Alticonodon_ is a genus of extinct mammal from the Late Cretaceous of North America. It is the geologically youngest known eutriconodont, and is a fairly more specialised animal than earlier representatives of this clade.[1]


Description

_Alticonodon_ is currently a monotypic genus, represented exclusively by _A. lindoei_. Its is known from the Milk River Formation deposits of the early Campanian of Alberta, Canada. It is known from two specimens: a dentary fragment bearing two molars, and an isolated lower last molar.


Classification

_Alticonodon_ has been consistently recovered as a triconodontid, and more specifically as an alticonodontine,[2] though the latter term may be redundant in relation to the rest of Triconodontidae.[3]


Biology

Compared to earlier eutriconodonts, _Alticonodon_ has molars better specialised for shearing.[4][5] As eutriconodonts as a group had shearing molars due to their carnivorous habits,[6] it can be inferred that _Alticonodon_ was hypercarnivorous.

This ecological speciation might have come due to competition with other mammals in the region, such as the various metatherians.[7]


Ecology

The Milk River Formation is a rich fossil environment that covered near-shore and terrestrial deposits. It included a few dinosaur species like _Saurornitholestes_ and _Acrotholus_, as well as a variety of other vertebrate such as the crocodilian _Gilchristosuchus_, various turtles and fish.

The mammalian fauna was primarily dominated by metatherians and multituberculates, as usual for Late Cretaceous mammaliafaunas, but a variety of older taxa remained; besides _Alticonodon_, there was also the symmetrodont _Symmetrodontoides_, and the illusive _Potamotelses_ and picopsids. These were the last non-therian mammals (other than the highly successful multituberculates) in North America, suggesting a relictual element to the region's fauna.
