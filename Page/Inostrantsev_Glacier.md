The INOSTRANTSEV GLACIER (; _Lednik Inostrantseva_) is one of the major glaciers in Novaya Zemlya, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.[1]

It was named after Russian geologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and professor at St. Petersburg University Alexander Alexandrovich Inostrantsev _(Александр Александрович Иностранцев)_ by Arctic explorer Georgy Sedov.[2]


Geography

The Inostrantsev Glacier is located on the western side of northern Severny Island of Novaya Zemlya. Flowing from the Severny Island ice cap, it is a roughly southeast-northwest oriented tidewater glacier and its front, where other three smaller tributary glaciers merge, has a width of over 3 km. Its terminus is at the Inostrantsev Bay (_Zaliv Inostrantseva_) of the Barents Sea, a 14 km wide and 130 m deep fjord.[3]
