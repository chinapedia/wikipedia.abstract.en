.[1] The words are separated by engraved dots, a common but by no means universal practice, and some of the long vowels (e.g., in ) are marked by apices.]] LATIN SPELLING, or LATIN ORTHOGRAPHY, is the spelling of Latin words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin from Old Latin to the present. All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase. The Roman alphabet, or Latin alphabet, was adapted from the Old Italic script to represent the phonemes of the Latin language. The Old Italic script had in turn been borrowed from the Greek alphabet, itself adapted from the Phoenician alphabet. The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet around 540 BC, as it appears on the black-figure pottery of the time.

LATIN PRONUNCIATION continually evolved over the centuries, making it difficult for speakers in one era to know how Latin was spoken in prior eras. A given phoneme may be represented by different letters in different periods. This article deals primarily with modern scholarship's best reconstruction of Classical Latin's phonemes (phonology) and the pronunciation and spelling used by educated people in the late Republic. This article then touches upon later changes and other variants. Knowledge of how Latin was pronounced comes from Roman grammar books, common misspellings by Romans, transcriptions into other ancient languages, and from how pronunciation has evolved in derived Romance languages.[2]


Letterforms

with portions of speeches delivered in the Roman Senate]] The forms of the Latin alphabet used during the Classical period did not distinguish between upper case and lower case. Roman inscriptions typically use Roman square capitals, which resemble modern capitals, and handwritten text often uses old Roman cursive, which includes letterforms similar to modern lowercase.

This article uses small caps for Latin text, representing Roman square capitals, and long vowels are marked with acutes, representing apices. In the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.


Letters and phonemes

In ancient Latin spelling, individual letters mostly corresponded to individual phonemes, with three main exceptions:

1.  The vowel letters _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, _y_ represented both short and long vowels. The long vowels were often marked by apices during the Classical period ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩, and long i was written using a taller version ⟨I⟩, called i longa "long I": ⟨ꟾ⟩;[3] but now long vowels are sometimes written with a macron in modern editions (_ā_), while short vowels are marked with a breve (_ă_) in dictionaries when necessary.
2.  Some pairs of vowel letters, such as _ae_, represented either a diphthong in one syllable or two vowels in adjacent syllables.
3.  The letters _i_ and _u - v_ represented either the close vowels and or the semivowels and .

In the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes that they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Notes on phonetics

-   The labialized velar stops and may both have been single phonemes rather than clusters like the and in English _quick_ and _penguin_. is more likely to have been a phoneme than . occurs between vowels and counts as a single consonant in Classical Latin poetry, but occurs only after , where it cannot be identified as a single or double consonant.[4] and were palatalized before a front vowel, becoming and , as in _quī_ compared with _quod_ , and _lingua_ compared with _pinguis_ . This sound change did not apply to in the same position: _uī - vī_ .[5]
-   before may have become by dissimilation. This is suggested by the fact that _equus_ and _unguunt_ (Old Latin equos and unguont) are spelled _ecus_ and _ungunt_, which may have indicated the pronunciations and . These spellings may, however, simply indicate that _c g_ before _u_ were labialized like , so that writing a double _uu_ was redundant.[6]

-   The voiceless plosives in Latin were likely less aspirated than voiceless plosives at the beginning of words in English; for example, Latin was not as strongly aspirated as _k_ in _kind_ but more like _k_ in English _sky_ or _look_. However, there was no phonemic contrast between voiceless and aspirated plosives in native Latin words, and the voiceless plosives were probably somewhat aspirated at the beginnings of words and near and .[7][8] Some Greek words beginning with the voiceless plosives , when they were borrowed into colloquial Latin, were spelled with the graphemes used to represent voiced plosives _b d g_ , e.g., Latin _gubernator_ besides West Greek (helmsman). That suggests that Latin speakers felt the Greek voiceless plosives to sound less aspirated than their own native equivalents.[9]
-   The aspirated consonants as distinctive phonemes were originally foreign to Latin, appearing in educated loanwords and names from Greek. In such cases, the aspiration was likely produced only by educated speakers.[10][11]
-   was also not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC, when it was probably pronounced initially and doubled between vowels, in contrast to Classical Greek or . In Classical Latin poetry, the letter between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.[12][13]

-   In Classical Latin, the coronal sibilant was likely unvoiced in all positions. In Old Latin, single between vowels was pronounced as voiced but had changed to by rhotacism by the time of Classical Latin, as in _gerō_ as compared with _gestus_ . Intervocalic in Classical usually derives from an earlier double after a long vowel or diphthong, as in _causa_, _cāsus_ from earlier _caussa_, _cāssus_;[14] or from loanwords, such as _pausa_ from Greek (_pausis_).
-   In Old Latin, final after a short vowel was often lost, probably after first changing to (debuccalization), as in the inscriptional form _Cornelio_ for _Cornelios_ (Classical Latin _Cornelius_). Often in the poetry of Plautus, Ennius, and Lucretius, final before a word beginning in a consonant did not make the preceding syllable heavy.[15]
-   was labiodental in Classical Latin, but it may have been bilabial in Old Latin,[16] or perhaps in free variation with . Lloyd, Sturtevant, and Kent make this argument based on certain misspellings in inscriptions, the Proto-Indo-European phone from which many instances of the Latin _f_ descended (others are from and ) and the way the sound appears to have behaved in Vulgar Latin, particularly in Spain.[17]

-   In most cases was pronounced as a bilabial nasal. At the end of a word, however, it was generally lost beginning in Old Latin (except when another nasal or a plosive followed it), causing the preceding vowel to be lengthened and nasalized,[18] as in _decem_ . In Old Latin inscriptions, it is often omitted, as in _viro_ for _virom_ (Classical _virum_). It was frequently elided before a following vowel in Latin poetry, and it was lost without a trace (apart from the lengthening) in the Romance languages,[19] except in monosyllabic words.
-   assimilated to before labial consonants as in _impar_ < *in-par, to before (if it did not represent nasalization) and to before velar consonants, as in _quīnque_ .[20] This assimilation likely also occurred between the preposition _in_ and a following word: _in causā_ , _in pace_ .[21]

-   assimilated to a velar nasal before .[22] Allen and Greenough say that a vowel before is always long,[23] but W. Sidney Allen says that is based on an interpolation in Priscian, and the vowel was actually long or short depending on the root, as for example _rēgnum_ from the root of _rēx_ , but _magnus_ from the root of _magis_ .[24] probably did not assimilate to before . The cluster arose by syncope, as for example _tegmen_ from _tegimen_. Original developed into in _flamma_, from the root of _flagrō_.[25] At the start of a word, was reduced to , and this change was reflected in the orthography in later texts: _gnātus_ became _nātus_, _gnōscō_ became _nōscō_.

-   In Classical Latin, the rhotic was most likely an alveolar trill . Gaius Lucilius likens it to the sound of a dog, and later writers describe it as being produced by vibration. In Old Latin, intervocalic developed into (rhotacism), suggesting an approximant like the English , and was sometimes written as , suggesting a tap like Spanish single _r_.[26]
-   had two allophones in Latin: and . Roman grammarians called these variants _exīlis_ ('thin') and _plēnus_ or _pinguis_ ('full' or 'thick'). Those adjectives are used elsewhere for front and back vowels respectively, which suggests that the "thin" allophone was a plain alveolar lateral approximant , like the clear in English _leaf_ in some English dialects or that of languages like Spanish or German, while the "full" or "thick" allophone was velarized like the English dark in _full_. It is partly uncertain where these allophones occurred. Sihler and Allen agree that was clear when the sound was doubled as , and dark when it occurred before another consonant or at the end of a word, but disagree on whether clear or dark _l_ occurred before vowels. Sihler says that was clear before and dark before other vowels, but Allen says that was dark before back vowels in pre-Classical Latin and clear before both front and back vowels in Classical Latin. This represents a partial agreement, however, in that Sihler argues the Classical Latin had three degrees of velarization, with a darker enunciation before consonants than vowels.[27][28]

-   generally appeared only at the beginning of words, before a vowel, as in _iaceō_ , except in compound words such as _adiaceō_ . Between vowels, this sound was generally not found as a single consonant, only as doubled , as in _cuius_ , except in compound words such as _trāiectus_ . varied with in the same morpheme in _iam_ and _etiam_ , and in poetry, one could be replaced with the other for the purposes of meter.[29]

-   was pronounced as an approximant until the first century AD, when and began to develop into fricatives. In poetry, and could be replaced with each other, as in for _silva_ and for _genua_ . Unlike , it was not doubled as or between vowels, except in Greek loanwords: _cavē_ , but _Evander_ from .[30]

Notes on spelling

-   Doubled consonant letters, such as _cc_, _ss_, represented geminated (doubled or long) consonants: . In Old Latin, geminate consonants were written singly like single consonants, until the middle of the 2nd century BC, when they began to be doubled in writing.[31] Grammarians mention the marking of double consonants with the sicilicus, a diacritic in the shape of a sickle. This mark appears in a few inscriptions of the Augustan era.[32]
-   _c_ and _k_ both represent the velar stop ; _qu_ represents the labialized velar stop . The letters _q_ and _c_ distinguish minimal pairs between and , such as _cui_ and _quī_ .[33] In Classical Latin, _k_ appeared in only a few words, such as _kalendae_ or _Karthagō_ (but can also be spelled _calendae_ and _Carthagō_ respectively).[34]
-   _x_ represented the consonant cluster . In Old Latin, this sequence was also spelled as _ks_, _cs_, and _xs_. X was borrowed from the Western Greek alphabet, in which the letterform of chi Χ was pronounced as . In the standard Ionic alphabet, used for modern editions of Ancient Greek, on the other hand, Χ represented , and the letter xi Ξ represented .[35]
-   In Old Latin inscriptions, and were not distinguished. They were both represented by _c_ before _e_ and _i_, _q_ before _o_ and _u_, and _k_ before consonants and _a_.[36] The letterform of _c_ derives from Greek gamma Γ, which represented , but its use for may come from Etruscan, which did not distinguish voiced and voiceless plosives. In Classical Latin, _c_ represented only in _c_ and _cn_, the abbreviations of the praenomina (first names) _Gaius_ and _Gnaeus_.[37][38]
-   The letter _g_ was created in the third century BC to distinguish the voiced from voiceless .[39] Its letterform derived from _c_ by the addition of a diacritic or stroke. Plutarch attributes this innovation to Spurius Carvilius Ruga around 230 BC,[40] but it may have originated with Appius Claudius Caecus in the fourth century BC.[41]
-   The combination _gn_ probably represented the consonant cluster , at least between vowels, as in _agnus_ .[42][43] Vowels before this cluster were sometimes long and sometimes short.[44]
-   The digraphs _ph_, _th,_ and _ch_ represented the aspirated plosives , and . They began to be used in writing around 150 BC,[45] primarily as a transcription of Greek phi , theta , and chi , as in _Philippus_, _cithara_, and _achāia_. Some native words were later also written with these digraphs, such as _pulcher_, _lachrima_, _gracchus_, _triumphus_, probably representing aspirated allophones of the voiceless plosives near and . Aspirated plosives and the glottal fricative were also used hypercorrectively, an affectation satirized in Catullus 84.[46][47]
-   In Old Latin, Koine Greek initial and between vowels were represented by _s_ and _ss_, as in _sona_ from and _massa_ from . Around the second and first centuries B.C., the Greek letter zeta Ζ was adopted to represent and .[48] However, the Vulgar Latin spellings _z_ or _zi_ for earlier _di_ and _d_ before _e_, and the spellings _di_ and _dz_ for earlier _z_, suggest the pronunciation , as for example _ziomedis_ for _diomedis_, and _diaeta_ for _zeta_.[49]
-   In ancient times _u_ and _i_ represented the approximant consonants and , as well as the close vowels and .
-   _i_ representing the consonant was usually not doubled in writing so a single _i_ represented double or and the sequences and , as in _cuius_ for *_cuiius_ , _conicit_ for *_coniicit_ , and _rēicit_ for *_reiiicit_ . Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of _i_ could occur in some of the same environments: compare _māius_ with _Gāius_ , and _Iūlius_ with _Iūlus_ . The vowel before a doubled is sometimes marked with a macron, as in _cūius_. It indicates not that the vowel is long but that the first syllable is heavy from the double consonant.[50]
-   _v_ between vowels represented single in native Latin words but double in Greek loanwords. Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of _v_ sometimes occurred in similar environments, as in _genua_ and _silva_ .[51][52]

Vowels

Monophthongs

Latin has ten native vowels, spelled _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_. In Classical Latin, each vowel had short and long versions: and . The long versions of the close and mid vowels _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_ had a different vowel quality from the short versions, so that long were similar to short . Some loanwords from Greek had the vowel _y_, which was pronounced as by educated speakers but approximated with the native vowels _u_ and _i_ by less educated speakers.

+-------+-------+---------+-------+

Long and short vowels

Each vowel letter (with the possible exception of _y_) represents at least two phonemes. _a_ can represent either short or long , _e_ represents either or , etc.

Short mid vowels () and close vowels () were pronounced with a different quality from their long counterparts, being also more open: , , and . This opening made the short vowels _i u_ similar in quality to long _é ó_ respectively. _i é_ and _u ó_ were often written in place of each other in inscriptions:[53]

-   _trebibos_ for _tribibus_
-   _minsis_ for _mensis_
-   _sob_ for _sub_
-   _punere_ for _pōnere_

Short most likely had a more open allophone before and tended toward near-open .[54]

Short and were probably pronounced closer when they occurred before another vowel. _mea_ was written as _mia_ in inscriptions. Short before another vowel is often written with _i longa_, as in _dīes_, indicating that its quality was similar to that of long and is almost never confused with _e_ in this position.[55]

Adoption of Greek upsilon

_y_ was used in Greek loanwords with upsilon Υ. This letter represented the close front rounded vowel, both short and long: .[56] Latin did not have this sound as a distinctive phoneme, and speakers tended to pronounce such loanwords with in Old Latin and in Classical and Late Latin if they were unable to produce .

Sonus medius

An intermediate vowel sound (likely a close central vowel or possibly its rounded counterpart ), called _sonus medius_, can be reconstructed for the classical period.[57] Such a vowel is found in _docUmentum_, _optImus_, _lacrIma_ (also spelled _docImentum_, _optUmus_, _lacrUma_) and other words. It developed out of a historical short , later fronted by vowel reduction. In the vicinity of labial consonants, this sound was not as fronted and may have retained some rounding.[58]

Vowel nasalization

Vowels followed by a nasal consonant were allophonically realised as long nasal vowels in two environments:[59]

-   Before word-final _m_:[60]
    -   _monstrum_  > .
    -   _dentem_  >
-   Before nasal consonants followed by a fricative:[61]
    -   _censor_  > (in early inscriptions, often written as _cesor_)
    -   _consul_  > (often written as _cosol_ and abbreviated as _cos_)
    -   _inferōs_  > (written as _iferos_)

Those long nasal vowels had the same quality as ordinary long vowels. In Vulgar Latin, the vowels lost their nasalisation, and they merged with the long vowels (which were themselves shortened by that time). This is shown by many forms in the Romance languages, such as Spanish _costar_ from Vulgar Latin _cōstāre_ (originally _constāre_) and Italian _mese_ from Vulgar Latin _mēse_ (Classical Latin _mensem_). On the other hand, the short vowel and was restored in French _enseigne_ and _enfant_ from _insignia_ and _infantem_ (_e_ is the normal development of Latin short _i_), likely by analogy with other forms beginning in the prefix _in-_.[62]

When a final _-m_ occurred before a plosive or nasal in the next word, however, it was pronounced as a nasal at the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, _tan dūrum_ was written for _tam dūrum_ in inscriptions, and _cum nōbīs_ was a double entendre,[63] possibly for _cunnō bis_ .

: Diphthongs classified by beginning sound

_ae_, _oe_, _au_, _ei_, _eu_ could represent diphthongs: _ae_ represented , _oe_ represented , _au_ represented , _ei_ represented , and _eu_ represented . _ui_ sometimes represented the diphthong , as in _cui_ and _huic_.[64]

If there is a tréma above the second vowel, both vowels are pronounced separately: _aë_ , _aü_ , _eü_ and _oë_ .

In Old Latin, _ae_, _oe_ were written as _ai_, _oi_ and probably pronounced as , with a fully closed second element, similar to the final syllable in French . In the late Old Latin period, the last element of the diphthongs was lowered to ,[65] so that the diphthongs were pronounced and in Classical Latin, similar to the diphthongs in English and . They were then monophthongized to and , starting in rural areas at the end of the Republican period.[66] The process, however, does not seem to have been completed before the 3rd century AD in Vulgar Latin, and some scholars say that it may have been regular by the 5th century.[67]

Vowel and consonant length

Vowel and consonant length were more significant and more clearly defined in Latin than in modern English. Length is the duration of time that a particular sound is held before proceeding to the next sound in a word. Unfortunately, "vowel length" is a confusing term for English speakers, who, in their language, call "long vowels" what are usually diphthongs rather than monophthongs. (That is a relic of the Great Vowel Shift, during which vowels that had once been pronounced phonemically longer turned into diphthongs.) In the modern spelling of Latin, especially in dictionaries and academic work, macrons are frequently used to mark long vowels: , while the breve is sometimes used to indicate that a vowel is short: .

Long consonants were usually indicated through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did not distinguish between the vocalic and consonantal uses of _i_ and _v_. Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then through a variety of means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention of spelling long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet Lucius Accius. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an apex (a diacritic similar to an acute accent) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter (long i); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well.[68] Distinctions of vowel length had become less important in later Latin and have ceased to be phonemic in the modern Romance languages, in which the previous long and short versions of the vowels have been either lost or replaced by other phonetic contrasts. However, distinctions of consonant length is still phonemic in the Romance language of Italian, as the Italian word _nono_ means "the ninth" while the word _nonno_ means "grandfather".[69]

A minimal set showing both long and short vowels and long and short consonants is _ānus_ ('buttocks'), _annus_ ('year'), _anus_ ('old woman').

: Pronunciation of Latin diphthongs


Syllables and stress

Old Latin stress

In Old Latin, as in Proto-Italic, stress normally fell on the first syllable of a word.[76] During this period, the word-initial stress triggered changes in the vowels of non-initial syllables, the effects of which are still visible in classical Latin. Compare for example:

-   _fAciō_ 'I do/make', _fActus_ 'made'; pronounced and in later Old Latin and Classical Latin.
-   _affIciō_ 'I affect', _affEctus_ 'affected'; pronounced and in Old Latin following vowel reduction, and in Classical Latin.

In the earliest Latin writings, the original unreduced vowels are still visible. Study of this vowel reduction, as well as syncopation (dropping of short unaccented syllables) in Greek loan words, indicates that the stress remained word-initial until around the time of Plautus, in the 3rd century BC.[77] The placement of the stress then shifted to become the pattern found in classical Latin.

Classical Latin syllables and stress

In Classical Latin, stress changed. It moved from the first syllable to one of the last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for _antepaenultima_ 'before almost last', _paenultima_ 'almost last', and _ultima syllaba_ 'last syllable'). Its position is determined by the syllable weight of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light and there are more than two syllables, the antepenult is accented.[78] In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.[79]

Syllable

To determine stress, syllable weight of the penult must be determined. To determine syllable weight, words must be broken up into syllables.[80] In the following examples, syllable structure is represented using these symbols: C (a consonant), K (a stop), R (a liquid), and V (a short vowel), VV (a long vowel or diphthong).

Nucleus

Every short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. This vowel forms the syllable nucleus. Thus _magistrārum_ has four syllables, one for every vowel (a i ā u: V V VV V), _aereus_ has three (ae e u: VV V V), _tuō_ has two (u ō: V VV), and _cui_ has one (ui: VV).[81]

Onset and coda

A consonant before a vowel, or a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word, is placed in the same syllable as the following vowel. This consonant or consonant cluster forms the syllable onset.[82]

-   _fēminae_ (CVV.CV.CVV)
-   _vidēre_ (CV.CVV.CV)
-   _puerō_ (CV.V.CVV)
-   _beātae_ (CV.VV.CVV)
-   _graviter_ (CCV.CV.CVC)
-   _strātum_ (CCCVV.CVC)

After this, if there is an additional consonant inside the word, it is placed at the end of the syllable. This consonant is the syllable coda. Thus if a consonant cluster of two consonants occurs between vowels, they are broken up between syllables: one goes with the syllable before, the other with the syllable after.[83]

-   _puella_ (CV.VC.CV)
-   _supersum_ (CV.CVC.CVC)
-   _coāctus_ (CV.VVC.CVC)
-   _intellēxit_ (VC.CVC.CVVC.CVC)

There are two exceptions. A consonant cluster of a stop _p t c b d g_ followed by a liquid _l r_ between vowels usually goes to the syllable after it, although it is also sometimes broken up like other consonant clusters.[84]

-   _volucris_ or (CV.CV.KRVC or CV.CVK.RVC)

Heavy and light syllables

As shown in the examples above, Latin syllables have a variety of possible structures. Here are some of them. The first four examples are light syllables, and the last six are heavy. All syllables have at least one V (vowel). A syllable is heavy if it has another V or a VC after the first V. In the table below, the extra V or VC is bolded, indicating that it makes the syllable heavy.

  --- --- --- --- --- ---
              V
          C   V
      C   C   V
  C   C   C   V
          C   V   V
          C   V   C
          C   V   V   C
              V   V
              V   C
              V   V   C
  --- --- --- --- --- ---

Thus, a syllable is heavy if it ends in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and a consonant, a long vowel and a consonant, or a diphthong and a consonant. Syllables ending in a diphthong and consonant are rare in Classical Latin.

The syllable onset has no relationship to syllable weight; both heavy and light syllables can have no onset or an onset of one, two, or three consonants.

In Latin a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called _syllaba nātūrā longa_ ('syllable long by nature'), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called _positiōne longa_ ('long by position'). These terms are translations of Greek _συλλαβὴ μακρά φύσει_ (_syllabḕ makrá phýsei_ = 'syllable long by nature') and _μακρὰ θέσει_ (_makrà thései_ = 'long by PROposition'), respectively; therefore _positiōne_ should not be mistaken for implying a syllable "is long because of its position/place in a word" but rather "is treated as 'long' by convention". This article uses the words _heavy_ and _light_ for syllables, and _long_ and _short_ for vowels since the two are not the same.[85]

Stress rule

In a word of three or more syllables, the weight of the penult determines where the accent is placed. If the penult is light, accent is placed on the antepenult; if it is heavy, accent is placed on the penult.[86] Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark before the stressed syllable.

Iambic shortening

IAMBIC SHORTENING or _brevis brevians_ is vowel shortening that occurs in words of the type _light–heavy_, where the light syllable is stressed. By this sound change, words like _egō_, _modō_, _benē_, _amā_ with long final vowel change to _ego_, _modo_, _bene_, _ama_ with short final vowel.[87]


Elision

Where one word ended with a vowel (including a nasalized vowel, represented by a vowel plus _m_) and the next word began with a vowel, the former vowel, at least in verse, was regularly elided; that is, it was omitted altogether, or possibly (in the case of and ) pronounced like the corresponding semivowel. When the second word was _est_ or _et_, a different form of elision sometimes occurred (prodelision): the vowel of the preceding word was retained, and the _e_ was elided instead. Elision also occurred in Ancient Greek, but in that language, it is shown in writing by the vowel in question being replaced by an apostrophe, whereas in Latin elision is not indicated at all in the orthography, but can be deduced from the verse form. Only occasionally is it found in inscriptions, as in _scriptust_ for _scriptum est_.[88]


Latin spelling and pronunciation today

Spelling

Modern usage, even for classical Latin texts, varies in respect of _I_ and _V_. During the Renaissance, the printing convention was to use _I_ (upper case) and _i_ (lower case) for both vocalic and consonantal , to use _V_ in the upper case and in the lower case to use _v_ at the start of words and _u_ subsequently within the word regardless of whether and was represented.[89]

Many publishers (such as Oxford University Press) have adopted the convention of using _I_ (upper case) and _i_ (lower case) for both and , and _V_ (upper case) and _u_ (lower case) for both and .

An alternative approach, less common today, is to use _i_ and _u_ only for the vowels and _j_ and _v_ for the approximants.

Most modern editions, however, adopt an intermediate position, distinguishing between _u_ and _v_ but not between _i_ and _j_. Usually, the non-vocalic _v_ after _q_ or _g_ is still printed as _u_ rather than _v_, probably because in this position it did not change from to in post-classical times.[90]

Textbooks and dictionaries indicate the length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, but it is not generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance, _Româ_ ('from Rome' ablative) compared to _Roma_ ('Rome' nominative).[91] Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they never heard it spoken aloud.

Pronunciation

Post-Medieval Latin

Since around the beginning of the Renaissance period onwards, with the language being used as an international language among intellectuals, pronunciation of Latin in Europe came to be dominated by the phonology of local languages, resulting in a variety of different pronunciation systems.

Loan words and formal study

When Latin words are used as loanwords in a modern language, there is ordinarily little or no attempt to pronounce them as the Romans did; in most cases, a pronunciation suiting the phonology of the receiving language is employed.

Latin words in common use in English are generally fully assimilated into the English sound system, with little to mark them as foreign, for example, _cranium_, _saliva_. Other words have a stronger Latin feel to them, usually because of spelling features such as the digraphs _ae_ and _oe_ (occasionally written as ligatures: _æ_ and _œ_, respectively), which both denote in English. The digraph _ae_ or ligature _æ_ in some words tend to be given an pronunciation, for example, _curriculum vitae_.

However, using loan words in the context of the language borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below on "Derivative languages").

However, other languages—including Romance family members—all have their own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin. But English, Romance, or other teachers do not always point out that the particular accent their students learn is not actually the way ancient Romans spoke.

Ecclesiastical pronunciation

Because of the central position of Rome within the Catholic Church, an Italian pronunciation of Latin became commonly accepted, but this was not the case until the latter part of the 19th century. This pronunciation corresponds to that of the Latin-derived words in Italian. Before then, the pronunciation of Latin in church was the same as the pronunciation as Latin in other fields and tended to reflect the sound values associated with the nationality of the speaker.. Other ecclesiastical variations are still in use (e.g. Germanic pronunciations), especially outside the Roman Catholic church.

The following are the main points that distinguish modern Italianate ecclesiastical pronunciation from Classical Latin pronunciation:

The letters _b_, _d_, _n_, _f_, _m_, _n_ are always pronounced as in English , , , , respectively, and they do not usually cause any difficulties. The exceptions are mentioned below:

: Pronunciation of Latin diphthongs

-   Vowel length is not phonemic. As a result, the automatic stress accent of Classical Latin, which was dependent on vowel length, becomes a phonemic one in Ecclesiastical Latin. (Some Ecclesiastical texts mark the stress with an acute accent in words of three or more syllables.)
-   Word-final _m_ and _n_ are pronounced fully, with no nasalization of the preceding vowel.

In his _Vox Latina: A guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin_, William Sidney Allen remarked that this pronunciation, used by the Catholic Church in Rome and elsewhere, and whose adoption Pope Pius X recommended in a 1912 letter to the Archbishop of Bourges, "is probably less far removed from classical Latin than any other 'national' pronunciation"; but, as can be seen from the table above, there are, nevertheless, very significant differences.[92] The introduction to the _Liber Usualis_ indicates that Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation should be used at Church liturgies.[93] The Pontifical Academy for Latin is the pontifical academy in the Vatican that is charged with the dissemination and education of Catholics in the Latin language.

Outside of Austria, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia, it is the most widely used standard in choral singing which, with a few exceptions like Stravinsky's _Oedipus rex_, is concerned with liturgical texts. Anglican choirs adopted it when classicists abandoned traditional English pronunciation after World War II. The rise of historically informed performance and the availability of guides such as Copeman's _Singing in Latin_ has led to the recent revival of regional pronunciations.


Pronunciation shared by Vulgar Latin and Romance languages

Because it gave rise to many modern languages, Latin did not "die"; it merely evolved over the centuries in different regions in diverse ways. The local dialects of Vulgar Latin that emerged eventually became modern Italian, Spanish, French, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, Romansh, Dalmatian, Sardinian, and many others.

Key features of Vulgar Latin and Romance languages include:

-   Almost total loss of and final unstressed .
-   Conversion of the distinction of vowel length into a distinction of height, and subsequent merger of some of these phonemes. Most Romance languages merged short with long and short with long .
-   Monophthongization of into and into .
-   Loss of marginal phonemes such as aspirates (, , and ), which became tenues, and the close front-rounded vowel , which became unrounded.
-   Loss of before [94] (CL _spōnsa_ > VL _spōsa_) but this influence on the later development of Romance languages was limited from written influence, analogy, and learned borrowings.[95]
-   Palatalization of before and (not in all varieties), probably first into and then before it finally developed into or .[96]
-   Palatalization of before and , and of , into (not in all varieties) and then further into in some Romance varieties.[97]
-   Palatalization of followed by a vowel (if not preceded by s, t, x) into . It merged with in dialects in which had developed into this sound, but it remained separate elsewhere (such as Italian).
-   Palatalization of and followed by a vowel into and . (orthographic _gn_) also coalesced to become .
-   The change of (except after ) and between vowels, into .


Examples

The following examples are both in verse, which demonstrates several features more clearly than prose.

From Classical Latin

Virgil's _Aeneid_, Book 1, verses 1–4. Quantitative metre (dactylic hexameter). Translation: "I sing of arms and the man, who, driven by fate, came first from the borders of Troy to Italy and the Lavinian shores; he [was] much afflicted both on lands and on the deep by the power of the gods, because of fierce Juno's vindictive wrath."

        Arma virúmque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris
        Italiam, fato profugus, Lavíniaque venit
        Litora; multùm ille et terris jactatus et alto

2.  Modern orthography with macrons

        Arma virumque canō, Trōiae quī prīmus ab ōrīs

3.  Modern orthography without macrons

        Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
        Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit
        Litora; multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
        Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram.

Note the elisions in _mult(um)_ and _ill(e)_ in the third line. For a fuller discussion of the prosodic features of this passage, see Dactylic hexameter.

Some manuscripts have "Lāvīna" rather than "Lāvīnia" in the second line.

From Medieval Latin

Beginning of _Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium_ by Thomas Aquinas (13th century). Rhymed accentual metre. Translation: "Extol, [my] tongue, the mystery of the glorious body and the precious blood, which the fruit of a noble womb, the king of nations, poured out as the price of the world."

1. Traditional orthography as in Roman Catholic service books (stressed syllable marked with an acute accent on words of three syllables or more).

    Pange lingua gloriósi
    Córporis mystérium,
    Sanguinísque pretiósi,
    quem in mundi prétium
    fructus ventris generósi
    Rex effúdit géntium.

[98] "The word-divider is regularly found on all good inscriptions, in papyri, on wax tablets, and even in _graffiti_ from the earliest Republican times through the Golden Age and well into the Second Century. ... Throughout these periods the word-divider was a dot placed half-way between the upper and the lower edge of the line of writing. ... As a rule, interpuncta are used simply to divide words, except that prepositions are only rarely separated from the word they govern, if this follows next. ... The regular use of the interpunct as a word-divider continued until sometime in the Second Century, when it began to fall into disuse, and Latin was written with increasing frequency, both in papyrus and on stone or bronze, in _scriptura continua._"
