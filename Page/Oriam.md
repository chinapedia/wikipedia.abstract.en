ORIAM is Scotland's national performance centre for sport, based at Heriot-Watt University's Riccarton campus in Edinburgh. The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association use it as a training facility, as do Heart of Midlothian F.C. for first-team training and to run their academy. It is also used by other sports teams, students and members of the public.


History

A review of Scottish football, led by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, picked up on the lack of facilities in Scotland in the first report published in April 2010.[1] In February 2012, Sport Minister Shona Robison announced that £25million from the Scottish Government's Young Scots Fund would be put towards a new multi-sports centre which would include a national football academy.[2] Universities, colleges and local authorities were invited to bid.[3] By August 2013 there were three finalists.[4] In September 2013, it was announced that the design by Reiach & Hall was chosen.[5][6] The remaining £9million towards the cost of building came from sportscotland, Heriot-Watt University and the City of Edinburgh Council.[7]

Construction work began in March 2015.[8] The £33million facility opened in August 2016. The indoor football pitch is covered by a curved steel frame with a PVC roof,[9] the shape of which has been likened to the trajectory of "the goal which defied physics" which was scored by Brazilian football player Roberto Carlos against France in 1997.[10][11][12] The building won the Future Building section at the 2016 Scottish Design Awards.[13][14]


Sports

The Scottish Rugby Union and the Scottish Football Association have both made long-term commitments to using Oriam ahead of international fixtures.[15] Heart of Midlothian F.C. use the facility to run their academy and for first-team training.[16] The Scottish Handball Association, basketballscotland and Scottish Netball also use the facility.[17] Furthermore, it is used by the recently formed professional women’s team in basketball and handball, both launched in summer 2016.[18] Unlike some elite performance facilities, Oriam will be available to other sports teams, students and members of the public.[19][20] For the 2016–17 season, Hibernian F.C. will play their under-20 fixtures at Oriam.[21]


Facilities

The centre has a FIFA-accredited indoor synthetic 3G pitch which is the largest of its type in Europe.[22][23][24][25][26] Its dimensions of 116 yards by 76 yards are the same size as those of Hampden Park's pitch.[27][28][29][30] At the midpoint of this playing space, the roof is 28m high and there is a 15m playing height at the sides.[31] The space accommodates a viewing area that can seat 500 people.[32] There is also a synthetic pitch outdoors. There are natural surfaces outside too- five grass football pitches and two grass rugby pitches.[33]

Indoors there is a 12-court sports hall, eight squash courts and a four-court sports hall.[34] Other facilities available on the high-performance side of the centre include a hydrotherapy pool, a rehabilitation area and gym area for strength and conditioning.[35]

A 160-bed hotel is to be located on the site, to open in 2017.[36][37]
