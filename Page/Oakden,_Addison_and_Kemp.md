OAKDEN, ADDISON AND KEMP was an Australian architectural firm in Melbourne, Victoria. Many of their works are now heritage-listed.


History

The firm was a partnership of architects Percy Oakden, George Henry Male Addison and Henry Hardie Kemp established in 1887.[1] Prior to this, Oakden was in partnership with Leonard Terry from 1874 until Terry's death in 1884,[2][3] Addison left in 1892, resulting in the partnership Oakden and Kemp.[4] Kemp moved to Sydney in 1895, dissolving the partnership in 1896.[5]

In 1900/01 Cedric Henry Ballantyne became a partner in the firm of Oakden and Ballantyne.[6][7]
