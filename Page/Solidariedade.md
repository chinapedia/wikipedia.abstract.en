SOLIDARIEDADE (, "solidarity") is a Brazilian social-democratic political party that uses the number 77.[1] The party won 14 seats in the 2014 Brazilian general election.


Ideology

The party identifies itself as centre-left and social-democratic.[2] The party has strong links with Força Sindical, a labour union that historically strongly opposes the hegemony of Central Única dos Trabalhadores and other leftist labour movements in favor of a less ideological and more pragmatic approach, "Sindicalismo de Resultados" (Unionism of Results), which means less ideology and more direct gains for the working class.
