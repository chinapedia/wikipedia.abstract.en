The TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS consists of a public road network, two seaports, and three airports.


Roads

As of 2000, the Cayman Islands had a total of 488 miles (785 km) of paved highway.


Seaports

Two ports, Cayman Brac and George Town, serve the islands. One hundred and twenty-three ships (of 1,000 GT or more) are registered in the Cayman Islands, with a total capacity of 2,402,058 GT/. Some foreign ships (including vessels from Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Norway, the UK, and US) are registered in the Cayman Islands under a flag of convenience. (All figures are 2002 estimates.)


Airports

There are three airports on the Islands, two with paved and one with unpaved runways.


Buses

A fleet of Share taxi minibuses serves Grand Cayman.[1]

A daily service starts at 6.00 from the depot and runs as follows from George Town to:[2]

-   -   West Bay — every 15 minutes: 6.00–23.00 (24.00 on Fr, Sa). CI$1.50 each way.
    -   Bodden Town — every 30 minutes: 6.00–23.00 (24.00 on Fr, Sa). CI$1.50 each way.
    -   East End and North Side — every hour, 6.00–21.00 (24.00 on Fr). CI$2 each way.

Colour-coded logos on the front and rear of the buses (white mini-vans) identify the routes:
