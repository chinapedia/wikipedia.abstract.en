IGLESIA DEL CARMEN is a Panama Metro station on Line 1.[1] It was one of the metro network's first 11 stations, opened on 5 April 2014 and commencing operations the following day.[2]

The station is named after the nearby neo-gothic church. It serves the neighbourhood of Bella Vista, providing access to the city's financial and banking district and the nightlife and restaurant zone of Calle 50.[3]

In its first year of operations, it was the fifth most used station of the twelve on the network at that time, carrying 18% of the system's users at peak times.[4]

Iglesia del Carmen is seen as a key interchange station in the plans to expand the metro, as it will connect line 1 with the future line 2 and line 5.[5]
