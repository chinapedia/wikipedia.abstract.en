NICHOLAS JOHN PISANI (born 23 December 1962)[1] is a British television producer, and a former Editor of _Question Time_.


Early life

He was born in south Hampshire. He has a younger brother (born 1966). He attended independent school from 1976-81. He attended the National Broadcasting School in London.


Career

Radio

He has been a radio producer for LBC on its mid-morning show. In the 1990s he was also a producer at Sky Sports.

Mentorn

In the late 1990s, he was a producer on _Question Time_.

From 2000-06 he was Editor of _Question Time_ on BBC One, produced by Mentorn, who were bought by Tinopolis in 2006. The previous editor, Charlie Courtauld (1966 - February 2016), joined the _Independent on Sunday_. He increased the number of panelists from four to five, when a producer in October 1998.[2] He took the programme time from 11pm to 10.30pm. He would choose the questions that were submitted to the panelists. _Question Time_ began in September 1979.

On 8 May 2003, the BBC (Mentorn) trialled a programme called _Answer Time_ on BBC Four, a forty-minute television version from 11.35pm of _Any Answers?_; Five Live now effectively does the same thing on Thursday evenings.

Hours before the programme was due to be recorded on broadcast on Thursday 4 May 2006 before the results of the 2006 United Kingdom local elections, when aged 44, he left his post as Editor. He has been criticised for _dumbing down_ the programme, by inviting less-mainstream guests onto the programme, but this has been also viewed by others as making the programme less stuffy, conformist and narrow-mindedly bipartisan; previous editors had begun the trend.

BBC

Since 2009 he has been the executive producer of _Intelligence Squared_, which is shown globally on BBC World News.[3]


Personal life

He lives in London.
