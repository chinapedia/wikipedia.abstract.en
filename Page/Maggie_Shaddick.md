MARGARET E. ("MAGGIE") SHADDICK (March 19, 1926 â€“ March 13, 2019) served as the assistant provincial commissioner for international relationships of the Quebec Council of Scouts Canada.

Shaddick did not experience scouting in her youth. In 1959, she became her son's Cub Scout pack leader. Gradually, she became involved in Canadian Scouting, and in England she became assistant to the district commissioner. Back in Canada, she was the first female district commissioner of Scouts Canada.[1] She, then, played an important role on the international scene, in particular in assisting the rebirth and integration of scouting in the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

In 2012, Shaddick was awarded the 338th _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world scouting.[2][3]

Shaddick died on March 13, 2019.[4]
