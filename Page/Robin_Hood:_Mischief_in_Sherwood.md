His friends are Little John, Tuck, Scarlett and Marian on whom he has a crush.

-   PRINCE JOHN (voiced by David Nelson) The antagonist of the series. The Prince is arrogant, selfish and greedy. He thinks of himself as the most powerful, though lacks any fighting skills or the traits that of a prince's. He loves money and treasure, and also enjoying taking the villagers' money as 'Taxes'. He is also shown to be a Scaredy-Cat at times, and always loses to Robin, whom he hates.
-   SHERIFF (voiced by David Wills) based on the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff leads the guards. He is naive and clumsy. He is often fooled by Marian or Scarlett and pranked by Robin, who always escapes his attempts to catch him.

-   MARIAN (voiced by Sarah Natochenny) based on Maid Marian. She operates as a spy in Prince John's castle, informing to Robin and his friends, using magic learned from her master which sometimes fails. She often gets herself into dangerous situations and is always saved by Robin. She and robin have a crush on each other.
    -   DERKE is a dragon who Marian transformed into a hamster. He mostly stays hot-headed because of the lack of magic Marian can do to turn him back into a dragon. Her spells always send him into hilarious situations. He is quiet brave though, and always helps Robin when possible.
-   SCARLETT (voiced by Eileen Stevens) is based on Will Scarlet, but changed into a girl in this show. She and Marian work together.
