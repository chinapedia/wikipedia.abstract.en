Daniel_Christian.jpg is the only bowler to take two five-wicket hauls in the BBL.[1]]] In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a "five-for" or "fifer")[2][3] refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.[4] The Big Bash League (BBL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in Australia, which has been held annually since its first season in 2011–12.[5] In the six seasons played, seven five-wicket hauls have been taken by six different bowlers. Players from five of the eight teams have taken five-wicket hauls.[6]

The first five-wicket haul was taken by Lasith Malinga of the Melbourne Stars against the Perth Scorchers on 12 December 2012.[7] Malinga took six wickets for seven runs, the best bowling figures in an innings by a player in the competition and one of only two six-wicket hauls. This also the most economical five-wicket haul taken with an economy rate of just 1.75[8] The next five-wicket haul came only 16 days later, taken by Daniel Christian of the Brisbane Heat against Sydney Thunder at ANZ Stadium in Sydney.[9] This is the least economical five-wicket haul, bowling with an economy rate of 6.50.[10]

Seasons 2013–14 and 2014–15 saw no five-wicket hauls taken. The third bowler to obtain five wicket in an innings was Sydney Sixers' Nathan Lyon playing at home against the Hobart Hurricanes on 20 December 2015. Despite taking figures of 5/23, Lyon is only bowler not to be named man of the match.[11] The fourth bowler was Samuel Badree, the second time a Brisbane Heat player has reached this milestone. Playing against the Melbourne Stars at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January 2016, Badree took the opening five wickets of the innings from just 16 balls, finishing with figures of 5/22 off his four overs.[12]

The 2016–17 BBL season saw three five-wicket hauls taken. On 31 December 2016, Sean Abbott became the second Sydney Sixers player to achieve the feat. The Sixers lost to the Adelaide Strikers by 48 runs,[13] the only occurrence of the seven which did not result in a victory to the team taking the five-wicket haul.[14] Just two days later, Daniel Christian became the only player achieve the feat twice.[15] Now with the Hobart Hurricanes, Christian finished the match with 5/14.[16] The fifth most recent five-wicket haul was taken by Ish Sodhi of the Adelaide Strikers. Achieving the second best figures taken the competition, Sodhi took 6/14 off just 21 deliveries to become the second player to take six wickets in a BBL innings.[17]

Thirty four-wicket hauls have been taken in the league, only five of which were taken in fewer than four overs.[18]

The list includes all the five-wicket hauls taken in the BBL, and is correct as of the 2016–17 season. The list does not cover the games played by the BBL teams in other tournaments, such as the Champions League Twenty20.
