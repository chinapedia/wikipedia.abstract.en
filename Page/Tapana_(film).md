Production

The film was announced in June 2003, where Applause Entertainment Ltd revealed their maiden regional venture titled _Tapana_ at Annapurna Studio in Banjara Hills.[1] The film marked the debut of actress Jayaprada's nephew Siddhu in the leading role, alongside Prabhu Deva. She had initially attempted to launch Siddhu through a bilingual venture titled _Classmates_ in 2001, but the film did not materialise.[2] He later made a comeback with the Tamil film _Uyire Uyire_, starring Hansika Motwani, during 2016.


Release

_Tapana_ opened to mixed reviews in February 2004, with a critic from Idlebrain.com noting the "first half of the film does not have any story, hence is little boring. Things start rolling in second half. The film is good from the moment it is revealed that heroine is suffering with a disease".[3] A critic from AllIndianSite.com wrote "Dhanraj's direction was not impressive, the entire film was narrated very slowly. It was more like a TV serial than a film".[4]


Soundtrack

An audio release event was held in December 2003 at Taj Krishna Hotel with Sonali Bendre in attendance as the chief guest.[5]
