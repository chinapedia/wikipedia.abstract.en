HORACE GAEL HAMMOND (4 June 1910 - December 2006)[1] was a British architect, responsible for designing the Grade II listed Curzon Mayfair Cinema for Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners, built in 1963-66.[2] Historic England have described it as "the finest surviving cinema building of the post-war period, it is also the least altered."[3]

Hammond was the junior partner to George Adie in designing Charters House, Berkshire, built in 1938.[4]
