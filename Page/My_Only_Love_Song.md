_MY ONLY LOVE SONG_ () is an American-South Korean web television series produced by Netflix, starring Lee Jong-hyun and Gong Seung-yeon.[1] It also has elements of fantasy[2] since it involves time travel and a "magical van".


Synopsis

Soo-jung (Gong Seung-yeon) is a conceited actress who believes that status and money can get you anywhere. She accidentally falls into a time-slip portal and travels to the past, specifically to 6th-century Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, while it is under the reign of King Pyeongwon. There she meets On-dal (Lee Jong-hyun), a man who loves money and will do anything to get it. However, he has a soft spot for the weak and helpless, and gives to them with a generous heart.
