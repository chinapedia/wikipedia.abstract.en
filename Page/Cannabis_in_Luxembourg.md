CANNABIS IN LUXEMBOURG is illegal for recreational use, but possession of personal amounts is decriminalized, and medical use has been legalized. Prosecution depends on the amount of cannabis one possesses. Since 2001, prison penalty has been substituted by a monetary fine ranging from 250 to 2,500 Euros.[1]


Decriminalization

In April 2001, Luxembourg updated its prior 1973 law, and reclassified cannabis as a Category B controlled substance, meriting only a fine for a first offense, effectively decriminalizing personal possession.[2][3]

In November 2018, the government announced that it would legalise the recreational use of cannabis, though an exact timetable has yet to be defined.[4]


Medical cannabis

In November 2017, the Minister of Health announced a two-year pilot program under which Luxembourgers would be able to obtain cannabis extracts and cannabinoids for medical purposes.[5][6]

In June 2018, lawmakers unanimously approved a bill to legalize the medical use of cannabis.[7][8]
