ERIC CHOU (, born 22 June 1995) is a Taiwanese singer-songwriter. Chou has been dubbed by the Taiwanese media as "king of the lovelorn people" for his ballads such as "How Have You Been" and "Let's Not Be Friends in the Future".[1][2]


Early life

Born and raised in Taiwan, Eric Chou moved to Boston, USA, when he was 12 years old, and returned to Taiwan when he was 18. In the United States, Chou attended Fay School and Northfield Mount Hermon School.[3] He has a younger brother named James and an older brother named Alex (周予天) who is also a singer-songwriter.[4]

He has been playing classical piano since he was young. Due to his passion for music, Chou loves composing. His inspiration for songwriting comes mainly from movies and the experiences of him and his friends.[5][6]


Career

Chou was scouted by his entertainment company when he performed onstage and sang at his uncle's wedding.[7][8]

At 19, he debuted with _My Way to Love_ (學著愛), a self-composed album featuring eleven tracks, on December 2014. He released his latest studio album _What Love Has Taught Us_ (愛，教會我們的事), consisting of 10 songs, on August 2016.

Chou has also performed for _Rock On! 2017_, the largest countdown party in Singapore, on 31 December 2016.[9]

He then released his first ever EP on 10 January 2019, and had his first concert tour for the year. The concert was first kicked off in Kaohsiung.
