The screenplay was written by Barry Wernick and James R. Hallam. It is based on Wernick and Matthew Spradlin's best-selling graphic novel _Bad Kids Go 2 Hell_. The film stars Sammi Hanratty, Drake Bell, Sean Astin, Gina Gershon, Ben Browder, Sufe Bradshaw, Colby Arps, Sophia Taylor Ali, Erika Daly, Matthew Frias, Ali Astin, Ashlyn McEvers, and Cameron Deane Stewart.

Wernick and Hallam had written the 2009 graphic novel _Bad Kids Go to Hell_, which was turned into the 2012 film _Bad Kids Go to Hell_, both telling the story of Matt Clark, a student at prestigious Crestview Academy who is the only survivor of six students serving a weekend detention.

The story in _Bad Kids of Crestview Academy_ takes place five years later, when another group of detention students are slaughtered.
