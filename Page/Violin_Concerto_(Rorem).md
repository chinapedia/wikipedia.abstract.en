Reception

The music critic Donal Henahan of _The New York Times_ gave the piece moderate praise, remarking that "the work proved to be immediately digestible and pleasant enough of its genial type." He added, "In its best moments, it vaguely reminded one of Sibelius or Barber. Mr. Rorem's score makes a few brusquely dramatic gestures (timpani obbligatos, for instance, in movements entitled Toccata-Chaconne and Toccata-Rondo), but in the main it relies on the kind of anonymous, vaporous lyricism that characterizes so much of his instrumental work."[4] Reviewing a recording of the piece paired with Rorem's Flute Concerto and _Pilgrims_, Peter Dickinson of _Gramophone_ wrote, "This is relaxed and indulgent music, even if these works are not the best from this now grand old man of American music."[5]
