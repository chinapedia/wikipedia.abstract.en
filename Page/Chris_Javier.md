CHRISTOPHER ROYCE FERNANDO JAVIER (born December 6, 1992) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Blackwater Elite of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).[1] He was drafted 5th overall by Star in the 2016 PBA draft.[2]


Early life

The young Javier learned the rudiments of the game of basketball when he participated in a camp held by former PBA player Ed Cordero sometime in 2005. A year later, he was recruited by the San Beda Red Cubs, which he helped win more championships in the high school division of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[3] When it was time for him to move to college, he planned to enroll at De La Salle University with fellow Red Cub Alfonzo Gotladera but was advised to play elsewhere to avoid playing in the shadow of his teammate.[4]


Collegiate career

Javier played his entire five-year collegiate career for the UE Red Warriors in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. He posted career averages of 7.1 points and 5.1 rebounds in 22.6 minutes, playing a total of 68 games.[5]

He started turning heads during his sophomore year after averaging 10.6 points and 6.9 rebounds, an improvement from his rookie numbers of 4.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.[6] In the same season, he hit back-to-back game winners — first against UP and then against five-peat seeking Ateneo de Manila.[7]


PBA D-League

Javier had an impressive stint with Racal Tile Masters in the PBA D-League.[8]


International

Javier suited up for the Philippine national team that competed in the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge in Tehran. He averaged 3.6 points, 0.8 rebound, and 9.1 minutes in the five games that he played.[9]
