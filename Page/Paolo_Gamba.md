PAOLO GAMBA (29 October 1712 - 26 December 1782) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active in the region of Molise.[1]


Biography

He was born to poor family in Ripabottoni in the province of Campobasso, region of Molise. His father was a decorative painter. An encounter with bishop of Larino in 1731 led to a recommendation for the young Paolo to study under Francesco Solimena in Naples. He was highly prolific in painting sacred subjects in the region, including for Ripabottoni, Larino, Fossalto, Agnone and Castelpetroso.

His first documented works were a series of frescoes (1740) in the sacristy and church of the convent of the Cappuccini in Sant'Elia a Pianisi. For the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ripabottoni, he painted many works, including canvases depicting a _Madonna of the Purgatory_, _Madonna of the Rosary_ _St Roch_, a _'Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple_ and a number of frescoes: _Virtue_ and _Prophets_ in medallions. For the church of Maria della Concezione in the same town, he painted an _Immaculate Conception_, an _Assumption of the Virgin_, an _Annunciation_, and medallions with stories of the new testament.

During 1738-1745, he painted for the parish church of Montorio nei Frentani. He painted a _Madonna del Purgatorio_ for the church of San Giovanni Battista a Colletorto. He painted a _Offering of Melchisedech_ for the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Fossalto. In 1771, he again painted for the church of San Francesco in Agnone. In 1774, he painted again in the church of Santa Maria Assunta of Fossalto, this time frescoes in the presbytery depicting: _Sacrifice of Isaac_, _Transport of the Holy Ark_, and _Cain an Abel_. In 1774, he painted an Immaculate Conception surrounded by the Evangelists in the apse of San Martino a Campodipietra. In 1779 in Matrice, he painted altarpieces for the church of Sant'Antonio depicting a _Madonna del Carmelo_ and a _Birth of the Virgin_. In Larino he painted the frescoes (1747) for the cupola of the church of San Francesco, depicting the _Immaculate Conception_.[2][3]
