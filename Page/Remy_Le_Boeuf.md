Biography

Born and raised in Santa Cruz, California, Le Boeuf started playing oboe at age 10 and picked up the saxophone a year later. In high school, he began performing regularly with his twin brother, Pascal Le Boeuf, and the brothers started their modern jazz group, Le Boeuf Brothers. In 2004, Remy moved to New York City to attend the Manhattan School of Music where he received his bachelor's and master's degrees and began working professionally.[3]

As a composer, Le Boeuf has received commissions from SFJAZZ,[4] The Jerome Foundation,[5] New York Youth Symphony,[6] and Keio University.[7] As a performer, Le Boeuf has worked as a sideman with various artists including Grammy Award-winning Bob Mintzer’s Big Band, Dayna Stephens, Alan Ferber, Dave Leibman, Linda Oh, indie-pop band Wildcat! Wildcat![8] and Donny McCaslin.[9]

Le Boeuf has performed throughout the world including North America, Europe and Asia. He has received many honors and awards for compositions and performances including recognition from ASCAP and _Downbeat_ magazine, both individually and as part of Le Boeuf Brothers.[10] His two most recent awards include the 2015 Commission Award from SFJAZZ Education[11] and the 2016 ASCAP Young Jazz Composer Award.[12]
