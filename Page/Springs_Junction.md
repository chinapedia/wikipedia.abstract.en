At Springs Junction is a site where geologists have dug trenches to study past earthquakes along the Alpine Fault.[7]Springs Junction has seen a major increase in traffic flows[8] [9] since the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake. This earthquake closed the main State Highway 1 route and Springs Junction is on the alternative route from Picton to Christchurch.[10] The New Zealand Transport Agency expects the volume of traffic to quadruple while the State Highway 1 route undergoes months of repairs.[11]
