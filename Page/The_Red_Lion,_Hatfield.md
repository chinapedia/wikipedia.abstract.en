On 4 January 1970 The Who drummer Keith Moon accidentally killed his friend, driver and bodyguard, Neil Boland, outside the pub. Patrons had begun to attack his Bentley and Moon, drunk, began driving to escape them. During the fracas, he hit Boland. After an investigation, the coroner ruled Boland's death an accident and Moon received an absolute discharge after being charged with a number of offences.[143]
