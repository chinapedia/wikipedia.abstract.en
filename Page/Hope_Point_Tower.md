HOPE POINT TOWER is a proposed skyscraper project in Providence, Rhode Island which consists of one 46-story residential tower.[1]

Initially, three residential towers of varying height were proposed. The tallest two towers, at 604 feet and 485 feet,[2] would be the tallest skyscrapers in Rhode Island and the tallest tower would be the tallest residential tower in New England. The towers would be built in a parcel, Parcel 42, an acre of former highway land between Dyer Street and the planned riverfront park east of that parcel that was reclaimed after the moving of Interstate 195 south.

The buildings consist of a brick and glass facade with some units having balconies. Amenities for residents would include a private movie theater and gym. The first floors will have shops and restaurants.[3]

On July 25, 2017 the I-195 District Commission approved the construction of a 46-story tower, conditional on zoning approval by the city.[4]
