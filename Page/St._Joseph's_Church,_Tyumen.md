The ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH[1] () It is a Catholic church in the city of Tyumen in Russia,[2][3] under the Diocese of Novosibirsk. It is located at 7 Lenin Street.


History

The church was built between 1903 and 1906 by parishioners of Poland, thanks in part to the financial means of the family of Polish mines magnate Koziell-Poklewski Alfons (1809-1890). The first Masses were held in 1904.

It was closed during the Soviet era and was used as a warehouse, student club, and gym. It returned to the parish community in the early 1990s and religious ceremonies resumed starting in 1993. The church celebrated its centenary in 2004.
