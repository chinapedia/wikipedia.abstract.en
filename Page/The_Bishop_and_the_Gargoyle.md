THE BISHOP AND THE GARGOYLE is a 30-minute old-time radio crime drama in the United States. It was broadcast on the NBC Blue network September 30, 1936 - January 3, 1942.[1] The program was unique in being a radio network prime-time drama with a church leader as its central character.[2]


Format

Episodes of _The Bishop and the Gargoyle_ focused on the combined crime-fighting efforts of a retiring bishop of a church and a convict called the Gargoyle. As a member of the parole board at Sing Sing Prison, the Bishop met and befriended the Gargoyle. In return, the inmate helped the bishop "to track criminals and bring them to justice."[3] Radio historian John Dunning wrote in _On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio_, "They became friends and, after the Gargoyle's release, formed a crime-fighting duo, with the Bishop supplying the spiritual guidance and the Gargoyle the muscle.[4]

An advertisement for the program in the October 2, 1940, issue of the trade publication _Variety_ described the two characters as follows:

  There's the Bishop, for example. A retired gentleman of the cloth — cultured, benevolent and infinitely wise; a man whose worldly grasp and shrewd wit are no less strange than his hobby of crime detection! The Gargoyle, on the other hand, is an ex-lawbreaker — "retired" through the Bishop's persuasion. The Gargoyle's untiring loyalty and direct, elemental approach to the facts and conditions of life is a constant source of polite astonishment to the Bishop.[5]


Personnel

Richard Gordon portrayed the bishop; Milton Herman first had the role of the Gargoyle, with Ken Lynch replacing him later.[6] Joseph Bell was the director, and Frank Wilson was the writer.[7]


Adaptation

On November 29, 1941, NBC-Television presented "The Item of the Scarlet Ace" (an episode of _The Bishop and the Gargoyle_) as an early experiment in TV broadcasting.[8]
