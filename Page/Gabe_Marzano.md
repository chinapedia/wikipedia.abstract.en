GABRIELLE "GAYY” MARZANO (born 12 February 1992) is an Australian soccer player, last played for Sydney FC in the Australian W-League. She previously played for Brisbane Roar and Perth Glory.


Early life and work

Born in Harvey, Western Australia, a small town 140 km south of Perth, Marzano was raised in Townsville, a city on the northeastern coast of Queensland. She began playing soccer at the age of five.[1] She attended military college in Canberra and later moved to Brisbane with the army.[2]

Marzano was the first woman to qualify as a combat engineer diver with the Australian Army.[3] She is currently an officer in 5th Engineer Regiment (Australia).


Playing career

In 2014, Marzano contacted Perth Glory head coach Jamie Harnwell to try out for the W-League team. She was selected amongst 30 trialists to sign with the team for the 2014 W-League.[4][5][6] With her 13 appearances and one goal, she helped lead the team to its first regular season title the same season with a record.[7][8] Perth advanced to the semifinals[9] where they defeated Sydney FC 3–0 with Marzano scoring in the second half after coming on as a substitute.[10] The team faced Canberra United in the Grand Final but were defeated 3–1.[11]

Marzano signed with Brisbane Roar for the 2015–16 W-League season.[12] She made 11 appearances and scored two goals helping the club finish fourth during the regular season with a record and advance to the playoffs.[13][14] During the semifinal match where they faced regular-season winners Melbourne City, Brisbane was defeated 5–4 during a penalty kick shootout after regular and overtime yielded no goals for either side.[15]

In September 2016, it was speculated Marzano would join Western Sydney Wanderers for the 2016–17 W-League season, having relocated to Sydney.[16] However, in November 2016, Sydney FC officially announced that Marzano had joined the Sky Blues.[17]

In October 2017, it was confirmed that Sydney FC had not re-signed Marzano for the 2017–18 W-League season.[18]

Failed to perform in the NPL in New South Wales.

In May 2016, Marzano was appointed to the Executive Committee of Professional Footballers Australia.[19] PFA Chairman Craig Foster said of her appointment, "Nigel, Kim and Gabe are outstanding people and leaders and we are delighted that they have accepted the offer to join the Executive. Many of Australian football’s most respected figures such as Tim Cahill, Alex Tobin and Kathryn Gill have served on the Executive Committee and I have no doubt that they will build on the proud legacy of those that have come before them."[20]
