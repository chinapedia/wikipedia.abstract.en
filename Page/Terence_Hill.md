TERENCE HILL (born MARIO GIROTTI; 29 March 1939) is an Italian actor, film director, screenwriter and film producer.[1]

Hill started his career as a child actor and went on to multiple starring roles in action and comedy films, many with longtime film partner and friend Bud Spencer. During the height of his popularity Hill was among Italy's highest-paid actors.[2] Hill's most widely seen films include comic and standard _Westerns all´Italiana_ ("Italian-style Westerns", colloquially called "Spaghetti Westerns"), some based on popular novels by German author Karl May about the American frontier.

Of these, the most famous are _Lo chiamavano Trinità_ (_They Call Me Trinity_, 1970) and _Il mio nome è Nessuno_ (_My Name Is Nobody_, 1973), co-starring Henry Fonda. His film _Django, Prepare a Coffin_, shot in 1968 by director Ferdinando Baldi, and co-starring Horst Frank and George Eastman, was featured at the 64th Venice Film Festival in 2007.

Hill, whose stage name was the product of a publicity stunt by film producers, also went on to a successful television career in Italy.


Early life and career

Hill was born on 29 March 1939 in Venice, Italy.[3] Hill's mother, Hildegard Girotti (née Thieme), was a German, from Dresden; his father, Girolamo Girotti, was Italian, and a chemist by occupation.[4]

During his childhood, Hill lived in the small town of Lommatzsch, Germany. He was there through the end of World War II (1943–1945) and survived the Bombing of Dresden.[5]

He was discovered by Italian filmmaker Dino Risi at a swimming meet at the age of 12, and became a child actor, appearing in _Vacanze col Gangster_ (_Vacation with a Gangster_, 1951).[6] His early roles also included _Gli sbandati_ (_The Abandoned,_ 1955).


Career as an adult

In 1964, he returned to Germany and there appeared in a series of Heimatfilme, adventure and western films, based on novels by German author Karl May.[8]

In 1967, he returned to Italy to act alongside Bud Spencer in Giuseppe Colizzi's Spaghetti Western _God Forgives... I Don't!_. The first film of the "Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy" trilogy, it was followed by _Ace High_ and _Boot Hill_. His film _Django, Prepare a Coffin_ was shot in 1968, by director Ferdinando Baldi; it co-starred Horst Frank and George Eastman (and would be featured, much later, at the 64th Venice Film Festival, in 2007).[9] For these films, the actor adopted the stage name Terence Hill, a name made up by the film producers; he had to choose from a list of twenty names and picked the one with his mother's initials. There is a persistent rumour that he took his last name, "Hill", from his wife's maiden name, but this is incorrect, for it was Zwicklbauer.

By this time, Hill had formed a friendship with Spencer, and the pair made a large number of films together. Their Western, action and comedy films were successful not only in Italy, but also abroad. Many of these have alternate titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Possibly their most famous film is the 1971 western _They Call Me Trinity_ and the 1972 sequel _Trinity Is Still My Name_. Hill has stated in interviews that _My Name Is Nobody_ (1973), in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda,[10] is his personal favorite of all his films.[11] His first American film roles were in _Mr. Billion_ and _March or Die_ (both 1977), after which he divided his time between Italy and the United States.[12]

Despite being fluent in Italian and English, Hill was usually dubbed by other actors in both languages. In the Italian versions of his films, his voice was provided by a variety of actors until the late 1960s, where he was primarily dubbed by Sergio Graziani; from 1970 to 1983, Hill was voiced by Pino Locchi, and by Michele Gammino from 1983 to 1996. For English dubs, Hill was dubbed by Lloyd Battista in six films, including the "Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy" trilogy, while Roger Browne dubbed him in most of his early 1970s films (_They Call Me Trinity_ to _A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe_); from _Mr. Billion_ onward, Hill dubbed his own English voice.[13][14] Terence_Hill_in_Dresden_(20.08.2018).jpg in August 2018]]


Television

Hill later went on to a television career in Italy; in 2000, he landed the leading role in the Italian television series _Don Matteo_ (2000–), about an inspirational parish priest who assists the Carabinieri in solving crimes local to his community. This role earned Hill an international "Outstanding Actor of the Year" award at the 42nd Monte Carlo Television Festival, alongside ones for the series, and for producer Alessandro Jacchia at that festival.[15]

In the summer of 2010, Hill filmed another Italian television series for the Italian state television channel Rai Uno, this time entitled _Un passo dal cielo_ (_One Step from Heaven_), playing a local chief of the state foresters in the region of Alto Adige, with a second season filmed in 2012.

On 19 April 2018 he directed _La chiamavano Maryam_.[16] The same year it was released the co-operative beat'em up videogame _Bud Spencer & Terence Hill - Slaps and Beans_.[17][18]


Personal life

Hill is married to Lori Hill (née Zwicklbauer). He has two sons, Jess (born 1969) and Ross (1973-1990). Ross was killed in a car accident in Stockbridge, Massachusetts in the winter of 1990, while Terence was preparing to film _Lucky Luke_ (1991) on the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico.
