The EDUCATIONAL VIDEO CENTER, founded in 1984 in New York City, is a "non-profit youth media organization dedicated to teaching documentary video as a means to develop artistic, critical literacy, and career skills of young people, while nurturing their idealism and commitment to social change."[1]

EVC students have created award-winning documentaries on a range of issues from immigration to the environment, from bullying and youth depression to policing and the juvenile justice system. Through Professional Development Programs, EVC offers teacher training courses, in-class coaching, and curricula.[2]

"The radical participatory agenda suggested by [Steve] Goodman and the work of groups such as Global Village, DCTV, Videofreex, and others dovetailed with the media literacy movement and notions of a critical pedagogy informed by the ideas of Paulo Freire as articulated in his foundational book, _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_."[3]

The 1986 EVC student documentary, _2371 Second Avenue: An East Harlem Story is "_one of EVC’s earliest videos and best examples of how the center’s emphasis on young expressivity, social justice, and handheld camera becomes actualized," and also exemplifies video as a tool for "collective voice and action."[4][5]
