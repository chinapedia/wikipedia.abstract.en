WILLIAMSVILLE is a neighbourhood located in downtown Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The neighbourhood is bounded by Concession Street to the north, Princess Street to the south and west, and Division Street to the east.[1] Williamsville is represented on the City Council by counsellor Jim Neill [2] and is also home to the Williamsville Community Association, a local advocacy group committed to the interests of Williamsville's residents, businesses, and agencies.[3]

As one of the original neighbourhoods of the City of Kingston, Williamsville is home to several good examples of local Limestone, Victorian, and Craftsman-Style architecture.[4] The neighbourhood is also known for being the childhood home of Don Cherry.[5] Following the completion of Ontario Highway 401 and declining usage of Ontario Highway 2, the main thoroughfare through Kingston, economic prosperity declined in Williamsville beginning in the 1960s.[6] As a result, Williamsville has been the subject of several revitalisation efforts based on the Williamsville Main Street Study.[7] These efforts have led to extensive renovations to the Kingston Memorial Centre, significant investment in infrastructure along Princess Street along the Williamsville corridor,[8] new residential development projects,[9] and the addition of Kingston's second Farmers' Market.[10]


Events

Each year, Williamsville hosts several of Kingston's festivals, including the Kingston Fall Fair,[11] the Kingston Ribfest & Craft Beer Show,[12] and the Kingston Health & Fitness Expo.[13]
