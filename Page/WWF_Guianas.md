The Guianas Conservation Significance

The 3 Guianas (Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana) have between 80-98% pristine forest cover and are part of the complex ecosystem of The Guiana Shield freshwater ecoregion, which provides 15% of the world’s freshwater reserves. The forests, wetlands, savannah, waters and biodiversity make the Guiana Shield “essential to enriching and replenishing the world’s biodiversity and, consequently, essential to the planet’s survival” as Brigadier David Granger - President of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana pointed out[6] during its speech at the Opening Ceremony of the IVth International Congress on Biodiversity of the Guiana Shield.[7] It is also the home of incredible wildlife creatures such as jaguars, anteaters, anacondas, caimans, bats, and sea turtles. A phenomenal variety of fishes populate its waters, and a prodigious amount of different bird species inhabits its trees and skies. The coasts of the Guianas are home to one of the largest populations of the endangered Leatherback turtle in the world and hosts millions of migratory birds from North America. Typical Guiana birds include the Red Ibis and the Cock-of-the-Rock. Multiple Indigenous communities live in key parts of the Shield such as the Iwokrama forest or the Rupununi region.
