Cardona helped the B-side achieve promotion to Segunda División in 2017 by scoring 15 goals. He played his first match in the second division on 19 August of that year, starting and scoring his team's second in a 2–1 away win against Real Valladolid.[5]

On 19 July 2018, Cardona was loaned to La Liga side SD Eibar for one year, with a buyout clause.[6] On 31 August he played and scored the equalizer in a 2–1 home win against Real Sociedad.[7]
