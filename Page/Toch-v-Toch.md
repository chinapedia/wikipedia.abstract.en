Like its predecessor, "Odin v odin!", "Toch-v-toch" also shows transformations, whose members try to impersonate well-known musicians, singers and actors popular from the past and present, trying to make it as similar as possible to the original. Each issue of the jury members assess the performance of the contestants on a scale whose points are added together to form the standings, so that it is possible to identify the winner of the show.

History

Little is known about the show and even the names of the participants were kept secret. Rollers with fragments of the first issue appeared only the day before the premiere.

Show "hair's breadth" first aired on March 2, 2014 at the same time on the channel, "Russia-1" was launched the second season of "Odin v odin!". As a result, the share of "One Channel" project ahead of competitor share almost doubled. Telekritika noted that the level of performance and quality of make-up on the two projects is not much different, but the show of Channel One won mainly thanks to the jury, for whom it was more interesting to watch than their counterparts in the "Russia-1".

After moving the show "Odin v odin!" On channel "Russia" jury Gennady Khazanov and Lyubov Kazarnovskaya said that it will remain on the first channel, and will participate in a new project of this channel. Also, in the "First" were teachers of vocal and acting, who worked with the contestants of the first season of "Odin v odin!", And leading Alexander Oleshko.

After the first season of the show, the Spanish company "Gestmusic Endemol" and its Russian representative of JSC "White Media" decided to sue the "Channel One" in the Moscow Arbitration Court for illegal use of the format of the show. The plaintiffs demand to recognize that "hair's breadth" copies the original format of "Your Face Sounds Familiar", sold to the channel "Russia 1", and to prohibit in the future to carry out the production of such shows without permission "of Endemol".

In October 2014 it appeared in the media information that "Channel One" won the case. The channel's spokesman said that "the Russian legislation does not provide such a protected object of copyright, as a format, and protected elements (logo and music screen saver) are not used channel". Representatives of the company "White Media" said that were dissatisfied with this decision and intend to appeal against the court's decision.

At the beginning of February 2015 "First Channel" website announced the second season of the project. The first release was shown on February 15. In September of the same year, the third season of the show was released, this was the first time the series was released in autumn-winter.

In May 2015 it was reported that the creators of the show "Odin v odin!" Again filed a lawsuit against the First Channel. In their view, copy format in the production and broadcast of the same show "Toch-v-Toch" is illegal.

In July 2015 the Supreme Court considered the claim to the first channel of the Spanish company Gestmusic Endemol and the company "White Media". According to the applicants, the project uses "virtually all of the key elements of the" format, including "images of the judges." The plaintiffs also claimed that, according to the survey, viewers perceive these two programs are both the same, but under different names. Now applicants claimed to forbid to show the programme "hair's breadth", as well as to the production of any other audiovisual productions owned by Endemol format. Then the Supreme Court of Moscow filed a lawsuit to ban the show "Odin v odin!". The reason for the suit was up format "Your face sounds familiar".

Information appeared in November 2015 that the Supreme Court of Moscow could not stop the show "Toch-v-toch." According to the court, the plaintiffs' complaints were examined by the lower courts, in which there is no compelling reason for a retrial on appeal.

At the end of August 2016 "First Channel" launched several promotional clips of the fourth season of the show, which was scheduled for autumn-winter TV season. The season started on September 18.


Format

The show is attended by twelve known singers. In each episode, they need to be reincarnated as a famous musician or actor/actress, trying to recreate the original style of the artist including the appearance and manners of moving as well as the tone of voice. The jury, consisting of five people, estimates the five-point system, each participant immediately upon termination of his or her speech. Points recruited artists to accumulate.

Show "Toch-v-toch" is different from "Odin v odin!" In the main system assessments. In the show "Odin v odin!" The jury assessed the participants in the system, similar to the "Eurovision" system, and it occurs only after all the participants made. In the show "Toch-v-toch" judges evaluated the participants after each number on the five-point system. In the show "! As is" at the end of the release, each participant chooses one rival, whom he or she wants to award an additional 5 points; in the show "Toch-v-toch" participants do not judge each other, instead of at the end of the transmission, a special guest – "arbitrator" who watches the performances in a separate room, and then distributes the contestants on a five-point evaluation system.

Show "Toch-v-toch" is characterized by the fact that the producers decided to keep the intrigue and did not disclose the names of the participants of the show. Jury members have to guess who is standing in front of them. At the end of the release it is not declared, as the participants will transform again the next time.

Another difference between the two formats – leading. The project "Odin v odin!" Were two of them, one leads the show and presents the participants, and his co-host takes interview them before going on stage. During the interview, show footage from rehearsals, vocal and acting skills. In the project "Toch-v-toch" is only one presenter. Everything happens behind the scenes, the air does not get (but the recording of rehearsals and interviews with participants are available on the official channel of the project on "YouTube" Online). Before going on stage leading participant declares only way in which he will play, after which the audience can see a short clip of one or two performances presented by celebrities.

Season winner is determined on the basis of issues rather than SMS voting viewers. Final, as such, no, all the contestants are involved in all the issues and get points from the judges. The only difference between the final release from the others – members of the jury put the assessment after all the speeches. At the end of the season also awarded the Audience Award participant with the most votes in a special vote of viewers, and a special prize from the jury members (from the second season).

In the third season, the number of participants has risen to 13. Initially it was assumed that the results of the semi-final participant speaking, according to the jury, weaker than the other, will not be admitted to the competition in the final, but in the end the final, all participants underwent season.

The fourth season – "Superseason" – differs from previous ones in that in it, instead of new entrants compete some of the more popular and successful representatives of the first three seasons of the show. Another innovation of the fourth season, became "musical duels" in which pairs of participants should represent the same artist.
