_GAME OF EMPERORS_ is a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game (MMORTS) developed by the Bulgarian game production company Imperia Online JSC. It is released on February 2016 and it has been translated into 30 languages. Game of Emperors is a medieval MMORTS game with deep gameplay.[1]


Gameplay

Game of Emperors is set in the Medieval times. The players develop their own cities by constructing economic and military buildings, researching in the University in the Capital and expanding their army, which will fight in the battles. Everyone is trying to keep the Happiness at maximum levels, so that they don’t lose or win population to migration. The players also can communicate with each other using in-game messages, and may create or join alliances.[2]

Starting a game

Players must register at www.gameofemperors.com free of charge to join the game, providing a username, an e-mail address and creating a password. After logging in, the players follow a tutorial that guides them through various aspects of the game and provides rewards for successful completion. After the tutorial, quests start appearing for the players.

Provinces and buildings

The players can have more provinces by annexing on the Global Map. To annex, they need a vacant level of Centralization (each level allows one annexed province) and a victory over the independent province. The points, the players get for annexing a province, correspond to the buildings in the new province.[3]

There are near 30 buildings in the game and each one has a special function.

Great person

The Governor skills boost the overall development of the province such as resource and troop production, while General skills affect the capabilities during battle. Generals can be captured by the opposite army if a battle is lost by a player.[4]

Population

The population in Game of Emperors can grow with Medicine and/or Premium activation. If there are losses due to lack of Farms, raising a level of Farms will decrease these losses and will respectively increase the net growth. Not maintaining high Happiness means, losses of population to migration. The lower the average Happiness, the bigger the chance to lose more people.[5]

Alliances

The Alliances in Game of Emperors are groups of players sharing their own strategy with each other. Alliance members donate resources into the alliance treasury, which are used for researching technologies, waging wars, building alliance holdings, cultural and military influence expansion, etc. Allies can support each other in an economic and military way via gold transfer module. Alliances are ranked in a separate ranking based thoroughly on the total sum of all members’ net worth points.

Resources

The resources are wealth, which workers produce in the empire's mines, as well as the taxes collected on the population. All of them can be invested in construction, research and armies.

The maximum amount of each resource a province/colony can stash before the production is frozen is determined by the Fortress level. When the maximum capacity is reached the province/colony can gather even bigger amounts but it simply stops producing until the amount drops below the limit or a new Fortress level is built and activated.[6]

Weather Forecast

Weather plays an important role in Game of Emperors as it applies both positive and negative bonuses upon all Empires in all Realms on a daily basis. Thus, it may affect factors like living conditions, food production, as well as the military campaigns.

The Weather Forecast module shows a 5 day prognosis of the weather conditions in the Realm and displays the different positive and negative bonuses that will be applied upon the Economy and Military globally.[7]

Battles

Game of Emperors has a complex battle system, even though it is built with only five main types of military units. The five main categories of units are as follows: Swordsmen, Spearmen, Archers, Cavalry and Siege Engines. The outcome of each battle is determined automatically by the impact, which means that the armies cannot be controlled directly. There are three battle types in The Great people according to the battle mechanics and troops involved and the profit for the attacker: Fortress siege, Field battle, Pillage.

The first one sends the troops to fight only with the field army of the opponent, without sieging the Fortress or pillaging the civil population. The only profit, which the attacker will gain are military points for slashing enemy units and honor points. Fortress siege is conducted after a successful Field battle for the attacker. A successful Fortress siege will loot resources. If Pillage is chosen, the troops will engage the civil population of the opponent. In this case, gold is earned for every villager that is killed. There will also be a punishment, expressed in drop of Honor.[8]
