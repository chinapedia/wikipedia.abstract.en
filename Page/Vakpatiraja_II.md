VAKPATIRAJA II (r. c. 1026-1040 CE) was an Indian king belonging to the Shakambhari Chahamana dynasty. He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.

Vakpati succeeded his father Govindaraja II as the Chahamana king. The _Prabandha-Kosha_ calls him "Vallabha".

According to _Prithviraja Vijaya_, Vakpati defeated and killed Ambaprasada, the ruler of Aghata (identified with modern Ahar). Historian R. B. Singh identifies Ambaprasada with the Guhila ruler Amaraprasada.

Later texts such as _Surjana-Charita_, _Hammira-Kavya_ and _Prabandha-Kosha_ claim that Vakpati defeated Bhoja, the Paramara king of Malwa. These sources provide also provide some fictitious details about the supposed conflict. However, this claim is not reliable.

Vakpati was succeeded by his son Viryarama, who was killed by Bhoja. Subsequently, Chamundaraja ascended the Chahamana throne. According to historian R. B. Singh, Virayarama and Chamundaraja were sons of Vakpati. Dasharatha Sharma, however, considers all three as sons of Govindaraja III.
