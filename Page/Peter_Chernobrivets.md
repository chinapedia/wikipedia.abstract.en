PETER ANATOLIEVICH CHERNOBRIVETS (, born on 24 August 1965 in Leningrad, USSR) is a Russian musicologist, composer and lecturer.


Biography

Chernobrivets was born in Leningrad in 1965. He graduated from special secondary music school of the Leningrad State Conservatory named after Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1983 and from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1988 (the class of the professor T. Bershadskaya).

Chernobrivets is an author of compositions for a piano, instrumental company, and a chamber orchestra that have been performed in well-known concert halls of Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia. In April 2015 and April 2016, two author’s concerts called “Dialogue of musical temperaments. Compositions in traditional and non-traditional musical tuning” took place on the new stage of The Mariinsky Theatre.[1][2]

In 1993, Chernobrivets completed his master thesis in art history ("Style and subject-matter. On functional analogies". Based on the material of clavier music by George Frideric Handel). The area of his scientific interests includes harmony, musical style, and aesthetics. In 2014, he published a monograph “Basics of musical aesthetics”. In recent years, Chernobrivetz has been occupied in research related to an alternative musical tuning (20-tone equal temperament).

Chernobrivets started teaching in 1986 as a teacher of the special secondary music school of the Leningrad State Conservatory named after N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov. At present, he is an assistant professor of the Department of musical theory of The N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory teaching the courses of harmony and musical aesthetics.
