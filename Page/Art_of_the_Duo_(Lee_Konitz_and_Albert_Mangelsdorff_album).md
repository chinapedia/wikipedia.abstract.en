_ART OF THE DUO_ is an album by saxophonist Lee Konitz and trombonist Albert Mangelsdorff recorded in West Germany in 1983 but not released on the Enja label until 1988.[1][2][3][4]


Critical reception

David Dupont on Allmusic said "Konitz has long espoused the belief that horn players can swing without a rhythm section, yet much of the time Mangelsdorff insists on serving as a faux bass – really, tuba – player. And when he uses his patented technique of singing into his horn while creating chords, he functions as a very simple guitar player. That said, anything with these two masters on it has its pleasures. Konitz creates tasty lines with souffle-like lightness, and when Mangelsdorff breaks free he provides some gruff, complementary solos".[5]
