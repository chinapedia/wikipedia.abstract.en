Professional career

Jones received an invitation to the Senior Bowl and had practiced well during the week leading up to the game. He led both teams and greatly improved his draft stock after making six receptions for 68 receiving yards and a touchdown for the North, who lost 16–15 to the South.[17] He also attended the NFL Combine and completed all the combine and positional drills. Jones also participated at East Carolina's Pro Day, but opted to only run positional drills for team representatives and scouts. The majority of NFL draft experts and analysts projected Jones to be selected in the second round. He was ranked the fourth best wide receiver in the draft by NFL media analyst Mike Mayock, the fifth best wide receiver by ESPN, and was ranked the sixth best wide receiver by _Sports Illustrated_ and NFLDraftScout.com.[18][19][20]

Buffalo Bills

2017

The Buffalo Bills selected Jones in the second round (37th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.[21] On May 18, the Bills signed Jones to a four-year, $6.77 million contract with $3.84 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $3.07 million.[22]

On September 10, 2017, Jones made his NFL debut. He had one reception for 21 yards in the 21–12 victory over the New York Jets.[23] On September 17, 2017, in Week 2, he barely missed on a potential game-winning pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor on fourth down late in the game of a 9–3 loss to the Carolina Panthers.[24] In Week 9, against the New York Jets, he recorded six receptions for 53 yards and his first career receiving touchdown.[25] In 15 games (10 starts) of his rookie year in 2017, Jones finished with 316 receiving yards and two touchdowns.[26]

2018

Following his rookie season, Jones revealed he had played much of the year with a torn labrum in the shoulder, which required offseason surgery. Jones missed much of OTA's during the 2018 offseason due to another injury stemming from an offseason incident and started training camp on the non-football injury list.[27]

Jones showed improvement early in the season as his catch percentage rose significantly from his rookie season despite a low-volume passing offense.[28] He caught a 57-yard pass from rookie quarterback Josh Allen in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Chargers that was his new personal record for his longest reception. The pass traveled 63.8 yards in the air, which was also the second longest air distance for a completed pass ever recorded by _NFL NextGen Stats_ since its inception.[29] Jones recorded his first touchdown of the season against the Houston Texans, a 16-yard pass from Nathan Peterman (who entered the game after Allen was injured), that briefly gave the Bills the lead.[30]

Against the New York Jets in Week 10, Jones caught another touchdown to go with 93 receiving yards, a new career high.[31] He recorded his first game with multiple receiving touchdowns two games later, catching two scores in a 21–17 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 13.[32]

Jones finished the 2018 season as Buffalo's leading receiver after the team released Kelvin Benjamin. He caught 56 receptions for 652 yards and seven touchdowns.[33][34]
