President Rodrigo Duterte left for China Wednesday, April 24, afternoon to attend the second Belt and Road Forum amid Manila’s concerns over rising tensions with Beijing over the Disputed South China Sea. Duterte is expected to push for Manila's interests in Beijing’s global infrastructure plan that could set the stage for the world economic landscape in the years to come. The ambitious Belt and Road Initiative plans to link China with Africa, the rest of Asia, and Europe through a network of ports, railways, roads, and industrial parks. At least 5 agreements are on the table with China covering areas of education, anti-corruption, official development assistance, and drug rehabilitation. Duterte is also one of the lead speakers at the Leaders’ Roundtable, where 39 other heads of state are expected to attend.[150]

In the weeks leading up to Duterte’s Beijing return for the second Belt and Road Forum Initiative, reports of Chinese activity in the disputed waters have notably increased.

The arbitral ruling, sought by the Philippines under the Aquino administration, upheld the country's exclusive economic zone.[154] The Philippines remains an ally of China in Southeast Asia but the two nations must strengthen and not destroy each other and agreed to tackle the differences bilaterally. The Chinese leader also cited the proposed oil and gas exploration deal between the Philippines and China during the meeting with Duterte.
