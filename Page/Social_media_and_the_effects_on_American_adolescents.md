Positive impacts

Social media may positively affect adolescents by promoting a feeling of inclusion, providing greater access to more friends, and enhancing romantic relationships. Some adolescents with social and emotional issues feel more included with social media and online activities.[1] As social media usage has risen, the typical adolescent in the United States has become less socially isolated and more likely to linger in public spaces, because social media have changed the ways that they are able to interact in public spaces. Additionally, social media provide a way to communicate with friends and family when alone.[2]

Adolescents who use social media tend to be more outgoing and interact more with others online and in person. Social media provide adolescents within the United States the ability to connect with people from other countries. Being involved in social media typically improves communication skills, social connections, and technical skills. Furthermore, adolescents who are students can use social media to seek academic help.[3] Using social media for learning purposes can have positive effects on students and instructors, including faster progress, higher performance, and greater student engagement.

Negative impacts

Social comparison theory examines how people establish their personal value by comparing themselves to others.[4] These social comparisons and related feelings of jealousy, when made on social media platforms, can lead to the development of symptoms of depression in users.[5] Depression is common also for children and adolescents who have been cyberbullied.[6]According to Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance — United States, 2015, nationwide, 15.5% of students had been electronically bullied, counting being bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting, during the 12 months before the survey[7] . Using 7 or more social media platforms has been correlated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents.[8] While making friends is possible on social media, adolescents using social media may experience loneliness and question others' genuineness.[9] The parents of adolescents may not understand social media fully and are concerned about safety and the effect of social media on social development.[10] The increased role of social media and technology in adolescents' daily communications may affect their development of in-person relationships. Increased social media usage may impact how adolescents socialize face-to-face, leading to social isolation when faced with self-doubt or a lack of confidence.[11]Social media can significantly influence body image concerns in female adolescents.[12] Young women who are easily influenced by the images of others on social media may hold themselves to an unrealistic standard for their bodies because of the prevalence of digital image alteration. Engaging with social media platforms two hours before falling asleep can seriously effect sleep quality, and a longer duration of digital media use is associated with reduced total sleep time.[13] Young adults who have a strong Facebook presence show more signs of other psychological disorders, including anti-social behaviors. Youths who frequently use social media increase their risk of depression by 27 percent, while those who dedicate themselves to outdoor activities don’t have that much risk.[14] Health Social media has effects on the physical health of teens impacting their development with both short- and long-term consequences. With the amount of access teens have to social media the, “harmful consequences include health problems emotional problems, including suicide Internet addiction, including video game addiction; risky Internet use; and social/functional impairment. (Guinta & John, 2018, p.1).” Each of the following issues can lead to secondary complications from their academic performances to health behaviors that are impacted upon their lives indirectly. In addition, it increases their risk or worsens their current health conditions with a lack of care or time for their health condition.
