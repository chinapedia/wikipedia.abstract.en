CHARLES-RAPHAËL MARÉCHAL (1818–1888) was a French painter of the nineteenth century.

Maréchal was the son of the glass painter Charles-Laurent Maréchal. Like his father, he was born in Metz, in 1881. He was trained in charcoal technique from a young age by his father[1] and pointed toward an artistic career. He exhibited several times at the Salon (the official art exhibition of the prestigious Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris), including in 1868.[2] In 1872, the City of Metz bought the immense charcoal work _Prayer In The Wilderness_, which Maréchal had produced for the Metz Exposition of 1861.[3]

Interested in chemistry, he is credited as co-inventor (with Cyprien Tessié du Motay) of the collotype process.{{#tag:ref|Invention of the collotype is also ascribed to Alphonse Louis Poitevin|group=note}} Maréchal and du Motay's work won a gold medal at the Paris Exposition of 1867.[4] Together, Maréchal and du Motay were awarded several patents for processes such as printing on glass windows, producing oxygen for public lighting, and so forth.

Maréchal died in Paris on 8 April 1888.[5]
