Production

Newcomer director Jayadev, the brother of actress Bhavana, began scripting for the film in mid-2013 and met industry professionals in both Chennai and Kerala to develop his script. After spending over a year meeting potential actors and producers, Jayadev met Kalaiyarasan in Chennai during August 2014 to discuss the film and after hearing the concept and storyline, Kalaiyarasan showed interest to work in the project. Jayadev reworked the screenplay and pre-production began in May 2015, with the team fixing the filming dates for August 2015. Anaswara Kumar was signed on to play the lead female role.[2][3] Speaking about her role, Anaswara revealed that she would portray a college student who hails from a middle-class background, who is extremely protective of Vetri (played by Kalaiyarasan)".[4] Chaya Singh revealed that she would be portraying a Bollywood actress, while Kalaiyarasan would play her mother's carer.[5]

However the film later was delayed twice, firstly as a result of Kalaiyarasan signing on to appear in _Kabali_ and then as a result of the 2015 South Indian floods. Principal photography began on 15 December 2015 and after a schedule break, the second schedule started in February and the production was wrapped up on 28 August 2016. The film was shot entirely in and around the city of Chennai.

Critical reception

The film received negative reviews from critics. _Cinema Express_ wrote "The film tries to be a lot of things at the same time. It starts off as a murder mystery and quickly slips into the family-drama genre, while trying hard to be a comedy intermittently. This lack of clarity in the writing and the sloppy execution makes Pattinapakkam a hard film to sit through."[7] _Times of India_ wrote "With hardly any convincing sequence, the whole set up looks staged and amateurish to the core. We do not sympathise with any of the characters which seem to suffer on screen and there is no curiosity factor throughout the movie." [8] Kollywood Kapsa wrote "It is the official remake of the sleeper hit Malayalam film Ee Adutha Kalathu. Sadly, it is just eons behind in acting, screenplay, and everything else, more like a haphazard drama put together by school boys. Laughable."
