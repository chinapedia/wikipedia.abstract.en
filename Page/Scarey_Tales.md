Critical reception

'Louder that War' said; "Scarey Tales is a celebration of the old tales that lead us into a greater understanding of our own natures. There can be no true self-awareness without an awareness of our own dark sides. Without death, life has no meaning".[1] Chain DLK said of the album; "The Danse Society with "Message In The Wind", "White Rabbit", "The Scarecrow", "The Tale", "The Wof" and "Jekyll & Hyde" are able to make you enter a world made of mystery and darkness. They do it mixing their elements with sorcerers' ability."[2]
