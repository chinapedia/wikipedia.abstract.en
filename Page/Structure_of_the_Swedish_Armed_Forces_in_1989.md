The following article depicts the structure of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1989 by service branch. In wartime units would come under six multi-service military area commands. These area commands, as well as their wartime structure, can be found in their respective articles listed at Swedish military areas.

The article was created by combining the Swedish government's 1987 request to parliament to approve a new defense structure and the adjoined five year defense plan (Link), the same request to parliament 1992, which listed the changes undertaken between 1988 and 1992, the various handbooks of the Swedish Army about its units for recruits found on this site (Link), and the Swedish Wikipedia articles about Swedish units histories.


Armed Forces Defense Staff

The Defense Staff of the Swedish Armed Forces commanded the staffs of its three services Army, Air Force and Navy, as well as the Home Guard. It also commanded the multi-service military areas and various universities, schools and logistic establishments.

Military Areas

The territory of Sweden was divided into six multi-service military commands. These six military areas (, usually abbreviated to MILO) were further subdivided in defense areas (, usually abbreviated to FO). In peacetime each military area commanded all units within its area of responsibility and in wartime they would also command and control of all reserve units and reinforcements in their area.

The Military Area Commander ( also _militärbefälhavare_), would command Swedish Army, Swedish Navy and Swedish Air Force units operating in his area and direct the commanders of the defense areas in the defense of their areas. Defense Area Commanders ( commanded Swedish Home Guard units in their area, which usually compromised a mix of infantry, engineers, air defense and light artillery. Unlike the military areas the defense areas were managed in peacetime by various training units of army, navy or air force.

Two geographically exposed defense areas were organized differently:

-   Fo 42 - Gotland Defense Area was part of the multi-service Gotland Military Command (MKG) tasked with defending Gotland

Army

Sweden's Army had only one active brigade in peacetime. All other brigades, combat support and combat service support units, would have been activated in wartime only. Recruits for the wartime units were trained by the army's regiments dispersed all over the nation. These regiments were under administrative control of the Army Staff in Stockholm, which oversaw training, doctrine and procurement.

Wartime Organization

Almost all units of the Swedish Army were not manned during peacetime. The only exception was the PB -18 Gotland Brigade, which was fully manned at all times. Usually brigades recruited their personnel in the county where they were based, with the exception of the Gotland Brigade, whose men came from all of Sweden.

The 1987 Swedish Defense bills lists the following wartime strength for the Swedish Army:[2]

-   7x Division commands
-   10x Infantry brigades Type 77
-   8x Infantry brigades Type 66M
-   5x Norrland brigades Type 85
-   4x Armoured brigades Type 63M
-   1x Armoured brigade Type Gotland
-   1x Mechanized brigade Type 85
-   105x Field Battalions (5x mechanized, 10x infantry, 16x Jäger (airborne, arctic rangers), 22x artillery, 20x air defense (2x Hawk, 10x RBS 70, 8x 40mm lvakan m/48), 19x engineer and 13x supply battalions)
-   85x Swedish Home Guard battalions for static defense

Divisions

Besides 29 brigades the military areas would also have activated seven divisional commands to take tactical command of the ground forces in their respective military district. There were three exceptions:

1.  Milo B would not activate a divisional command as its brigades were the army's reserve and would have been assigned to other military districts as needed.
2.  Milo S would activate the 13th Division to take command of the four armoured brigades in Southern Sweden and then act as the army's mobile armoured reserve force.
3.  Milo Ö would activate two division commands to handle reinforcements arriving to defend the Stockholm area.

The seven divisions were:

-   1st Division, in Kristianstad (Milo S)
-   3rd Division, in Skövde (Milo V)
-   4th Division, in Kungsängen (Milo Ö)
-   12th Division, in Östersund (Milo NN)
-   13th (Armoured) Division, in Kristianstad (Milo S)
-   14th Division, in Solna (Milo Ö)
-   15th Division, in Boden (Milo ÖN)

Besides two to four brigades each division would also have commanded a variety of combat support and combat service support units.

Brigade Structures

The Swedish Army had four brigade types in 1989. Two types of infantry brigade, one type of armoured brigade and the type Norrland brigade. Two brigades had unique structures, as their tasks differed from all other brigades:

-   MekB 10 - Södermanland Brigade, in Strängnäs tasked with the defense of Stockholm had less tanks than a standard armoured brigade.
-   PB 18 - Gotland Brigade, in Visby tasked with the defense of Gotland fielded five instead of three maneuver battalions, however with only one tank company per armoured battalion.

Unlike all other brigades PB 18 - Gotland Brigade was fully manned even in peacetime.

Armoured Brigade 63

Air Force

The only unit under direct command of the Air Force's Air Staff was the E 1 - 1st Attack Group (E 1 - Attackeskadern), which fielded the air force's strike aircraft. All other wings were under command of the four air defense sectors. The air force's wartime strength as approved the Swedish Parliament in 1987 was:[6]

-   7x Fighter squadrons, with JA 37 Viggen fighter aircraft
-   4x Fighter squadrons, with J 35J Draken fighter aircraft
-   5.5x Attack squadrons, with AJ 37 Viggen attack aircraft
-   3x Reconnaissance squadrons, with SF 37 Viggen photo reconnaissance aircraft and SH 37 Viggen maritime reconnaissance/strike aircraft
-   4x Light attack squadrons, with Saab 105A advanced jet trainers

By 1989 the air force had deactivated one J 35J Draken squadron because of the age of the Draken fighters, while adding another JA 37 Viggen squadron in its stead. The four squadrons of the Swedish Air Force Flying School would have become the four light attack squadrons in case of war.
