PROJECT TURNAROUND was a private prison that was located south of Midland, Ontario, Canada, established in 1997.


History

At first it was privately operated for high-risk males between the ages of 16-18. These teens were admitted after serving sentences for a range of offenses that included assault, robbery, forcible confinement, escape, and weapons charges, while excluding crimes such as murder, arson, and sexual assault. The 32 teens were subjected to high-intensity daily activities that lasted approximately 16 hours, designed to instill respect, accountability, skill building and educational and vocational programming to those who were predicted to re-offend. This facilitation provided good feedback in 2003, which led Public Security Minister Bob Runciman to further expand these sort of programs around the provinces. Sally Walker, the owner and boss of Project Turnaround also was happy with the results, and wanted to re-portray the perspective of visitors by clarifying that this institution was not a boot camp.

Professor Anthony Dobb, Center of Criminology at the University of Toronto, said that the successful graduates of Project: Turnaround showed no significant differences in their likelihood to commit new offenses between those who were admitted to standard institutions, but were likely to instill change in the behavior of the youths. Therefore, the institution focused on activities such as: schooling (math and literacy), vocational training, military model, and nutrition. Walker said that this multi-disciplinary schematic was meant to promote pride and respect.

On February 2003, the establishment had a mold outbreak which led to the closure of the facility in January 31, 2004. The facility closed due to the change in government and the contract price ($2.5Â million/year) to maintain the facility. These changes were due to the creation of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which made judging youths more lenient. In January 2005, several missing children cases were filed, and extensive search were held in the facilities around Project: Turnaround due to its closure.[1][2][3][4][5]
