MACARONI (, Italian: Maccheroni) is dry pasta shaped like narrow tubes.[1] Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes, but like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine.

In North America, the word "macaroni" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes.[2] In Italy, the noun _maccheroni_ refers to straight, tubular, square-ended _pasta corta_ ("short-length pasta"). Maccheroni may also refer to long pasta dishes such as _maccheroni alla chitarra_ and _frittata di maccheroni_, which are prepared with long pasta like spaghetti.


Etymology

The name comes from Italian _maccheroni_ , plural form of _maccarone_.[3][4] The many variants sometimes differ from each other because of the texture of each pasta: _rigatoni_ and _tortiglioni_, for example, have ridges down their lengths, while _chifferi_, _lumache_, _lumaconi_, _pipe_, _pipette_, etc. refer to elbow-shaped pasta similar to macaroni in North American culture.

However, the product as well as the name derive from the ancient Greek "Macaria". The academic consensus supports that the word is derived from the Greek μακαρία (_makaria_),[5] a kind of barley broth which was served to commemorate the dead.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] In turn, that comes from μάκαρες (_makares_) meaning "blessed dead", and ultimately from μακάριος (_makarios_), collateral of μάκαρ (_makar_) which means "blessed, happy".[15]

However, the Italian linguist G. Alessio argues that the word can have two origins. The first is the Medieval Greek μακαρώνεια (_makarōneia_) "dirge" (stated in sec. XIII by James of Bulgaria), which would mean "funeral meal" and then "food to serve" during this office (see modern Eastern Thrace's μαχαρωνιά - _macharōnia_ in the sense of "rice-based dish served at the funeral"), in which case, the term would be composed of the double root of μακάριος "blessed" and αἰωνίος (_aiōnios_), "eternally".[16] The second is the Greek μακαρία "barley broth", which would have added the suffix _-one_.[17]

In his book _Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and their Food_ (2007), John Dickie instead says that the word macaroni, and its earlier variants like _maccheroni_, "comes from _maccare_, meaning to pound or crush."

The word first appears in English as _makerouns_ in the 1390 _Forme of Cury_ which records the earliest recipe for macaroni cheese[18]. The word later came to be applied to overdressed dandies and was associated with foppish Italian fashions of dress and periwigs, as in the eighteenth-century British song "Yankee Doodle".

The Russian language borrowed the word (as ) as a generic term for all varieties of pasta; this also holds for several other Slavic languages, as well as for Turkish, Greek, and Brazilian Portuguese. In Iran, all sorts of pasta are collectively called _makaroni_.


Culinary use outside Italy

As is the case with dishes made with other types of pasta, macaroni and cheese is a popular dish in North America, and is often made with elbow macaroni. The same dish, known simply as macaroni cheese, is also popular in Great Britain, where it originated.[19][20] A sweet macaroni pudding containing milk and sugar (and rather similar to a rice pudding) was also popular with the British during the Victorian era.[21] In areas with large Chinese populations open to Western cultural influence, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia and Singapore, the local Chinese have adopted macaroni as an ingredient for Chinese-style Western cuisine. In Hong Kong's _cha chaan teng_ ("tea restaurants") and Southeast Asia's _kopi tiam_ ("coffee shops"), macaroni are cooked in water and then rinsed to remove starch, and served in clear broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare.[22]
