Background

Marco Pérez was born in Mexico City on March 17, 1977.[1] At age 14, he began his professional career at an experimental theater in Jalisco, and later relocated to Mexico City to keep working in theater with director Martín Acosta.[2][3] Pérez wrote the plays _Hipótesis del Sueño_, _El Orgullo del Pajarraco_, and _El Saxofonista_, all based on experiences of his youth.[4]


Career

Early work

Pérez debuted on screen with the film _Amores Perros_ (2000), directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu.[5] In the film, Pérez played Ramiro, the brother of Gael García Bernal's character, Octavio.[6] The following year he was also included in the short film _Powder Keg_ by González Iñárritu and in 2004 was featured in _La Sombra del Sahuaro_, filmed in the desert of Sonora with the actors Eduardo Santamarina and Itatí Cantoral.[7] _Trade_ (2007), _La Garganta del Diablo_ (2008), and _Backyard: El Traspatio_ (2008), followed. In 2009, he joined the second season of the TV series _Capadocia_ in the role of Emiliano Treviño.[8] In 2011, Pérez played Mauricio (the private secretary of the Attorney General of Mexico) in the TV series _El 8° Mandamiento_ for Argos TV and also played Gabino in _Días de Gracia_, directed by Everardo Gout and starring Tenoch Huerta Mejía.[9][10] Pérez and Huerta re-teamed in 2015 in the film _Mexican Gangster: La Leyenda del Charro Misterioso_, directed by José Manuel Cravioto.[11] For his role of Comandante in _Mexican Gangster_, Pérez was nominated for a Diosa de Plata for Best Supporting Actor.[12][13] _La vida precoz y breve de Sabina Rivas_, _Colosio: El asesinato_, and _Mariachi Gringo_ were released in 2012. Pérez was cast as Guadalupe Robles (a role based on real life drug trafficker Ramón Arellano Félix) in the TV series _El Señor de los Cielos_.[14]

Breakthrough role with _Gloria_

In 2014, Sofia Espinosa and Pérez were cast as singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi and record producer Sergio Andrade, respectively, in the film _Gloria_.[15] The movie chronicles the rise and fall of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure on a band, her musical rise to stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brasil.[16] Pérez initially rejected the role since it was not a subject matter that moved him in an artistic way.[17] "I read the script, then I heard more and more the voice of Gloria [Trevi] herself, without the need to deepen as the scandal that it was, that was the thing I rejected a bit. But I was finding that the story lends itself to also tell a behind-the-scenes, what lies behind a character as stigmatized as [Sergio] Andrade", Pérez told Radio Fórmula.[18] To fully prepare for the role, Pérez gained weight interviewed Andrade to clarify some issues and delve into some of his experiences.[19][20] The film was premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with 1,000 copies.[21] Pérez received mixed critical reviews for his performance; Jessica Oliva of _Cine Premiere_ magazine stated that "Marco Perez [Sergio Andrade] manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time".[22] Sofía Ochoa and Verónica Sánchez of _En Filme_ were critical about the fact that Pérez was "flat", with no further explaining on how Andrade achieved his domain over women, "drawing a caricature of a public figure, [that] not only was complex and imposing, he was talented to some extent, very Machiavellian, ambitious, egotistical, narcissistic and unscrupulous".[23] David Noh of _Film Journal International_ also gave a negative review, since the actor "is too unremittingly slimy and completely lacking in magnetic charisma to be convincing as such an irresistible and titanic A&R lothario".[24] In Mexico, Pérez was nominated for a Diosa de Plata and won the Ariel Award for Best Actor for _Gloria_.[25][26][27]

Later work

Pérez played Felipe Murillo during the first season of Telemundo's _Señora Acero_ (2014).[28] In 2015, he was included in the cast of the film _Desierto_, directed by Jonás Cuarón.[29] In the film, Pérez co-stars with Gael García Bernal and American actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and plays Lobo, a smuggler.[30] On this role, Pérez noted, "He is a character that came into my hands and got to my skin. I feel like I gave life to a cold guy, without compassion for the migrants".[31] The same year, Pérez was featured in the Mexican telenovela _Caminos de Guanajuato_ for TV Azteca.[32] In 2016, Pérez joined the cast of the _El Señor de los Cielos_ spin-off _El Chema_, starred by Mexican actor Mauricio Ochmann.[33]
