WPBI-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 16, is a low-powered dual Fox/NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Lafayette, Indiana, United States. Owned by Star City Broadcasting, LLC, a partnership between Meridian, Mississippi-based Waypoint Media and upstate New York-based Vision Communications, it is a sister station to ABC affiliate WPBY-LD (channel 35) and radio stations WAZY-FM, WBPE, WSHY and WYCM. The six stations share studios on South 18th Street in Lafayette;[1][2] WPBI-LD's transmitter is located on McCarty Lane on the city's east side. The signal is oriented to the northwest.[3] On cable and satellite, WPBI-LD1 is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 16, Metronet channel 11, and Dish Network channel 59; WPBI-LD2 is carried on Xfinity channel 17, Metronet channel 12, and Dish Network channel 13.[4]


History

The station's construction permit was issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 22, 2011, under the call sign of W16DB-D. The station's call sign was changed to the current WPBI-LD in August 2016.[5] The station signed on in late October as the Lafayette area's Fox affiliate, with NBC being launched on the WPBI-LD2 subchannel. Prior to the launch of WPBI-LD, Star City Broadcasting also purchased four Lafayette-area radio stations.[6]

WPBI-LD and WPBI-LD2 are the first Fox and NBC affiliates ever based in the Lafayette market; before the two stations signed on, Indianapolis television stations WXIN and WTHR served as the default Fox and NBC affiliates for Lafayette via cable and satellite. Cable television providers Comcast Xfinity and Metronet began carrying WPBI in November 2016.[7] On March 29, 2018, satellite provider Dish Network started carrying WPBI's Fox and NBC channels in high definition.[8] Despite discontinuing carriage of Indianapolis-based Fox and NBC affiliates, satellite television provider DirecTV has said it plans to carry WPBI-LD and WPBI-LD2 but has not announced its timetable for doing so.[9][10]

From 1953 until WPBI's 2016 launch, WLFI-TV had been the only "Big Three" (ABC, CBS and NBC—or, including Fox, "big four") network television broadcaster in the Lafayette market.

The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

News operation

After beginning local weather coverage on January 1, 2017,[12] WPBI aired its inaugural _Star City News_ broadcast on May 29, 2017.[13] WPBI presently broadcasts 7½ hours of local newscasts each week, all on weekdays. The newscasts air at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. on NBC 16 and at 10:00 p.m. on Fox 16.[14][15] The 6 p.m. newscast is exclusive to WPBI-LD2, while the 11 p.m. newscast also simulcasts on WPBY-LD.[16][17]

Chris Morisse Vizza, a 10-year veteran of WLFI-TV, is WPBI's first news director. Sarah Blakely is the station's inaugural news anchor, broadcasting from a Media Gateway-owned studio in Little Rock, Arkansas,[18] airing segments from Lafayette-based Vizza.[19] Blakely also anchors similar newscasts on sister station KJNB-LD in Jonesboro, Arkansas.[20]

Radio tie-ins of the newscasts are planned for WSHY, WBPE, WYCM, and WAZY-FM.[21]
