_Y STIWDIO GEFN_ (meaning _The Back Studio_) is a Welsh language music programme, broadcast regularly on S4C since January 2013. The programmes are presented by Lisa Gwilym.[1] _Y Stiwdio Gefn_ showcases Welsh language music, covering a variety of music genres,[2][3] usually with a small number of bands or singers sharing the studio and taking turns to perform during a half hour broadcast.

New series have continued to be produced on a regular basis,[4][5] as well as the occasional special edition such as in August 2014 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first Welsh language rock opera, _Nia Ben Aur_,[6] or a December 2015 broadcast performing music written by Alun 'Sbardun' Huws.[7]
