HÆGEBOSTAD CHURCH () is a parish church in Hægebostad municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway. It is located in the village of Snartemo. The church is part of the Hægebostad parish in the Lister deanery in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden, octagonal church was built in 1844 by using plans drawn up by the parish priest Nils Christian Hald with some help from the national architect Christian H. Grosch. The church seats about 450 people.[1][2]


History

The first historical mention of a church in Hægebostad was in 1445 and again in 1620. The medieval church was torn down in 1629 and replaced with a wooden long-form church. This timber church had small tower and small windows. It sat in a similar position to the location of the present-day church. By the 1840s, the church had become too small for the congregation, so a new church was constructed on the same site. Wood from the old church was reused in the new church which was completed in 1844.[3]
