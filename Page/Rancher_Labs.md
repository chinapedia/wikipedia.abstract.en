Products

Rancher

Rancher 2.x

Rancher 2.x is a multi-cloud Kubernetes management platform. It is built on top of Kubernetes, and includes an upstream Kubernetes hyperkube distribution. Rancher 2 uses Docker as the underlying container runtime and utilizes Kubernetes to coordinate running containers between multiple discrete physical nodes.

Rancher 2.x is a complete rewrite from Rancher 1.x and was built off of user and customer feedback regarding the desire to run Kubernetes in a multi-cloud/hybridized fashion.[6]

Rancher 1.x

Rancher 1.x is a management platform for Docker containers. It includes a Kubernetes distribution as well as the option to choose from Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos. These all use Docker as the underlying container runtime and coordinate running containers between multiple discrete physical nodes. Rancher also includes modular infrastructure services including networking, load balancing, service discovery, monitoring and recovery.[7]

RancherOS

RancherOS is a minimized version of Linux focused on hosting Docker containers, including only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker. This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small. Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker when needed.[8][9] Rancher Labs announced version 1.0 in April 2017.[10] RancherOS is open source and can be downloaded from GitHub.
