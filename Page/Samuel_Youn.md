__NOTOC__ SAMUEL YOUN (; born 1971 in Seoul) is a South Korean operatic bass baritone.


Career

Samuel Youn studied voice in Seoul, in Milan, and at the Cologne University of Music under Arthur Janzen. He has been a member of the Cologne Opera since the 1999/2000 season. At Cologne he has sung among other roles Kaspar in _Der Freischütz_, Jochanaan in Richard Strauss' _Salome_, Escamillo in Bizet's _Carmen_, and the Wagnerian roles of Donner and Gunther in _Der Ring des Nibelungen_, Kurwenal in _Tristan und Isolde_ and the Dutchman in _Der fliegende Holländer_; he has also made many guest appearances in various countries, including as the Wanderer/Wotan in Wagner's _Siegfried_, his début in the role, in Lisbon,[1] and Mephisto in Gounod's _Faust_ in Treviso and Rovigo, his first appearances in Italy.[2] He has also sung in concert in Brahms' _German Requiem_, Mahler's _Symphony No. 8_,[3] and Beethoven's _Ninth Symphony_ among other works.[4]

In 2004 he made his début at the Bayreuth Festival as the second Grail Knight in _Parsifal_ (conducted by Pierre Boulez), and in 2005 he appeared there as Reinmar von Zweter in _Tannhäuser_ (conducted by Christian Thielemann) and in 2010 as the Herald in _Lohengrin_ (conducted by Andris Nelsons).[5]

In 2012 Youn became the first Korean to sing the Dutchman in _Der Fliegende Holländer_ at Bayreuth, as a short-notice replacement for Yevgeny Nikitin, who withdrew days before the opening of the festival because he had a tattoo that was said in German media to resemble a swastika.[6][7]

In November 2012 Youn was appointed a Musical Ambassador of Singende Krankenhäuser e.V. (Singing Hospitals).[8]

In 2016 Youn sang Scarpia in Puccini's _Tosca_ at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,[9] and also performed for the first time in the US, as Alberich in Wagner's _Das Rheingold_ with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, his first performance in the role.[10][11]


Honours

Youn was the first recipient of the Offenbach Prize of the Freunde der Oper Köln e. V., in 2005.[12]

He has won several international singing competitions, including the Treviso _Toti dal Monte_, the Seoul Chung-Ang, the Genoa Franz Schubert Contest, and the Naples Francesco Albanese Contest.[13]
