Critical reception

_123Telugu_ wrote "On the whole, Angel is just an okay socio-fantasy entertainer which has some moments here and there. Hebah Patelâ€™s performance and some good visuals are basic assets for the film."[2] _Indiaglitz_ wrote "A half-baked socio-fantasy that meets Kranthi Madhav's on-screen social agenda. Utterly predictable, the film treats almost everything half-heartedly."[3] _Telugu cinema_ wrote "Angel' is a formulaic socio-fantasy-comedy with no surprises in store. The hero's characterization suffers in the second half. Poor visuals, outdated villainy and a largely uninspiring comedy fail it."[4]
