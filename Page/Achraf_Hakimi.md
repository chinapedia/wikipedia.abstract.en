ACHRAF HAKIMI MOUH (; born 4 November 1998), sometimes known simply as ACHRAF, is a professional footballer who plays for German club Borussia Dortmund, on loan from Real Madrid, and the Morocco national team. Mainly a right-back, he can also play as a left-back or central defender.[1]


Early life

Born in Madrid to parents of Moroccan descent, Achraf joined Real Madrid's youth setup in 2006 from CD Colonia Ofigevi, aged eight.[2][3]


Club career

Real Madrid Castilla

After progressing through La Fábrica, Achraf was promoted to the reserves in June 2016.[4] Shortly after, he was included in the first-team's pre-season camp in the United States.

Achraf made his debut for _Los Blancos_ in the first match of the 2016 International Champions Cup, a 3–1 loss against Paris Saint-Germain.[5] He subsequently returned to the B-side, making his senior debut on 20 August 2016 by starting in a 3–2 Segunda División B home win against Real Sociedad B.[6]

Achraf scored his first senior goal on 25 September 2016, netting the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at CF Fuenlabrada.[7] He contributed with 28 appearances (26 starts, 2305 minutes of action) during the campaign, as Castilla only managed an 11th-place finish. At the end of the season, he was still young enough to return to the youth side to take part in the final of the 2017 Copa del Rey Juvenil.

Borussia Dortmund (loan)

On 11 July 2018, Borussia Dortmund signed Hakimi on a two-year loan deal.[13][14] He scored his first goal for the club and his first Bundesliga goal in a 7–0 victory over 1. FC Nürnberg on 27 September 2018.[15] Hakimi provided 3 assists in a single match for the first time in his career in a superb display against Atletico Madrid in his first Champions League appearance for Dortmund.[16]


International career

Youth level

After representing Morocco at under-17 and under-20 levels,[17] Achraf made his debut for the under-23s on 5 June 2016, in a 1–0 friendly win over Cameroon U23s.[18]

Senior

In May 2018, he was named in Morocco's preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and on 4 June he was named in the final 23-man squad for the summer tournament.[21][22]


Style of play

On signing for Borussia Dortmund, Achraf was profiled as a quick, dynamic and powerful full-back who is tactically and technically adept and capable of playing long accurate passes from defence. Trained as a winger, he can also play as a central defender due to his physical presence.[23]
