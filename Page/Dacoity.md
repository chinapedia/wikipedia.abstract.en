DACOITY is a term used for "banditry" in Bengali, Odia, Hindi, Kannada and Urdu. The spelling is the anglicized version of the Hindustani word, and as a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning, it appears in the _Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases_ (1903).[1] Banditry is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule. Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.


Etymology

The word "dacoity", the anglicized version of the Hindustani word _ḍakaitī_ (historically spelled _dakaitee_, Hindi डकैती or Urdu ڈکیتی or Bengali ডাকাতি, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି ), comes from _ḍākū_ (historically spelled _dakoo_, Hindi: डाकू, Urdu: ڈاکو, meaning "armed robber") or Bengali _ḍakat_ (ডাকাত, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି).

In Urdu, _ḍākū_ ڈاکو is singular and _ḍakait_ ڈکیت plural for bandits. The crime of banditry is known as _dakaitee_ ڈکیتی.

In Hindi, _dacoity_ (Hindi: डकैती _ḍakaitī_, Urdu: ڈکیتی _ḍakaitī_, Bengali: ডাকাতি _ḍakati_, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means "armed robbery".

The term DACOIT (Hindi: डकैत _ḍakait_, Urdu: ڈکیت _ḍakait_, Bengali: ডাকাত _ḍākāt_, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means "a bandit", according to the _OED_ ("A member of a class of robbers in India and Burma, who plunder in armed bands").


History

Bandits of Morena and Chambal

The dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and Chambal regions in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh haryana in north-central India.[2] The exact reasons for the emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley has been disputed. Most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. The area was also underdeveloped and poor, so that banditry posed great economic incentives.[3] However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Furthermore, traditional honor codes and blood feuds would drive some into criminality.[4]

In Chambal, organized crime controlled much of the countryside from the time of the British Raj up to the early 2000s, with the police offering high rewards for the most notorious bandit chiefs. The criminals regularly targeted local businesses, though they preferred to kidnap wealthy people, and demand ransom from their relatives - cutting off fingers, noses, and ears to pressure them into paying high sums. Many dacoity also posed as social bandits toward the local poor, paying medical bills and funding weddings. One ex-dacoit described his own criminal past by claiming that "I was a rebel. I fought injustice."[5] Following intense anti-banditry campaigns by the Indian Police, highway robbery was almost completely eradicated in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, Chambal is still popularly believed to be unsafe and bandit-infested by many Indians. One police officer noted that the fading of the dacoity was also due to social changes, as few young people were any longer willing to endure the harsh life as highway robber in the countryside. Instead, they prefer to join crime groups in the city, where life is easier.[6]

Other dacoity

The term is also applied, according to the _OED_, to "pirates who formerly infested the Ganges between Calcutta and Burhampore".

Dacoits existed in Burma as well – Rudyard Kipling's fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in "The Taking of Lungtungpen". Sax Rohmer's criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu also employed Burmese dacoits as his henchmen.

Indian police forces use "Known Dacoit" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.

Protection measures

In Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity. The Ex-chief minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.[13]


In popular culture

Dacoit films

As the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various Hindi films made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in Bollywood.[14] The genre began with Mehboob Khan's _Aurat_ (1940), which he remade as _Mother India_ (1957). _Mother India_ received an Academy Award nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with Dilip Kumar's _Gunga Jumna_ (1961).[15] Other popular films in this genre included Homi Wadia's Diamond Queen (1940), Raj Kapoor’s _Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai_ (1961) and Moni Bhattacharjee's _Mujhe Jeene Do_ (1963).[16]

Pakistani actor Akmal Khan had two dacoit films, _Malangi_ (1965) and _Imam Din Gohavia_ (1967). Other films in this genre included _Khote Sikkay_ (1973), _Mera Gaon Mera Desh_ (1971), and _Kuchhe Dhaage_ (1973) both by Raj Khosla.

The most famous dacoit film is _Sholay_ (1975), written by Salim-Javed and starring Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, and with its dacoit character Gabbar Singh played by Amjad Khan. It was a masala film that combined the dacoit film conventions of _Mother India_ and _Gunga Jumna_ with that of Spaghetti Westerns, spawning the Dacoit Western genre,[17] often known as the "Curry Western" genre. The film also borrowed elements from Akira Kurosawa's _Seven Samurai_.[18] _Sholay_ became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including _Ganga Ki Saugandh_ (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.

An internationally acclaimed example of the genre is _Bandit Queen_ (1994).

Tamil movie, Karthi starrer _Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru_ (2017) deals elaborately about Bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director Vinoth did a 2 year research about Bandits to develop the script.

A related genre of crime films are Mumbai underworld films.

Other media

A Hindi novel पैंसठ लाख की डकैती (Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity, 1977) was written by Surender Mohan Pathak; it was translated as _The 65 Lakh Heist_.

Dacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in _Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties_.

They frequently appeared in the French language _Bob Morane_ series of novels by Henri Vernes, principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero's recurring villain, Mr. Ming.
