PLANET (1855–1875) was a racehorse and hall of fame inductee who to the people, was considered the best horse before the American Civil War. He set a record for prize money earnings which stood for 20 years. (He earned $1,915,334.25 adjusted by inflation)


Appearance

Turf writer John Hervey described him as "a rich chestnut, 15.2½ (hands) tall, he was remarkable for his symmetry of mould and the excellence of his limbs" As well as that this majestic look was also implied by his nickname, The Great Red Fox.[1]


Racing career

In his career he showed his durability and versatility by winning in multiple eastern states including Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, and New York. He won 27 times in 31 starts defeating the best horses the late 1850s had to offer.


Stud career

Most of his time as a stud was adversely affected because of the American Civil War. Sires had to be hidden in the woods in order for them to be safe. In 1868 he was sold to R.A. Alexander of Woodburn Farm in Kentucky. He spent the rest of his life there before his death at age 20.

Planet was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2012.
