SAN QUIRICO MARTIRE is the Roman Catholic church in the _frazione_ of Bolano in the _comune_ of Fisciano, province of Salerno, region of Campania, Italy.


History

Originally this was a chapel dedicated to _Santa Maria del Carmine_ associated with the Congrega della Carit√† of Fisciano. It replaced in 1890 an earlier ancient church of San Quirico, outside of town, in a lowlying area, which due to repeated flooding had caused the structure to fall into ruin. The Belltower was built in 1897. A number of the ornaments date from this year including the canvas depicting the S.S Vergine di Pompei, the Madonna of the Carmine, and the altar of the _Addolorata_.

Originally a rural location, it is now in an urban neighborhood.[1]
