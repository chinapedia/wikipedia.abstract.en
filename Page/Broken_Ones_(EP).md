_BROKEN ONES_ is the debut extended play recorded by American singer and runner-up of fifth season of _The Voice_, Jacquie Lee. It was released through Atlantic Records and 300 Entertainment on October 21, 2014.[1] A cover of Cyndi Lauper's 1983 hit, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" is included along with four original songs co-written by popular songwriters such as Sia Furler and Andreas Carlsson. The EP failed to reach the _Billboard_ 200, but did peak at 193 on the Top Current Albums component chart.[2]


Singles

The title track, "Broken Ones", was released to digital retailers as the lead single and Lee's debut post-_Voice_ release on May 13, 2014.[3] It entered the Pop Digital Songs sales chart at 36.[4] The song was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio through 300 Entertainment on June 16, 2014.[5]

"Tears Fall" was first released digitally on October 7, 2014 as a promotional single in support of pre-orders.[6] It was later selected as the second official single and was scheduled to impact adult and pop radio on February 23, 2015, but its release was delayed and the song instead impacted on March 9, 2015.[7][8]


Critical reception

Jason Scott of PopDust rated the EP four stars out of five and praised Lee's "uncanny maturity" on the record. "Lee has balanced the trapeze between catchy, memorable material and a stellar presentation," writes Scott, "_Broken Ones_ is where everything seems to gloriously fall into place perfectly."[9] Emilee Lindner of MTV called the EP a must-hear which demonstrates that Lee is "equipped with powerful vocals and the smarts of an industry vet."[10]
