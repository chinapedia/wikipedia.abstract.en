DAVID JANSSEN (born DAVID HAROLD MEYER, March 27, 1931 – February 13, 1980) was an American film and television actor who is best known for his starring role as Richard Kimble in the television series _The Fugitive_ (1963–1967). Janssen also had the title roles in three other series: _Richard Diamond, Private Detective_; _Harry O_; and _O'Hara, U.S. Treasury_.

In 1996 _TV Guide_ ranked him number 36 on its _50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time_ list.[1]


Early life

Janssen was born in 1931 in Naponee, a village in Franklin County in southern Nebraska, to Harold Edward Meyer, a banker (May 12, 1906 – November 4, 1990) and Berniece Graf (May 11, 1910 – November 26, 1995). Janssen was of Irish and Jewish descent.[2] Following his parents' divorce in 1935, his mother moved with five-year-old David to Los Angeles, California, and later married Eugene Janssen (February 18, 1918 – March 30, 1996) in 1940 in Los Angeles. Young David used his stepfather's name after he entered show business as a child.

He attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, where he excelled on the basketball court, setting a school-scoring record that lasted over 20 years. His first film part was at the age of thirteen, and by the age of twenty-five he had appeared in twenty films and served two years as an enlisted man in the United States Army. During his Army days, Janssen became friends with fellow enlistees Martin Milner and Clint Eastwood while posted at Fort Ord, California.


Acting career

Janssen appeared in many television series before he landed programs of his own. In 1956, he and Peter Breck appeared in John Bromfield's syndicated series _Sheriff of Cochise_ in the episode "The Turkey Farmers". Later, he guest-starred on NBC's medical drama _The Eleventh Hour_ in the role of Hal Kincaid in the 1962 episode "Make Me a Place", with series co-stars Wendell Corey and Jack Ging. He joined friend Martin Milner in a 1962 episode of _Route 66_ as the character Kamo in the episode "One Tiger to a Hill."

Janssen starred in four television series of his own:

-   _Richard Diamond, Private Detective_ (1957–1960), a CBS/Four Star hit series that also introduced Mary Tyler Moore, showing only her legs, and Barbara Bain as Diamond's girlfriend.
-   _The Fugitive_ (1963–67), the hit Quinn Martin-produced series, about a Midwest doctor wrongly convicted of murdering his wife;
-   _O'Hara, U.S. Treasury_ (1971–1972), one of Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited productions for Universal Studios, as a government agent investigating counterfeiters and other federal crimes;
-   _Harry O_ (1974–1976), as a San Diego-based private eye.

At the time, the final episode of _The Fugitive_ held the record for the greatest number of American homes with television sets to watch a series finale, at 72 percent in August 1967. David Janssen was well liked by everyone, but more loved by his fans. He fit the perfect role of "why me?" One could not help feeling sorry for his Fugitive character of being quiet, unassuming, afraid, but mainly caring for others. On an episode, he stopped to help an old lady cross the street, on another; he helped a young, attractive woman start up her stalled car in the middle of nowhere.

His films include _To Hell and Back_, the biography of Audie Murphy, who was the most decorated American soldier of World War II; John Wayne's Vietnam war film _The Green Berets_; opposite Gregory Peck in the space story _Marooned_, in which Janssen played an astronaut sent to rescue three stranded men in space, and _The Shoes of the Fisherman_, as a television journalist in Rome reporting on the election of a new Pope (Anthony Quinn).

He starred as a Los Angeles police detective trying to clear himself in the killing of an apparently innocent doctor in the 1967 film _Warning Shot_. The film was shot during a break in the spring and summer of 1966 between the third and fourth seasons of _The Fugitive._

Janssen played an alcoholic in the 1977 TV movie _A Sensitive, Passionate Man_, which co-starred Angie Dickinson, and an engineer who devises an unbeatable system for blackjack in the 1978 made-for-TV movie _Nowhere to Run_, co-starring Stefanie Powers and Linda Evans. Janssen's impressively husky voice was used to good effect as the narrator for the TV mini-series _Centennial_ (1978–79); he also appeared in the final episode. He starred in the made-for-TV mini series _S.O.S. Titanic_ as John Jacob Astor, playing opposite Beverly Ross as his wife, Madeleine, in 1979.

Though Janssen's scenes were cut from the final release, he also appeared as a journalist in the film _Inchon_, which he accepted to work with Laurence Olivier who played General Douglas MacArthur. At the time of his death, Janssen had just begun filming a television movie playing the part of Father Damien, the priest who dedicated himself to the leper colony on the island of Molokai, Hawaii. The part was eventually reassigned to actor Ken Howard of the CBS series _The White Shadow_.

In 1996 _TV Guide_ ranked him number 36 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.[3]


Personal life

Janssen was married twice. His first marriage was to model and interior decorator Ellie Graham, whom he married in Las Vegas on August 25, 1958.[4] They divorced in 1968.[5] In 1975, he married actress and model Dani Crayne Greco. They remained married until Janssen's death.[6]


Death

A heavy drinker and a four-pack-a-day smoker,[7] Janssen died of a heart attack in the early morning of February 13, 1980, at his home in Malibu, California at the age of 48.[8][9] At the time of his death, Janssen was filming the television movie _Father Damien_. Janssen was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.[10] A non-denominational funeral was held at the Jewish chapel of the cemetery on February 17. Suzanne Pleshette delivered the eulogy at the request of Janssen's widow. Milton Berle, Johnny Carson, Tommy Gallagher, Richard Harris, Stan Herman, Rod Stewart and Gregory Peck were among Janssen's pallbearers. Honorary pallbearers included Jack Lemmon, George Peppard, James Stewart and Danny Thomas.[11][12]

For his contribution to the television industry, David Janssen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located on the 7700 block of Hollywood Boulevard.[13]
