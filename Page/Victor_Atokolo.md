Brexit & Trump Predictions

Atokolo in July 2016 predicted Donald Trump would emerge as new President-Elect of the United States of America. According to him, Trump’s victory would impede the movement towards a one-world government. He also strongly believes that if Hillary Clinton of the Democrats had won the election, a chain of events would have ensued which would intensify the persecution of Christians and Jews.

In a video interview released on his official page[3] months before the US General Elections, he said the world would have been taken over by Anti-Christ if Hillary Clinton had won. According to him, "The movement was towards a one-world government and consequently the one-world religion as well as the full revelation of the anti-Christ. If the moves by the Democratic had succeeded, we would have ended up having a one-world government. That would have intensified the persecution of Christians and the Jews and the eventual manifestation of the Anti-Christ. You will recall that the within the last five years, Christians around the world had been persecuted more than any other season since the first century of the Church. This resulted in the murder of thousands of Christians in the Middle East by the ISIS as well as here in Nigeria where several lives have been wasted by the Boko Haram. All these have been happening because the American government turned the other cheek. However the exit of Britain from the European Union has impeded the move to introduce one-world government".[4]
