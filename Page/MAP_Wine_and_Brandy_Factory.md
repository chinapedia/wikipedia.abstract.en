MAP WINE AND BRANDY FACTORY ( (_MAP Ginu-Konyaki Gortsaran_)), is one of the leading producers of alcoholic drinks in Armenia, located in the village of Lenughi of Armavir Province.[1] It was founded in 1942 as the _Hoktemberian Wine and Brandy Factory_ by the government of the Armenian SSR, to process the grapes of the fertile Ararat plain. The company is largely known by its main wine and cognac brand _Aramé_,[2] named after king Arame of Urartu.


History

The Hoktemberian Wine and Brandy Factory was founded in 1942 as a state-owned enterprise of the Soviet Armenian government.

After the privatization of the factory in 1995, the winery was turned into an open joint-stock company. In 2001, the company was incorporated into a closed joint-stock company.[3]

As of 2016, the factory has an annual production capacity 14 million liters, based on French and German technologies.
