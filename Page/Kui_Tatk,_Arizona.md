KUI TATK is a populated place located on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation in Pima County, Arizona.[1] It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2] Its name means "mesquite root" in the Tohono O'odham language.[3] Historically it has also been known by the variant, KVITATK. It has also incorrectly been identified as IRON PIPE (translated into the O'odham as _Vainom Kug_), which is the name of a village which sprang up around a steam pump built by miners about a mile away. The name, and its current spelling, was reached as a decision by the Board on Geographic Names in 1941.[4] The original Indian settlement was abandoned in the 1850s, when its inhabitants migrated to different locations such as Gu Oidak, Pan Tak, and Gu Chuapo.[5]
