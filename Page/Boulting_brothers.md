JOHN EDWARD BOULTING[1] (21 November[2] 1913 – 17 June 1985) and ROY ALFRED CLARENCE BOULTING[3] (21 November[4] 1913 – 5 November 2001), known collectively as the BOULTING BROTHERS, were English filmmakers and identical twins who became known for their popular series of satirical comedies in the 1950s and 1960s. They produced many of their films through their own production company, CHARTER FILM PRODUCTIONS, which they set up in 1937.[5]


Early life

The twin brothers were born to Arthur Boulting and his wife Rosetta (Rose) _née_ Bennett in Bray, Berkshire, England on 21 November[6] 1913. John was the elder by half an hour. John was named JOSEPH EDWARD JOHN BOULTING and Roy was named ALFRED FITZROY CLARENCE BOULTING. Their elder brother Sydney Boulting became an actor and stage producer as Peter Cotes; he was the original director of _The Mousetrap_. A younger brother, Guy, died aged eight.

Both twins were educated at Reading School, where they formed a film society. They were extras in Anthony Asquith's 1931 film _Tell England_ while still at school.[7]

During the Spanish Civil War, John served with the International Brigades[8][9] as an ambulance driver,[10][11] where—according to Richard Attenborough—Boulting was nearly captured.[12]

The brothers constitute one of those producer-director teams responsible for much notable British cinema. For most of their careers one produced while the other directed, but the product remained essentially a 'Boulting Brothers film'. They were socialists, as John demonstrated with the International Brigades, and wanted all film, including comedies, to reflect the real world.

Charter Film Productions

In 1937, they set up CHARTER FILM PRODUCTIONS and made several short features, including _The Landlady_ (1937) and _Consider Your Verdict_ (1938), which attracted critical and commercial attention.[13]

They made quota quickies such as _Trunk Crime_ (1939) and _Inquest_ (1939).

Feature films

Being eager to speak out against the Third Reich, the brothers made their major film, _Pastor Hall (1940)_, a biopic of Martin Niemöller, a German preacher who refuses to kowtow to the Nazis. Roy directed and John produced. The film had to have its initial release delayed by the British Government, which was not yet ready to be openly critical of Nazism. Once released, the film was well received by the critics and the public.[14][15]

They followed up with _Thunder Rock (1942)_ with Michael Redgrave, a passionate anti-isolationist allegory distinguished by imaginative cinematography and a theatrical but highly atmospheric lighthouse setting. It was financed by MGM.

Military service

In 1941 Roy joined the Army Film Unit, where he was responsible for the enormously influential _Desert Victory_ - which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1944.[16] He also worked on _Tunisian Victory_ (1944) and _Burma Victory_ (1945).

John joined the RAF Film Unit, where he made _Journey Together_ in 1945, a dramatised documentary about the training and combat experience of a bomber crew with Richard Attenborough in the lead part. Terence Rattigan worked on the script.

Post-war films

After the war the Boultings made the drama _Fame Is the Spur_ (1947) with Redgrave.[17] More popular was _Brighton Rock_ (1947), starring Attenborough as the gangster "Pinkie" from the novel by Graham Greene, which has become a classic.[18]

Also well liked was the comedy _The Guinea Pig_ (1948), starring Richard Attenborough as a young working class boy sent to a public school. It was made for Pilgrim Pictures who the Boultings left shortly afterwards.[19]

The Boultings co-directed the thriller _Seven Days to Noon_ (1950), which won an Oscar for Best Story.[20] It led to a less popular sequel, _High Treason_ (1951).

John directed _The Magic Box_ (1951), a biopic of William Friese-Greene notable for the number of cameos in its cast. It was a box office disappointment.

Hollywood-financed films

Roy received an offer to direct a World War Two naval film, _Sailor of the King_ (1953), starring Jeffrey Hunter for 20th Century Fox. _Seagulls Over Sorrento_ (1954) was another war naval story financed by a Hollywood studio (in this case MGM) with an imported star (Gene Kelly); it was not a big success.

The brothers collaborated on a comedy, _Josephine and Men_ (1955) then Roy was hired by United Artists to do an action film with Hollywood stars, _Run for the Sun_ (1956).

Satires

In the mid-50s the Boultings quickly became identified with "affectionate" [21] satires on various British institutions. it started with John's _Private's Progress_ (1956), a look at army life, starring Attenborough, Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael and co written by Frank Harvey. It was the second most popular film in Britain in 1956.[22]

They followed it with _Lucky Jim_ (1957), a look at academia from the novel by Kingsley Amis. It starred Carmichael and Terry Thomas.[23] _Brothers in Law_ (1957) with Carmichael, Attenborough and Thomas, took on the legal profession.

They had a break from satirising institutions with _Happy Is the Bride_ (1958), an adaptation of _Quiet Wedding_, then returned to it with _Carlton-Browne of the F.O._ (1959), a send up of diplomacy.

The Boultings took on increasingly powerful trade unions and ever corrupt board room power with _I'm All Right Jack_ (1959), a sequel to _Private's Progress_ with Carmichael, Thomas and Attenborough reprising their roles, and Harvey co-writing. The film was also notable for the performance of Peter Sellers as trade union foreman Fred Kite. It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1959.[24]

_Suspect_ (1960) was a return to the thriller genre for the brothers. _A French Mistress_ (1960) was a comedy farce.

_Heavens Above!_ (1963) was a look at religion in Britain, starring Sellers and Carmichael. It was a minor hit.[25]

_Rotten to the Core_ (1965) was a heist comedy which attempted to make a star of Anton Rodgers in a Peter Sellers-type role, playing multiple parts. It featured a young Charlotte Rampling.

Hayley Mills

The Boultings directed and produced the northern comedy _The Family Way_ (1966), starring John Mills and his teenage daughter Hayley. Roy Boulting and Hayley Mills began a relationship during the shoot despite a 33-year age difference; they married in 1971.[26][27]

Roy wrote and directed _Twisted Nerve_ (1968), a thriller starring Mills and Hywel Bennett. The brothers had a massive hit with _There's a Girl in My Soup_ (1970) starring Sellers and Goldie Hawn.

Roy was called in to replace the director on _Mr. Forbush and the Penguins_ (1971), and he brought in Mills to star. The movie was not successful. Neither was the comedy _Soft Beds, Hard Battles_ (1974) made by the brothers starring Peter Sellers. Roy Boulting lost a considerable amount of money on the film.[28]

In 1975 Roy was working on a stage play, _The Family Games_.[29] He worked on the script for _The Kingfisher Caper_ (1975), starring Mills.

Later career

In the US, Roy directed _The Last Word_ (1979), a comedy starring Richard Harris that was barely seen.

When John died of cancer in 1985, Roy stopped making films. His last credit was directing an episode of the _Miss Marple_ series for TV, _The Moving Finger_ (1985). He was working on an adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play _Deja Vu_ when he died.[30]

When the National Film Theatre mounted its biggest retrospective to date of British cinema in the late 1980s, Roy who launched it, introduced _Desert Victory_. The Boulting Brother's films are regarded by film historians as "a sensitive barometer of the changing times."


Personal lives

John Boulting was married four times and had three sons and three daughters.[31] John and his South African-born wife Anne had two daughters: one of whom is Lucy Boulting Hill, a successful casting director.[32] John's grandson Jordan Stephens is one half of British hip hop duo Rizzle Kicks.[33]

Roy Boulting was married five times and had seven sons.[34] In 1951, Roy married Enid Munnik (née Groenewald/Grunewald[35]), later known as Enid Boulting (later wife of 9th Earl of Hardwicke[36]), an established fashion model and fashion editor at the French magazine _Elle_. Ingrid Boulting is Enid's daughter from a previous marriage. Together they had three children: Fitzroy (b. 1951), the eldest, then identical twins named Edmund and Rupert (b. 1952).[37] In 1971, Roy married Hayley Mills, 33 years his junior, whom he had met on the set of _The Family Way_. Their son is musician and filmmaker Crispian Mills. The couple divorced in 1978.[38]


Deaths

John Boulting died on 17 June 1985 at his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, and Roy Boulting 16 years later on 5 November 2001 in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford; both died of cancer.[39]


In popular culture

A still from _The Family Way_ was used for The Smiths single "I Started Something I Couldn't Finish".
