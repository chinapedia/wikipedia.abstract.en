KONSMO is a former municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Konsmo where Konsmo Church is located. The municipality encompassed the southern half of the present-day municipality of Audnedal.[1]


History

The municipality of Konsmo was established on 1 January 1911 when the old municipality of Nord-Audnedal was divided into Konsmo (population: 782) and Vigmostad (population: 923). There were many municipal mergers across Norway during the 1960s due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Konsmo municipality was merged with the neighboring municipality of Grindheim and the Ågedal and Midtbø areas in Bjelland to create the new municipality of Audnedal. Before the merger Konsmo had a population of 712.[2]


Name

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old _Konsmo_ farm (Old Norse: _Konungsmór_), since the first Konsmo Church was built there. The name is a corruption of _Kongsmoen_ which means King's moor.[3]
