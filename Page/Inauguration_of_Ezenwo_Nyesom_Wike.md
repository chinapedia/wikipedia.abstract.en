The INAUGURATION OF EZENWO NYESOM WIKE as the 6th Governor of Rivers State took place on Friday, 29 May 2015 at the Liberation Stadium in Elekahia, Port Harcourt.[1] The ceremony marked the beginning of the first four-year term of Ezenwo Nyesom Wike as Governor and Ipalibo Banigo as Deputy Governor.[2]

Wike won in the 2015 gubernatorial election, receiving 87.77 percent of the popular vote. He was sworn-in in accordance with section 185 (2) of the amended Constitution of Nigeria.[3] Prior to that, the Supreme Court had set aside the judgement of the Appeal Court which nullified the election.[4]


Wike Inaugural Committee

The inauguration committee was set up in April 2015 along with the transition committee. Former Deputy Speaker of the House of Reps, Austin Opara, was assigned as chairman with Jacob Beredugo as secretary.[5]


Pre-inaugural events

The full schedule of the events was unveiled by the committee on 20 May 2015 during a press briefing. On 24 May, a pre-inaugural church service was held at St Paulâ€™s Anglican Cathedral, Garrison. On 26 May, pro-chancellor of the University of Uyo, Kimse Okoko presented a lecture at Aztech Arcum entitled _Democracy and Good Governance Towards A New Rivers State_.

Inaugural events

Swearing-in ceremony

On 29 May 2015, the official swearing-in of Governor-elect Wike took place at Liberation Stadium, Elekahia. Arriving at the venue, Wike went round the stadium in a motorcade to greet the crowd and also gave his acceptance speech. Due to the vacuum that existed in the office of the Chief Judge and the President of the Customary Court of Appeal in Rivers State around that period of time, Wike was sworn-in in accordance with the provisions of Section 185 (2) of the 1999 Constitution.

Chief Judge of Bayelsa State, Justice Kate Abiri, administered the Oath of Office. Wike had also solicited the cooperation and support of Riverian stakeholders in restoring the state to its former glory. His predecessor Chibuike Amaechi did not attend the ceremony as many had expected, but instead, was in Abuja for the presidential inauguration at Eagle Square.[7][8]
