γ Octantis}}

GAMMA¹ OCTANTIS, Latinized from γ¹ Octantis, is a single,[1] yellow-hued star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Octans. Its apparent visual magnitude is 5.10,[2] which means it is just bright enough to be faintly visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 12.30 mas as seen from Earth,[3] this star is located about 265 light years from the Sun. It is moving away from the Sun with a radial velocity of +15.4 km/s.[4]

This is an evolved G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G7 III.[5] It is a red clump star,[6] which means it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. The star has an estimated 1.81[7] times the mass of the Sun and it has expanded to 11[8] times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 69[9] times the Sun's luminosity from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,150 K.[10]
