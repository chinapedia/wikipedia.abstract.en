_ROBOTECH_ is a science fiction franchise that began with an 85-episode anime television series produced by Harmony Gold USA in association with Tatsunoko Production and first released in the United States in 1985. It was adapted from three original and unrelated, though visually similar, Japanese anime television series (_The Super Dimension Fortress Macross_, _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_, and _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_) to make a series suitable for syndication.[1] In the series, _Robotechnology_ refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island.[2] With this technology, Earth developed robotic technologies, such as transformable mecha, to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions.[3]


Name origin

Prior to the release of the TV series, the name _Robotech_ was used by model kit manufacturer Revell on their _Robotech Defenders_ line in the mid-1980s. The line consisted of mecha model kits imported from Japan and featured in anime titles such as _The Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ (1982), _Super Dimension Century Orguss_ (1983) and _Fang of the Sun Dougram_ (1981). The kits were originally intended to be a marketing tie-in to a similarly named comic book series by DC Comics, which was cancelled after only two issues.[4]

At the same time, Harmony Gold licensed the _Macross_ TV series for direct-to-video distribution in 1984, but their merchandising plans were compromised by Revell's prior distribution of the _Macross_ kits. In the end, both parties signed a co-licensing agreement and the _Robotech_ name was adopted for the TV syndication of _Macross_ combined with _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_ (1984) and _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_ (1983).[5]


Fictional chronology

''The _Robotech_ chronology, according to Harmony Gold, is illustrated below:

  Timeline             Generation / Saga (release date)
  -------------------- ----------------------------------
  1999 (2009) – 2014   (1)
  2022
  2027
  2029–2030            (2)
  2031 (2042) – 2044   (3)
  2044–

Note: Asterisked works are now considered 'secondary continuity'—that is, that their events exist in the continuity of _Robotech_, but 'don't count' when conflicts arise with the primary continuity that comprises the three-part _Robotech_ TV series and 2006's _Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles_.

In 2002, with the publication of the WildStorm (DC) comics, Harmony Gold officially decided to retcon the _Robotech_ Universe. The following _Robotech_ material is now relegated to the status of secondary continuity:

-   _The Sentinels_ in all its incarnations.
-   _Robotech: The Movie_
-   _Robotech_ comics published by Comico, Eternity, Academy, and Antarctic Press.
-   _Robotech_ RPGs published by Palladium Books.
-   _Robotech_ novels written by Jack McKinney, most notably _The End of the Circle_.

While these materials are not precisely 'retired' or 'removed' from the continuity, their events are subject to critical review, and are strictly subordinate to the 'official' events of the 85-episode animated series.


Television and film

The original television series

_Robotech_ (1985) is an original story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different mecha anime series:

1.  _The Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ (1982–1983)
2.  _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_ (1984)
3.  _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_ (1983–1984)[6]

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market _Macross_ for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week).[7] _Macross_ and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. On some television stations, the syndicated run was preceded by the broadcast premiere of _Codename: Robotech_, a feature-length pilot.

This combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations, as mankind must fight three destructive 'Robotech Wars' in succession with various invading forces, each of which is motivated in one way or another by a desire for a powerful energy source called 'protoculture'. While each of the three animated series used for its footage informs its content, the Robotech storyline is distinct and separate from each of them.

-   The First Robotech War (_The Macross Saga_) concerns humanity's discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown. In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture. Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.
-   The Second Robotech War (_The Masters_) focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture. Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life—the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.
-   The Third Robotech War (_The New Generation_) begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet. References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld. The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.

_Robotech: The Movie_

_Robotech: The Movie_, also called _Robotech: The Untold Story_, is a feature film and was the first new _Robotech_ adventure created after the premiere of the original series. It uses footage from the _Megazone 23 – Part 1_ OVA (original video animation; made-for-video animated feature) combined with scenes from "Southern Cross" and additional original animation produced for the film.

The original plan for the film was to have it set during the Macross Saga, parallel to the SDF-1's return to Earth from Pluto. The film would also have served as a prequel to the Sentinels, as both projects were initially meant to share many characters. Harmony Gold producer Carl Macek worked with the OVA's original creators to make the story and the new ending work. The film had to be changed again after the distributor of the film, Cannon Films, saw an incomplete rough cut of the film and were upset by it. They ordered Macek to remove multiple scenes from the film and to add more violence (most of the scenes removed were scenes setting up characters and showing female characters interacting). Macek reluctantly did what they ordered, and created a new script and rough edit for the film in less than 24 hours. When the distributors saw Macek act out the new film, they were much more pleased with the new cut.[8] The opening night in Texas received a positive response, but Cannon Films pulled out after noting that most attendants were adults; the bulk of the scheduled advertising for the series was targeted to children. The film had limited success in Argentina and Belgium.

In 2011, A&E Home Video released, as a part of their _Robotech: The Complete Series_ collection, a 29-minute version of _Robotech: The Movie_ containing only footage used from "Southern Cross". There was no attempt to remaster the footage.[9]

_Robotech II: The Sentinels_

This aborted American-produced series would have followed the continuing adventures of Rick and Lisa Hunter and the Robotech Expedition during the events of _The Masters_ and _The New Generation_. The feature-length pilot is composed of the first three (and only) episodes that were produced. _The Sentinels_ featured characters from all three _Robotech_ sagas and introduced the SDF-3 along with an overview of their new mission. The series was planned to have a total of 65 episodes.[10]

In _Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels_, Carl Macek blamed the cancellation of the series on the crash of the Yen/Dollar exchange rate,[11] which caused toy partner Matchbox to withdraw from the project. Harmony Gold lacked the funds to produce the series on its own, and production ceased after only three episodes.

_Robotech II: The Sentinels_ was released on VHS by Palladium Books.[12] In 2011, a "remastered" version was released on the A&E DVD set, _Robotech: The Complete Original Series_ DVD. This version has opening titles resembling those found on the "Robotech Remastered" DVDs, as well as a new ending with text explaining the fate of the SDF-3. Also, all of the flashback footage used from "The Macross Saga" has been removed, including the re-used footage from the episode "Wedding Bells".[13]

_Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles_

In 2002, Tommy Yune announced development of a new sequel film, which was untitled until 2004 as _Robotech: Shadow Force_. The storyline overlaps with and continues from the unresolved ending of the original series. The title of the story arc was soon changed to _Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles_. The first trailers with finished animation were shown at Anime Expo and Comic-Con International in 2005. It was not until February 2006, when Kevin McKeever, operations coordinator at Harmony Gold, was able to confirm that the pilot movie had been completed. After a series of delays, FUNimation Entertainment was finally announced as the home video, broadcast, and theatrical distributor at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego with the possibility of producing further sequels. Harmony Gold premiered the movie at various film festivals in 2006, and it was first seen by a public audience at MechaCon on August 9, 2006, where it was showcased as a charity screening to help raise funds for the ongoing Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita recovery effort. A limited theatrical run followed in January 2007, and the film was released on DVD on February 6, 2007.[14] A two-disc collector's edition was released in November 2007.[15]

_Robotech: Love Live Alive_

First revealed in late 2011 in the final minutes of _Carl Macek's Robotech Universe_, a documentary on the making of _Robotech_ dedicated to the then-recent passing of Macek, _Love Live Alive_ is an adaptation of the 1985 _Genesis Climber Mospeada_ OVA, _Love Live Alive_, incorporating some brand-new animation. The film was released on DVD on July 23, 2013 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in North America.[16]


Other television and film productions

_Robotech Wars_

This promotional VHS tape created by Matchbox was included with their _Robotech Wars_ playset. This video includes two episodes cobbled together from clips of _The Macross Saga_. Titled "To the End of the Universe" and "Battle Royale", these episodes contain no new footage, and are not meant to follow any continuity established in the TV series.[17]

Robotech III, Robotech IV and Robotech V

Carl Macek revealed ideas for another proposed series, _Robotech: The Odyssey_, which would have picked up where _The New Generation_ and end of _Robotech: The Sentinels_ left off, and eventually created a circular storyline that would end where the original _Robotech_ began in a giant 260-episode cycle to fill up all the weekdays in a year. According to Macek, _The Odyssey_ would have involved the SDF-3 travelling back into the past to the days before the birth of Zor (as well as Scott Bernard's search for the SDF-3). The SDF-3's crew would become citizens of the Robotech Masters' homeworld and change time by becoming a part of its history. Ultimately, it would be revealed that Lynn Minmei was the mother of Zor, making Minmei the focal point of Robotech. The final episode of the Odyssey would be of Zor dying and his Super Dimension Fortress (the SDF-1) being launched into space, and eventually crash landing on Earth in 1999. The next episode after that would be "Boobytrap", episode 1 of the original series which in turn will create an endless loop within the _Robotech_ universe.[18][19] After the failure of _Sentinels_, _Odyssey_ never went into development, although some of its ideas were worked into the final Jack McKinney novel _The End of the Circle_, which wrapped up all of the outstanding plot threads left by the original series and the previous _Robotech_ novels.[20]

Fan publication _Macross Life_ interviewed Harmony Gold executive Richard Firth in 1986, where he revealed that Macek had "plans through _ROBOTECH V_, which would give us an episode for each day of the year for a year and a half." He also said that these two installments would have brought the series to 285 episodes. Regarding the plot, Firth mentioned a "retired Commodore Hunter, whomever that may be, could very well be speaking at the graduation of the later day cadets or whatever, and they ask him to tell them the story all over again: it comes back [to the first episode of the series]."

Macek himself described a fourth and fifth series envisioned for Robotech in Chris Meadow's Space Station Liberty podcast in 2007. Macek mentioned the original series as the first, The Sentinels as Robotech II, The Odyssey as Robotech III, and then 2 further series detailing the evolution of Zor, bringing the combined series' total to approximately 300 episodes.[21]

_Robotech 3000_

Macek attempted another sequel with the development of _Robotech 3000_. This all-CGI series would have been set a millennium in the future of the _Robotech_ universe and feature none of the old series' characters. In the three-minute trailer, an expedition is sent to check on a non-responsive mining outpost and is attacked by "infected" Veritech mecha. The idea was abandoned midway into production after negative reception within the company, negative fan reactions at the FanimeCon anime convention in 2000, and financial difficulties within Netter Digital who was animating the show. The trailer is hosted on the official _Robotech_ website, and was included in the 2007 release of the _Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles_ 2-disc collector's DVD, along with behind-the-scenes motion capture footage.

_Robotech: Mars Force_

In October 2004, veteran animation writer and producer Greg Weisman revealed that he wrote developed an animated spin-off series titled _Robotech: Mars Force_.[22] When asked about the project, Weisman said that he was under a non-disclosure agreement with Harmony Gold and was only allowed to mention that he developed the series.[23]

In 2006, Harmony Gold Creative Director Tommy Yune elaborated on the project in the Space Station Liberty Podcast, saying that Mars Force was a series geared at younger audiences, following the children Robotech Expeditionary Force.[24] A similar plot would later be used for canceled 2014 spin-off, _Robotech Academy_.

_Robotech UN Public Service Announcement_

A sixty-second public service announcement for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, featuring Scott Bernard and Ariel, was animated during the production of _The Shadow Chronicles_. Although it did not use the original voice actors and the dialogue was somewhat out-of-character, it nonetheless marked the first fully completed _Robotech_ footage in many years.[25]

_Robotech: Shadow Rising_ (canceled)

On July 27, 2007, at their Comic-Con International panel, Harmony Gold and Yune unveiled the second entry of the _Shadow Chronicles_ production, titled _Robotech: Shadow Rising_ and was to be a co-production with FUNimation Entertainment. Pre-production reportedly began on February 2007 and a projected release date of sometime in 2009 was originally expected.[26] Production ceased after Harmony Gold terminated their deal with FUNimation Entertainment due to creative differences.

At Comic-Con 2012, Tommy Yune announced that _Love Live Alive_ would pave the way for _Shadow Rising_.[27] As of 2015, the Shadow Rising trademark remains abandoned since 2007.[28]

_Robotech Academy_ (canceled)

On July 5, 2014, Harmony Gold started a Kickstarter project for _Robotech Academy_, which Macek had developed before he died. The goal of this project was to raise US$500,000 to produce a new 24-minute pilot episode. The crowdfunding project was to have closed on August 9, 2014;[29] however, on August 2, the project was canceled with a pledge level of US$194,574, or 39% of its target.[30] Harmony Gold, however, announced that further plans to fund the project were being explored.[31] At the 2014 Long Beach Comic Con, it was announced that the producers at Harmony Gold were in talks with at least one new media network on the prospect of producing the show.[32] As of December 7, 2015, the project remains abandoned.

Unofficial and parody productions

In the 1990s, Seishun Shitemasu, an anime fandubbing group, produced the parodies _Robotech III: Not Necessarily the Sentinels_ and _Robotech IV: Khyron's Counterattack_, using footage from, respectively, _Gunbuster_ and _Gundam: Char's Counterattack_, continuing the tradition of the original Robotech's adaptation of unrelated anime series into a single continuity.

On July 2, 2010, Ecuadorian animator Patricio "Pat" Mosquera uploaded to YouTube a teaser for _Robotech Skull Knights_. On August 17, 2010, second teaser revealed Rick Hunter standing in front of an image of the VF-4 shown in the final episodes of the original series. _Robotech Skull Knights_ has not been released yet.[33] In July 2013, Patricio Mosquera was included as an animation director in the staff list in the IMDb page of _Love Live Alive_.[34]

On December 31, 2012, Cesar Turturro uploaded to YouTube an Argentinian fan trailer for _Robotech Valkyrie Project_.[35] On December, 2013 the first episode was uploaded to YouTube, and in January 2014, the second episode was also uploaded. The series was cancelled after Harmony Gold issued a "cease and desist" letter to the producers. The team was, however, hired to do the CGI effects for _Robotech: Academy_.

Proposed live-action film

On September 7, 2007, _The Hollywood Reporter_ stated that Warner Bros. had acquired the film rights to _Robotech_ and would be producing a live-action film with an as-yet-unknown release date.[36] Tobey Maguire is producing the film through his Maguire Entertainment banner and is pursuing the lead role, in what the studio plans to be a tentpole science fiction franchise. Maguire stated, "We are very excited to bring _Robotech_ to the big screen. There is a rich mythology that will be a great foundation for a sophisticated, smart and entertaining film."[37]

In an interview,[38] Harmony Gold representative Kevin McKeever said that Warner Bros. had approached Harmony Gold about the project, that Harmony Gold would have "a say" in its creative direction, and that it was not expected to affect the production schedule for _Shadow Rising_. He was unable to confirm any details of budget, casting, expected release date, or storyline, explaining that it was too early in the life of the project for these things to have been decided.

In June 2008, it was reported that Lawrence Kasdan had been hired to write the film, with Charles Roven and Akiva Goldsman joining Tobey Maguire as producers.[39] During the Robotech Panel at Anime Expo 2008, the involvement of Maguire and Kasdan was confirmed, with Kasdan writing the script for the live-action film. Tommy Yune also revealed that the film is planned as a re-imagining of the original _Robotech_ universe (with new updated mecha and character designs) and will take place several years in the future, departing from the original cartoon's 2009 setting.[40]

As of November 2008, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (who both worked in _Smallville_, _Spider-Man 2_, _Herbie: Fully Loaded_, and _The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_) are the writers for the film.[41]

Roven is currently no longer working on the proposed film adaptation of the _Robotech_ animated series, but he wished the remaining producers Goldsman and Maguire "fantastic luck" on the project.[42]

The Mania.com website reported on June 23, 2009, that British television writer and novelist Tom Rob Smith "has taken over writing duties" for the proposed film adaptation. Smith wrote for the British soaps _Family Affairs_ and _Bad Girls_ before writing the critically acclaimed crime suspense novel _Child 44_. Smith will be the fourth writer or writing team to be reportedly attached to the upcoming film's pre-production.[43]

In early 2013, _The Hollywood Reporter_ announced that Warner Bros. was in talks with commercial director Nic Mathieu to direct the film.[44] On July 24, 2013, it was reported that Leonardo DiCaprio had turned down a role in _Star Wars: Episode VII_ and has shown interest to star as a main character in the upcoming big screen version of _Robotech_. DiCaprio is a longtime friend of Tobey Maguire; they co-starred in _The Great Gatsby_. Maguire will probably participate in the film as another one of the lead actors—while Nic Mathieu will direct.[45][46] On February 4, 2015, Deadline.com reported Gianni Nunori and Mark Canton selected Michael B. Gordon to write the film's script and are looking at Andy Muschietti to direct it.[47]

On March 25, 2015, Variety announced that the _Robotech_ franchise had been acquired by Sony Pictures, who views _Robotech_ as a potential film franchise.[48] On April 29, 2015, Deadline reported that James Wan is in talks to direct the film.[49] On June 3, 2015, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that Wan is confirmed to direct the film.[50]

On July 3, 2015, Kevin McKeever of Harmony Gold announced at Anime Expo that Sony has the rights to release this film worldwide, with the exception of Japan.[51]

On March 27, 2016, Wan told IGN that the film will follow the roots of the franchise.[52]

As of April 4, 2016, Harmony Gold's Kevin McKeever revealed on the official Robotech Facebook page that their deal with Sony is still not finalized.[53]

On July 17, 2017, it was reported by The Hollywood Reporter that Argentine filmmaker Andy Muschietti will direct the project, after Wan dropped out to work on _Aquaman_.[54]

On September 12, 2017, Jason Fuchs was reportedly hired by the studio to write the script for the film.[55]


Other media

At the time of its broadcast, Harmony Gold also launched _Robotech_ through a popular line of comics to be followed by novels, role-playing games, toys, and other consumer products. With the cancellation of _Robotech II: The Sentinels_, many of these licensed products were discontinued, and led to a drought of _Robotech_ product through much of the 1990s, except for publishers who continued _The Sentinels_ storyline in print.

Art books

In 1986, Starblaze Graphics published _Robotech Art 1_, a reference book containing artwork, Japanese production designs, and episode guides from the original television series. This was followed by _Robotech Art 2_, which was largely a collection of art by various American artists and fans. In 1988, Carl Macek collected much of the unused designs from _Robotech II: The Sentinels_ into _Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels_, which also included his story outline for the rest of the unfinished series, with an explanation behind its cancellation. In 2007, Stone Bridge Press published _The Art of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles_.

Comics

_Robotech_ comics were first published in 1984 with DC Comics' short-lived _Robotech Defenders_ and Comico's adaptation of the first episode of the Japanese version of _Macross_. However, the first adaptation of the _Robotech_ television series did not arrive until 1985 with Comico's _Robotech: The Macross Saga_ Number 2, which continued from the first _Macross_ issue.

The various comic publishers include:

-   Comico (1984–1989)
-   Eternity Comics (1988–1994)
-   Academy Comics (1994–1996)
-   Antarctic Press (1997–1998)
-   Wildstorm (DC) (2002–2005)
-   Dynamite Entertainment (2013–2015)
-   Titan Comics[56] (2017–2019)

Collectible card game

The first _Robotech_ collectible card game was released in 2006 by Hero Factory, which had previously produced _Robotech_ trading cards.

Music and soundtracks

Various _Robotech_ soundtracks have been released on records, cassettes, and compact discs since 1988.

-   _Robotech_: BGM Collection, Vol.1 (1988)
-   _Robotech_: Perfect Collection (1988)
-   _Robotech_: Perfect Soundtrack Album (1996)
-   _Robotech_: Battlecry Soundtrack (2002)
-   _Robotech_: Invasion Soundtrack (2004)
-   _Robotech_: 20th Anniversary Soundtrack (2005)
-   _Robotech_: The Shadow Chronicles Soundtrack (2007)
-   _Robotech_: 30th Anniversary Soundtrack (2015)

Novelizations

Since 1987, _Robotech_ was adapted into novel form by "Jack McKinney", a pseudonym for the team of James Luceno and the late Brian Daley, a pair of writers who had been working with Macek since they had collaborated on the animated series _Galaxy Rangers_. Using fictitious epigraphs in the style of _Dune_, McKinney's novels fleshed out the chronology (including adapting the incomplete _Sentinels_ source material) in far greater detail than the original animation. Many _Robotech_ fans consider the McKinney series to be an unofficial canon of its own, despite notable divergences in the writing from Harmony Gold's current official animation-based canon. Despite no longer being considered core-continuity by Harmony Gold, the novels have been recently re-issued by Del Rey Books as Omnibus compilations.

Role-playing games

In 1986, Palladium Books published a role-playing game based on the _Robotech_ series, including several books covering the _Sentinels_ portion of the storyline. The original _Robotech_ RPG line went out of print as of June 30, 2001, but Harmony Gold and Palladium Books signed an agreement in 2007 to produce a new line of Robotech RPG books, beginning with a book covering and promoting the feature-length film _The Shadow Chronicles_.[57] The _Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles Role-Playing Game_ sourcebook first book was released on March 21, 2008, followed by sourcebooks covering the Macross, Masters, and New Generation chapters of Robotech (redrafted to reflect the Harmony Gold canon). Other sourcebooks and supplements are reflected in the Palladium Books production pipeline.

On April 18, 2013, Palladium started a campaign on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter for a tabletop miniatures game based on the Robotech RPG called "Robotech: RPG Tactics". The miniatures are being produced by Ninja Division (combining sculpting talents from Soda Pop Miniatures and Cipher Studios), and will feature multi part plastic miniatures that can be posed during assembly. The campaign reached its goal in 3 hours, and was initially scheduled to release in December 2013, but delays have persisted into 2018.

In May 2019, under licencing from Harmony Gold and Strange Machine Games, Battlefield Press International produced a game book for the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.

Toys

Action figures in the size of the three _Robotech_ generations were initially released in 1985 by Matchbox toy company, but then reissued in 1992 by Harmony Gold (Lunk and Corg were only released by Matchbox and Lynn Minmei was only released by Harmony Gold). Each included a weapon and helmet where appropriate. Matchbox also released figures of Zentraedi characters from the first generation. These figures were supposed to represent the size difference between the Humans and the giant Zentraedi forces, but to be correct these figures would have to have been made about tall. None of the larger figures came with weapons but the Armored Zentraedi came with a removable helmet.

Also many toys depicting the vehicles and mecha from the series were released by Matchbox in 1985, Harmony Gold in 1992 and Playmates Toys in 1994 (under the Exosquad line). There were major differences in packaging, toy stickers and colors between the different releases. The vehicles were designed to be used only with the 3¾-inch figures. The SDF-1 Playset was only released under the Matchbox line in the 1980s and could be used with both the 3¾- and six-inch figures.

Harmony Gold and Matchbox were unable to sell the 1/55 VF-1 Valkyrie toy originally sold in Japan by Takatoku Toys due to Hasbro licensing it as Jetfire in the Transformers toy line. Because of this, they settled with manufacturing a non-transformable Veritech Fighter that could fit any of the 3¾-inch action figures, as well as importing the transformable super deformed Veritech Fighters (originally manufactured in Japan by Bandai as _Macross_ VF-1 Valkyrie "Joke machines").

Since the late 1990s, there has been a resurgence of _Robotech_-related toys. In 2001, Toynami released the _Robotech Masterpiece Collection_ line, featuring replicas of the Veritech Fighters of _The Macross Saga_. Since then, Toynami has become the exclusive toy manufacturer of the _Robotech_ franchise—having covered mecha from _The Macross Saga_, _The New Generation_ and _The Shadow Chronicles_.

Video games

_Robotech_ spawned five video game licenses, of which the most recent three were released:

-   _Robotech: Crystal Dreams_ was a cancelled release for the Nintendo 64 game system. This was aborted when its publisher, GameTek, went under in 1998. The game would have taken place during the period between the SDF-1's destruction and the launch of the SDF-3. The game had a Zentraedi invasion during what was scripted in the series as a period of peace.
-   _Robotech: Battlecry_ (2002) for the Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation 2, and Nintendo Nintendo GameCube. The gameplay takes place in the Macross era, and features a storyline running exactly concurrent with that era's historical events. Multiplayer support is limited to one-on-one. Several of the voice actors from the original series, including Tony Oliver, Melanie MacQueen, Dan Woren, and Cam Clarke, reprised their original roles, or voiced new characters in this game. The game was a relative success, even though many fans complained of the over-cartoonified look of the game.
-   _Robotech: The Macross Saga_ (2002) for the Game Boy Advance, a side-scrolling shooter that resembles the Japanese Super Famicom game _Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie_.
-   _Robotech: Invasion_ (2004) for the Microsoft Xbox and the Sony PlayStation 2. First-/third-person shooter. The gameplay covers the _New Generation_ part of the story, with support for single player missions and multiplayer online matches. Features Cyclones, transformable body armor/motorcycles. As with _Battlecry_, several of the original voice actors reprised their roles. Unlike _Battlecry_, it is not backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.
-   _Robotech: The New Generation_ (2007) for mobile phones. A top-down scrolling shooter that covers the _New Generation_ part of the story, leading up to the _Shadow Chronicles_. The player can play as one of three characters (Scott, Rook and Rand), each with their own special weapons. The player also has the ability to change into "Battloid Mode" through the collection of Protoculture. _Robotech: The New Generation_ features famous music from the TV series, as well as the most evil of all the villains.


Reception of adaptation

_Robotech_ is often a polarizing subject amongst anime fans.[58][59] Some critics look down upon the show for its extensive edits to the source material (Westernizing character names, editing for content and chiefly, forging a connection between previously unrelated series),[60][61] while supporters of the adaptation have pointed out that the weaving of three unrelated series into a contiguous whole necessarily required reworking, and that it helped to maintain a slow but continuous rise in the consumption of anime in the US.[62][63][64]

Series writer/actor Gregory Snegoff said in an interview on the now-defunct _Shadow Chronicles News_ fansite that, "afterward, we received compliments from the Japanese who thought our dialogue and stories were better than the original," likely a reference to the creators of the latter two series, both of whom worked with the team on _The Sentinels_.[65] The producers of _Megazone 23 – Part 1_ were very happy with the original plans for _Robotech: The Movie_ (where the incomplete film would have been added to the _Robotech_ mythos to play part in _The Sentinels_ storyline), and worked closely with Carl Macek to plan the new ending and animation.[66] When the film reached a limited release, the new ending was released on a LaserDisc of _Megazone 23_, with the title "Present For You."[67] However, _Animag_ magazine (issue 11) and _Animerica_ magazine (issue 9, volume 4) reports that the staff of _Macross_ at Studio Nue and Artland, such as the original story creator and mecha designer Shōji Kawamori and chief director Noboru Ishiguro, expressed their concern over the _Robotech_ adaptation, and surprise at its differences.[68]

In 2009, _IGN_ ranked _Robotech_ as the 34th-greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.[69]
