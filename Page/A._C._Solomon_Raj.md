Spiritual studies

During the Bishopric of the Old Testament Scholar, the Cantabrigian Victor Premasagar, CSI, Solomon Raj was admitted as a ministerial candidate of the Diocese of Medak to discern his avocation towards priesthood and spent a year assisting Presbyters during 1987–1988 in the Diocese of Medak that was predominantly Wesleyan Methodist[17] with a couple of Anglican churches[18] in the urban pastorate.

James Carl,[25] SALC and other notable faculty, Solomon Raj was also benefited by the scholarship of the visiting faculty from the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate-Dharmaram College[26] and the St. Peter's Pontifical Seminary, also in Bangalore. Incidentally, the Homiletics Scholar The Rev. P.

D. S. Satyaranjan, IPC.


Ecclesiastical ministry

Bishopric

In 2012,[43] Bishop T. S. Kanaka Prasad, CSI had to relinquish[44] the _Cathedra_ as per an ecclesiastical communique from the Church of South India Synod in Chennai resulting in _sede vacante_ during which time the Medak Diocese was overseen from Chennai by the Church of South India Synod led by then Moderator and Systematic theologian, The Most Reverend G.

After nearly five years of ecclesiastical oversight of the Medak Diocese, the Church of South India Synod appointed A. C. Solomon Raj to shepherd the Diocese, consecrating him on Thursday, 13.10.2016[45] at the CSI-St. George's Cathedral, Chennai[46] where he was principally consecrated[47] by the Systematic theologian, G.

Oommen, then Deputy Moderator in the presence of other Bishops including The Right Reverend Sister Eggoni Pushpalalitha, CSI Order of Sisters, Bishop – in – Nandyal and The Right Reverend Daniel Thiagarajah, CSI Bishop – in – Jaffna.

The consecration of Solomon Raj in Chennai makes him the second Bishop from the Diocese of Medak after Frank Whittaker, CSI[49] to have been consecrated as Bishop at the St. George's Cathedral, Chennai and the third Bishop – in Medak after H. D. L. Abraham, CSI[50] to have been consecrated as Bishop at a Cathedral other than the Cathedral in Medak.
