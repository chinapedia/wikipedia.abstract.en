World War II

Colonel Underhill was transferred to the Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., where he was appointed executive officer of the Adjutant and Inspector's Department in July 1939. He served in this capacity until March 1942, when he was appointed commander of the Marine Corps Base San Diego, California. Underhill was also promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 28 March 1942.[2]

One year later, Brigadier General Underhill was transferred to the Command of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. When 4th Marine Division was activated in August 1943, Underhill was appointed division assistant commander. He subsequently supervised the training together with the division commander, Major General Harry Schmidt, before it was shipped out to the Pacific in January 1944.

Underhill commanded Preliminary Landing Group during the landing at Kwajalein Atoll. He landed with 25th Marine Regiment and coordinated the landings with artillery support. Underhill was succeeded in his capacity of assistant division commander by Samuel C. Cumming on 11 April 1944.

Underhill returned to the United States and was appointed president of the Postwar Personnel Reorganization Board at Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. in 1946.[5] This office was tasked with study of the records of all officers, who wanted to stay in the active service. Underhill was responsible for recommendations, who would stay in active service and who would not. He finally retired from the Marine Corps on November 1, 1946. Underhill was also advanced to the rank of lieutenant general for having been specially commended in combat.
