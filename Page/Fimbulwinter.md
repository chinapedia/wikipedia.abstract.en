In Norse mythology, _FIMBULVETR_ (or _fimbulvinter_), commonly rendered in English as FIMBULWINTER, is the immediate prelude to the events of Ragnarök. It means "great winter".


Summary

Fimbulwinter is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Then, there will be innumerable wars.

The event is described primarily in the _Poetic Edda_. In the poem _Vafþrúðnismál_, Odin poses the question to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter. Vafþrúðnir responds that Líf and Lífþrasir will survive and that they will live in the forest of Hoddmímis holt.

The mythology might be related to the extreme weather events of 535–536, which resulted in a notable drop in temperature across northern Europe. There have also been several popular ideas about whether or not the particular piece of mythology has a connection to the climate change that occurred in the Nordic countries at the end of the Nordic Bronze Age from about 650 BC. Before that climate change, the Nordic countries were considerably warmer.[1]

In Denmark, Norway, Sweden and other Nordic countries, the term _fimbulvinter_ is still used to refer to an unusually cold and harsh winter.[2]


Etymology

Fimbulvetr comes from Old Norse, meaning "awful, great winter". The prefix "fimbul" means "the great/big" so the correct interpretation of the word is "the great winter".[3]


In popular culture

In the 2008 MMORPG _Wizard101_, the Fimbulvetr was adapted to "Everwinter" for the 2011 Wintertusk expansion to Grizzleheim, a world heavily based on Nordic culture and mythology. In the game, players must stop the Coven from awaking Ymir and causing the end of the world.
