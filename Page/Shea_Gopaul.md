Publication

In early 2013, Shea Gopaul led and authored an International Labour Organization (ILO) feasibility study to gather information from businesses about their apprenticeship programs and to seek their views on how an international business network on apprenticeships could add value for them. In collaboration with the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) and members of the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Youth Unemployment, the feasibility study collected information from multi-stakeholders on country and company apprenticeship practices; and, explored the interest and eventual commitment of companies to join forces to promote apprenticeship through a Global Apprenticeships Network.[8] Shea Gopaul has coauthored several articles on apprenticeships,[9] jobs,[10] and other reskilling programs.[11] She has been a regular voice on youth training at Davos and other B20 programs.
