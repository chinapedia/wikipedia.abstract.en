Plot

Sister Angela (whose name before being a nun was Lorenza Rapetti) runs the bar "l'Angolo Divino", a particular bar inside a convent based in Modena. She decided to turn the convent into a Student Accommodation with bar because it risked the closing for a series of economic difficulties, even if her Mother Superior (Sister Costanza) didn't agree.

The bar acts as a meeting for people of varying kinds, especially students. Sister Angela speaks to them and learns about their daily life, often helping to solve their problems.

Season 1 is focused more on crime scenes, due to the helping of Inspector Marco Ferrari, while in Seasons 2, 3 and 4 Sister Angela helps people in hospital, due to the job of Margherita (Miriam Dalmazio), Carlo (Andrés Gil) and Monica (Diana del Bufalo). Even if they often don't approve Sister Angela's behaviour, the Mother Superior and the lawyer Guido Corsi always end up helping her in her adventures.
