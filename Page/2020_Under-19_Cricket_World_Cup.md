The 2020 ICC UNDER-19 CRICKET WORLD CUP is an upcoming international limited-overs cricket tournament scheduled to be held in South Africa from 17 January to 9 February 2020.[1][2] It will be the thirteenth edition of the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and the second to be held in South Africa.


Qualification

The top eleven full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) at the 2018 World Cup qualified automatically for the 2020 tournament; Ireland were the only full member to fail to qualify automatically.[3] They will be joined by the winners of the five regional qualification tournaments.[4] Fifty teams are taking part in the qualification pathway matches during 2018 and 2019.[5] The first qualification matches took place in the Europe Division 2 group, in Essex, England, on 31 July 2018.[6] The final round of qualification fixtures are scheduled to take place in the Netherlands in July and August 2019.[7]

Nigeria became the first team to win their regional qualification group, and qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time in their history.[8] Japan also qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time in their history.[9] Japan were scheduled to play Papua New Guinea in their final qualification fixture, but Papua New Guinea forfeited the match.[10] The Papua New Guinea Cricket Board later suspended ten of the players for a year, after bringing the game into disrepute following a shoplifting incident.[11][12]
