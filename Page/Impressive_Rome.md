_IMPRESSIVE ROME_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz and French pianist Martial Solal recorded in Italy in 1968 and released on the Campi label.[1][2]


Critical reception

Ken Dryden of Allmusic said "Lee Konitz's initial recording session with pianist Martial Solal produced two albums (the other one is _European Episode_), including alternate versions of several songs ... This was a great beginning to an occasional partnership that lasted into the early '80s and produced several more albums".[3]
