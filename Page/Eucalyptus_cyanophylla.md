_EUCALYPTUS CYANOPHYLLA_, commonly known as the MURRAYLANDS MALLEE, BLUE-LEAVED MALLEE[1] or GHOST MALLEE,[2] is a species of mallee that is endemic in southern Australia. It has mostly smooth bark, greyish blue, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus cyanophylla_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has pinkish brown or white to orange bark, often with rough, fibrous grey or reddish bark on the lower trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have thick, greyish blue, elliptic to broadly egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, the same dull bluish grey on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature flower buds are oblong, long and wide with a rounded or conical operculum. Flowering occurs between August and October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody conical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves close to rim level.[3][4][5][6][7]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus cyanophylla_ was first formally described in 1977 by Ian Brooker from a specimen collected near Berri by Bruce Copley.[8] The description was published in _Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia_.[9] The specific epithet (_cyanophylla_) is derived from the Ancient Greek words _kyanos_ meaning "dark blue"[10] and _phyllon_ meaning "leaf"[11] referring to the colour of the leaves.[12]


Distribution and habitat

Blue-leaved mallee grows in sandy soil, usually over limestone, in open shrubland. It is mainly found between Waikerie, Renmark and Alawoona in South Australia and in north-western Victoria.[13][14]
