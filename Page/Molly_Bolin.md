"MACHINE GUN" MOLLY BOLIN (born MONNA LEA VAN BENTHUYSEN November 13, 1957) is a retired American basketball player who mainly played for the Women's Professional Basketball League. Although her accomplishments for the most part went unrecognized, Bolin, who was the first player signed to play in the WBL, became a pioneering figure in women's basketball, both as a formidable scoring threat and as a sex symbol of the league. Among her accolades, Bolin holds the record for the most points scored in a single game by any professional women's basketball player (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8).


Biography

Bolin was born in Dryden, Ontario, but was raised in Moravia, Iowa, where she first began playing basketball for Moravia High School's Mohawks during her junior year.[1] In unconventional six-player half-court gameplay, Bolin averaged 50 points in her first year and 54.8 points in her senior year, while setting the school's single-game record for most points by one player (83). Among other early accolades, Bolin was selected to participate in tryouts for 1976 Summer Olympics' women's basketball team at 17 years-old and was voted an All-American in her senior year.[2][3]

In 1975, Bolin began attending Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa where she had to adjust to the conventional five-player style of play with the Vikings basketball team.[4] As she recollected, "College wasn't the same experience as high school and I had to learn the five-on-five full-court game pretty quickly. In fact, right out of high school in 1975, I got recruited to tryout for the '75 Pan American team and I couldn't even dribble full-court and make a basket".[5] Instead of playing her sophomore year, Bolin decided to sit out to marry Dennis Bolin and give birth to the couple's child, Damien, in 1977. When Bolin returned to the court in 1978, she set university scoring records, averaging 24.6 PPG, and graduated with an associate's degree in telecommunications.[6]

After her second year of eligibility, Bolin became the first player to sign to the newly-formed Women's Professional Basketball League, when she signed a one-year contract with the Iowa Cornets for $6,000. Honing in on her appearance as a blonde bombshell, Bolin was situated as the sex symbol of the league, appearing in several photo shoots, features in _Sports Illustrated_ and _SportsWorld_, and commercials with NBA players such as Larry Bird.[7][8] Nicknamed "Machine Gun" by a columnist of the _Washington Post_ for her prolific scoring ability, Bolin averaged 16.7 PPG, and helped advance the Cornets to the championship finals before they were defeated by the Houston Angels.[9] During the 1979-1980 season, Bolin set 12 WBL records, including most points scored in a single game (55) and the highest single-season scoring average (32.8), and was named co-MVP alongside Ann Meyers. Both of Bolin's scoring marks have yet to be matched by any professional women's basketball player. Despite posting a 36-point game, the Cornets were beaten again in the finals, this time losing to the New York Stars.[10][11]

With the WBL financially struggling, long road-trips, and low pay, Bolin agreed to join the Ladies Professional Basketball Association, a Southwestern-based league that was established to compete with the faltering WBL. However, after just seven games with the Southern California Breeze, the LPBA disbanded, and Bolin -- a high-list free agent sought after by all the eight remaining WBL teams -- negotiated a contract with the San Francisco Pioneers, whose coach, former NBA player Dean Meminger, was a crucial selling point for Bolin.[12] Under Meminger's mentorship, she finished the 1980-1981 season second in the league in scoring (26.8) and competed in her third All-Star game. The WBL's third season proved to be its last for the league was forced to dissolve under severe financial hardship.[13][14]

After the WBL folded, Bolin was engaged in a custody battle with her recently-divorced husband over their son, Damien. Initially, the court awarded her ex-spouse full custody, arguing that Bolin's profession and her glamour shoots made her an unfit parent; however, the decision was appealed and overturned in 1983.[15] In 1984, Bolin was selected for a USA All-Star team composed of former olympians and professional players to participate in exhibition games against the 1984 Summer Olympics women's team which eventually won the gold medal. Bolin played her last professional season in the same year, signing with the Columbus Minks of the short-lived Women's American Basketball Association. Even though Bolin's basketball career was over, she continued to promote the concept of a new women's basketball league, and was hired by _Fox Sports_ in 1995 to create a women's tournament for television.[16]

Shortly after Bolin's contributions, the NBA announced its intent to establish the Women's National Basketball Association. Other post-basketball accolades include her induction in the Iowa High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986, and the Grandview College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. Bolin remarried to John Kazmer in 1989, and they currently reside in La Quinta, California with their two children.[17]
