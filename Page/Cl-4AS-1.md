CL-4AS-1 is a dual anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and 5α-reductase inhibitor.[1][2] It is a potent and selective full agonist of the androgen receptor (IC₅₀ = 12 nM) and inhibitor of 5α-reductase types I and II (IC₅₀ = 6 and 10 nM, respectively).[3][4] Structurally, Cl-4AS-1 is a 4-azasteroid.[5]
