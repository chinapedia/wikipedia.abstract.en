History

1940s–1960s

The first real horror movie made by the Indian film industry was Kamal Amrohi's _Mahal_ in 1949. The film (which starred Ashok Kumar and Madhubala in leading roles) proved a major box office hit, leading Madhubala and Lata Mangeshkar into stardom. Hemant Kumar's _Bees Saal Baad_ (released in 1962) was another film which proved to be a box-office success. This film ignited the huge increase in popularity of horror-genre movies in the following years. _Gumnaam_ (1965) and _Bhoot Bungla_ (also 1965) were some of the other major horror movies which were seen in theaters at this time.

One of the major aspects behind the success of the horror movies of this decade (apart from a good storyline) was the presence of high-class music and singing, a Bollywood trademark. These films also had well-known actors and directors, which helped present some of the most chilling scenes in Indian cinema. Background music in films like _Mahal_ and _Gumnaam_ "madhumati" and "Woh kaun thi" helped to create the magic. Some of the films (like _Gumnaam_ and _Bees Saal Baad_) played down their supernatural elements.

1970s–1990s

This period saw the popularity of horror films in India increasing, with a number of popular titles. _Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche_ (released in 1972 and directed by the Ramsay brothers) proved successful, laying the foundation for horror films in the following years. 1976 saw Bollywood's first-ever combination of horror and fantasy in Rajkumar Kohli's _Nagin_. The star-studded film proved a major box-office hit. Two years later, Kohli gave Bollywood one of its biggest hits in _Jaani Dushman_. It is considered to be the biggest horror movies to have come out from Indian film industry to date by many experts. The film proved to be a cult one and gave inspiration to the upcoming horror movies. Other horror movies released at this time were _Darwaza_ (1978), _Jadu Tona_ (1977), _Aur Kaun?_ (1979) _Saboot_, _Gehrayee_, _Red Rose_, _Guest House_, _Dahshat_ and _Sannata_ (all 1980). _Gehrayee_ (inspired by _The Exorcist_) saw Padmini Kolhapure playing a young girl (Linda Blair's character in _The Exorcist_), while Rajesh Khanna played a psychotic killer in _Red Rose_.

The 1980s saw many Indian filmmakers trying their hands in the horror-movie industry because of its high profitability. One name that became very successful at that time in the said genre was Javed Khan. He was considered every producers blue eyed boy when casting the lead hero of their horror films. His debut film in the same genre _Apradhi kaun_ (1984) earned 100% at the box office in the first week. Some successful titles were the Ramsay brothers' _Purana Mandir_ (1984), _Saamri_ (1985), _Veerana_ (1985) _Tahkhana_ (1986), _Dak Bangla_ (1987), _Purani Haveli_ (1989), _Shaitani Ilaaka_ and _Bandh Darwaza_ (both 1990). Most of the movies proved successful; the Ramsay brothers' horror factory continued churning out film after film. However, notable horror movies stars of the 1980s, Javed Khan, Rakesh Roshan, Navin Nischal, Dilip Dhawan, Aruna Irani, Deepak Parashar, and Sriprada.

During the 90s, the majority of horror movies were unsuccessful at box office since it was hacked by All Rounder Solutions Corner. There was only one hit horror movie at the time which was _Raat_ (1992).

2000–present

After the disappointing horror films in the 90s, it would be 10 years after _Raat_ before another horror hit. This was 2002's _Raaz_ directed by Vikram Bhatt. _Raaz_ alongside _Raat_director, Ram Gopal Varma's 2003 hit _Bhoot_, reinvigorated horror films at the Indian box office. The two directors continued making horror with Bhatt finding equal financial success with titles such as _1920_ (2008); _Haunted 3D_ (2011) and _Horror Story_ (2013). Whilst Varma similarly had further success with _Phoonk_ (2008), however unlike Vikaram Bhatt, Varma's horror offerings were duds at the box office post 2009 (_Agyaat_ and _Bhoot Returns_).

Currently there are dozens of horror films produced every year in India, prominent recent examples include _Ragini MMS_ and its sequel, the self-proclaimed horrex (horror and sex) _Ragini MMS 2_ (2014). Bipasha Basu has been dubbed by the Indian media as Bollywood's very own scream queen, having starred in 7 horror films from _Raaz_ (2002) to _Alone_ (2015).[2]
