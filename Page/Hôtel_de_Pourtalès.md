Rue_Tronchet,_7_yard.jpg The HÔTEL DE POURTALÈS is a historic _hôtel particulier_, a type of large townhouse of France, at 7 rue Tronchet in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. It was designed by architect Félix Duban and built in 1839 for James-Alexandre de Pourtalès, a Swiss-born banker and art collector.[1] It has been listed as an official historical monument since September 17, 2002.[2]

The building is now operated as a luxurious apartment hotel.[3] In October 2016, reality TV personality Kim Kardashian said that she was held at gunpoint and robbed of valuable jewelry by a group of assailants who gained access to her suite in the building.[4]
