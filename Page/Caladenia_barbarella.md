_CALADENIA BARBARELLA_, commonly known as the SMALL DRAGON ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single broad, hairy leaf held close to the ground and a single greenish-yellow and red flower. It is only known from a small area near the Murchison River.


Description

_Caladenia barbarella_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single ground-hugging, broad, hairy leaf long and wide. The single flower is borne on a stem tall and is greenish-yellow with red stripes and wide and long. The lateral sepals and petals are short and hang downwards. The labellum is densely hairy and has a large dark red gland at its highest point. It also has many long purple hairs that are thought to attract pollinators. Flowering occurs in late August and September.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia barbarella_ was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected in the Cooloomia Nature Reserve near the Murchison river and the description was published in Nuytsia.[4] The specific epithet (_barbarella_) is a diminutive form of the Latin word _barba_ meaning "a small beard",[5] but also alludes to a comparison of the sexual deception of this orchid to its male insect pollinators, and the French comic-book character Barbarella.[6]


Distribution and habitat

Small dragon orchid is known from fourteen populations east and north-east of Kalbarri in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region[7] where it grows under low shrubs in areas that are inundated in winter.[8][9]


Conservation

_Caladenia barbarella_ is classified as "Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora â€” Extant)" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife[10] and it has also been listed as "Endangered" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).[11]
