MARIA SUSANNA (also SUSANNE) KÜBLER (1814–1873) was a Swiss writer who is remembered for her housekeeping guides and cookbooks, especially the popular _Das Hauswesen_ (Housekeeping, 1850) which also contained recipes.[1][2]


Biography

Born on 27 February 1814 in Winterthur, Maria Kübler was the daughter of the teacher Jakob Kübler and the sister of Jakob Kübler (1827–1899), who from 1851 was a clergyman in Neftenbach. In 1834, she married the merchant Jakob Heinrich Haggenmacher. Following their divorce, in 1845 she married Johannes Scherr, a German-born writer, schoolteacher, college professor and political activist.[3]

Kübler studied English, French and Italian at Yverdon in French-speaking Switzerland. In 1845, she moved to Stuttgart, Germany, with her second husband but returned to Switzerland in 1849 after he ran into political difficulties.[4] Kübler returned to Winterthur in 1852 and from 1860 lived in Zürich. She worked as a translator, language teacher and writer of household guides and cookbooks.[5]
