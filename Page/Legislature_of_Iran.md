The LEGISLATURE () of Islamic Republic of Iran consists of two components, a unicameral[1] parliamentary chamber called Islamic Consultative Assembly and a reviewing power, the Guardian Council of the Constitution.[2]

According to the article 93 of Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Parliament generally has no legal status without the simultaneous existence of the Council. As a consequence, existence of the Council is a precondition for the efficiency of the legislative power as all bills passed by the Parliament have to be summitted to the Council in order to enact.[3] The council has the authority to veto the bill if it finds it incompatible with _sharia_ and the constitution.[4]

In case that the Parliament and the Council dispute over a blocked bill and refuse to accept positions by each other, the bill is submitted to the Expediency Discernment Council of the System, set up to resolve the conflicts.[5]
