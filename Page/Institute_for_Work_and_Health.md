The INSTITUTE FOR WORK & HEALTH (IWH) is an independent, not-for-profit research organization based in Toronto, Canada. Its mission is to “promote, protect and improve the safety and health of working people by conducting actionable research that is valued by employers, workers, and policy-makers.”[1]


Operations

Since 2013, IWH has operated with core funding from the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Labour (Ontario). For the 22 years previous to that, since its founding in 1990, the core funder was Ontario’s Workplace Safety and Insurance Board and its predecessors. The institute maintains an arm’s-length relationship with its core funder.[2] Institute scientists also apply for and receive grants from peer-reviewed funding agencies in Canada, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. IWH’s board of directors includes senior business, labour and academic representatives.[3] A scientific advisory committee provides guidance on IWH research activities.[4] IWH has formal affiliations with four universities in Ontario, Canada: University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, McMaster University and York University. The institute has access to data sources from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board and Statistics Canada. IWH is part of the health and safety system in Ontario.[5]


Research

IWH research falls into two broad areas:

-   the prevention of work-related injury and illness (primary prevention), which includes studies of programs, policies and practices, and the health of workers in the population at large; and
-   the health and recovery of injured workers (secondary prevention), which involves research on treatment, return to work, disability prevention and management, and compensation policy.

IWH research focuses on these topics:

-   work-related musculoskeletal disorders
-   occupational health and safety practices
-   vulnerable workers (such as newcomers, young workers, temporary workers)
-   regulations and incentives
-   working conditions and health
-   return-to-work practices
-   clinical treatment
-   compensation and benefits
-   measurement of health and function.

IWH also conducts systematic reviews of occupational health and safety research. Systematic reviews provide an overview of the evidence from higher quality studies on a specific research question.[6] Cochrane Back and Neck (formerly known as the Cochrane Back Review Group) is based at IWH and conducts systematic reviews of clinical research on back and neck pain.
