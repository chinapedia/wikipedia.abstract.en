The New Zealand cricket team toured Australia from early December 1913 to late January 1914, playing four first-class matches against state teams and five other matches.


The team

Three of New Zealand’s leading batsmen, David Collins, Harold Lusk and Arthur Sims, were unavailable.[1] The provincial cricket associations were asked to submit the names of suitable players from their regions. Out of 40 players nominated, 14 were eventually chosen.[2]
