_SUNLESS SKIES_ is a role-playing video game developed by Failbetter Games. The game is a sequel to 2015's _Sunless Sea_.


Gameplay

_Sunless Skies_ is an exploration and narrative focused role-playing video game. The game is played from a top-down perspective.[1]


Synopsis

_Sunless Skies_ is set in the same Victorian era-inspired world as _Fallen London_ and _Sunless Sea_.[2] The game is set ten years after the events of _Sunless Sea_.[3] The player assumes the role of a captain of interplanetary locomotive.[4]


Development

The game was announced at the 2016 EGX expo.[5] In February 2017, the studio launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to raise funds for the game's development.[6] Failbetter estimated the total cost of the game's development to be £330,000.[7] They set a funding goal of £100,000, which was achieved four hours into the thirty day campaign.[8][9] The game is being built on the Unity game engine and Failbetter's own narrative platform StoryNexus.[10] The development team plan to release an in-development version of the game in 2017 using an early access model.[11]

Failbetter CEO Paul Arendt noted that they didn't want a sequel to just be _Sunless Sea 2_ with bigger ships.[12] Taking the Victorian setting into space appealed to them.[13] The development team cited the science fiction and planetary romance works of authors C. S. Lewis, H. G. Wells, and Leigh Brackett as influences along with Art Nouveau and the 1999 game _Planescape: Torment_.[14]


Release

The game was scheduled to be released in May 2018,[15] for Linux, macOS, Windows-based personal computers.[16] The game was first delayed to September 2018,[17] but was released on 31 January 2019.[18]


Accolades

While in development, the game was nominated for "Writing or Narrative Design" at the 2018 Develop Awards.[19] After release, it was nominated for "Best Narrative", "Best Original IP", and "Game of the Year" at the Develop:Star Awards.[20]
