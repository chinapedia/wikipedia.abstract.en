OGDEN GOELET (June 11, 1851 New York City – August 27, 1897 Cowes, Isle of Wight) was an American heir, businessman and yachtsman from New York City during the Gilded Age. With his wife, he built Ochre Court in Newport, Rhode Island, his son built Glenmere mansion, and his daughter, Mary Goelet, married Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe.


Early life

Ogden Goelet was born on September 29, 1851 in Manhattan, New York City to Sarah Ogden (1809–1888) and Robert Goelet (1809–1879).[1] His father was a prominent landlord in New York City, as was his uncle, Peter Goelet, who was named after Peter Goelet, Ogden's great-grandfather. His parents resided at 5 State Street, overlooking the Battery in Manhattan.[2]

Goelet's older brother was real estate developer Robert Goelet, and his nephew was Robert Walton Goelet.[3] His paternal aunt, Hannah Green Goelet, was married to Thomas Russell Gerry, a son of U.S. Vice President Elbridge Gerry. Through this marriage, Goelet was a first cousin of Elbridge Thomas Gerry.[4]

Society life

In 1892, Goelet and his wife Mary were included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in _The New York Times_.[8][9] Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.[10] Mary was known as one of the viceregal leaders of the Ultra-fashionable 150, among Mrs. Astor, Mrs. Ogden Mills, Mrs. John Jacob Astor, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.[11]

Yachting

After Goelet's death the yacht was sold to the US Navy and became the famous USS Mayflower (PY-1).[15] Goelet's brother, Robert, had an almost identical yacht built at the same time and in the same yard and this later became USS Nahma (SP-771).[16]

Residences

Goelet and his wife owned a townhouse at 608 Fifth Avenue in New York City and a villa in Nice, France. When in London, they resided at Wimbourne House.[17]

In 1892, he and his wife commissioned Ochre Court, a châteauesque mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. The home was built at a cost of $4.5 million and was the second largest mansion in Newport after nearby The Breakers, both designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt.[18]


Personal life

In 1878, he married Mary Rita Wilson (1855–1929), daughter of Richard Thornton Wilson Sr. and Melissa Clementine Johnston. Her siblings included the banker Richard Thornton Wilson Jr. and socialite Grace Graham Wilson, who was married to Cornelius Vanderbilt III.[19] Together, they were the parents of two children:[20]

-   Robert Wilson Goelet (1880–1966), who built Glenmere mansion.[23]

He was a member of the New York Yacht Club for 17 years, as well as the Knickerbocker Club, Metropolitan Club, and Union Club.[24]

On August 27, 1897, after over five years spent abroad, Goelet died aboard his yacht in the town of Cowes in the Isle of Wight after having been ill for two months. He had been attended to by William Broadbent, doctor to the Prince of Wales, with whom he was close friends.[25] His family and body sailed back to the United States[26] and his funeral was held aboard his yacht in Newport and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York).[27][28] In his will, he left his entire estate to his wife and two children.[29] His widow died in 1929.[30]
