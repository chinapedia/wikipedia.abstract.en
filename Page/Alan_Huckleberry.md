ALAN TRINLER HUCKLEBERRY (born February 18, 1941) is an American mathematician who works in complex analysis, Lie groups actions and algebraic geometry. He is currently (since 2009) Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Ruhr University Bochum and Wisdom Professor of Mathematics at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany.


Professional career

He received his B.S. from Yale University in 1963 and his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1969 working under Halsey Royden. His Ph.D. thesis was titled: Holomorphic Mappings and algebras of holomorphic functions of several complex variables. He has previously taught at University of Notre Dame before joining Ruhr University Bochum in 1980.

Huckleberry has honorary doctor’s degrees from University of Lile (France) in 1997, and from University of Nancy (France) in 2002.

In addition to pure mathematics, he also works in applications of symplectic geometry in quantum entanglement and in other problems of mathematical physics.
