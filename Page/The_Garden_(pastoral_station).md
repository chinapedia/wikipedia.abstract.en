THE GARDEN is a property located north east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is run by Andy Hayes. The Hayes' run both Hereford and Droughtmaster cattle on the property.[1][2][3]

In the 1940s a large poll shorthorn cattle herd was kept on the station.[4][5][6]

The Trephina Gorge Nature Park,[7] which includes the popular tourist attractions Trephina Gorge[8] and John Hayes Waterhole were formerly part of The Garden. The park was protected from 1965 and was then handed back to the Aboriginal traditional owners on 12 June 2009.[9]

Quad-biking tours currently operate on the station.[10]
