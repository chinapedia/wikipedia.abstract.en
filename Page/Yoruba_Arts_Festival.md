The Yoruba Arts festival was created in 2009 as an annual festival to celebrate the rich, vibrant and colorful arts and culture of the Yoruba's in London UK. It held its first event in 2010 in Clissold Park Hackney London where it has been resident since its inception.

The Yoruba's are a people predominantly from Western Nigeria who over time migrated to other parts of West Africa to Togo, Benin, Ghana, Senegal, Mali and Sierra-Leone and Liberia. They are also the largest group of people taken during the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade holocaust to the West Indies and Latin America where their culture, traditions and belief systems have stood the test of time and are still being practiced. The Yoruba IFA/Orisa belief system created the foundation for new age religions such as Santeria, Umbanda and Lucumi. As a global culture the Yorubas remain linked around the world through language, history, art, music and the belief and practice of IFA/ Orisa.

In the UK the Yoruba's are the largest group of people from outside Nigeria and Africa who have made important contributions in their communities and local governments in education, sports, medicine, business, religion, media, politics and charitable causes.
