The LOST TREE (), also known as the ARBRE THIERRY SABINE, is a remote tree in the Ténéré region of the Sahara desert in northeast Niger.

The tree is an acacia, lying on a small mound on a promontory. Despite its small size, due to its remoteness, the tree is an important landmark.[1][2]

Thierry Sabine, founder of the Dakar Rally (run in Africa from 1979–2007), died in a helicopter crash in the vicinity of the tree. His ashes were spread around the Lost Tree, which thereafter was described on maps printed for the rally as the "Arbre Thierry Sabine". A plaque next to the tree is dedicated to his memory, reading "For those who go a challenge – for those who stay a dream".[3]
