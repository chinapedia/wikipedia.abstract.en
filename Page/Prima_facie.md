_PRIMA FACIE_ (; ) is a Latin expression meaning _on its first encounter_ or _at first sight_.[1] The literal translation would be "at first face" or "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of _primus_ ("first") and _facies_ ("face"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be "on the face of it". The term _prima facie_ is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, _prima facie_ denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a _prima facie_ case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.[2]


Burden of proof

In most legal proceedings, one party has a burden of proof, which requires it to present _prima facie_ evidence for all of the essential facts in its case. If it cannot, its claim may be dismissed without any need for a response by other parties.[3] A _prima facie_ case might not stand or fall on its own; if an opposing party introduces other evidence or asserts an affirmative defense it can only be reconciled with a full trial. Sometimes the introduction of _prima facie_ evidence is informally called _making a case_ or _building a case_.

For example, in a trial under criminal law the prosecution has the burden of presenting _prima facie_ evidence of each element of the crime charged against the defendant. In a murder case, this would include evidence that the victim was in fact dead, that the defendant's act caused the death, and evidence that the defendant acted with malice aforethought. If no party introduces new evidence, the case stands or falls just by the _prima facie_ evidence or lack thereof, respectively.

_Prima facie_ evidence does not need to be conclusive or irrefutable: at this stage, evidence rebutting the case is not considered, only whether any party's case has enough merit to take it to a full trial.

In common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the prosecution in a criminal trial must disclose all evidence to the defense. This includes the _prima facie_ evidence.

An aim of the doctrine of _prima facie_ is to prevent litigants from bringing spurious charges which simply waste all other parties' time.


_Res ipsa loquitur_

_Prima facie_ is often confused with _res ipsa loquitur_ ("the thing speaks for itself", or literally "the thing itself speaks"), the common law doctrine that when the facts make it self-evident that negligence or other responsibility lies with a party, it is not necessary to provide extraneous details, since any reasonable person would immediately find the facts of the case.

The difference between the two is that _prima facie_ is a term meaning there is enough evidence for there to be a case to answer, while _Res ipsa loquitur_ means that the facts are so obvious a party does not need to explain any more. For example: "There is a _prima facie_ case that the defendant is liable. They controlled the pump. The pump was left on and flooded the plaintiff's house. The plaintiff was away and had left the house in the control of the defendant. _Res ipsa loquitur_."

This doctrine has been subsumed by general negligence law in Canadian tort law.


Use in academic philosophy

The phrase is also used in academic philosophy. Among its most notable uses is in the theory of ethics first proposed by W. D. Ross, often called the _Ethic of Prima Facie Duties_, as well as in epistemology, as used, for example, by Robert Audi. It is generally used in reference to an obligation. "I have a _prima facie_ obligation to keep my promise and meet my friend" means that I am under an obligation, but this may yield to a more pressing duty. A more modern usage prefers the title _pro tanto obligation_: an obligation that may be later overruled by another more pressing one; it exists only _pro tempore_.

In policy debate theory, _prima facie_ is used to describe the mandates or planks of an affirmative case, or, in some rare cases, a negative counterplan. When the negative team appeals to _prima facie_, it appeals to the fact that the affirmative team cannot add or amend anything in its plan after being stated in the first affirmative constructive.

A common usage of the phrase is the concept of a "_prima facie_ speed limit", which has been used in Australia and the United States. A _prima facie_ speed limit is a default speed limit that applies when no other specific speed limit is posted, and may be exceeded by a driver. However, if the driver is detected, and cited by police for exceeding the limit, the onus of proof is on the driver, to show that the speed at which the driver was travelling was safe under the circumstances. In most jurisdictions, this type of speed limit has been replaced by absolute speed limits.
