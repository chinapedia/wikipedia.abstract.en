ALL-INDIA JUDICIAL SERVICE is a proposed judicial service in India.[1][2]


History

The proposal for an All-India Judicial Service was first suggested in the Chief Justices' Conference in 1961 as a way to remove any scope for judicial or executive intervention in the appointments to the judiciary in the High Courts and the Supreme Court in India. The idea had to be shelved after some states and High Courts opposed it.[3]

The Constitution was amended in 1976 to provide for an AIJS under Article 312. The proposal was again floated by the ruling UPA government in 2012 but the draft bill was shelved again after opposition from High Court Chief Justices who labeled this an infringement of their rights.
