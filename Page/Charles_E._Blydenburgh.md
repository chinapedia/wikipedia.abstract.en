CHARLES EDWARD BLYDENBURGH (March 19, 1854â€“April 17, 1921) was an American judge who served as a Justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court from November 1, 1917 to April 17, 1921.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, "a descendant of one of the old New York families",[1] Blydenburgh attended private schools in Brooklyn, Connecticut, and Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and then entered Princeton University, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1874 and a Master of Arts in 1877.[2] He received a degree in engineering from Columbia University in 1878, and moved to Wyoming as a mining engineer.[3][4]

Blydenburgh opened an office in Rawlins, Wyoming, where he remained until 1880, after which he went into the cattle business with his brother near Saratoga, Wyoming. He read law in the office of one of the pioneer attorneys of Rawlins and was admitted to practice early in the year of 1888.[5] The following year, the firm of McMicken & Blydenburgh was established, which would remain in operation for the next 28 years.[6] During this time, he served as a school board member, a county superintendent of schools, a city attorney, a city councilman, and a member of the Wyoming Territorial Legislature. He was also an active member of the Democratic Party.[7][8]

On November 1, 1917, Governor Frank L. Houx appointed Blydenburgh to a seat on the Wyoming Supreme Court vacated by the death of Richard H. Scott. Blydenburgh took the oath of office as justice on November 11, 1917, and in 1918 he was elected for the remainder of the unexpired term for which he had been appointed.

He died before the end of that term, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[9][10] The first session of the court following his death was on April 19, 1921, at which time the Chief Justice announced Blydenburgh's death.[11]


Personal life

Blydenburgh married Illinois native Isabelle Cannon on June 21, 1894, in Rawlins, with whom he had seven children, of whom one died in infancy.[12]
