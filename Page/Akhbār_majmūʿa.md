The _AKHBĀR MAJMŪʿA FĪ FATḤ AL-ANDALUS_ ("Collection of Anecdotes on the Conquest of al-Andalus") is an anonymous history of al-Andalus compiled in the second decade of the 11th century and only preserved in a single manuscript, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Parts of it date to the 8th and 9th centuries,[1] and it is the earliest Arabic history of al-Andalus, covering the period from the Arab conquest (711) until the reign of the Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III (929–61).[2] The _Akhbār majmūʿa_ is sometimes called the "Anonymous of Paris", after the home of its manuscript, or the "Anonymous of Córdoba", after its presumed place of origin.[3]

The _Akhbār majmūʿa_ records how, during the Abbasid Revolution, an army of ten thousand under a certain Balj marched to al-Andalus to support the Umayyad emir Abd ar-Rahman I. The story appears to be borrowed from the _Anabasis_ of Xenophon. Likewise, the anonymous compiler borrows elements, such as Roderic's alleged kidnapping of the daughter of Count Julian, from other classical sources, namely the _Aeneid_ and the _Iliad_.[4] Besides these literary embellishments, the _Akhbār majmūʿa_ is generally free of legend.[5] The Spanish historian Ramón Menéndez Pidal argued that since the anonymous author was clearly aiming for historical accuracy, he should be generally trusted, even on the doubtful episode of Count Julian's daughter.[6] The _Akhbār majmūʿa_ makes no mention of Jews in connection with the Arab conquest.[7]
