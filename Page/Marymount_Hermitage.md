History

The Marymount Hermitage was dedicated by Bishop Sylvester William Treinen in 1984.[1] It has ten buildings.[2] Initially, there were six buildings: a chapel, a library, a common room and three hermitage buildings.[3] In 1987, three more hermitage buildings and a bell tower were built.[4] By 1994, a new chapel was built.[5]

The hermitage welcomes guests on retreats.[6][7]
