EMERSON FIELD is a former World War I military airfield, located at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. It operated as a training field for the Air Service, United States Army from 1918, and was established in connection with the field artillery brigade firing center at Camp Jackson.[1] The airfield was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established starting in 1917 after the United States entry into World War I.[2]


History

Camp Jackson was established in 1917. The flying field was constructed from 18 July 1918,[3] and was soon named for 2d. Lt. William K. B. Emerson, (9 April 1894 - 14 May 1918) of the Allied Expeditionary Force, 12th Aero Squadron, American Field Artillery, who was killed in action at Bonconville, France.[4][5][6][7] A New York City native, Emerson was a 1916 undergraduate of Harvard University and went overseas in the American Ambulance Service.[8][9]
