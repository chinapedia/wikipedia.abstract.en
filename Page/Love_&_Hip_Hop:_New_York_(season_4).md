The fourth season of the reality television series _Love & Hip Hop: New York_ aired on VH1 from October 28, 2013 until February 10, 2014. The show was primarily filmed in New York City, New York. It was executively produced by Mona Scott-Young for Monami Entertainment, Toby Barraud and Stefan Springman for Eastern TV, and Shelly Tatro, Brad Abramson and Danielle Gelfand for VH1.

The series chronicles the lives of several women and men in the New York area, involved in hip hop music. It consists of 14 episodes, including a two-part reunion special hosted by Mo'Nique.


Production

On October 10, 2013, VH1 announced _Love & Hip Hop_ would be returning for a fourth season on October 28, 2013. The season would premiere back to back with the second season of the spin-off series _Chrissy & Mr. Jones_.[1] The season was preceded by _40 Greatest Love & Hip Hop Moments_, a 2 hour clip show hosted by Mona Scott-Young. The special aired on October 24, 2013, and showcased the franchise's most "shocking, scandalous and dramatic _Love & Hip Hop_ moments", featuring clips from the show's first three seasons, as well as the first two seasons of its spin-off _Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta_.[2]

The cast was once again retooled, with only Yandy Smith, Erica Mena and Tahiry Jose returning from last season's main cast. They were joined by Peter Gunz' girlfriend Tara Wallace, Amina Buddafly, Saigon's baby mama Erica Jean and former _Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta_ cast member K. Michelle. Peter Gunz joined the supporting cast, along with stripper Nya Lee, Saigon and Erica's girlfriend Cyn Santana. Former main cast member Rashidah Ali appeared as a guest star in several episodes.

The season's ratings improved significantly from last season's lackluster efforts, up 54% over last season's average and attracting an average of 3 million total viewers per episode.[3]

The season was released on DVD on region 1 on January 25, 2015.[4]

K. Michelle's purpose on the show was mainly served to set up her own spin-off series, as such, she appeared in infrequently and barely interacted with the rest of the cast. Her future co-stars on the show, Paris Phillips and Tracie Renee, appeared as guest stars. On October 15, 2014, VH1 officially announced _K. Michelle: My Life_, which premiered on November 3, 2014.[5]
