SAMUEL M. RAIMI[1] (born October 23, 1959) is an American filmmaker, actor, and producer, primarily known for creating cult horror _Evil Dead_ series, and directing the _Spider-Man_ trilogy (2002–07). He also directed the 1990 superhero film _Darkman_, the 1998 neo-noir crime-thriller _A Simple Plan_, the 2000 supernatural thriller film _The Gift_, the 2009 supernatural horror film _Drag Me to Hell_, and the 2013 Disney fantasy film _Oz the Great and Powerful_. Raimi has also produced several successful television series, including _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ and its spin-off _Xena: Warrior Princess_. He founded the production company Renaissance Pictures in 1979.


Early life

Raimi was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to a Conservative Jewish family. His ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Hungary.[2][3][4] He is the older brother of actor Ted Raimi and the younger brother of screenwriter Ivan Raimi. His sister is Andrea Raimi Rubin.[5] Another older brother, Sander Raimi, died at 15 in an accidental drowning; Sam Raimi has said that the trauma knitted the remaining family closer together and "colour[ed] everything [he's done] for the rest of [his] life."[6]

The fourth of five children born to Celia Barbara (née Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi, Raimi grew up in Franklin, Michigan.[7][8] He graduated from Groves High School[9] and later went on to attend Michigan State University, where he majored in English but left after three semesters to film _The Evil Dead_.[10]


Film

Raimi became fascinated with making films when his father brought a movie camera home one day. He began to make Super 8 movies with his friend Bruce Campbell, whom he met in 1975. In college, he teamed up with his brother's roommate Robert Tapert and Campbell to shoot _Within the Woods_ (1978), a 32-minute horror film which raised $375,000, as well as his debut feature film _It's Murder!_. During that time, he also shot the 7-minute short film _Clockwork_ (1978), starring Scott Spiegel, who had appeared in _Within the Woods_, and Cheryl Guttridge.[11][12] Through family, friends, and a network of investors, Raimi was able to finance production of the highly successful horror film _The Evil Dead_ (1981) which became a cult hit and effectively launched Raimi's career.

He began work on his third film _Crimewave_ (1985), which he co-wrote with the then-unknown Coen brothers, shortly after. Intended as a live-action comic book, the film was not successful, due in part to unwanted studio intervention. Raimi then returned to the horror genre with the seminal _Evil Dead II_ (which added slapstick humor to the over the top horror, showcasing his love of the Three Stooges). With his brother Ivan Raimi (and crediting himself as Celia Abrams), Sam Raimi also wrote _Easy Wheels_ (1989), a parody of the Outlaw biker film genre. A long-time comic book buff, he then attempted to adapt "The Shadow" into a movie, but was unable to secure the rights, so he created his own super-hero, _Darkman_ (1990). The film was his first major studio picture, and while it was only moderately successful, it spawned two sequels. Through it he was still able to secure funding for _Evil Dead III_, which was retitled _Army of Darkness_ and turned away almost totally from horror in favor of fantasy and comedy elements. _Army of Darkness_, the final movie in the _Evil Dead_ trilogy, was a box office disappointment, yet on video became a cult classic.

In the 1990s, Raimi moved into other genres, directing such films as the western _The Quick and the Dead_ (starring Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman), the critically acclaimed crime thriller _A Simple Plan_ (1998) (starring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton), and the romantic drama _For Love of the Game_ (1999) (starring Kevin Costner).

Raimi achieved great critical and commercial success with the blockbuster _Spider-Man_ (2002), which was adapted from the comic book series of the same name. The movie has grossed over US$800 million worldwide, spawning two sequels: _Spider-Man 2_ and _Spider-Man 3_, both directed by Raimi and each grossing approximately $800 million. After the completion of the third _Spider-Man_ film, he planned on producing two more sequels (although Sony Pictures planned three sequels) but could not find a satisfactory script.

Raimi frequently collaborates with Joel and Ethan Coen, beginning when Joel was one of the editors of _Evil Dead_. The Coens co-wrote _Crimewave_ and _The Hudsucker Proxy_ with Raimi in the mid-1980s (though _Hudsucker_ was not produced for almost a decade). Raimi made cameo appearances in _Miller's Crossing_, _The Hudsucker Proxy_, and with Joel Coen in _Spies Like Us_. The Coen brothers gave Raimi advice on shooting in snow for _A Simple Plan_, based on their experiences with _Fargo_.

He worked in front of the camera in _The Stand_ as a dimwitted hitman, John Carpenter's _Body Bags_ as a gas station attendant, and _Indian Summer_ in what is perhaps his biggest role as a bumbling assistant to Alan Arkin. The film was written by his childhood friend writer-director Mike Binder and shot at the camp that they both attended when they were younger. Raimi also produced the entire _The Grudge_ franchise.

According to _Entertainment Weekly_, Raimi had expressed an interest in directing a film version of _The Hobbit_, the prequel to the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy.[13] In 2008, Guillermo del Toro was selected as the director, with Peter Jackson as the executive producer. Raimi may direct _By Any Means Necessary_, the next film based on the "Jack Ryan" CIA character created by Tom Clancy for Paramount Pictures. Disney also approached him to direct _W.I.T.C.H.: The Movie_, based on the popular comic.

Blizzard Entertainment announced on July 22, 2009 that Sam Raimi will be directing a _Warcraft_ film.[14] However at Comic-Con International 2012, it was revealed that he would not be the one directing the _World of Warcraft_ adaptation.[15]

On September 23, 2009, he became the producer for the British supernatural thriller _Refuge_, which is directed by Corin Hardy and published by Mandate Pictures.[16] He will produce the remake of the Danish thriller _The Substitute_, which will be directed by Scott Dickerson under his new label Spooky Pictures.[17] Raimi produced with his company Ghost House Pictures the British thriller flick _Burst 3D_, which is directed by Neil Marshall.[18]

Raimi directed _Oz the Great and Powerful_, which was released on March 8, 2013 by Walt Disney Pictures.[19][20] He said he would not be directing the planned sequel.[21][22]

On December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new film version of _The Shadow_ for Columbia Pictures. On October 16, 2007, Raimi stated that: "I don't have any news on 'The Shadow' at this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we've got the rights to 'The Shadow.' I love the character very much and we're trying to work on a story that'll do justice to the character."[23]

Raimi, along with Bruce Campbell and Rob Tapert, produced the remake of Raimi's _The Evil Dead_. First-time feature filmmaker Fede Alvarez wrote and directed, and Diablo Cody was also brought in to revise/rewrite the script.[24] Raimi confirmed plans to write _Evil Dead 4_ with his brother; it was later specified that this film would be _Army of Darkness 2_.[25] Alvarez revealed that Raimi would direct the sequel to _Army of Darkness_.[26] However, in an interview with Erin Darling, Bruce Campbell announced that _Army of Darkness 2_ is not happening, saying "It's all internet b.s. There's no reality whatsoever. These random comments slip out of either my mouth, or Sam Raimi's mouth, next thing you know, we're making a sequel."[27]

On February 26, 2016, it was confirmed that Raimi is attached to direct the upcoming film _World War 3_ for Warner Bros. The film will be based on a possible future inspired by the book _The Next 100 Years_ by George Friedman.[28]

On February 16, 2017, it was reported that Raimi will be directing a thriller about the Bermuda Triangle for Skydance Media, with the script being written by Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard.[29]

On January 29, 2018, it was announced that Raimi was set to direct the first movie in the big-screen adaptation of Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle series, _The Name of the Wind_, with Rothfuss and _Hamilton_ creator Lin-Manuel Miranda serving as executive producers.[30] However, it was reported on Dec. 1, 2018, that Raimi was no longer involved with the project.[31]


Television

In addition to film, Raimi has worked in television, producing such series as _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ and its spin-off _Xena: Warrior Princess_, both featuring his younger brother Ted Raimi and long-time friend Bruce Campbell, _American Gothic_, _Cleopatra 2525_, _M.A.N.T.I.S._, _13: Fear Is Real_, _Young Hercules_, and _Jack of All Trades_. In 2008, Raimi executive produced a syndicated TV series called _Legend of the Seeker_, based on Terry Goodkind's best-selling _The Sword of Truth_ fantasy series. He is also the executive producer of Starz original television series _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_ and _Spartacus: Gods of the Arena_,[32] _Spartacus: Vengeance_ and _Spartacus: War of the Damned_. He directed the pilot episode of _Ash vs Evil Dead_ for Starz.[33]


Recurring trademarks, motifs, and partners

Raimi's brother Ted Raimi and his friend Bruce Campbell often appear in on-screen roles in his film and television projects, although some of the appearances are just cameos. The trio have been working together since their college days. Both Ted and Bruce have appeared in all three _Evil Dead_ and _Spider-Man_ movies, as well as _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ and _Xena: Warrior Princess_, which Sam produced. In the _Evil Dead_ films, Campbell plays the recurring lead part of Ash, while Ted played numerous small parts in each film.

In the _Spider-Man_ films Ted played the featured role of _Daily Bugle_ advertising manager Ted Hoffman, while Bruce Campbell played different roles in each _Spider-Man_ film. In _Hercules_ and _Xena_, Ted and Bruce played the recurring roles of Joxer and Autolycus respectively. Raimi occasionally appears on-screen in his movies, usually in similar fashion to the cameos made by his idol Alfred Hitchcock: In _Spider-Man_ in the wrestling scene as a silhouette behind a projection screen; in _Spider-Man 2_ as a passing student whose bookbag hits Peter Parker in the back of the head; as a hitchhiking fisherman accompanied by Robert Tapert in _The Evil Dead_. Raimi also wears a suit with white shirt and tie on-set in another homage to Hitchcock. An adept fan will also notice Raimi's recurring usage of soda crackers as a back prop.

Raimi often works with film editor Bob Murawski, a fellow Michigan State University alumnus. Among Raimi's films edited by Murawski include the _Spider-Man_ movies, _The Gift_, and _Army of Darkness_. Raimi also frequently collaborates with composer Joseph LoDuca, another acquaintance from Michigan who has provided the scores to most of his films.

Raimi has included his old car from his college days, a 1973 yellow Oldsmobile Delta 88 automobile (nicknamed "The Classic"), in every film including _The Quick and the Dead_ ("Somewhere...somewhere hidden. Only I know. I'll never tell"). At Comic-con 2005 Bruce Campbell revealed that a special covered wagon frame had covered the Oldsmobile to maintain the motif of the film. The yellow Oldsmobile also appeared in _Drag Me to Hell,_ driven by the elderly gypsy woman. A bottle of Maker's Mark also appears regularly in his movies. The Classic does not appear in the final cut of _For Love of the Game_, however. The scene in which it appeared was removed during the editing process.

Other Raimi visual trademarks include:

-   A distinctive camera shot where the camera follows a moving object (such as an arrow or a bullet) at high speed creating a first-person point-of-view from the object itself;
-   A rapid dolly shot to bring a far-off object suddenly into the center of the frame or to pull back from the main focal object to show what is happening around the perimeter (sometimes called "push-pull");
-   Montage sequences with overlapping close-up shots to establish a set of similar actions over elapsing time.
-   Extreme closeups using a wide angle lens.

In the _Making The Amazing_ documentary on the _Spider-Man 2_ DVD, both Tobey Maguire and Bruce Campbell humorously describe Raimi's penchant for "abusing" actors. To obtain detailed closeups of a character getting hit by debris Raimi stands off-camera throwing items, swinging tree branches, etc., at the actor at the center of the shot. Scenes from the documentary show that Raimi is the one throwing popcorn at Peter Parker during the walk to the wrestling ring in _Spider-Man_ and tossing gold coins around during the bank robbery scene in _Spider-Man 2_, as well as a passer-by banging their bag into Peter Parker's head as he kneels on the sidewalk of his college's campus being Sam Raimi.

In many of Raimi's movies the camera itself is part of the action onscreen. One of Raimi's most famous sequences involves a point-of-view shot of actor Bruce Campbell being chased through a cabin by an unseen evil force.
