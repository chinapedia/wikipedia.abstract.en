SPRING CREEK is a stream in Maries and Phelps counties of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Gasconade River.

The stream headwaters arise in Phelps County just northeast of Rolla near the Missouri Route V interchange on I-44 (at ) and stream flows to the north-northwest passing under Missouri Route 63 about three miles north of Rolla. The stream enters Maries County near its midpoint, crosses under Missouri Route A and flows parallel to and just south of Route 63 again to its confluence with the Gasconade (at [2]) about four miles southeast of Vienna.[3]

Spring Creek was named for the fact there are abundant springs along its course.[4]
