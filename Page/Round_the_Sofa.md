Round_the_Sofa.jpg _ROUND THE SOFA_ is an 1859 2-volume collection consisting of a novel with a story preface and five short stories by Elizabeth Gaskell. The two volumes were published by Sampson Low, Son & Co. in London.[1]

The 1859 2-volume set is unillustrated. The first volume consists of the novel _My Lady Ludlow_ prefaced by a short story _Round the Sofa_, which is used to provide a framework for the telling of _My Lady Ludlow_ and the disparate stories. Mrs. Dawson tells the story of "My Lady Ludlow" and then five other narrators gathered around the sofa each tell a story. The second volume consists of the short stories _An Accursed Race_, _The Doom of the Griffiths_, _Half a Life-time Ago_, _The Poor Clare_, and _The Half-Brothers_. The novel and three of the short stories were first published in _Household Words_. _The Doom of the Griffiths_ was first published in _Harper's New Monthly Magazine_ in January 1858.[2] _The Half-Brothers_ was first published in _Fulcher's Ladies' Memorandum Book and Poetical Miscellany_ in 1856.[3]

In 1861 Sampson Low, Son & Co. published a 1-volume second edition entitled _My Lady Ludlow, and Other Tales; included in "Round the Sofa"_. In the 1861 book the lengths of the stories are: _Round the Sofa_, 6 p.; _My Lady Ludlow_, 164 p.; _An Accursed Race_, 15 p.; _The Doom of the Griffiths_, 33 p.; _Half a Life-time Ago_, 40 p.; _The Poor Clare_, 49 p.; _The Half-Brothers_, 10 p.[4]
