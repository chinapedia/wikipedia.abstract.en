Background

Belly has stated in an interview with Billboard that his music is all about progress - "I feel like it took me a lifetime to gain the experience and the knowledge that I needed to put the project together, you know what I mean? But all my projects are ongoing. I'm halfway through the album right now, I just put this out, I've got another short mixtape I'm working on on the side." When describing the concept behind the project, he states that "People think of paradise as sunlight, palm trees and beaches. For me, paradise is all the hell I had to go through to get here. And every time I look at all this beautiful scenery, that's the first thing I think about. That's what I compare it to. And that's my paradise. That's kind of the concept behind the project. [3]
