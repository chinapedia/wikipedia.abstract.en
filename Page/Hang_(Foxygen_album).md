_HANG_ is the fifth studio album by American indie rock duo Foxygen, released on January 20, 2017 on Jagjaguwar.


Reception

In a mostly positive review for Pitchfork, Evan Rytlewski praised the album's stylistic departure from its predecessor, _...And Star Power_, and its high concept direction: "Hang is the kind of investment of time, money, and patience a band can only make if they intend to stick around for a while, an audacious timpani crash of an album that satirizes its own grandiosity in real time."[1] Writing for NME magazine, Ben Homewood gave the album a positive review, saying "...don’t take this sumptuous fifth record ... as a step towards convention. ‘Hang’ may be crisp, clear and smooth, but Foxygen are still very much a force for chaos."
