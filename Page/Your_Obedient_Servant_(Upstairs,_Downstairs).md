Donald Hudson, Mr. Hudson's brother, comes to Eaton Place with his wife (Maudie) and daughter (Alice). Donald is a relatively famous engineer having constructed two major bridges over the Zambezi river; it appears that Hudson has gone to some effort to assist his brother's education in the past. Hudson wants to impress his brother and parades around London dressed as a toff. But the fraternal relationship remains very complicated.[1][2]
