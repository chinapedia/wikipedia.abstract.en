_90º MINUTO_ (translated: "ninetieth minute") is an Italian long-running Sunday RAI television program broadcast since 1970. During its history, the title was also spelled as _Novantesimo minuto_.

The sport program was created by Maurizio Barendson, Paolo Valenti and Remo Pascucci. The program, which provides results and reports of Serie A and Serie B football matches, achieved its major fame between 1970s and early 1990s, mainly thanks to the popularity of its colorful group of stadium correspondents.[1][2] The co-creator Paolo Valenti was the longest-running presenter of the program, from 1970 until a few months before his death in 1990. Later, several journalists alternated, notably Fabrizio Maffei, Giampiero Galeazzi and Paola Ferrari.[3][4]
