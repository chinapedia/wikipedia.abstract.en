GORILLAZ are a British virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band primarily consists of four animated members: Stuart "2-D" Pot, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. Their fictional universe is explored through music videos, interviews, and other short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, and often collaborates with other musicians.

With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop of his band Blur and explored influences including hip hop, electronic music, and world music through an "eccentrically postmodern" approach.[1] The band's 2001 debut album _Gorillaz_ went Triple Platinum in the UK and Double Platinum in Europe and earned the group an entry in the _Guinness Book of World Records_ as the Most Successful Virtual Band.[2] It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was withdrawn at the band's request.[3] Their second studio album, _Demon Days_ (2005), went six times platinum in the UK[4] and double platinum in the US.[5][6][7]

The third Gorillaz studio album, _Plastic Beach_, was released on 3 March 2010. The fourth, _The Fall_, was released on 25 December 2010 as a surprise gift for paying fan club members, then on 18 April 2011 as an official release. The fifth, _Humanz_, was released after a six-year hiatus on 28 April 2017.[8] Their sixth studio album, _The Now Now_, was released on 29 June 2018.[9]

Gorillaz have won one Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and three MTV Europe Music Awards.[10] They have been nominated for ten Brit Awards, and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.[11][12]


History

Creation (1990–1999)

Damon_Albarn_-_Gorillaz_-_Roskilde_Festival_2010.jpg, co-creator of Gorillaz]] Musician Damon Albarn and comic creator Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed.[13] The interview was published in _Deadline_ magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip _Tank Girl_. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver.[14] Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997.[15] Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.[16]

The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a virtual band, something that would be a comment on that."[17] The band originally identified themselves as "Gorilla" and the first song they recorded was "Ghost Train",[18] which was later released as a B-side on their single "Rock the House" and the B-side compilation _G Sides_. The musicians behind Gorillaz' first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track "Time Keeps on Slipping" for Deltron 3030's eponymous debut album.[19]

Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that "one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes" was Blur's 1997 single "On Your Own", which was released for their fifth studio album _Blur_.[20]

_Gorillaz_ (2000–03)

The band's first release was the EP _Tomorrow Comes Today_, released on 27 November 2000. The band's first single was "Clint Eastwood" and was released on 5 March 2001. It was produced by hip hop producer Dan the Automator and originally featured UK rap group Phi Life Cypher, but the version that appears on the album features American rapper Del the Funky Homosapien,[21] known on the album as _Del tha' Ghost Rapper_, a spirit in the band's drummer Russel Hobbs.[22] The Phi Life Cypher version of "Clint Eastwood" appears on the B-side album _G Sides_. Later that same month, their first full-length album, the self-titled _Gorillaz_, was released, producing four singles: "Clint Eastwood", "19-2000", "Rock the House", and "Tomorrow Comes Today". In June 2001, "19–2000" a remix of the song was used as the title theme for EA Sports _FIFA_ video game _FIFA Football 2002_.[23]

On 7 December, the song "911" was released, a collaboration between Gorillaz and hip hop group D12 (without Eminem) and Terry Hall about the September 11 attacks.[24] Meanwhile, _G Sides_, a compilation of the B-sides from the _Tomorrow Comes Today_ EP and first three singles, was released in Japan on 12 December. Gorillaz performed at the 2002 Brit Awards in London on 22 February, appearing in 3D animation on four large screens along with rap accompaniment by Phi Life Cypher. The band were nominated for four Brit Awards, including Best British Group, Best British Album and British Breakthrough Act,[25] but did not win any awards.[26]

On 1 July 2002, a remix album titled _Laika Come Home_ by Spacemonkeyz vs. Gorillaz was released. It contains most of the songs from the Gorillaz' first album, _Gorillaz_, but remixed in dub and reggae style.[27] On 18 November, a DVD titled _Phase One: Celebrity Take Down_ was released. The DVD contains four promotional videos, the abandoned video for "5/4", the _Charts of Darkness_ documentary, the five Gorilla Bitez (comedic shorts starring the virtual characters), a tour of the website by the MEL 9000 server and more. The DVD's menu was designed much like the band's website and depicts an abandoned Kong Studios.[28]

Rumours were circulating at this time that the Gorillaz team were busy preparing a film, but Hewlett said that the film project had been abandoned: "We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and talking to these Hollywood executive types, we just weren't on the same page. We said, fuck it, we'll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves."[29]

_Demon Days_ (2004–06)

The album _Demon Days_ was released on 11 May 2005. The album debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart.[30] The third single was "Dirty Harry", which had been released as a promotional single earlier that year. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 November. The fourth and final single was the double A-side, "Kids with Guns" / "El Mañana". It was released in the UK on 10 April 2006.[31] In December 2005, _Demon Days_ had sold over a million copies in the UK, making it the UK's fifth best selling album of 2005.[32] _Demon Days_ has since gone six times platinum in the UK,[33] double platinum in the United States,[34] triple platinum in Australia[35] and has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.[36] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami on 28 August, Gorillaz won two awards for "Feel Good Inc." featuring De La Soul, including the award for Breakthrough Video.[37]

De_La_Soul_Demon_Days_Live.jpg performing "Feel Good Inc." with Gorillaz at the Demon Days Live concert in Manchester, England]] Gorillaz performed "Dirty Harry" at the 2006 Brit Awards in London, and the band were nominated for Best British Group, and Best British Album (_Demon Days_).[38] Plans were unveiled for Gorillaz to go on a "holographic" world tour in 2007 and 2008.[39] The virtual members would be shown as virtual characters on stage using Musion Eyeliner technology, giving them a lifelike appearance on stage. The virtual characters were first used at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards on 3 November,[40] and again at the 2006 Grammy Awards, on 8 February 2006 with the addition of Madonna, where the band played a pre-recorded version of "Feel Good Inc."[41]

GorillazKidrobot.jpg" Noodle, four-color set, white set and two-tone set]] During 16 October–2 November, a set of Gorillaz figures were released by Kidrobot to coincide with the release of _Demon Days_. Two variations of the set were released, known as the Red and Black editions, and a limited edition Noodle from the music video for "Dare" was also released.[42] Three new sets of Gorillaz vinyl figures were released in 2006. The basic set which was limited to 60,000 was the two-tone set limited to 1,000 and the white edition which was limited to 4,000 were released.[43] On 26 October, the Gorillaz autobiography titled _Rise of the Ogre_ by Riverhead Books,[44] was released on UK.[45] 2 November 2006 on US. On 30 October, the _Phase Two: Slowboat to Hades_ DVD was released on UK. 25 October in Japan. 31 October in the US. And 11 November in Australia. It contains the most of the materials released by Gorillaz from 2004 to 2006. The MTV EMAs, Grammys and Brits live performances. Also included is the Gorillaz' _MTV Cribs_ episode, the Phase Two Gorillaz bites, a new Kong Studios guide, a gallery, and short interviews.

On 2 June 2006 the hopes for a Gorillaz film were revived, when Hewlett stated that they would be producing the film on their own. Film producer and The Weinstein Company co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, was said to be in talks with Albarn and Hewlett.[46] In a September 2006 interview with _Uncut_ magazine, Albarn was said that the band "has been a fantastic journey which isn't over, because we're making a film. We've got Terry Gilliam involved. But as far as being in a big band and putting pop music out there, it's finished. We won't be doing that any more."[47]

On 19 November 2007, a compilation album titled _D-Sides_ was released. It contains B-sides and remixes from singles and bonus tracks for the band's second studio album _Demon Days_, as well as previously unreleased tracks recorded during the same sessions.[48][49] Only one video out in 8 December 2004, "Rockit (or "Rock It").[50] On 20 April 2009, a documentary titled _Bananaz_, was released on PAL / Region 0 DVD format. It contains the documentary film, directed by Ceri Levy, documents the previous seven years of the band.[51] The film was released online on the Babelgum website on 20 April 2009 followed by the DVD release on 1 June 2009.[52]

_Plastic Beach_ and _The Fall_ (2007–13)

In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on _Carousel_, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band's third studio album _Plastic Beach_.[53][54]

Albarn said "I'm making this the biggest and most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth."[55] The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music.[56][57][58]

On 18 January 2010, it was announced that Gorillaz would be headlining the final night of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 18 April 2010.[59] The first single from the album, "Stylo", featuring Bobby Womack and Mos Def was made available for download 26 January 2010.[60] In October 2010, Albarn announced to the media that he would not let the cast of _Glee_ cover the band's songs, claiming that the music on the Fox network's TV show is a "very poor substitute for the real thing". This statement led most people to believe that Gorillaz had been asked by _Glee_ producers to lend their music to the show, which they had not. Albarn responded to the confusion with a laugh and said "and now they definitely won't."[61]

On 5 October 2010, Gorillaz announced their new single "Doncamatic" featuring Daley.[62] On 8 December 2010, Albarn confirmed that a Gorillaz album recorded on the American leg of the Escape to Plastic Beach tour would be released to download for free exclusively to paying fan club members from the Gorillaz website on Christmas Day, 25 December 2010.[63] The video for "Phoner to Arizona" was released on Gorillaz' website for free on 24 December, and a day later, their new album was released, entitled _The Fall_.[64]

On 18 April 2011, Gorillaz announced the release of their own version of the iPad app iElectribe, by Korg – which features loops and samples taken from _The Fall_ as well as other samples. The new version features a Gorillaz designed and styled interface, and is customised to generate Gorillaz samples from their album _The Fall_ and includes 128 new sounds created by the band and 64 ready-to-use pre-programmed patterns from Gorillaz, Stephen Sedgwick (Gorillaz' engineer) and Korg. The app was based on Korg's Electribe: R device app.[65][66] On 5 October 2011, Gorillaz released their first "greatest hits" compilation, _The Singles Collection 2001–2011_.[67]

On 9 February 2012, Gorillaz announced "DoYaThing", a single to promote the Gorillaz-branded Converse shoes that were soon to be released. The song would be part of Converse's "Three Artists, One Song" projects, with the two collaborators being James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and André 3000 of Outkast. An explicit, 13-minute-long version of the song became available for listening shortly after on Gorillaz.com. Hewlett returned to direct the single's music video, featuring animated versions of the two collaborators on the track.[68][69]

In April 2012, Albarn told _The Guardian_ that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were "unlikely".[70] Tension between the two had been building, partly due to a belief held by Hewlett that his contributions to Gorillaz were being diminished. Speaking to _The Guardian_ in April 2017, Hewlett explained: "Damon had half the Clash on stage, and Bobby Womack and Mos Def and De La Soul, and fucking Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Bashy and everyone else. It was the greatest band ever. And the screen on stage behind them seemed to get smaller every day. I’d say, ‘Have we got a new screen?’ and the tour manager was like, ‘No, it’s the same screen.’ Because it seemed to me like it was getting smaller."[71] On 25 April 2012, in an interview with Metro, Albarn was more optimistic about Gorillaz' future, saying that once he had worked out his differences with Hewlett, he was sure that they would make another record.[72] On 24 June 2013, Hewlett stated that he and Albarn planned to someday record a follow-up to their 2010 album _Plastic Beach_.[73][74]

_Humanz_ (2014–17)

In April 2014, Albarn told the _National Post_ that he "wouldn't mind having another stab at a Gorillaz record."[75] Two months later he reported that he had "been writing quite a lot of songs on the road for Gorillaz".[76] On 19 October 2014, Albarn told _The Sydney Morning Herald_ that he was planning to release new Gorillaz material in 2016.[77] Albarn has described the music that he has written for the next Gorillaz album as being very upbeat, humorous, and positive, stating that he plans on giving the tracks "a benchmark of 125 bpm and nothing underneath that", while also suggesting that it once again may have many collaborations.[78][79][80] On 16 July 2015, Albarn stated during an interview for ABC's 7.30 in Australia that he would begin work on the next Gorillaz album: "I'm starting recording in September for a new Gorillaz record, I've just been really, really busy so I haven't had a chance. I'd love to just get back in to that routine of being at home and coming to the studio five days a week."[81]

Speaking about his relationship with Hewlett, Albarn said that the pair's well-publicized fall-out has helped their relationship in the long term.[82] In October 2015, Albarn revealed to _Rolling Stone_ that he and Hewlett were working on a new Gorillaz album.[83] In April 2016, Hewlett uploaded two video clips onto his Instagram showing the continued work on the album. The first clip featured Liam Bailey and rumoured executive producer on the album _The Twilite Tone_. The second clip was a time-lapse video featuring Albarn, Bailey, The Twilite Tone and Jean Michel Jarre.[84][85][86] On 17 May 2016, Gorillaz were in the studio with Chicago-based hip hop artist Vic Mensa.[87][88][89][90]

On 20 September 2016, Gorillaz began an abridged retrospective timeline of the history of Gorillaz releases since 2000.[91][92][93] On 3 October 2016, Gorillaz began posting a series of interactive multimedia stories revolving around the fictional lives of each Gorillaz character since their hiatus to their social media profiles, beginning with _The Book of Noodle_ (she ended up in Japan and tracked down a demon crime boss), then _The Book of Russel_ (he was still a giant from the storyline of Plastic Beach, where he washed up on the shores of North Korea and starved so much he shrank back to normal size), then _The Book of Murdoc_ (he was captured by the band's record label EMI at sea and told to make another album), and finishing with _The Book of 2-D_ (he was swallowed by a whale named Massive Dick on Plastic Beach, and washed up on the shores of Mexico, where to survive he had to eat the whale's blubber, but it turned out he was just at an empty part of Cabo San Lucas).[94] Gorillaz,_Brixton_Academy,_London_(34377484273).jpg in London, June 2017]] On 8 October 2016, Noodle was given her own Instagram page and was announced to be the Global Ambassador of Jaguar Racing.[95] On 19 January 2017, a new song from the band entitled "Hallelujah Money" featuring Benjamin Clementine was released.[96][97] On 6 March, Gorillaz announced the launch of their own festival, called Demon Dayz Festival, which took place on 10 June 2017 at Dreamland Margate in Margate, Kent, England.[98][99][100] The band headlined the festival.[101]

On 17 March 2017, the tracklist of the forthcoming album was leaked online, showing guest features from a variety of artists including usual collaborators De La Soul, as well as new collaborators such as Grace Jones, Vince Staples, Pusha T, Rag'n'Bone Man, Anthony Hamilton, Kilo Kish and Kali Uchis.[102][103][104]

On 23 March 2017, Gorillaz announced via Instagram that the new album will be entitled _Humanz_, with a scheduled release date of 28 April 2017.[105] On the official Gorillaz YouTube page, two new music videos were released for their track "Saturnz Barz", one of which was in a 360º view. The track features vocals from Jamaican dancehall artist Popcaan. The band also released an art video for the track "Andromeda", featuring an animated planet in a galaxy. The track features the American rapper D.R.A.M., two more art videos were released: "Ascension" (featuring American rapper Vince Staples) and "We Got the Power" (featuring Jehnny Beth of the English rock band Savages and Noel Gallagher of Oasis).[106] On 6 April 2017, the fifth single from _Humanz_, "Let Me Out" (featuring Mavis Staples and Pusha T), was released, followed by a performance of the song on _The Late Show with Stephen Colbert_ on 27 April.[107] On 10 April 2017, a Gorillaz themed augmented reality app created in collaboration with Electronic Beats was released. On 24 April 2017, four days before the _Humanz_ release date, another promotional single was uploaded, titled "The Apprentice". It is the only new song taken from the deluxe edition of _Humanz_.

On 28 April 2017, _Humanz_ was released worldwide. On 8 June 2017, the non-album single "Sleeping Powder" was released, along with an accompanying music video. On 10 June 2017, the band headlined the Demon Dayz Festival in Margate, England. On August 4, 2017, the band released "Strobelite" as a single with an accompanying music video.[108] On 31 October 2017, "Garage Palace" was released as a single from the "Super Deluxe" Edition of _Humanz_, which includes 14 additional songs and was released on 3 November 2017.[109][110][111] In December 2017, the band released a _Humanz_-themed, in-universe magazine called G Magazine.[112] On 21 February 2018, the band received the Brit Award for British Group for their work on _Humanz_. During their acceptance speech, a short-video of Murdoc was played, showing him being imprisoned for an unknown reason.[113]

_The Now Now_ (2018–present)

In an interview with _Q Magazine_ in September 2017, Albarn hinted at another potential Gorillaz album being in production. He mentioned enjoying the spontaneity of recording and debuting music while on tour, similarly to the band's 2010 release _The Fall_, but expressed desire to make it a comparatively more "complete" record, adding that "If we're going to do more with Gorillaz we don't want to wait seven years because, y'know, we're getting on a bit now".[114] At the end of the same month on 30 September 2017 while touring for _Humanz_, the band debuted a new song in Seattle called "Idaho". Hewlett confirmed later on in December 2017 that the band planned to release a follow-up album to _Humanz_ in 2018, citing a desire to keep the band going rather than take any prolonged breaks as the band had usually done with previous projects. Hewlett described several of the demos and new material as a "new direction" for the band, stating that he hopes to move the band's artwork in a similar direction.[115] During a performance in Chile on the final leg of the Humanz Tour, Albarn confirmed that the new album was coming "very soon" and premiered a new song called "Hollywood" featuring Jamie Principle and Snoop Dogg.[116] On 26 May 2018, the album was officially announced to be titled _The Now Now_, being co-produced by James Ford.[117][118] On 31 May, the music video for the single "Humility" featuring George Benson, was released alongside "Lake Zurich".[119] From 7 to 21 June, the band released the singles "Sorcererz", "Fire Flies", and "Hollywood".[120][121][122] _The Now Now_ was released on 29 June 2018. On 13 September, "Tranz" was released as a single along with a music video.[123] All of the songs from the album have a visualizer except "Humility".

In the fictional Gorillaz storyline, the band introduced Ace from Cartoon Network's animated series _The Powerpuff Girls_ as a temporary bassist of the band, filling in for the imprisoned Murdoc Niccals (as seen in the band's Brit Awards acceptance speech for _Humanz_). As well as being his confirmed cousin. [124] From 4 June to 26 October 2018, the band ran a bi-weekly text-adventure ARG called _"Free Murdoc"_, in which the player assists Murdoc as he attempts to escape from prison.[125][126][127][128] Murdoc was reunited with the band on 20 September, in time to join them on the final leg of The Now Now Tour.[129] On 25 October, the band announced they would be partnering with G-Shock to create a line of Gorillaz watches.[130] To promote the watches, the band released a monthly web-series called ''Mission M101.[131][132]


Style

Writers and critics have variously described Gorillaz' music as alternative rock,[133][134][135][136][137][138] art pop,[139][140][141][142][143] hip hop,[144][145][146][147] pop,[148][149][150] trip hop,[151][152][153] electronica,[154][155] electronic,[156] bedroom pop,[157] dark pop,[158][159] indie rock,[160][161][162] alternative hip hop,[163][164] rap rock,[165][166] lo-fi,[167] electropop,[168] dance-rock,[169] dub,[170] world,[171] and worldbeat.[172] The band's aesthetic and general approach has been described as postmodern.[173] According to _PopMatters_, the band's early work foreshadowed "the melding of hip-hop, rock, and electronic elements in pop music" that grew in significance in the next decade.[174]


Live performances

Apollo_Marquee_2006.jpg in Harlem, New York in April 2006.]] In March 2001, Gorillaz played their first show at the Scala in London before embarking on a UK tour later that summer, with one date in Paris and two in Japan. During this tour the live band played behind a giant projector screen which covered the whole stage, on which was projected various visuals and images created by Hewlett. After taking a short break over the holidays, the tour resumed with a North American leg in February 2002.[175]

During 1–5 November 2005, Gorillaz played a five night residency at the Manchester Opera House in Manchester, England. The event was filmed by an EMI film crew for a DVD release, _Demon Days Live_, in late March 2006. It was later announced that an American version of the event would take place from 2 to 6 April 2006 at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Within an hour of release tickets were sold out.[176] The show of 6 April was filmed for a live webcast at MSN Video.[177] Palladia (then known as MHD) also broadcast an Apollo Theater show in HDTV on 31 December 2006.[178] Gorillaz_live_2010.jpg in London, April 2010|300px|left]] In March 2010, Gorillaz began a short six date tour as "rehearsal" shows for their headlining slot at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The shows were open exclusively to Gorillaz Sub Division fan club members and featured no visuals whatsoever. These performances were the band's first public performances in four years. Gorillaz headlined the final night of the Coachella Festival on 18 April 2010 as their first proper, full show of Phase Three. On 27 April they were the main guests on _Later... with Jools Holland_ on the BBC. In addition, Gorillaz played a two-night residency at London's Camden Roundhouse (29 and 30 April 2010). Mick Jones and Paul Simonon of the Clash performed guitar and bass respectively with the band and more than once in the evening chords from the Clash song "Guns of Brixton" were heard as a subtle reference to their presence.[179] Gorillaz_at_Oslo_Spektrum_2.jpg in November 2017]] Gorillaz kicked off their first ever world tour in October 2010, with some preceding festival dates in the summer, such as at the Byblos Festival in Lebanon, the Roskilde Festival in Denmark, the Glastonbury Festival in England and one show at the Citadel of Damascus in Syria.[180][181] The Escape to Plastic Beach Tour took them across North America in October, Europe in November, and finally through Australia, New Zealand, and with one date in Hong Kong in December.[182] During the final show of the tour at the Vector Arena in Auckland, New Zealand on 21 December 2010, Albarn announced that it would be their final show with the _Plastic Beach_ line up.[183]

On 8 July 2017, Gorillaz embarked upon the Humanz Tour, the band's second world tour and first since 2010. With 53 scheduled shows and lasting over a year, the tour was Gorillaz' longest tour in their history.[184] On 6 December, Gorillaz announced they would be playing BoomTown Fair as an "exclusive one-off UK show".[185] After 53 performances, on 30 March 2018, Humanz Tour concluded in São Paulo, Brazil.[186]

On 1 June 2018, Gorillaz embarked The Now Now Tour, in Nuremberg, Germany. On 20 October, Gorillaz played "Song 2" by Blur, at Demon Dayz Festival, with Graham Coxon, in Los Angeles, California.[187] After 29 performances, on 24 October, The Now Now Tour concluded, in Mexico City.[188][189] The Now Now Tour had participations of The Internet and Little Dragon.
