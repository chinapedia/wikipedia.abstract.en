The KERALA STATE POLICE is the state police for the Indian state of Kerala, and is responsible for statewide law enforcement. The Kerala State Police was formed in 1956 after the taluk of Kasargod in the South Canara district of Madras Presidency, the Malabar district of Madras Presidency, and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act.[1][2] Kerala Police has its headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital with Kerala Police Academy in Thrissur that runs full-term basic courses for sub-inspectors, Armed Police Constables, Women constables, Police Drivers and Telecommunication Police Constables.

History

There is no authoritative record on the history of Police in ancient Kerala. The literary works of the Sangam period, namely Akamkrithikal, Pathittipattu and Chilppathikaram, depict the ancient policing system. The feudal system which existed in ancient Kerala gave way to a new structure under the Cheras, comprising Thara, Desomand Nadu ruled by Madampi, Desavazhi and Naduvazhi respectively. The semblance of a modern police force was created in the late 19th century in Travancore under the British rule. There was no unified geographical entity as 'Kerala' before 1956. The present Kerala Police Department was formed in the same year by re-organizing and merging of police forces in Travancore-Cochin States and the British Malabar State.[5][6]
