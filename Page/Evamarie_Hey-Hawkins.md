Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. EVAMARIE HEY-HAWKINS is a German inorganic chemist and professor at Leipzig University. Her research has focused on main group and transition metal chemistry.


Biography

She received her diploma (1982) and doctoral degree (1983) at the University of Marburg, Germany, the latter under Kurt Dehnicke. After stays at the University of Sussex, UK (1984/85), the University of Western Australia (1985/86) and the ANU (1986/87), she returned to Germany and completed her habilitation in Marburg (1988). From 1988-1990 she was a Research Associate at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart. Evamarie Hey-Hawkins has been a Full Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at Leipzig University, Germany, since 1993.


Research

Her scientific interests comprise many aspects of structural and synthetic chemistry. Much of her work focuses on main group compounds, especially derivatives of boron and phosphorus. She has also conducted research on bioactive boron compounds.[1] She has authored more than 470 publications in refereed journals.[2]
