The AUDIT BOARD OF INDONESIA (id: _BADAN PEMERIKSA KEUANGAN_), also referred to as the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia, is a high state body which is responsible for evaluation of management and accountability of state finances conducted by the central Government of Indonesia, local governments, Bank Indonesia, state-owned enterprises, the Public Service Board, and institutions or other entities which manage state finances.


History

The body was initially established under the name _National Supervision Board_ at Magelang, Central Java during the United States of Indonesia period on 28 December 1946.[1] The Board currently functions under the latest revision to the laws governing it dating to 2006.[2][3] The Board has increasingly tackled environmental issues, revealing in 2014 that the Ciliwung River had been polluted by seventeen separate companies, submitting its report to the police.[4]

As of 2015, the Audit Board of Indonesia was chairing the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions' Working Group on Environmental Auditing.[5]

In 2016, Board chairman Harry Azhar Azis was implicated in the Panama Papers due to a previously registered blank company which he hadn't reported.[6] Azis claimed that the company was merely a registered name on paper which he had started for his oldest daughter, but then sold to someone else after his appointment as Board chairman in December 2014.[7]
