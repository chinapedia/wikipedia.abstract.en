_MY OWN WORDS_ is a 2016 book by American Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her biographers Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams. The book is a collection of Bader Ginsburg's speeches and writings dating back to the eighth grade. It is Bader Ginsburg's first book since becoming a Supreme Court Justice in 1993.


Background

In March 2016, Simon & Schuster announced _My Own Words_ was slated to release in January 2017.[1][2][3] The book was released early, however, being published on October 4, 2016.


Synopsis

Bader Ginsburg writes the preface to the book, with Hartnett and Williams contextualizing "each part of the sections, which include law review articles, speeches, briefs and dissents."[4] Many topics are covered in _My Own Words_, including Bader Ginsburg's life as a Jewish woman, gender equality, the Supreme Court, and interpreting the U.S. Constitution.[5]

One of the treatises in the book is the speech she gave when accepting the position of Supreme Court Justice.[6] Another is a writing on why the United States "needs" the Equal Rights Amendment.[7]

Bader Ginsburg also recalls her relationship with Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia. Of Scalia, she stated, "some very good people have some very bad ideas." Of O'Connor, she stated she learned to "waste no time on anger, regret or resentment, just get the job done."[8]


Reception

Reception for the book was generally positive.

_USA Today_ stated, "What emerges is not a portrait of a take-no-prisoners advocate but a strategic legal plotter who understands how to bring her audience around to her point of view."[9]

_Kirkus Reviews_ stated, "Only the most dedicated Ginsburg fans, and there are many, will devour everything here, but most readers will find items of interest from this icon of womenâ€™s rights."[10]

_Yahoo! News_ stated, "In _My Own Words_... the vim and vigor that she is famous for expressing from the Supreme Court bench is just as apparent in her high school editorials."[11]

_The New Republic_ stated, "The selection showcases her astonishing intellectual range, from law and lawyers in opera, to tributes to Louis Brandeis, William Rehnquist, and Gloria Steinem, to the significance and form of dissenting opinions."[12]
