JONATHAN JUDAH ISAAC (born October 3, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Florida State Seminoles. He was selected by Orlando in the first round of the 2017 NBA draft with the sixth overall pick.


High school career

Isaac first attended Barron Collier High School in Naples, Florida during his freshman and sophomore years. In his junior and senior years, he also attended the International School Of Broward in Hollywood, Florida. However, as a result of wanting to be reclassified as someone from the high school class of 2016, Isaac also attended IMG Academy for what was considered to be a postgraduate year in 2016.[1] As a senior in 2016, he averaged 17.6 points per game and 10.0 rebounds per game while leading IMG Academy to a (21-10) overall record. Throughout his high school career, he grew six inches from his freshman year to his senior year, going from a combo guard of sorts to the combo forward he is today. Issac was selected to play in the 2016 Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit All-Star games. Isaac was rated as a five-star recruit and ranked as the No.12 overall recruit and No.4 Small forward in the 2016 high school class.[2][3] On July 5, 2015, Isaac confirmed that he was going to commit to Florida State after his senior year of high school ended. On February 5, 2016, he announced his intentions of testing the possibility of entering the 2016 NBA draft as the first American postgraduate to jump directly from high school to the NBA draft since 2005. He was also considered a prospect that could have been taken in the middle or late first round had he committed to it.[4] Four days after making that announcement, however, Isaac confirmed that he wasn't going to enter the 2016 draft after all and reaffirmed his intentions of playing with Florida State for the 2016–17 season.[5]

As the second seed in the ACC Tournament, Florida State beat Virginia Tech in the quarterfinals, but lost to Notre Dame in the semi-finals. His team then proceeded to the NCAA Tournament, where they were seeded 3rd in the West. They won their first-round game 86–80 against FGCU at Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. However, they lost in the round of 32 in a blowout upset against 11th seeded Xavier, 66–91. Isaac scored just 25 points in two games In his NCAA Tournament Career. At the conclusion of his freshman season, he was named to the All-ACC Freshman Team of 2017.
