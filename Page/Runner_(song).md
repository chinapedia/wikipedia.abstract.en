THE RUNNER, also RUNNER, is a song written by Canadian rock musician Ian Thomas, his version released in 1981 on the album of the same name. It was also recorded by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, an artist known for making hits of reworked cover songs, and released as a single in 1984. It was that band's highest chart climber, reaching 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.


The song

Ian Thomas was a moderately successful artist in Canada, whose songs have been covered by bigger artists a number of times. He was inspired to write this song by Terry Fox seeking publicity and funding for cancer by running across Canada, but who died of it before he finished. "I wanted to capture that gallantry, the importance of passing on the flame", related Thomas. His version was included in the 1983 movie _The Terry Fox Story_.[1]

This song was also covered by Shiela in 1981.


Manfred Mann version

The timing on Manfred Mann's version was especially good, as it came out right before the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles, prompting especially heavy play. Trevor Rabin, at that time the guitarist of the progressive rock band Yes, played the guitar solo on this track.

The video for the Manfred Mann version, directed by Lindsey Clennell, received heavy airplay on MTV, back when they played music. In it, the band performs near a campfire at night (shot on a soundstage), interspersed with video of runners either racing, or carrying the Olympic torch, much of which was footage shot for the recent Olympic games in Munich and Montreal.[2]

This version of the song was used in the film The Philadelphia Experiment.
