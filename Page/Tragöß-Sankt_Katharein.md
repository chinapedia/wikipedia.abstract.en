TRAGÖSS-SANKT KATHAREIN is since 2015 a new municipality in Bruck-Mürzzuschlag District in Styria, Austria, which had merged after 31 December 2014 the independent municipalities Tragöß and St. Katharein an der Laming. This merger was part of the Styria municipal structural reform.[1][2]

The municipality Tragöß, at the Constitutional Court, introduced an appeal against the merger but was not successful. The court dismissed the appeal.[3]

Administration

The former mayors of Tragöß and St. Katharein lost their function, as did the community leaders and the local councils. It was planned for 23 March 2015 that the next municipal elections would take place, where a new municipal council and the mayor are elected. Until the election of the new town council, Hubert Zinner was appointed by the Steiermärkische Landesregierung as a government commissioner. Eduard Lengger (Tragöß) and Werner Mikusch (St. Katharein) were appointed as advisors by the dissolved municipal councils. This practice was a consultative role for the government commissioner.[5]

The municipal office is located in St. Katharein. Tragöß holds a Bürgerservicestelle civil-service branch.[6]
