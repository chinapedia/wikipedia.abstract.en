_IT ALL STARTED FROM AN INTRO_ () is the fourth studio album by Taiwanese Mandopop singer-songwriter William Wei. It was released digitally on August 16, 2016[1] and physically on August 18, 2016 by Linfair Records. The album consists of 11 tracks and 5 bonus tracks.

Wei merges technology and music in his fourth album. The album features a QR code as its cover, designed by Red Dot Design Award winner David Lai (賴佳韋) and Golden Pin Design Award winner Wei Chia Lu (呂瑋嘉).[2] By scanning the QR code cover with the VisionLens app, a "virtual William Wei" 3D model will appear and interact with its listeners.[3]
