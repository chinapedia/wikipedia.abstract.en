History

Penna_SanGiovanni_Teatro_Flora3.jpg The nucleus for the theater was formed by a _Società del Teatro_, founded in 1780, and composed of ten condomini (owners) in the town. They utilized this space in the town palace to built this theater with a frescoed wooden roof, above ground seating and two floors of theater boxes. The decoration is an elaborate rococo décor on wood, with wooden columns painted as faux marble. The theater presently sits about 100 persons. In the twentieth century, for years the theater was abandoned and threatened with destruction. In 1985 it was designated as a historic national treasure and recently subsequently restored.[1]

The painted decoration was completed Antonio Liozzi, who painted the central ceiling fresco of the goddess Flora, as well as the mouldings and frames.[2]
