Critical reception

In his review of the poetry collection in _The Age_ Dennis Douglas noted "In Rowbotham's poetry technique counts far more than content", though he does go on to say the poet's "words can attain a startling freshness." He also concluded that "David Rowbotham seems to be seeking a new subject-matter and a new style."[3]

Vivian Smith in _The Bulletin_ found Rowbotham "striking out in new directions." He went on: "Rowbotham's strength has always been that of simple affection for and appreciation of country life and living. His tone is subdued, unassertive. One feels that he would rather not be heard than have to raise his voice."[4]
