COLLEGE OF SAINT MICHAEL, AMPARIBE (_Coll√®ge de Saint-Michel_), Madagascar, was founded in 1888 by the Society of Jesus.


History

In the 1840s six French Jesuits from Lyons began prosyliticing the outlying settlements and educating. By 1855 they were able to get into the capital. With the advent of King Radama II in 1861, Christians were free to preach. Thus, the Jesuits and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny settled in the capital, and opened schools and churches.[1]

The internal life of the College survived the abolition of the European section (1906 to 1934). Then followed the start of secondary education (1935), the closing of Madagascar College (1942), and new programs: Philosophy (1952), Elementary Mathematics (1956), Experimental Sciences (1960) and the Baccalaureate (1955). Coeducation began with the first girls admitted in 1966. In 1983 the Higher Technical Institute (1983) opened on the premises. In 1986 the literature sector was restored.

Its current enrollment included 2202 students:, 1340 Catholics, 799 Protestants, and 63 others; 2039 boys and 163 girls.[2]


Sports

Saint-Michel has a swimming club with many good results.[3] Its table tennis teams have won national championships at many levels.[4]
