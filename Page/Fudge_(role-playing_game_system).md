_FUDGE_ is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games.[1] The name "_FUDGE_" was once an acronym for _Freeform Universal Donated_ (later, _Do-it-yourself_) _Gaming Engine_[2] and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game's design goals. _Fudge_ has been nominated for an Origins Award for _Best Role-Playing Game System_ for the _Deryni Role-Playing Game_.[3][4]

Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like _d20 System_ or _GURPS_, _Fudge_ offers a customizable toolkit for building the users' own specialized role-playing game system. Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the Game Master and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. _Fudge_ is not tied to any particular genre or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign.[5]


History

The project that would lead to _Fudge_ was first proposed by Steffan O'Sullivan in November 1992 on the rec.games.design newsgroup,[6] and over the following months that online community would contribute to the directed project.[7] One of the earliest stipulations of O'Sullivan was that the basic system would always remain free to the public over the internet, and the PDF of the 1995 version still is.[8] The 1995 version of _Fudge_ is available under a non-commercial licence.

Grey Ghost Press, with the endorsement of Steffan O'Sullivan, publishes an expanded form of the _Fudge_ system. There have been three Grey Ghost Press editions, the most current being the _Fudge 10th Anniversary Edition_, which includes several suggested rules systems for common RPG elements and an example basic fantasy "build" of the game.

In March 2004, Grey Ghost Press acquired the copyright of _Fudge_, and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of _Fudge_ under the Open Game License.

The OGL license has allowed the _FATE role-playing game system_ to build on _Fudge_ as its underlying mechanic.[9]

In 1999 _Pyramid_ magazine named _Fudge_ as one of _The Millennium's Most Underrated Games_. Editor Scott Haring stated that "_Fudge_ is an extremely flexible, rules-light system. It works great, and everybody who plays it, loves it. Why isn't it more popular? I dunno."[10]


Name

At the time _Fudge_ was conceived, it was stylish to give role-playing games acronyms for names (for instance, _GURPS_ and _TWERPS_) and originally the usenet design project referred to the game as _SLUG_, for "Simple Laid-back Universal Game".[11] However, this was soon changed to _FUDGE_ for "Free-form Universal Donated Gaming Engine", but also because the word invoked connotations of an easy to make source of fun. This again was changed when Grey Ghost Press released their 1995 hardcopy version of the game, to "Free-form Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine".

With the publication of the Expanded Edition in 2000, the fad for acronym-based names had long since faded, and the writer and the publisher both felt that the forced acronym had become irrelevant. The game has been referred to officially as just _Fudge_ ever since, though fans often still refer to it in the old manner as _FUDGE_.


Game mechanics

FUDGE_4dF_probability.svg In _Fudge_, character Traits such as Attributes and Skills, are rated on a seven-level, ascending adjective scale: _Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great,_ and _Superb._

_Fudge_ characters can also have Gifts and Faults, which are positive and negative traits that do not fit into the adjective scale.

Fudge dice

White_Fudge_Dice.jpg _Fudge_ uses customized "_Fudge_ dice" which have an equal number of plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time ("4dF" in Fudge dice notation), and for every plus side that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from _Fair_ to _Good_) and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a _Good_ attribute is considered to be _Great_ if the player were to roll two plus sides, one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of the plus sides and the remaining plus side raises the result by one step. The same _Good_ attribute would be considered _Poor_ if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as [−], a 3-4 as [ ] and a 5-6 as [+].

There are also several alternative dice systems available that use ten-sided dice, coins, or playing cards.


Complexity

The rules of _Fudge_ are highly customizable and can be adjusted for the level of simplicity or complexity desired by the Game Master and Players. Overall, the system is designed to encourage role-playing over strict adherence to an arbitrary set of rules. In fact, the main _Fudge_ documents encourage players to "Just Fudge It"; that is, to focus on the story being created rather than on the game rules. For example, one character creation method encourages players to first write prose descriptions of their characters and then translate those into _Fudge_ Traits.
