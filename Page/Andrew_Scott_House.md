The ANDREW SCOTT HOUSE is a historic two-story farmhouse in Culleoka, Tennessee, U.S.


History

The house was built circa 1820 for Andrew Scott and his wife, Mary Doak Matthews.[1] It was designed in the Georgian architectural style, with touches of Palladian architecture.[2] After Andrew Scott's death in 1870, it was inherited by his son, Robert Miles Scott, who lived in the house with his wife, Sarah M. Walker, and their nine children.[3] It became a horse farm.[4]

After Robert M. Scott's 1897 death, it was purchased by J. T. Petty.[5] By January 1939, it was purchased by Allan Matthews and his wife Mary.[6] It was inherited by her nephew, Elliott Matthews, in 1978, and purchased by Philip M. Wendts in 1991.[7]

The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 4, 1995.[8]
