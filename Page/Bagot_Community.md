Bagot_Community_Sign.jpg BAGOT COMMUNITY is an Aboriginal community in Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia. It was formerly known as the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve. It is now the largest Aboriginal community in Darwin, home to nearly 400 Aboriginal people.


History

The Bagot Aboriginal Reserve was established in 1939 when all Aboriginal residents were moved from the Kahlin Compound. The Retta Dixon Home was located at the reserve.

In 1954, 22 boys from the reserve travelled to Toowoomba to perform a corroboree for Queen Elizabeth II.[1]

In the 1970s the reserve was handed over to the Indigenous custodians and became known as Bagot Community.


Recent history

Bagot_Community_Painting_Home_Project.jpg Bagot Community is run by the Bagot Community Incorporated (BCI). It faced financial difficulties in 2015 and was reportedly in administration with debts of more than $700,000.[2] Commercial development of about three hectares of the Bagot Community site was then proposed. President of BCI Helen Fejo-Frith stated the development would "enable the Bagot Community to have a sustainable future".[3]

A community celebration known as 'The Bagot Festival' was held as part of Darwin Festival in 2014, featuring music, dance and art.[4]

In 2015, a painting project was undertaken at the community which saw a series of murals painted on the houses.[5]
