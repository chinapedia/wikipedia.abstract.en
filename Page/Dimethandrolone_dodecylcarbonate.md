DIMETHANDROLONE DODECYLCARBONATE (developmental code name CDB-4730), or DIMETHANDROLONE DODECANOYLCARBONATE, also known as 7Α,11Β-DIMETHYL-19-NORTESTOSTERONE 17Β-DODECYLCARBONATE, is a synthetic and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) which was developed by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and has not been marketed at this time.[1] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β dodecylcarbonate ester of dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) – and acts as a prodrug of dimethandrolone in the body.[2]
