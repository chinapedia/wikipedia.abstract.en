RAJAZ (, literally 'tremor, spasm, convulsion as may occur in the behind of a camel when it wants to rise'[1]) is a metre used in classical Arabic poetry. A poem composed in this metre is an _urjūza_. The metre accounts for about 3% of surviving ancient and classical Arabic verse.[2]

This form is the simplest of the Arabic metres, with a basic foot pattern of XXSL (where L represents a long syllable, S a short syllable, and X a syllable that can be long or short).[3] It is unique among the classical Arabic metres because its lines are not divided into hemistichs.[4] Lines were most often of three feet, though this varied. It can be exemplified through the traditional mnemonic (_Tafā'īl_) __ ().

Every line would rhyme on the same sound.[5] However, a popular alternative was couplet rhyme, this form of _rajaz_ poetry being called _muzdawij_ (and a poem in this form being called a _muzdawija_).[6]

Though generally regarded as the oldest of the Arabic metres,[7] _rajaz_ was not highly regarded in the pre- and early Islamic periods, being seen as similar to (and at times indistinguishable from) the rhymed prose form _saj'_. It tended to be used for low-status, everyday genres such as lullabies, or for improvisation, for example improvised incitements to battle.

The metre gained in popularity towards the end of the Umayyad period, with al-‘Ajjāj (d. c. 91/710), Ru‘ba (d. 145/762) and Abū al-Najm al-‘Ijlī (d. before 125/743) all composing long, _qaṣīda_ style pieces in the metre. Abū Nuwās was also particularly fond of the form.[8]

In the twentieth century, in response to the aesthetics of free verse, _rajaz_, both in traditional form and more innovative adaptations, gained a new popularity in Arabic poetry, with key exponents in the first half of the century including ‘Ali Maḥmūd Ṭāhā, Elias Abu Shabaki, and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab (not least in his 'Unshūdat al-Maṭar').[9] _Rajaz_ feet were often taken, from the 1950s onwards, as the basis for free-verse compositions.[10]


Example

A famous, early example is the following incitement to battle by Hind bint Utbah, showing the form XXSL XLSL, with the first two elements mostly long, and the fifth one always short:[11]
