_IRIS HEYLANDIANA_ is a species in the genus _Iris_, it is also in the subgenus of Iris, and in the Oncocyclus section. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the marshlands or fields of Iraq. It has short, linear or sickle shaped grey-green leaves, slender stem, a single flower in spring, which has a dingy-white, whitish, or pale background, which is covered in many spots or dark veining, in black-purple, brown-purple, or brown violet, or brown shades. It has a dark brown or burgundy brown signal patch and white tinged with yellow or orange white sparse beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer.


Description

It has a short,[1] brown rhizome,[2] that is creeping and stoloniferous.[3][4] It has 5-7 leaves,[5] which are linear in the middle, but falcate or sickle-shaped,[6] on the outside.[7][8][9] They are similar in form to _Iris sari_ but are narrower.[10] The glaucescent,[11] greyish green leaves,[12] can grow up to between long,[13][14] and between 0.8mm and 1.2 cm wide.[15][16][17] After flowering they begin to fade away, before regrowing in spring.[18] It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall.[19][20][21] The flowers are high above the foliage.[22] The stem has 1 green, lanceolate, membranous,[23] spathes (leaf of the flower bud),[24] which is long.[25][26] The stem has a terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in Spring between April,[27] and June.[28][29] The flowers are in diameter,[30] they have a dingy-white,[31][32] whitish,[33][34] or pale background,[35][36] which has many spots and dark veining,[37][38] in black-purple,[39][40] brown-purple,[41] or brown violet,[42][43] or brown shades.[44] Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.[45] The obovate or cuneate (wedge shaped) falls,[46] are long and 3.5–4 cm wide.[47] In the centre of the fall, is a signal patch, which is dark brown,[48][49] or burgundy brown,[50] and in the middle of the falls, it has a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is sparse,[51][52] and white with a slightly yellow tint,[53][54] or orange-white.[55] It has broader standards,[56][57][58] which are orbicular (rounded),[59] or unguiculate (narrow stalk-like),[60] they are cm long and 4.5–5 cm wide.[61] It has short, 3.5 to 5 cm long,[62] broad and crenulated crests,[63] and a 2.5 cm long perianth tube.[64][65] After the iris has flowered, it produces a trigonal (narrow at both ends) and long seed capsule.[66]

Biochemistry

As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.[67] It has a chromosome count: 2n=20,[68] similar to other Oncocyclus irises.[69]


Taxonomy

The Latin specific epithet _heylandiana_ refers to the German botanical artist Jean-Christophe Heyland (1791-1866), he lived mainly in Switzerland, working for Delessert, Webb, Boissier and other botanists.[70]

It was originally found in Mesopotamia,[71][72][73] and then called _Iris iberica var. heylandiana_ by John Gilbert Baker in 1877 in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society (J. Linn. Soc., Bot.) Vol.16 on page 142.[74][75][76] It was then soon re-named as _Iris heylandiana_ in 1882 by Boiss. in Fl. Orient. Vol.5 on page 130, (edited by Reut.).[77][78] In 1893, Foster described the species in The Garden (journal) of 18 February, but in 1977 S. A Chaudhary worked out that one of these was instead _Iris gatesii_. It was found that Boissier & Reuter had named two specimens _Iris heylandiana_, but one of these was also determined to be _I. gatesii_ by Chaudhary.[79] It has also been confused with _Iris nectarifera_, as both of these species have been found in the Derbassieh area in Syria. Although _I. nectarifera_ is mainly from adjacent Turkey.[80]

It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then altered on 2 December 2004.[81]

It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life,[82] and in the Catalogue of Life.[83]


Distribution and habitat

It is native to temperate Asia.[84]

Range

It is found in Iraq,[85][86][87] from Mosul to Baghdad.[88][89] It is also once thought to occur in north-east Syria,[90] and found in Palestine in 1888.[91]

_Iris maculata_ (a synonym for the iris) was found in Turkey,[92][93] near Mardin.[94]

Habitat

It grows on drained marshlands,[95] and fields.[96]


Conservation

It was listed as Endangered in 1991.[97]


Cultivation

In general, 'Oncocyclus Section' Irises need good drainage,[98] minimal summer rainfall and dry winters.[99] In temperate areas (such as the Europe and America), they are only suitable for growing by specialist iris growers, within a bulb frame or greenhouse.[100][101] They can be grown under glass (in frames), to protect the irises from excess moisture (especially during winter times) and also to ensure the (shallow planted) rhizomes get the best temperatures during the growing season.[102][103] They can be grown in pots (especially in deep ones known as 'long toms'), but they need re-potting, every 2 years and extra feeding. Watering is one of the most critical aspects of iris cultivation.[104] It can suffer from aphids, viruses and rots.[105] A herbarium specimen can be found in Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.[106]

Propagation

Irises can generally be propagated by division,[107] or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves.[108]


Toxicity

Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.[109]
