She is known for starring as Kelly Kapowski on NBC's _Saved by the Bell_ (1989–93) and as Valerie Malone on Fox's _Beverly Hills, 90210_ (1994–98). Thiessen has also starred in other TV series such as Fox's _Fastlane_ (2002–03), ABC's _What About Brian_ (2007), and USA Network's _White Collar_ (2009–14), as well as in a number of TV movies, and she has also appeared in several films like _Son in Law_ (1993), _Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th_ (2000), _Hollywood Ending_ (2002), and _Cyborg Soldier_ (2008).


Early life

Thiessen was born in Long Beach, California, the daughter of Robyn (née Ernest), a homemaker, and Frank Thiessen, a park designer and landscape architect.[1] She has credited her brother, Todd, as one of her most important sources of inspiration, and her mother and grandmother as role models.[2] Her mother has Greek, Turkish and Welsh heritage.[3] She attended Cubberley Elementary and Marshall Junior High School in Long Beach. In 1992, Thiessen graduated as valedictorian at Valley Professional High School in Studio City, Los Angeles.


Career

Thiessen participated in beauty pageants during her childhood and was crowned Miss Junior America in 1987. The following year, she appeared on the cover of _Teen_ magazine, having won the magazine's "Great Model Search". In 1989, she was named Cover Girl magazine's "Model of the Year", and landed her first role of Kelly Kapowski on NBC's television sitcom _Saved by the Bell_, starring until its end in 1993. The success of the show gave her career a boost and Thiessen received Young Artist Award nominations for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in 1990 and Best Young Actress in an Off-Primetime Series in 1992 and 1993. Simultaneously, Thiessen guest starred on series such as _Married... with Children_, _Charles in Charge_ and _Step by Step_. In 1992, she starred in her first television movies _Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style_ and _A Killer Among Friends_, making her film debut in _Son in Law_ in 1993. She then continued with starring in spin-off _Saved by the Bell: The College Years_ in its single season (1993–94) and in television movie _Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas_ (1994), which marked the end of the original _Saved by the Bell_ series.

In 1994, after her tenure on _Saved by the Bell_ had ended, Thiessen landed the role of Valerie Malone in Fox's Aaron Spelling-produced hit teen-drama _Beverly Hills, 90210_, to fill the void after Shannen Doherty's departure. She was the first actress to join directly the main cast of the show and portrayed Valerie until 1998, when she left in the early episodes of the ninth season of the show. While starring in _90210_, Thiessen began to take on continuous dramatic leading roles in television films: _The Stranger Beside Me_ and _She Fought Alone_ in 1995, _Sweet Dreams_ and _Buried Secrets_ in 1996. After her departure from the show, she appeared in a number of films, including _Speedway Junky_ (1999), _From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money_ (1999), _Love Stinks_ (1999) and _The Ladies Man_ (2000); she also guest-starred on _NewsRadio_ (1999), _Two Guys and a Girl_ (2000), _Just Shoot Me!_ (2001) and _Good Morning, Miami_ (2003–04). In 2000, she was featured in the music video for "You're a God" by Vertical Horizon, portraying a beauty pageant contestant, in her first music video appearance. That year she also dropped her middle name which she had been including professionally for many years and is now credited as simply Tiffani Thiessen.[4] Thiessen was Spelling's first choice to replace Doherty in the series _Charmed_ in 2001, but she refused his offer because she was hoping the NBC pilot for _Everything But the Girl_ would be picked up.[5] The role eventually went to Rose McGowan.

Meanwhile, Thiessen starred in direct-to-video parody film _Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth_ (2000) and in television movie _Everything But the Girl_ (2001), before appearing in the Woody Allen-directed film _Hollywood Ending_ (2002) and starring in action drama series _Fastlane_ (2002–03) as Wilhelmina 'Billie' Chambers, for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice TV Actress in Drama/Action Adventure. In 2003, she launched her production company Tit 4 Tat Productions, producing and directing the short film _Just Pray_ in 2005,[6] which earned distinctions at several film festivals, including winning Best Score at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, an Academy Award-qualifying festival. The original motion picture soundtrack album, co-produced by Thiessen and Al Gomes of Big Noise, was placed on the Official Ballot for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards by The Recording Academy in several categories including Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.[7]

Later on, she starred in television movies _Stroller Wars_ (2006) and _Pandemic_ (2007), she joined the cast of ABC's drama _What About Brian_ (2007) for its last five episodes and starred in the science fiction film _Cyborg Soldier_ (2008). In 2008, she made her second music video appearance, this time for Ben Lee's "American Television". Thiessen appeared with her husband Brady Smith on the September 6, 2009 episode of season four of the reality show _HGTV Design Star_. Interior designer Lonni Paul, one of the final three contestants of the season, was given the task of redesigning Thiessen's guest bedroom with an eco-friendly theme; Thiessen and Paul now have a nursery furniture line called PetitNest.[8] From 2009 through 2014 Thiessen appeared in the USA Network crime series _White Collar_ as Elizabeth Burke.

On February 4, 2015, Thiessen reunited with Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Elizabeth Berkley, Dennis Haskins and Mario Lopez on _The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon_ where they appeared in a _Saved by the Bell_ sketch with Fallon.[9][10][11]

Also in 2015, Thiessen started hosting her own show on Cooking Channel called _Dinner at Tiffani's_. The series ended in 2017.

On June 7, 2017, Thiessen was cast as Lori Mendoza, mother of the Mendoza family on the multi camera Netflix sitcom _Alexa & Katie_, which premiered its first two seasons on March 23 and December 26, 2018.[12]


Personal life

In early 1992, Thiessen started dating Brian Austin Green, introduced by mutual friend David Faustino;[13] they moved in together in July 1994, but they broke up the next year.[14] In 1999, she went through a difficult period in her personal life, when David Strickland, also an actor, whom she had begun dating, committed suicide.[15] From 2001 to the spring of 2003, she was engaged to actor Richard Ruccolo, whom she had met during the _Two Guys and a Girl_ run.[16] She married actor Brady Smith on July 9, 2005,[17] and they have two children Harper Renn Smith, their daughter born in June 2010,[18] and Holt Fisher Smith, their son born in July 2015.[19]

Thiessen served as maid of honor at _90210_ co-star and best friend Jennie Garth's 2001 wedding to actor Peter Facinelli, with whom she co-starred on _Fastlane._ Garth and Thiessen's friendship has since come to an end.[20] Her friendship with fellow _90210_ star Tori Spelling also broke up, after Spelling's split from her first husband.[21]

In 2013, she participated in the One Bag party for April for Earth Month, in which the Glad company promoted "clean, green living".[22]


Public image

Thiessen was a teen idol during the 1990s, starting from her role as cheerleader Kelly Kapowski on _Saved by the Bell_ and then playing bad girl Valerie Malone on _Beverly Hills, 90210_. In a much-discussed moment, Justin Bieber appeared wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Thiessen in her _Saved by the Bell_ days at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards,[23] admitting his admiration for her. Basketball player Chris Paul also revealed publicly that he was a fan of Thiessen back then, when she sent him an autographed photograph of her _Saved by the Bell_-era for his 29th birthday in 2014.[24]
