SELECT (styled SELECT) is a United States-based charge card sometimes referred to as "Select Black Card." It is a members-only loyalty card that connects an existing credit or debit card of members to use for discounts at select locations. It was called the "Black Card for Millennials" and "AMEX for the Next Generation" by the Fox Business Network.[1]


History

SELECT was founded by Carlo Cisco who serves as its CEO.[2][3] It was launched in beta in New York in 2013, adding approximately 3,000 members in the first year.[4] SELECT was chosen to participate in Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator in 2015[5] and has since launched in other cities including Washington D.C., Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.[6][7]


Overview

Prospective members apply through a selective application process that accepts only 30-40% of applicants.[8] Once accepted, the SELECT card is linked to a member's existing credit or debit card.[9] Members can then use it to receive discounts at various locations such as select entertainment, hotels, and restaurants. It also provides members a 24/7 concierge service similar to that of the Centurion Card from American Express.[10]

SELECT has a member community wherein members can connect at events such as fashion shows and menu tastings.[11] According to the company, it is an opportunity for members to interact with like-minded professionals.[12] This card has a US$ 300 annual membership fee.
