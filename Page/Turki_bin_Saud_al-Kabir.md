TURKI BIN SAUD AL-KABEER (تركي بن سعود الكبير) was a Saudi prince and a direct successor of Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud. Based on the bloodline, his father, Saud Al-Kabeer was married to Abdul Aziz's sister called Nura. Saud Al-Kabeer was a prominent figure in the _majlis_ of internal advisers who were very close to Abdul Aziz who ruled the country until 1953.[1] Prince Turki's execution for murder was announced by Saudi state media on October 18, 2016.[2] He was the first member of the Saudi royal family to be executed since the execution of 19 year old Princess Mishaal bint Fahd bin Mohammed Al Saud in 1977.


Crime and punishment

Prince Turki pleaded guilty to the murder of Adel bin Suleiman bin Abdulkareem Al-Muhaimeed, whom he shot to death in 2012.[3][4] The victim was "a friend" of the shooter, who also injured other people in a brawl in the desert outside Riyadh.[5] After the victim's family refused offers of blood money,[6] he was executed by beheading.[7] It was the 134th execution of 2016 in Saudi Arabia.[8]


Execution

After the victim's father refused blood money from prince's father, the execution of the Saudi prince was continued. A few hours before the execution, Prince Turki was met by his friends and family within four hours. Meanwhile, awaiting for the execution, Prince Turki spent his time by praying and reading the Quran until the Fajr prayer. Around 7 A.M., the prison warden took him to the place where the prince was to write his last will. After he performed ablution, at 11 A.M., he was taken to the mosque. At the final hour before the execution, the prince’s father tried to convince the victim’s father to forgive the prince and to accept (blood money). However, the victim's father did not accept this offer nor did he forgive his son's killer. The attempt failed, and the execution continued immediately after at 4:13 P.M.[9]

Prince Turki's execution started significant discussion on Saudi social media, with interpreters from different parts of the country’s society taking to Twitter, predominantly in support of the Saudi authorities’ judgement to handle the case like any other Saudi citizen.[10]
