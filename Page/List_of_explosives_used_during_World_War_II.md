Almost all the common explosives listed here were mixtures of several common components:

-   Ammonium picrate
-   TNT (Trinitrotoluene)
-   PETN (Pentaerythritol tetranitrate)
-   RDX
-   Powdered aluminium.

This is only a partial list; there were many others. Many of these compositions are now obsolete and only encountered in legacy munitions and unexploded ordnance.

  Amatol                       Ammonium nitrate and TNT                                             Extensively used in bombs, shells, depth charges and naval mines
  Baronal                      Barium nitrate, TNT and powdered aluminium
  Baratol                      Barium nitrate and TNT                                               Used in British hand grenades
  Composition A                88.3% RDX and 11.7% plasticizer
  Composition B                RDX, TNT and wax
  Composition H6               45% RDX, 30% TNT, 20% powdered aluminium and 5% wax                  Replaced Torpex for use in naval applications.
  DBX (Depth Bomb Explosive)   21% RDX, 21% ammonium nitrate, 40% TNT, 18% powdered aluminium       An alternative for Torpex, that used less of the strategic material RDX
  Minol                        40% TNT, 40% ammonium nitrate and 20% powdered aluminium (Minol-2)   Developed by the British Royal Navy and used in torpedoes, depth charges and naval mines. Unsuitable for shells because of a risk of detonation if subjected to very high accelerations.
  Octol                        75% HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) and 25% TNT             Still in use
  Pentolites                   50% PETN and 50% TNT
  Picratol                     52% ammonium picrate and 48% TNT                                     Used in armour-piercing shells and bombs as insensitive to shock
  PIPE                         81% PETN and 19% oil
  PTX-1                        30% RDX, 50% tetryl and 20% TNT
  PTX-2                        41-44% RDX, 26-28% PETN and 28-33% TNT
  PVA-4                        90% RDX, 8% PVA and 2% dibutyl phthalate
  RIPE                         85% RDX and 15% oil
  Tetrytols                    70% Tetryl and 30% TNT
  Torpex                       42% RDX, 40% TNT and 18% powdered aluminium                          Developed for use in torpedoes, it was especially effective at producing destructive, underwater explosions.
  Trialen 105                  15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% powdered aluminium                          Used by the Luftwaffe
  Explosive "D"                Ammonium picrate                                                     US Army/Navy
  Type 91 Explosive            Trinitroanisol (TNA)                                                 Japanese Army/Navy

Two nuclear explosives, containing mixtures of uranium and plutonium, respectively, were also used at the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
