LINKIN PARK is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/keyboardist Joe Hahn, and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band.

Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with its debut studio album, _Hybrid Theory_ (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005, and multi-platinum in several other countries.[1] Its second album, _Meteora_ (2003), continued the band's success, topping the _Billboard_ 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work.[2] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in its first two albums,[3][4][5] the band explored other genres on its third album, _Minutes to Midnight_ (2007).[6][7] The album topped the _Billboard_ charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.[8][9]

Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in its fourth album, _A Thousand Suns_ (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, _Living Things_ (2012), combined musical elements from all of its previous records. Its sixth album, _The Hunting Party_ (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and its seventh album, _One More Light_ (2017), was a more electronic and pop-oriented record.[10][11]

Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists overall, having sold more than 70 million albums worldwide.[12][13][14][15] They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards and three World Music Awards.[16] In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.[17] _Billboard_ ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[18] In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.[19] In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now" by _Kerrang!_.[20][21]

Linkin Park has been on hiatus after longtime lead vocalist Bennington died from suicide by hanging on July 20, 2017. The other members of the band have yet to decide how to continue moving forward.


History

1996–2000: Early years

Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.[22][23] The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.[24][25] After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled _Xero_.[26][27] Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a record deal.[28] The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.[29][30] Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.[31][32]

After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.[33][34] Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style.[35] The band then agreed on changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.[36][37] In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'.[38]

The band's renaissance culminated with another change in name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park,[39] now called Christine Emerson Reed Park.[40] The band initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".[41] The band still struggled to sign a record deal. Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, who had negotiated his employment contract with Warner Brothers to include signing Linkin Park, and was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. Farrell returned the following year and the band released its breakthrough album, _Hybrid Theory_.[42]

2000–2002: _Hybrid Theory_ and _Reanimation_

During this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas.[50][51] The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, "Linkin Park Underground", in November 2001.[52][53] Linkin Park also formed its own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other notable artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg.[54] Within a year's stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts.[55] The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in its first DVD, _Frat Party at the Pankake Festival_, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed _Reanimation_, which would include works from _Hybrid Theory_ and non-album tracks.[56] _Reanimation_ debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others.[57] _Reanimation_ claimed the second spot on the _Billboard_ 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week.[58] _Hybrid Theory_ is also in the RIAA's _Top 100 Albums_.[59]

2002–2004: _Meteora_

Following the success of _Hybrid Theory_ and _Reanimation_, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio.[60] The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks.[61] _Meteora_ features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments.[62] Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition,[63] going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia.[64]

_Meteora_ sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time.[65] The album's singles, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Breaking the Habit", "Faint", and "Numb", received significant radio attention.[66] By October 2003, _Meteora_ sold nearly three million copies.[67] The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit.[68] Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones.[69] The band released an album and DVD, titled _Live in Texas_, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour.[70] In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the _Meteora World Tour_. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia.[71]

_Meteora_ earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for "Somewhere I Belong" and the Viewer's Choice Award for "Breaking the Habit".[72] Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year ("Numb") awards.[73] Although _Meteora_ was not nearly as successful as _Hybrid Theory_, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003.[74] The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts.[75] At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust and financial issues.[76] After months of feuding, the band finally negotiated a deal in December 2005.[77]

2004–2006: Side projects

Following _Meteora_'s success, the band worked on many side projects.[78] Bennington appeared on DJ Lethal's "State of the Art" and other work with Dead by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode.[79] In 2004, the band began to work with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled _Collision Course_. The album, which featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from both artists' previous albums, debuted in November 2004. Shinoda also formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released its debut album, _The Rising Tied_, to critical acclaim.[80][81]

On April 17, 2018, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, but did not win any of them.[207]

The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May 18, 2018.[208]

On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don’t know, almost like unhealthy.” When asked about the band's future minus Chester, Shinoda stated, “It’s not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester.”[209]


Philanthropy

On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled "Not Alone" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called _Download to Donate for Haiti_ in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011.

On January 11, 2011, an updated version of _Download to Donate for Haiti_ was launched, called _Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0_, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of "The Catalyst" from the "Linkin Park featuring YOU" contest.[210]

Shinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds will go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters.[211][212] Music for Relief released _Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan_, another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds will go to Save the Children.[213] The band released the song titled as "Issho Ni", meaning "we're in this together", on March 22, 2011 via _Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan_.

In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the show included The Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and The Filharmonic.[214][215]


Musical style and influences

Linkin Park combines elements of rock music, hip hop and electronica, and have been categorized as alternative rock,[216][217][218][219] nu metal,[220][221][222][223] alternative metal,[224][225] rap rock,[226][227][228] electronic rock,[229][230] hard rock,[231] hip hop,[232][233] rap metal,[234] pop,[235] industrial rock,[236] and pop rock.[237] Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.[238]

Both _Hybrid Theory_ and _Meteora_ combine the alternative metal,[239][240][241] nu metal,[242][243][244] rap rock,[245][246] rap metal,[247] and alternative rock[248][249] sound with influences and elements from hip hop, and electronica,[250][251] utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as "a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style,"[252] whereas _Rolling Stone_ described their song "Breaking the Habit" as "risky, beautiful art".[253]

In _Minutes to Midnight_ the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process _Los Angeles Times_ compares to a stage in U2's work.[254] Only two songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered alternative rock.[255][256]

The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda plays as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, _Minutes to Midnight_, Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left". On numerous songs from band's fourth album, _A Thousand Suns_, such as the album's singles ("The Catalyst", "Burning in the Skies", "Iridescent"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica.[257][258] James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead's _Kid A_,[259] while Jordy Kasko of _Review, Rinse, Repeat_ likened the album to both _Kid A_ and Pink Floyd's landmark album _The Dark Side of the Moon_.[260] Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: "Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively".[261] One of the record's political elements is its samples of notable speeches by American political figures.[262] _A Thousand Suns_ was described as trip hop,[263] electronic rock,[264][265] ambient,[266] alternative rock,[267] industrial rock,[268] experimental rock,[269] rap rock,[270] and progressive rock.[271]

Their fifth album, _Living Things_, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison.[272][273] The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on _The Hunting Party_, which was described as an alternative metal,[274][275][276] nu metal,[277] hard rock,[278][279] rap rock,[280] and rap metal album.[281] Their seventh album, _One More Light,_ was described as pop,[282][283] pop rock[284][285] and electropop.[286]

Linkin Park's influences include Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane's Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, and the Beatles.[287][288]

Worldwide, the album shipped over 3.3 million copies in its first four weeks of release.[306]

_The New York Times_{{'}} Jon Caramanica commented Linkin Park "brought the collision of hard rock and hip-hop to its commercial and aesthetic peak" at the beginning of the 2000s.[307] Several rock and non-rock artists have cited Linkin Park as an influence, including Proyecto Eskhata,[308] Of Mice & Men,[309] One Ok Rock,[310] Bishop Nehru,[311] Misono, From Ashes to New,[312] Bring Me the Horizon,[313] Red, Girl on Fire, Manafest, Silentó,[314] 3OH!3,[315] The Prom Kings,[316] AJ Tracey,[317] Kiiara,[318] The Chainsmokers,[319] Kevin Rudolf,[320] Blackbear,[321] Amber Liu,[322] Tokio Hotel,[323] Stormzy[324] and Imagine Dragons.[325]
