EAST LAKE is an extinct town in New Madrid County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1]

A post office called Eastlake was established in 1892, and remained in operation until 1905.[2] The community was so named on account of a nearby (former) lake which lied in the eastern section of New Madrid County.[3]
