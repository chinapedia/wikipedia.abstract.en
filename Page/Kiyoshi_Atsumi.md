KIYOSHI ATSUMI (渥美 清 _Atsumi Kiyoshi_), born YASUO TADOKORO (田所 康雄 _Tadokoro Yasuo_, 10 March 1928 in Tokyo – 4 August 1996 in Tokyo), was a Japanese film actor. He started his career in 1951 as a comedian at a strip-show theater in Asakusa. After two years of fighting pulmonary tuberculosis, he made his debut on TV in 1956 and on film in 1957. His vivid performance of a lovable, innocent man in a film “Dear Mr. Emperor” (_Haikei Tenno-Heika-Sama_) in 1963 established his reputation as an actor.

Later he became the star of the highly popular _Tora-san series of films_, from the original _Otoko wa Tsurai yo_(translated in English as, 'It's Tough being a Man') in 1969 to the 48th film released in 1995, the year before his death.

The enduring success of the series made him synonymous with the Tora-san character, and many Japanese regarded his death as the death of Tora-san, not the death of Yasuo Tadokoro or Kiyoshi Atsumi.
