_EUCALYPTUS LANE-POOLEI_, commonly known as SALMON WHITE GUM, is a eucalypt that is native to Western Australia.[1]

The mallee or tree typically grows to a height of with bark that is mostly smooth. It blooms between January and April or June to September producing inflorescences with white-cream coloured flowers.[2] Flowering is unpredictable and individuals may possibly bloom at any time of year.[3] It has mottled bark which has colours ranging from a whitish grey to an orange-brown making it quite distinctive. The evergreen tree and glossy green foliage. Prior to flowering it forms ornamental globose buds.[4] The branches of the main stem are twisting and spreading and the lignotuber is large, allowing regeneration after fire. New branches may emerge from the bole without response to fire, and these intertwine with the older trunk to produce a tangled and irregular appearance as mature trees.[5]

It is found on slopes and creek banks along the west coast in the Wheatbelt, Peel and South West regions of Western Australia extending from Coorow in the north to Busselton in the south where it grows sandy or sandy-loam soils containing lateritic or granitic gravel.[6] It is native through most of the range but has become naturalised elsewhere. A distinct population is found on the western side of the Darling Range. Associated species in the understorey include _Banksia nivea_ or _Baumea preissii_.[7] The species favour Guildford soil of the Perth metropolitan region, on the Swan Coastal Plain, and occurs on wetter sites that inhibit otherwise dominant eucalypts, _Eucalyptus calophylla_ (marri) and _E. wandoo_. [8]

The species name _lane-poolei_ honours the Western Australian forester Charles Edward Lane-Poole, who collected the type at Beenup (Byford) in 1919.[9][10] The author of the first description, made the same year, was Joseph Maiden.[11]
