Loika hosted a podcast titled _Loikamania_, where he would interview individuals involved in the comic industry, until it ended in 2016. _Buzzfeed_ described his efforts in interviewing comic book creators as being "the closest thing comics has to an Oprah".[5] After completing his final episode of _Loikamania_, Loika hosted a panel at Comic-Con International.[6] Loika, had previously been a panelist at the same convention in 2014.[7]

During the first decade of the 21st century, after having his artwork reviewed by Marvel, Loika went on to write a western story in Image Comics' _Outlaw Territory_. The project involved Garry Henderson and Michael Woods.[8]

In early July 2013, Comic Book Resources featured his collection on a segment called "Shelf Porn".[9] Later that month, Loika was stuck in an elevator, tweeting about his experience.[10] Bleeding Cool published an article about this event.[11] Due to his efforts of being a booster in the comic book industry, _Playboy Philippines_ interviewed Loika and published the interview in their July 2014 issue.[12]

In addition to creating a podcast, Loika is also a photographer.[13] His photographs, largely of cosplay, have been featured or utilized on _Vanity Fair_,[14] _The Mary Sue_,[15] _Nerdist_,[16] and MTV.[17]
