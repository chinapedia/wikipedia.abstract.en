_MONOPOLY_ is a 1985 multi-platform video game based on the board game _Monopoly_, released on the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, MSX, Tatung Einstein, Thomson MO, Thomson TO, and ZX Spectrum. Published by Leisure Genius, this title was one of many inspired by the property.


Gameplay

The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations.


Critical reception

Computer Shopper praised the game for its graphics and animation, and deemed it "excellent value".[1] Your Spectrum thought the game was an "excellent conversion" of the board game,[2] while Sinclair User wrote that the game was "very boring".[3] One issue of Amiga Power deemed it a "sound conversion" albeit more expensive than its source material,[4] while another from the same publication said it was competent but "arguably quite pointless".[5]
