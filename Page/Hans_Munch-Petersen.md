Munch-Petersen worked eagerly for reforms in the examination studio; His primer _Den borgerlige Ret i Hovedtræk_ (The Civil Court of Main) (1901, 5th edition 1921 plus 1922), and his practical collection _Retstilfælde til Brug ved det juridiske Studium_ (Legal Cases to Use at the Law Study) (1901, 3rd edition 1922), was widely circulated and appreciated. At close range had Munch-Petersen studied the process of reform started in Europe, particularly in Austria. While his work _Den danske Civilproces i Hovedtræk_ (In 1906, II 1908 III 1915 IV 1911 2nd edition, 1915) was intended to replace Nellemanns and Deuntzers representations of the moulting process, claimed that he, partly under the influence of the foreign received impression, considerable work for the effective establishment of a Danish legal reform, so the scriptures _Retsreformen med Hensyn til vor Strafferetspleje_ (1902), _Den nye Retspleje belyst i sine Grundtræk_ (1908) and Retspleje og Kultur (University Programme 1913), numerous papers and articles in _Tilskueren_, _Det ny Aarhundrede_ and especially _Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen_, whose literary department he edited 1906-20, and in its edition of _Lov om Rettens Pleje_ (1908, 1909).
