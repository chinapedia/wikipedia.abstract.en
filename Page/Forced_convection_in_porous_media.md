Forced convection is type of heat transport in which fluid motion is generated by an external source like a (pump, fan, suction device, etc.). Heat transfer through porus media is very effective and efficiently. Porous medium is defined as a material volume consisting of solid matrix with an interconnected void. Flow in porous media have revealed the Darcy law< which relates linearly the flow velocity to the pressure gradient across the porous medium. Forced convection heat transfer in a confined porous medium has been a subject of intensive studies during the last decades because of its wide applications, including: Chemical, Environmental, Mechanical, Geological and Petroleum.

The basic problem in heat convection through porous media consists of predicting the heat transfer rate between a deferentially heated, solid impermeable surface and a fluid-saturated porous medium.We begin with constant wall temperature.[1]

In 2D steady state system

∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y = 0

According to Darcy's law

u =  − (K/μ)∂P/∂x

v =  − (K/μ)∂P/∂y

$u\partial T/\partial x+v\partial T/\partial y = \boldsymbol{\alpha}{\partial^2\over\partial x^2}T$

u=U_(∞) v = 0

P(x) =  − (μ/K)U∞x + constant

Let δ_(t) be the thickness of the slender layer of length x that affects the temperature transition from T₀ to T_(∞).

Balancing the energy equation between enthalpy flow in the x direction and thermal diffusion in the y direction

U_(∞)∂T/∂x ∼ αΔT/δ_(t)²

boundary is slender so δ_(t) <  < x

δ_(t)/x ∼ Pe_(x)^(−).5

Nu = hx/K ∼ x/δ_(t) ∼ Pe_(x)^(0.5)

The PECLET NUMBER is a dimensionless NUMBER used in calculations involving convective heat transfer. It is the ratio of the thermal energy convected to the fluid to the thermal energy conducted within the fluid.

Pe_(x) = Advective transport rate / Diffusive transport rate

Pe_(x) = U_(∞)x/α
