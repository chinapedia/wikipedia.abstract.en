SEBASTIÁN OBANDO GIRALDO known professionally as SEBASTIÁN YATRA (born October 15, 1994) is a Colombian singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit "Traicionera".[1]

His family moved to Cartagena, and at age 5 he settled in Miami. He studied piano, guitar and vocal technique, and was an avid footballer before deciding to concentrate on his music, although he continues to practice soccer as a hobby. He started writing songs early and in September 2013, had his first great hit single "El psicólogo" that charted in his home country Colombia, and all over Latin America notably in Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico and the United States. He was declared revelation of the year in Colombia and an artist with great following.[2]

"El Psicólogo", a pop ballad with reggae influences was recorded in the United States, and produced by well-known Latin producers Yhonny Atella and Ender Thomas, mastered by Tom Coynequien and music video shot by Colombian director Simón Brand.[3] Yatra toured with Paty Cantú in her Drama Queen Tour and with Sandoval Sandoval in her Deja Que La Vida Te Sorprenda Tour gaining more fame. His follow-up single "Todo Lo Que Siento" was mildly successful, but the ensuing "Para olvidar" became a big hit in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and yet again in the States.[4]

2015 saw launching of two successful singles, "No me llames" featuring Alkilados and "Como Mirarte", a repeat hit first as solo and again in a collaboration featuring Kenai and remixed by producers like Kevin ADG, Chan El Genio and Dandee. But it was Yatra's 2016 song, Traicionera[5] a huge Reggaeton and Trap EDM hit for him that solidified his status as a favorite international artist in Latin America, in the Latin market in the States also charting in Spain and finding success all over Europe. The single was classified double platinum in Colombia, platinum in Ecuador, hit or miss. In January 2019 Sebastián Yatra and Reik launched a collaborative work titled “Un Año” (one year). The single was received by many Venezuelan migrants who identify the song lyrics with separations from families, friends and even pets. [6] The single was released alongside his new album “Fantasia” which was released in April 2019.
