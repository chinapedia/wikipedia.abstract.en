ST MARY'S CHURCH, THIRSK is a Church of England parish church in Thirsk, North Yorkshire. The church is a grade I listed building.


History

The church dates from the 15th century.[1]

The living was augmented in 1811 with £1,200 () and in 1824 with another £400 () both by parliamentary grant by lot. In 1834 there was another grant of £400 () to meet the benefaction of a stipend of £30 per year by Archbishop Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt as a perpetual augmentation.

In 1857 the porch on the south side was rebuilt.

It was restored in 1877 by George Edmund Street.[2] During the restoration of 1877 it was reported that the East window of the south aisle contained the royal arms of England quartered with France, with the motto “Dieu et mon droit.” There were also the arms of the Ascough family, those of Mowbray, of Sir James Strangways, and Elizabeth his wife, and members of their family.

The church re-opened on 2 October 1877.[3]

Bells

In 1859 the tower had four bells. The largest dating as far back as 1410 was reputed to have been brought from Fountains Abbey. The other three were cast in 1729, 1775 and 1805. Between 1857 and 1864 two new bells were added to the peal and two more in 1871. Since the peal was augmented to eight, then only the sixth bell has been recast in 1926.[9]
