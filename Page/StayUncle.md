STAYUNCLE is a hotel booking website in India for both married and unmarried couples.[1][2][3] The site books hotel rooms in 40 Indian cities, who will now allow unmarried couples coming from StayUncle with local ID proof to stay in their properties. The site also allows booking of rooms for 12 hours, rather than the customary 24.[4]

The company was initially co-founded in 2014 by Blaze Arizanov and Sanchit Sethi, as hourly based hotel booking portal for business and transit travelers but has reoriented towards the young couples segment at the beginning of 2015.[5] Arizanov is now Chief Marketing Officer; Sethi is Chief Executive Officer..

Investors in the company include Ajay Naqvi, the former country head of Airbnb India.
