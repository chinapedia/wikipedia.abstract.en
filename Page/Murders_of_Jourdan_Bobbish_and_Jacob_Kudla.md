In 2012, Jourdan Bobbish and Jacob Kudla were two American teenagers tortured and murdered in Detroit after attempting to purchase drugs. The suspects in the killings were Frederick Young and Felando Hunter, who were sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015.[1][2][3][4][5][6]


Victims

Jacob Kudla, 18, was a student at Schoolcraft College. Jourdan Bobbish, 17, was a high school senior.[7]


Aftermath

When Kudla and Bobbish were reported missing, an area-wide search was mounted.[8][9] Their bodies were discovered in a vacant parking lot by a waste picker.[10][11] They were later found to have been unusually brutally murdered.[12][13]

Details of the murders emerged during the trial. A witness said that she heard the victims begging for their lives, and that the suspects told them they could leave but killed them anyway.[14][15]

During sentencing in 2015, the suspects maintained an unrepentant attitude, yawning and shifting in their seats.[16] Before being sentenced Young gave a statement to the court saying "I'd like to say sorry to the family of Aiyana Jones, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and I want to apologize for them for not being able to get justice for their loved ones who were murdered in cold blood and in respect for the peaceful protest I want to say hands up, don't shoot, black lives matter," Young said.[17][18] Video of his statement went viral.[19]

Hunter had already been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the unrelated August 2012 murder of John Villneff, a military veteran, on Rutland Street in Detroit.[20]


Hate Crime

Despite the statements[21][22] made in court by one of the defendants, the unusually brutal nature of the murders[23][24], and the apparent absence of any other motivating factor, neither murder was prosecuted as a hate crime.
