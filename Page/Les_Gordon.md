MARC MIFUNE (born in Rennes, France),[1] whose stage name is LES GORDON, is a French electronic musician and songwriter.[2]


Early life

Gordon went to the École des Beaux-Arts.[3][4] Originally from Rennes,[5] he studied at the École Émile-Cohl in Lyon. His father is Taiwanese[6][7] and his stage name comes from the Scottish artist Douglas Gordon.[8] He notably studied cello and guitar.[9]


Career

Mifune began creating his first tracks under the pseudonym Morning Crash, when he began learning how to make computer-aided music.[10] His current stage name, Les Gordon, is a reference to Douglas Gordon, videographer and visual artist; "Les" is an English name that references British artists such as Four Tet, Gold Panda, Mount Kimbie and many others.[11]

Mifune has been an opening act for Stromae (Rencontres Trans Musicales of 2013), Madeon (Le Trianon) and Fauve[12][13] (eighteen representations [14]).

He composed _Saisons_ (2014), _Les cheveux longs_ (2015) and _Atlas_ (2016),[15] along with a collaboration EP, _Croquis n°1_ (2015).[16] and signed to the French label Kitsuné[17] after leaving the label Allo Floride.[18]

He has a band, which is called Singapour (2015), where Gordon is a producer and his friend Roman Oswald writes lyrics.[19]

He is featured in several duos such as Mondrian with Roman Oswald[20] and Leska with Douchka.[21]
