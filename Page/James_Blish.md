JAMES BENJAMIN BLISH (May 23, 1921 – July 30, 1975) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer. He is best known for his _Cities in Flight_ novels, and his series of _Star Trek_ novelizations written with his wife, J. A. Lawrence. He is credited with creating the term gas giant to refer to large planetary bodies.

Blish was a member of the Futurians.[1] His first published stories appeared in _Super Science Stories_ and _Amazing Stories_.

Blish wrote literary criticism of science fiction using the pen name WILLIAM ATHELING JR. His other pen names included DONALD LAVERTY, JOHN MACDOUGAL, and ARTHUR LLOYD MERLYN.


Early life

Blish was born on May 23, 1921 at East Orange, New Jersey.[2] While in high school, Blish self-published a fanzine using a hectograph, called _The Planeteer_.[3] The fanzine ran for six issues. Blish attended meetings of the Futurian Science Fiction Society in New York City during this period.

Futurian members Damon Knight and Cyril M. Kornbluth became close friends. However, Blish's relationships with other members were often bitter.[4] A personal target was fellow member Judith Merril, with whom he would debate politics. Merril would frequently dismiss Blish's self-description of being a "paper fascist". She wrote in _Better to Have Loved_ (2002), "Of course [Blish] was not fascist, antisemitic, or any of those terrible things, but every time he used the phrase, I saw red."[5]

The United States Army discharged him for refusing orders to clean a grease trap in 1944. Following discharge, Blish entered Columbia University as a masters student of zoology. He did not complete the program, opting to write fiction full-time.[6]

In 1947, he married Virginia Kidd, a fellow Futurian. They divorced in 1963. Blish then married artist J. A. Lawrence in 1968, moving to England that same year.

From 1962 to 1968, Blish worked for the Tobacco Institute, as a writer and critic. Much of his work for the institute went uncredited.

Blish died on July 30, 1975 from complications related to lung cancer. He was buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. The Bodleian Library at Oxford is the custodian of Blish's papers.[7] The library also has a complete catalog of Blish's published works.

Career

Throughout the 1940s, Blish published most of his stories in the few pulp magazines still in circulation. His first story was sold to fellow Futurian Frederik Pohl for _Super Science Stories_ (1940), called "Emergency Refueling". Other stories were published intermittently, but with little circulation. Blish's "Chaos, Co-Ordinated", co-written with Robert A. W. Lowndes, was sold to _Astounding Science Fiction_, appearing in the October 1946 issue, earning Blish national circulation for the first time.

Pantropy (1942–1956)

Blish was what Andrew Litpack called a "practical writer".[8] He would revisit, revise, and often expand on previously written stories. An example is "Sunken Universe" published in _Super Science Stories_ in 1942. The story reappeared in _Galaxy Science Fiction_ as "Surface Tension", in an altered form in 1952. The premise emphasised Blish's understanding of microbiology, and featured microscopic humans engineered to live on a hostile planet's shallow pools of water. The story proved to be among Blish's more popular, and was anthologized in _The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964_, edited by Robert Silverberg.[9]

The world of microscopic humans continued in "The Thing in the Attic" in 1954, and "Watershed" the following year. The fourth entry, "A Time to Survive", was published by _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_ in 1957. The stories were collected, edited together, and released as the fix-up _The Seedling Stars_ (1956) from Gnome Press. John Clute said of all of Blish's "deeply felt work" explored "confronting the Faustian (or Frankensteinian) man".[10]

_Cities in Flight_ (1950–1958)

_The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ asserts that it was not until the 1950s, and the Okie sequence of stories beginning their run, "did it become clear [Blish] would become a [science fiction] writer of unusual depth".[11] The stories were loosely based on the Okie migration following the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and were influenced by Oswald Spengler's two-part _Der Untergang des Abendlandes_ (_The Decline of the West_)_._

The stories detail the life of the Okies, humans who migrate throughout space looking for work in vast city-ships, powered by spindizzies, a type of anti-gravity engine. The premise and plot reflected Blish's feelings on the state of western civilization, and his personal politics.[12] The first two stories, "Okie", and "Bindlestiff", were published in 1950, by _Astounding_. "Sargasso of Lost Cities" appeared in _Two Complete Science-Adventure Books_ in April 1953. "Earthman, Come Home" followed a few months later, published by _Astounding_. In 1955, Blish collected the four stories together into an omnibus titled _Earthman, Come Home_, published by Putman.

More stories followed: In 1956, _They Shall Have Stars_, which edited together "Bridge" and "At Death’s End", and in 1958, Blish released _The Triumph of Time_. Four years later, he published a new Okies novel, _A Life for the Stars_. The Okies sequence was edited together and published as _Cities In Flight_ (1970).

Clute notes, "the brilliance of _Cities in Flight_ does not lie in the assemblage of its parts, but in the momentum of the ideas embodied in it (albeit sometimes obscurely)."[13] Two_complete_science_adventure_books_1953spr_n8.jpg'' in 1953. ]]

_After Such Knowledge_ (1958–1971)

Blish continued to rework older stories, and did so for one of his best known works, _A Case of Conscience_ (1958). The novel originated as a novella, originally published in an issue of _If_, in 1953. The story follows a Jesuit priest, Ramon Ruiz-Sanchez, who visits the planet Lithia as a technical member of an expedition. While on the planet they discover a race of bipedal reptilians that have perfected morality in what Ruiz-Sanchez says is "the absence of God", and theological complications ensue. The book is one of the first major works in the genre to explore religion and its implications. It was the first of a series including _Doctor Mirabilis_ (1964) and the two-part story _Black Easter_ (1968), and _The Day After Judgment_ (1971). The latter two were collected as _The Devil's Day_ (1980). An omnibus of all four entries in the series was released by Legend in 1991, titled _After Such Knowledge_.

_A Case of Conscience_ won the 1959 Hugo Award for Best Novel,[14] and was collected as part of Library of America’s omnibus _American Science Fiction: Five Classic Novels 1956-1958_.[15]

_Star Trek_ (1967–1977)

Blish was commissioned by Bantam Books to adapt episodes of _Star Trek_. The adapted short stories were generally based on draft scripts, and contained differing plot elements, and situations present in the aired television episodes.

The stories were collected into twelve volumes, and published as a title series of the same name from 1967 to 1977. The adaptations were largely written by Blish, however, his declining health during this period proved problematic. His wife, J. A. Lawrence, wrote a number of installments, however, her work remained uncredited until the final volume, _Star Trek 12_ released in 1977, two years after Blish's death.[16]

The original novel based on the television series, _Spock Must Die!_ (1970), was also written by Blish, and he planned to release more. According to Lawrence, two episodes featuring popular character Harry Mudd, "I, Mudd" and "Mudd's Women", were held back by Blish for adaptation to be included in the follow-up to _Spock Must Die!_.[17] However, Blish died before a novel could be completed. Lawrence did eventually adapt the two episodes, as _Mudd's Angels_ (1978), which included an original novella _Business, as Usual, During Altercations_ by Lawrence.

Blish credited his financial stability later in life to the _Star Trek_ commission, and the advance he received for _Spock Must Die!_.[18]


Literary criticism and legacy

Blish was among the first literary critics of science fiction, and he judged works in the genre by the standards applied to "serious" literature.[19] He took to task his fellow authors for deficiencies, such as bad grammar and a misunderstanding of scientific concepts, and the magazine editors, who accepted and published such material without editorial intervention. His critiques were published in "fanzines" in the 1950s under the pseudonym William Atheling Jr.

The essays were collected in _The Issue at Hand_ (1964) and _More Issues at Hand_ (1970). Reviewing _The Issue at Hand_, Algis Budrys said that Atheling had, along with Damon Knight, "transformed the reviewer's trade in this field". He described the persona of Atheling as "acidulous, assertive, categorical, conscientious and occasionally idiosyncratic".[20]

Blish was a fan of the works of James Branch Cabell, and for a time edited _Kalki_, the journal of the Cabell Society.

In his works of science fiction, James Blish developed many ideas and terms which have influenced other writers and on occasion have been adopted more widely, such as faster than light communication via the dirac computer, introduced in the short story "Beep" (1954). The dirac is comparable to Ursula K. Le Guin's ansible.

Blish is also credited with coining the term gas giant, in the story "Solar Plexus" as it appeared in the anthology _Beyond Human Ken_, edited by Judith Merril. The story was originally published in 1941, but did not contain the term. Blish reworked the story, changing the description of a large magnetic field to "a magnetic field of some strength nearby, one that didn't belong to the invisible gas giant revolving half a million miles away".[21]
