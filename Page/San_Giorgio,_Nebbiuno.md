History

A church dedicated to San Giorgio was likely erected under Lombard rule. Originally, a single nave, over the centuries the church was enlarged, and in the 18th century, lateral naves were added. In 1775, the present bell-tower erected. Above the entrance portal is a fresco depicting _St George slaying the Dragon_. The Chapel of the Crucifix has a baroque marble altar, and the Chapel of the Madonna del Rosario has a 16th-century wooden statue of the Virgin.[1]
