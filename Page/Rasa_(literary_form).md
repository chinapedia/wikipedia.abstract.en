_RASA_ () or _RASO_ is a certain didactic literary form in Apabhramsa. It is a genre of poetry in Old Gujarati language popular during early period of Gujarati literature. Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with _Prabandha_ of medieval literature.


History

_Rasa_ developed during the period of Gurjar Apbhramsa. It is a period between Hemachandra and Narsinh Mehta. They are mostly written by Jain monks and were performed in Jain temples on certain occasions.[1] Early examples are _Updeshrasayan Rasa_ (1143) by Jinadattasuri, _Bharateshwar-Bahubali Raso_ (1184) by Shilabhadrasuri, _Jeevdaya Raso_ (1200) by Asigu. _Sandesa Rasak_ (15th century) by Abdul Rahman is one example of non-Jain composition. The literary tradition till 19th century. _Gajsinh-Raja-no-Rasa_ (1851) is one late example.[2][3]


Form

During its earliest form, it was a musical _Roopaka_ (theatrical performance). Vagbhatta describes _Rasaka_ as a soft and vigorous musical _Roopaka_ with a variety of _Tala_ (beat or measure) and _Laya_ (rhythm). _Rasaka_ was played by female dancers. The number of pairs participating can increase up to 64.[4][5]

There were two types of _Rasa_s; _Tala Rasa_ and _Lakuta Rasa_. In _Tala Rasa_ the beats of time were matched by claps of hands while in _Lakuta Rasa_ it was matched by clashing of wooden sticks in the hands of performers. So the _Rasa_ was a type of literature intended to performed by pairs of females dancing and singing in a circle. _Tala Rasa_s were mostly played by females while _Lakuta Rasa_s were mostly played by males. The form is somewhat similar to _Rasa_ dance played in _Rasa lila_.[6][7][8][9]

As the early _Rasa_s were intended to be performed, they were not lengthy. But over the years, they became lengthy and narrative with elements of story. So the performance aspect may have been diminished. It is doubtful that the _Rasa_s written in 17th and 18th centuries were actually performed. It is most likely that they were only recited.[10][11]

The _Rasa_s were written in a variety of metres like Doha, Chaupai or Deshi. _Rasa_s were divided into _Khanda_ and different parts were called _Bhasha_, _Thavani_, _Kadavaka_.[12][13]

They had historical as well as mythological themes.[14] Due to their basic composition meant to be didactic, the early _Rasa_ like the _Buddhi Rasa_ includes only words of advice. In late compositions of 16th to 18th century, they reads heavy and artificial due to incorporation of elements of narration, description, moral instructions and sectarian principles.[15][16]
