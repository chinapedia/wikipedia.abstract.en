Kacimi is the author of several novels, plays and non-fiction books. His first novel, _Le mouchoir_, was turned down fourteen times before it was published by L'Harmattan in 1987.[6] His 2006 play, _Terre sainte_, received a good review from _Le Figaro_ when it was performed in Avignon in 2013.[7] Meanwhile, Kacimi also worked as a translator and a ghostwriter.[8] He was also a contributor to _Actuel_, a French magazine, and he produced _Les Chemins de la connaissance_ on France Culture.[9] In 2005, he was, with others authors such as Alain Decaux, Richard Millet and Jean-Pierre Thiollet, one of the Beirut Book Fair's guests in the Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center, commonly (BIEL).[10]

Kacimi is a critic of Al Jazeera.[11] In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting of 7 January 2015, he wrote a Facebook post relating remarks voiced by teenagers from Val-de-Marne against Charlie Hebdo; however, he was unable to explain where he had heard them specifically, leading _Marianne_ and other media outlets to wonder if he had made them up.[12]
