_MAMMON_, originally exhibited as _MAMMON DEDICATED TO HIS WORSHIPPERS_, is an 1885 oil painting by English artist George Frederic Watts, currently in Tate Britain. One of a number of paintings by Watts in this period on the theme of the corrupting influence of wealth, _Mammon_ shows a scene from Edmund Spenser's _The Faerie Queene_ in which Mammon, the embodiment of greed, crushes the weak through his indifference to their plight. This reflected Watts's belief that wealth was taking the place of religion in modern society, and that this worship of riches was leading to social deterioration. The painting was one of a group of works Watts donated to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886, and in 1897 it was one of 17 Watts paintings transferred to the newly created Tate Gallery. Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, the popularity of reproductions made _Mammon_ one of Watts's better known paintings.


Background

George_Frederic_Watts_by_Henry_Herschel_Hay_Cameron.jpg George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to Watts developing a deep knowledge of the Bible but a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and at the age of 16 was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter and as a cricket illustrator. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by renowned artist Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.

In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy, where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from depression, and painted a number of notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded. In 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works were shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, believed to have been the first such exhibition by any artist.


Subject

Watts_–_The_Wife_of_Plutus.jpg Mammon originally meant wealth in Aramaic, but from the early days of the Christian Church the name was occasionally used to represent the personification of greed. This notion of Mammon as an individual, rather than an abstract concept, became commonplace in English culture owing to Edmund Spenser's _The Faerie Queene_, published in the late 16th century, and later in John Milton's _Paradise Lost_ (1667), both of which treated Mammon as an individual exemplar of greed. As was the case with almost all English artists of the period, Watts was heavily influenced by the works of both Spenser and Milton.

Watts based _Mammon_ on a scene from Book II of _The Faerie Queene_ in which the protagonist Guyon encounters Mammon in a cave containing .[1] _Mammon_ was one of a series Watts painted at around this time on the theme of the corruption brought about by wealth, including _The Wife of Plutus_ (1880s ), _Sic Transit_ (1880–1882) and _For he had Great Possessions_ (1894).


Composition

Watts depicted Mammon as a corrupted version of traditional images of the gods. This reflected his belief that the worship of wealth was taking the place of traditional beliefs in modern society, and that this attitude, which he described as "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity", was leading to social decay. (His widow, Mary Seton Watts, wrote in 1912 that Watts had said that "Mammon sits supreme, while great art, as a child of the nation, cannot find a place; the seat is not wide enough for both".) Mammon wears gold and scarlet robes, and crushes "whatever is weak and gentle and timid and lovely". Watts aimed to show Mammon not as crushing the weak through deliberate cruelty, but through an indifference to the damage he was causing. His headdress resembles donkey's ears, an allusion to Thomas Carlyle's description of "serious, most earnest Mammonism grown Midas-eared" in _Past and Present_.


Reception and legacy

Assistants_and_George_Frederic_Watts_-_Hope_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg thought _Mammon_ a companion to _Hope_ (1886).|alt=blind girl sitting on an orange ball]] _Mammon_ was first exhibited in 1885, under the title of _Mammon Dedicated to his Worshippers_. The catalogue accompanying this exhibition described this unusual title as "righteously scornful". Aside from an oil sketch now in the Watts Gallery, only one completed version of _Mammon_ was made. This was among a number of paintings donated by Watts to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886. In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly-created Tate Gallery (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works.

Watts_–_Progress_(Watts_Gallery_version).jpg Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, cheap photographic reproductions of _Mammon_ made by Frederick Hollyer circulated widely, making it one of Watts's better-known paintings. In 1887 it was one of the paintings discussed by Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth in his series of lectures on "Religion in Recent Art". Forsyth considered _Mammon_ a companion to Watts's 1885 _Hope_, arguing that both depicted false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them in the absence of faith. By 1904 the image was well-enough known that the _Daily Express_ reproduced the head of _Mammon_ alongside that of John D. Rockefeller, a person of whom the newspaper greatly disapproved, implicitly inviting readers to draw comparisons.

Watts returned to the theme of greed in _Progress_ (1902–1904), one of his final works. This shows the figure of Mammon as one of three figures representing what Watts called "non-progress"; academia, wealth and laziness, oblivious to the emergence of Progress on horseback behind them. The central figure was described by Watts as "money grubbing"; as with _Mammon_ and many of his other works, Watts aimed to show spiritual and material values as inherently contradictory.
