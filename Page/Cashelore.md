CASHELORE, also called CASHEL BIR or BAWNBOY, is a stone ringfort (cashel) and National Monument located in County Sligo, Ireland.[1]


Location

Cashelore is located on the southern slopes of Benbo Mountain, 1.3 km (¾ mile) northwest of Ballintogher.[2]


History

Cashelore was built in the early Christian period (AD 400–1100). The name may mean "Fort Pride", while Cashel Bir is _caiseal bir_, "stone ringfort of stakes", presumably meaning that there was a palisade surrounding it, and Bawnboy is _bábhún buidhe_, "yellow walled enclosure."[3]

Skeletons were formerly found near the fort.

It is believed to be identical with _Caislen-in-nuabhair_, mentioned in the Annals of Loch Cé, entry for 1389:

The O'Rourkes were kings of West Breifne (roughly County Leitrim), while the Ó hÉilidhe (Healys) were based around the Curlew Mountains, Ballinafad and the west of Lough Arrow. _Per dolum_ is Latin for "by trickery." The Ó Fearghail ruled Angaile (roughly County Longford).[4]


Description

This is a stone ringfort long E-W and NS, with walls thick and high.[5]

A souterrain led to the bottom of the hill and could have functioned as an escape route.[6][7]
