The 2020 UTAH GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the Governor of Utah, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Although incumbent Republican Governor Gary Herbert is eligible to run for re-election, he initially announced shortly after being re-elected in 2016 that he would not run for a third full term,[1] but indicated in January 2019 that he was open to the possibility of running again[2] before ultimately deciding to retire and endorse his Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox[3]
