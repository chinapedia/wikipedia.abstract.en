The FOREIGN RELATIONS OF SYRIAN OPPOSITION refers to the external relations of the self-proclaimed oppositional Syrian Arab Republic, which sees itself as the genuine Syria. The region of control of Syrian opposition affiliated groups is not well defined. The Turkish government recognizes Syrian opposition as the genuine Syrian Arab Republic and hosts several of its institutions on its territory. The seat of Syria in the Arab League is reserved for the Syrian opposition since 2014.


Diplomatic relations of opposition groups

The Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) was formed in Doha in November 2012, and declared itself the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, calling on states to recognize it. It was recognized by the six member States (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait) of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) within a day.[1] The Arab League "urged regional and international organisations to recognise it [SOC] as a legitimate representative for the aspirations of the Syrian people”, and called it “a legitimate representative and a primary negotiator with the Arab League", but did not recognise it as the sole representative of the Syrian people.[2][3] France was the first Western country to give recognition to the SOC on 13 November 2012, followed by Turkey on 15 November.[4] On 19 November, Italy and the European Union's Foreign Ministers stated recognition of the SOC as _a_ (rather than the sole) legitimate representative of the Syrian people.[5][6] Over the following weeks, Britain recognised it as the sole representative,[7] and Germany, Denmark, Norway, the Benelux countries and the US recognised it as "the" legitimate representative.[8] Similar wording was used by the 114 member Friends of Syria group of states in December 2012.[9]
