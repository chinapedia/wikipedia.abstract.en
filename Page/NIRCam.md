NIRCAM is an instrument aboard the to-be-launched James Webb Space Telescope. It has two major tasks, as an imager from 0.6 to 5 micron light wavelength, and as a wavefront sensor to keep the 18-section mirrors functioning as one.[1][2] In other words, it is a camera and is also used to provide information to align the 18 segments of the primary mirror.[3] It is an infrared camera with ten mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) detector arrays, and each array has an array of 2048x2048 pixels.[4][5] The camera has a field of view of 2.2x2.2 arc minutes with an angular resolution of 0.07 arcsec at 2 microns.[6] NIRCam is also equipped with coronagraphs, which helps to collect data on exoplanets near stars. It helps with imaging anything next to a much brighter object, because the coronagraph blocks that light.[7] NIRCam is housed in the Integrated Science Instrument Module, to which it is attached physically by struts.[8][9][10][11] It is designed to operate at 37 Kelvin (roughly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit), so it can detect infrared light at this wavelength.[12][13] It is connected to the ISIM by struts and thermal straps connect to heat radiators, which helps maintain its temperature.[14] The Focal Plane Electronics operated at 290 kelvin.[15]

NIRCam should be able to observe as faint as magnitude +29 with a 10000-second exposure (about 2.8 hours).[16] It makes these observations in light from 0.6 (600 nm) to 5 microns (5000 nm) wavelength.[17] It can observe in two fields of view, and either side can do imaging, or from the capabilities of the wave-front sensing equipment, spectroscopy.[18] The wavefront sensing is much finer than the thickness of an average human hair.[19] It must perform at an accuracy of at least 93 nanometers and in testing it has even achieved between 32 and 52 nm.[20] A human hair is thousands of nanometers across.[21]

Overview

JWST-instrument-ranges.jpg NIRCam has two complete optical systems for redundancy.[24] The two sides can operate at the same time, and view two separate patches of sky; the two sides are called side A and side B.[25] The lenses used in the internal optics are triplet refractors.[26] The lens materials are lithium fluoride (LiF), a barium fluoride (BaF₂) and zinc selenide (ZnSe).[27] The triplet lenses are collimating optics.[28] The biggest lens as 90 mm of clear aperture.[29]

The observed wavelength range is broken up into a high and low band.[30] The low band goes from 0.6 to 2.3 microns and the high band goes from 2.4 to 5 microns; both have the same field of view and access to a coronagraph.[31] The lower band has finer plate scale with twin quad arrays of 2048x2048 arrays, while the high band has two 2048x2048 arrays.[32] Each side of the NIRCam views a 2.2 arcminute by 2.2 arcminute patch of sky in both the high and the low band; however, the low band has twice the resolution.[33] The high band has one array per side (two overall), and the low band has four arrays per side, or 8 overall.[34] Side A and Side B have a unique field of view, but they are adjacent to each other.[35] In other words, the camera looks at two 2.2 arcminute wide fields of view that are next to each other, and each of these views is observed in the high and low band, but the low band has twice the resolution of the higher wavelength band.[36]

The builders of NIRCam are the University of Arizona and company Lockheed Martin, in cooperation with the U.S. Space agency, NASA.[37] NIRCam was completed in July 2013 and it was shipped to Goddard Spaceflight Center, which is the NASA center managing the JWST project.[38] NIRCam was also delivered to NASA in March 2014.[39]

NIRCam's four major science goals include:


Electronics

Webb_Instruments_Perfected_to_Microscopic_Levels_(14486243743).jpg Data from the image sensors (Focal Plane Arrays) is collected by the Focal Plane Electronics and sent to the ISIM computer.[40] The data between the FPE and the ISIM computer is transferred by SpaceWire connection.[41] There are also Instrument Control Electronics (ICE).[42] The Focal Plane Arrays contain 40 million pixels.[43]

The FPE provides or monitors the following for the FPA:[44]

-   Regulated power
-   Output data synchronization
-   Temperature control
-   Operational mode controls
-   Image data conditioning
-   Image data amplification
-   Image data digitization


Filters

NIRcam includes filter wheels that allow the light coming in from the optics to be sent through a filter before it is recorded by the sensors.[45] The filters have a certain range in which they allow light to pass, blocking the other frequencies; this allows operators of NIRCam some control over what frequencies are observed when making an observation with the telescope.[46]

By using multiple filters the redshift of distant galaxies can be estimated by photometry.[47]
