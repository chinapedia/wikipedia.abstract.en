HIT SOUTH QUEENSLAND is an Australian commercial radio station broadcasting to South West Queensland and the Darling Downs. Owned and operated by Southern Cross Austereo, the station broadcasts a contemporary hit radio music format with a local breakfast show based from studios in Toowoomba.


History

The station was first launched in 2000 by RG Capital as C FM,[1] affiliated with the Sea FM brand used by its sister stations on the Queensland coast. In 2004, C FM and sister station 4GR was sold to Macquarie Regional RadioWorks.[2][3]

Following the merger of Southern Cross Media, Macquarie Regional RadioWorks' successor, with Austereo in February 2011, the Sea FM network - along with Hot FM and Star FM regional counterparts - became more closely aligned with the Today Network, including networking programming from 2DayFM Sydney and Fox FM Melbourne.

On 13 November 2013, C FM relaunched as Hot FM.[4][5] As Hot FM, 4RGD performed well in a ratings survey conducted by Xtra Research in June 2016, winning an average of 31% audience share in all 10+ demographics.[6] According to the survey results, the station also won all but two individual age demographics. The station was beaten in the older 55-64 and 65+ demographics by ABC Southern Queensland.[7]

On 15 December 2016, as part of a national brand consolidation by parent company Southern Cross Austereo, the station was merged into the Hit Network.[8][9]
