GREG AUSTIN is an actor, best known for his role as Charlie Smith in the BBC's _Doctor Who_ spin-off _Class_.[1]


Early life

Austin grew up in Bournemouth.[2] Before Austin became an actor he started off as a dancer. He danced Modern, ballet, Tap and Street Dance, which got him into musical theatre. After this he studied at Arts Educational in London, where he finished his musical theatre degree in 2013.[3]


Career

From 2014 to 2016 Austin starred as the young Gordon Selfridge in ITV's _Mr Selfridge_.[4] He got this job even before finishing his theatre degree.[5] He also appeared as Rufus Barton in one episode of _Law & Order: UK_.[6]

In 2015 Austin appeared in the short film _Into the Surf_.

In 2016 Austin was cast in the BBC Three _Doctor Who_ spin-off _Class_ as Charlie Smith. Austin's character Charlie is an alien[7] who falls in love with his classmate Matteusz.[8] At first Austin didn't know his character was alien. When he read the script he presumed that Charlie was being a bit socially inept and might have mild Asperger's syndrome. This also helped him to have a different way of looking at things and to get an alien perspective.[9]

In 2017, Greg starred in a popular Wrigley's chewing gum commercial, as well as appearing in series 5 of ITV's Endeavour as Rufus Barton.

In 2018 Austin reprised his role as Charlie in six audio plays by Big Finish.[10] Greg then appeared briefly as a "synth" in the Channel 4 series Humans. He also filmed for a guest lead role on Stephen Poliakoff's Summer of Rockets, which is set to be released on BBC2 on the 22nd of May, 2019.

He is currently filming a lead role in Jordan Peele's upcoming series The Hunt, playing “Travis Leich”, described as a fanatical young man whose adherence to the Nazi cause leads him to do whatever dirty job is necessary, no matter how murderous. It will air on Amazon Prime.


Personal life

Greg married his wife Abigail Cole on 22 October 2016,[11][12] after 9 1/2 years of relationship.[13][14][15] In early 2018 however, they separated, although they remain very close. Greg co-hosts a weekly podcast entitled "The Greatest Waste of Time", with long time friend, Andy Jay.
