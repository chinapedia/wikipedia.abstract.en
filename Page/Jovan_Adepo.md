JOVAN ADEPO is an English-born American actor. He is best known for playing Michael Murphy in the HBO television series _The Leftovers_ and for his role as Cory Maxson in the film adaptation of August Wilson's play, _Fences_ (2016).


Early life and education

Adepo was born in 1988 in Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire. His mother, from London, is of Nigerian descent.[1] His father, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, is African-American. Raised in Waldorf, Maryland, he acted in school and church plays. He attended college at Bowie State University in Maryland, receiving his B.A. in political science and philosophy. In 2011, he moved to Los Angeles to become a writer. To make ends meet, he took acting classes in order to book commercials. Here, he grew an interest in becoming an actor. Adepo studied acting under the tutelage of a variety of notable instructors, including Dianne Hull of the Actors Studio.[2] Through church in Maryland he met Viola Davis's older sister, who helped him get in contact with Davis. It was Davis who put Adepo on the path to studying the right techniques, seeing plays, and reading as many plays as he could.[3][4] He has a younger sister, Macayla.
