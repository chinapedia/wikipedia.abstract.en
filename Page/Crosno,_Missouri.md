CROSNO is an extinct town in Mississippi County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1]


History

Permanent settlement occurred on the site as early as 1802; it formerly was called "Lucas Bend".[2] A post office called Crosno was established in 1890, and remained in operation until 1934.[3] F. M. Crosno, an early postmaster, gave the community his last name.[4]

Crosno lends its name to the Crosno Fortified Village Archeological Site, a Native American archaeological site listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1969.[5][6]
