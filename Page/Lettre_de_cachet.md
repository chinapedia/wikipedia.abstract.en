), opening _De par le roy_ ("In the name of the King...")]] _LETTRES DE CACHET_ (, lit. "letters of the sign/signet") were letters signed by the king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed with the royal seal, or _cachet_. They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be appealed.

In the case of organized bodies, 'lettres de cachet’ were issued for the purpose of preventing assembly or accomplishing some other definite act. The provincial estates were convoked (called to assembly) in this manner, and it was by a _lettre de cachet_ (in this case, a _lettre de jussipri_), or by showing in person in a _lit de justice_, that the king ordered a _parlement_ to register a law despite that parlement's refusal to pass it.

The best-known _lettres de cachet_, however, were penal, by which a subject was imprisoned without trial and without an opportunity of defense (after inquiry and due diligence by the Lieutenant De Police) in a state prison or an ordinary jail, confinement in a convent or the General Hospital of Paris, transportation to the colonies, or expulsion to another part of the realm, or from the realm altogether. The Lettres were mainly used against drunkards, troublemakers, prostitutes, squanderers of family fortune, or insane persons. The wealthy sometimes petitioned such _lettres_ to dispose of inconvenient individuals, especially to prevent unequal marriages (nobles with commoners), or to prevent a scandal (the Lettre could prevent court cases that might otherwise dishonour a family).

In this respect, the _lettres de cachet_ were a prominent symbol of the abuses of the _ancien régime_ monarchy, and as such were suppressed during the French Revolution. In 1789 and 1790, all cases were revised by a commission which confirmed most of the sentences. Historian Claude Quétel has interpreted these confirmations as indicating that the Lettres were not as arbitrary and unjust as they have been represented after the Revolution,[1] and he hence speaks of a _Légende noire_.[2]


History

's detention at the Bastille, signed by Louis XV and minister Louis Phélypeaux in 1759]] The power to issue _lettres de cachet_ was a royal privilege recognized by the French monarchic civil law that developed during the 13th century, as the Capetian monarchy overcame its initial distrust of Roman law. The principle can be traced to a maxim which furnished a text of the _Pandects_ of Justinian: in their Latin version, "_Rex solutus est a legibus_", or "The king is released from the laws." "The French legal scholars interpreted the imperial office of the Justinian code in a generic way and arrived at the conclusion that every 'king is an emperor in his own kingdom,' that is, he possesses the prerogatives of legal absolutism that the _Corpus Juris Civilis_ attributes to the Roman emperor."[3]

This meant that when the king intervened directly, he could decide without heeding the laws, and even contrary to the laws. This was an early conception, and in early times the order in question was simply verbal; some letters patent of Henry III of France in 1576 state that François de Montmorency was "prisoner in our castle of the Bastille in Paris by verbal command" of the late king Charles IX.

In the 14th century the principle was introduced that the order should be written, and hence arose the _lettre de cachet_. The _lettre de cachet_ belonged to the class of _lettres closes_, as opposed to _lettres patentes_, which contained the expression of the legal and permanent will of the king, and had to be furnished with the seal of state affixed by the chancellor.

The _lettres de cachet_, on the contrary, were signed simply by a secretary of state for the king; they bore merely the imprint of the king's privy seal, from which circumstance they were often called, in the 14th and 15th centuries, _lettres de petit signet_ or _lettres de petit cachet_, and were entirely exempt from the control of the chancellor.


As a tool

While serving the government as a silent weapon against political adversaries or controversial writers and as a means of punishing culprits of high birth without the scandal of a lawsuit, the _lettres de cachet_ had many other uses. They were employed by the police in dealing with prostitutes, and on their authority lunatics were shut up in hospitals and sometimes in prisons.

They were also often used by heads of families as a means of correction, for example, for protecting the family honour from the disorderly or criminal conduct of sons. The case of the Marquis de Sade (imprisoned 1777–1790 under a _lettre de cachet_ obtained by his wealthy and influential mother-in-law) is a prominent example. Wives, too, took advantage of them to curb the profligacy of husbands and vice versa.

In reality, the secretary of state had a delegation, and could issue them at his own discretion, and in most cases the king was unaware of their issue. In the 18th century it is certain that the letters were often issued blank, i.e. without containing the name of the person against whom they were directed; the recipient, or mandatary, filled in the name in order to make the letter effective.


Protests

Protests against the _lettres de cachet_ were made continually by the _parlement_ of Paris and by the provincial _parlements_, and also by the Estates-General. In 1648, during the Fronde, the sovereign courts of Paris,[4] by their _Arrêt d'Union_, procured their momentary suppression in a kind of charter of liberties which they imposed upon the crown, but which was short-lived.

It was not until the reign of Louis XVI that a reaction against the abuse became clearly perceptible. At the beginning of that reign Malesherbes during his short ministry endeavoured to infuse some measure of justice into the system, and in March 1784 the baron de Breteuil, a minister of the king's household, addressed a circular to the intendants and the lieutenant of police with a view to preventing the most serious abuses connected with the issue of _lettres de cachet_.

The Comte de Mirabeau wrote a scathing indictment of _lettres de cachet_ while imprisoned in the dungeon of Vincennes (by _lettre de cachet_ obtained by his father). The treatise was published after his liberation in 1782 under the title _Les Lettres de cachet et des prisons d'etat_ and was widely read throughout Europe.

In Paris, in 1779, the Cour des Aides demanded their suppression, and in March 1788 the parlement of Paris made some exceedingly energetic remonstrances, which are important for the light they throw upon old French public law. The crown, however, did not decide to lay aside this weapon, and in a declaration to the States-General in the royal session of June 23, 1789 (art. 15) it did not renounce it absolutely.


Abolition and reinstatement

_Lettres de cachet_ were abolished after the French Revolution by the Constituent Assembly, but Napoleon reestablished their penal equivalent by a political measure in the decree of 8 March 1801 on the state prisons. This is all the more striking, given that Napoleon had pushed for measures ensuring the rule of law in the codes of laws adopted under his rule. This action was one of the acts brought up against him by the senatus-consulte of 3 April 1814, which pronounced his fall "considering that he has violated the constitutional laws by the decrees on the state prisons."


Victims of Lettre de cachet

-   Charles Simon Favart (because a nobleman was interested in his wife)
-   Luke Joseph Hooke (deprived of his academic chair in theology for awarding a Ph.D. to a candidate without having read the (heretical) thesis.)
-   Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau (several times, on request of his father, as protection against creditors and once to prevent a death penalty for kidnapping and eloping with a married woman)
-   Marguerite Monvoisin (complicity in a poisoning affair. A Lettre de cachet was used to avoid scandal that might have affected highly placed accomplices).
-   Pigault-Lebrun (twice, for eloping with two successive young women)
-   Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière (misconduct: sent away to an abbey by his father)
-   Marquis de Sade (rape and torture. The Lettre was petitioned by the marquis' wife, to avoid a court case)
-   Comte de Sanois (domestic disputes and debt. His wife petitioned a Lettre, claiming her husband insane)
-   Voltaire (once for slander, a second time for violent menaces against the Prince de Rohan)
-   Jean-François Marmontel, accused to be the author of a satire against the duke d'Aumont. His account of his short stay in the Bastille contains a description of the food he received, the room he was imprisoned with his servant, and the goodwill shown to him.
-   Giacomo Casanova (dueling)
-   Marie-Anne de La Ville (practiced black magic. A scandalous trial was avoided by a Lettre)
-   Jean-Baptiste Forqueray (request of his father)


In literature

-   Honoré Mirabeau, _Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d'état_ (Hamburg, 1782), written in the dungeon at Vincennes into which his father had thrown him by a _lettre de cachet_, one of the ablest and most eloquent of his works, which had an immense circulation and was translated into English in 1788.
-   Doctor Alexandre Manette, in Dickens' _A Tale of Two Cities_, was thrown into the Bastille prison by means of a _lettre de cachet_. In addition, Charles Darnay suspected that his uncle, a marquis, would have used a _lettre de cachet_ to put Darnay himself into prison if it weren't for the fact that the Marquis had fallen out of favour with the royal court.
