It is grade II listed with Historic England.[2]


St Luke's Church, Euston Road

ST LUKE'S CHURCH, EUSTON ROAD () was a Church of England parish church on the Euston Road in St Pancras, London.

It was designed by John Johnson, also one of the architects of St Paul's Church, Camden Square. It was built in between 1856 and 1861 on the corner of Midland Road. The construction in the 1860s of the Midland Railway's London terminus, St Pancras railway station, necessitated the church's demolition. It was taken down and re-erected in 1866–67, with alterations by Johnson, as Wanstead United Reformed Church.[3] Its sale to Wanstead provided £526 which was combined with £12,500 compensation from the railway company to build a replacement in Kentish Town.
