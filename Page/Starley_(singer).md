In June 2018, Starley release "Love is Love". The track comes just over six months after the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Stanley said on a press release to promote the single "Love is Love" is a very personal song for me. I had written a first draft for it that had a lot less detail. After sharing it with a few friends, it seemed it wasn't hitting home all the way, and I realised it was because I was leaving out the parts of the story I felt uncomfortable sharing. I decided to re-write it and dig deeper. That felt scary and liberating at the same time. From that process "Love is Love" was born. I'm nervous and excited to share it with the world!” [3] In July and August 2018, Starley supported Katy Perry on the Australian leg of her Witness Tour.[4]

In November, she appeared in the music video for Baby by Clean Bandit.[5]
