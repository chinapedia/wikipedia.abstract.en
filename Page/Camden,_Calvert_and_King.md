CAMDEN, CALVERT AND KING was an eighteenth-century partnership that traded in London from 1760 to 1824,[1] transporting slaves and later convicts.


Activities

The partners owned whalers, merchant vessels trading to the East and West Indies, slavers and vessels transporting convicts to Australia.[2]

The partners became involved in the transportation of English convicts first to America and later to Australia.[3]

They were the largest company in London involved in the slave trade.[4] After the British Parliament passed an Act for the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the company continued to put its know-how in transporting people to work transporting convicts to Australia.[5]

The principal partners were William Camden (173? - 1796), Anthony Calvert (1735-1809) and Thomas King (1735? â€“ 1824).[6]
