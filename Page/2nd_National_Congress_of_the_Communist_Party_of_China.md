The 2nd NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA was a significant Communist Party Congress in China that was held in Shanghai, between 16â€“23 July 1922. It was held at Li Da's estate at 625 Delhi Chengdu, West of the South Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. It was succeeded by the 3rd National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The congress was attended by 12 people who represented the 195 party members.[1]


Attendance

Recorded in the 6th National Congress held in Moscow during 1928, it listed the 12 participants of the 2nd National Congress as follows: Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, Li Da, Yang Mingzhai, Luo Zhanglong, Wang Jinmei, Xu Baihao, Mao Zedong, Cai Hesen, Tan Pingshan, Li Zhenying, Shi Cuntong.[2]

However, this list only denoted the representatives of the congress and is not inclusive of the actual members whom attended the congress. Mao Zedong, for instance, received the notification to attend the congress but did not attend. In the published "History of the Chinese Communist Party" by the CPC Party Research Center, it stated the ambiguity of Mao's attendance in the congress. Since the official records of the representatives remain ambiguous, leading up to the possibility of "someone other than Mao whom attended the congress".[3]

However, in an interview by American journalist Edgar Snow published under his book Red Star Over China, it was recorded that Mao admitted to Snow of his absence from the 2nd National Congress due to miscommunication.


Significance of the Congress

The congress led to the confirmation and adoption of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China among several other resolutions that were passed during the congress. This included the Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Resolution of the CPC on Imperialism and World Events, Resolution On Joining the Communist International, Resolution of the United Front of Democracy, Resolution on the Trade Union Movement and the Communist Party, Resolution on the Communist Youth Movement , Resolution on the Woman's Movement and Resolution on the Constitution of the Communist Party.[4]

The declaration made by the 2nd Congress stated the CPC as a "branch of the Comintern". The congress also saw the approval to join Comintern, a drastic turn from the 1st National Congress where it declared that Comintern was to be made an ally of the CPC. This alignment made at the 2nd Congress would greatly affect the development of the CPC in her early years.[5]
