GRAND BREWING LUXEMBOURG, is a Luxembourgish brewery founded by Mark Hatherly in 2014.[1]


History

Grand Brewing was founded in 2014 by Mark Heatherly. In 2015, the company launched its first commercial release : the _Red Bridge Amber Ale_ (named after the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge). Since then it has also released Luxembourgs first ever India Pale Ale, named _Satellite I.P.A._ (named after Luxembourg's famous SES Astra company). The release of a Pilsner and Porter beer are planned sometime in the near future.[2]

Before 2016, Grand Brewing was known as _Capital City Brewing_, but since there was already a company holding the rights to this name, they changed to the now known Grand Brewing Luxembourg.
