Plot

Prosperity is trapped. In her constant pursuit of perfection she must battle her opposite Penury, in an enchanted game of chess. The game affects the lives of two perfect archetypal lovers in a far away land, but as the game develops and the end draws ever closer, we are confronted with the question; Can perfection last more than just a moment? In her parochial desire to win, Prosperity forsakes herself to remain trapped in the enchanted game.

The film was shot entirely in North Wales. Locations include Dolbadarn Castle, Baron Hill Mansion and Snowdonia National Park.
