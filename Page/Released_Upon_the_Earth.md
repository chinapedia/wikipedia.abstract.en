_RELEASED UPON THE EARTH_ is the fourth album of the thrash metal band, Vengeance Rising. The album was later re-released in 2015, remastered and expanded.[1][2] The only official members of the band at this point were founder Roger Martinez and new drummer Johnny Vasquez, who would later play with Mortification, when they first came to America.[3] Alongside Vasquez, on this album, Steve Rowe performed guest vocals on the track "Tion".[4]


Critical reception

Dave Williams wrote "...musically, they are really not in the same league as our own home grown Seventh Angel and Detritus. I think in this case the Americans need to take a lesson from the inventors of metal music - the British."[5] Classic Thrash reports "In all honesty, Released Upon The Earth may be far from perfection, but for some reason it is the Vengeance Rising release that has got the most spins from me so far."[6] The magazine, Heaven's Metal also did a review of the album, written by Doug Van Pelt.[7]
