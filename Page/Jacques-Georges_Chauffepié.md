-   1750–1756: _Nouveau Dictionnaire historique et critique, pour servir de supplément ou de continuation, au Dictionnaire historique et critique de M. Pierre Bayle_, Amsterdam, 4 vol. in-fol. The project of a supplement to the dictionary of Bayle was conceived at the death of the philosopher, but was not executed. After some English people of letters gave an English translation of the book by Bayle in 40 vol, with considerable additions, it was proposed to Chauffepié to translate into French the additions made in England. These additions consisted either in addition to articles bby Bayle, either new articles, He devoted many years to this work, and made himself new additions and new articles. Out of nearly fourteen hundred items found in his dictionary, more than six hundred, almost all English, are translated without additions from Chauffepié; about two hundred and eighty are reworked by him, some five hundred items are entirely his. Chauffepié has neither the piquancy nor cynicism of Bayle. He meets the character of Minister which he was invested with. He sometimes straightens English authors, and shows great erudition. Only in a work of this scope can we afford the explanatory notes of the text, or dissertations on some curious history or literature points.
-   1787: _Sermons sur divers textes_, Amsterdam, 5 vol. in-8°, They were published by Samuel Chauffepié, Jacques George's nephew, who, in the praise he made of his uncle, mentions a few other minor works.
