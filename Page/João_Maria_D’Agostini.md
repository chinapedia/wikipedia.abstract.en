JOÃO MARIA D’AGOSTINI, or GIOVANNI MARIA DE AGOSTINI (1801 – 17 April 1869), was a lay monk of Italian origin who travelled widely in South and North America preaching and healing with herbal remedies. He drew large crowds who thought he was a holy man and could work miracles, although the authorities often viewed him with suspicion. In Brazil his devotees have conflated his identity with two other monks named João Maria. Thousands people each year visit a cave in the state of Paraná, Brazil, where he once lived.


Early years (1801–43)

Giovanni de Agostini was born into a noble family in 1801 in Sizzano, Piedmont, Italy. His mother died in 1819, and he made a pilgrimage to Rome, and then to France and Spain. He tried to become a monk, but was unable to accept the secluded life of the monastery. He decided to become an evangelist in America, and arrived in Caracas, Venezuela, in June 1838. He travelled in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and finally Brazil.


Brazil (1843–52)

Agostini lived in Brazil from 1843 to 1852 under the name of João Maria. He visited the cities of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Curitiba, Florianópolis (then called Desterro) and Porto Alegre. In each place he obtained authorization from the bishop and president of the province to preach the gospel, before leaving for the interior to conduct his missionary work. He dressed in the habit of a Capuchin friar, wore sandals and carried religious objects such as a bible, medals of Our Lady and a staff. He knew the Gospel well, had a good understanding of theology and was fluent in French and Latin. He gave apocalyptic sermons in which he condemned luxury and avarice, warned of the day of judgement and the torments of hell, and spoke of the possibilities of salvation. Like other Capuchins he established _cruzeiros_ or sacred ways where the faithful could make penitential processions to reduce their debt to God.

Agostini made rosaries and wooden crucifixes which he sold for cash or kind to support his mission. He made medicines from herbs, roots, leaves and water from special sources. He gained a reputation as a saint who could perform miracles, and drew large crowds. During his stay in Rio Grande do Sul between 1846 and 1848 he was visited by crowds of patients and others curious to see him, including some who came from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. João Maria was not a revolutionary, but tried to improve the condition of the peasants. He organized processions, built chapels, blessed cattle and baptized children. He cared for the sick, and his herbal teas became famous.

He moved to Sorocaba, São Paulo, and continued to practice medicine and give advice. João Maria left the city of São Paulo and disappeared for a while before showing up in Rio Grande do Sul. Thousands of people came to him at Cerro Campestre, in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, drawn by word of the miraculous power of his waters. The authorities of Rio Grande do Sul analyzed the water and found it was potable but no different from any other water. He then continued through Santa Catarina and Paraná, where he lived in a cave near Lapa in 1847. There he performed marriages, baptisms, healings and gave blessings to the local people.

In 1848 João Maria was deported to Santa Catarina, then to Rio de Janeiro, where he was lost from sight for a while. He met Father Joaquim Gomes de Oliveira e Paiva, deputy provincial of Santa Catarina, in February 1849 on Arvoredo Island. The father spoke highly of him, and perhaps as a result the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil gave him an audience and offered him gifts and favors which, as a mendicant, he could not use. The emperor's favor may have protected him when charges were later laid against him of charlatanism, illegal medicine, false promises of cure and religious imposture.


Later career (1853–1869)

In 1852 Agostini moved to Monte Palma in Paraguay, now called _El Cerro del Monje_ and now in the Misiones Province of Argentina. The next year he was in Buenos Aires, then crossed the Andes to Chile, where he lived from 1854 to 1856. He was in Bolivia in 1857, Peru in 1858, Mexico in 1859, Cuba in 1860 and Canada in 1861. Often he drew large crowds, and often the activities of this foreign religious leader roused the suspicions of the authorities.

Agostini reached the United States in 1861, and walked for almost to New Mexico. In 1867 he moved to a cave near the village of Las Vegas, although the residents warned him that the Indians were dangerous. He lived there for two years, sometimes coming down to the village to preach, treat the sick and catechize children. In April 1869 the villagers did not see his fire, went up to his cave and found him dead. He had been murdered by some person who was never found. He died on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69. João Maria's tomb may still be seen in New Mexico.


Legacy

João Maria D’Agostini inspired others who became mendicants in Brazil in the following decades, and was the first of the three "monks" named João Maria in southern Brazil. Some widely distributed photographs with the legend "Jõao Maria de Agostinho Propheta" are in fact pictures of the later monk, João Maria de Jesus. There are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles. There are many places in the center and east of Paraná and Santa Catarina, the south of São Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the "João Marias" would have passed.

The Monge State Park was created in Lapa in 1960. The main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. It also includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous.
