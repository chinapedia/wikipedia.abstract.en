MISANDRY () is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against men or boys.[1][2][3] "Misandrous" or "misandrist" can be used as adjectival forms of the word.[4] Misandry manifests itself in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of men, violence against men, and sexual objectification of men.[5]


Etymology

Misandry is formed from the Greek _misos_ (μῖσος, "hatred") and _anēr_, _andros_ (ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός; "man").[6] Use of the word can be found as far back as the nineteenth century, including an 1871 use in _The Spectator_ magazine.[7][8] It appeared in _Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary_ (11th ed.) in 1952. Translation of the French "_misandrie_" to the German "_Männerhass_" (Hatred of Men)[9] is recorded in 1803.[10] Misandry is parallel in form to 'misogyny' (hatred of women or girls). A term with a similar but distinct meaning is _androphobia_, which constitutes fear of men.[11] Writer Helen Pluckrose has argued that the _androphobia_ is the more propitious term in instances where aversion to men stems from a sense of fear.[12]


Male disposability

Educator and activist Warren Farrell has written of his views on how men are uniquely marginalized in what he calls their "disposability", the manner in which the most dangerous occupations, notably soldiering and mining, were historically performed exclusively by men and remain so today. In his book, _The Myth of Male Power_, Farrell argues that patriarchal societies do not make rules to benefit men at the expense of women. Farrell contends that nothing is more telling about who has benefited from "men's rules" than life expectancy, which is lower in males, and suicide rates, which are higher.[13]

Concerning male disposability, social psychologist Professor Roy F. Baumeister has written:


In Law

In 2019 a female judge in the UK twice spared a convicted drink driver from jail saying the driver would have gone 'straight down the stairs' (to jail) if she was a man.[14] [15] [16] [17] [18]

An article published in 2014 by the University of Michigan Law School under 'American Law and Economics' stated, "It finds large unexplained gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution." [19] The University went on to argue, "Policymakers could equally sensibly ask: Why not treat men like women are treated?" [20]


Within feminist movements

Academic Alice Echols, in her 1989 book _Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975_, argued that the radical feminist Valerie Solanas, best known for her attempted murder of Andy Warhol in 1968, displayed an extreme level of misandry compared to other radical feminists of the time in her tract the _SCUM Manifesto_. Echols stated:

Andrea Dworkin criticized the biological determinist strand in radical feminism that, in 1977, she found "with increasing frequency in feminist circles" which echoed the views of Valerie Solanas that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a gendercide to allow for the emergence of a "new _Übermensch_ Womon".[21]

The author Bell Hooks has discussed the issue of "man hating" during the early period of women's liberation as a reaction to patriarchal oppression and women who have had bad experiences with men in non-feminist social movements. She has also criticized separatist strands of feminism as "reactionary" for promoting the notion that men are inherently immoral, inferior, and unable to help end sexist oppression or benefit from feminism.[22][23] In _Feminism is For Everybody_, Hooks laments the fact that feminists who critiqued anti-male bias in the early women's movement never gained mainstream media attention and that "our theoretical work critiquing the demonization of men as the enemy did not change the perspective of women who were anti-male." Hooks has theorized previously that this demonization led to an unnecessary rift between the men's movement and the women's movement.[24]

Although Hooks doesn't name individual separatist theorists, Mary Daly's utopian vision of a world in which men and heterosexual women have been eliminated is an extreme example of this tendency.[25] Daly argued that sexual equality between men and women was not possible and that women, due to their superior capacities, should rule men.[26] Yet later, in an interview, Daly argued "If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males."[27]

Paul Nathanson and Katherine K. Young argued that "ideological feminism" as opposed to "egalitarian feminism" has imposed misandry on culture.[28] Their 2001 book, _Spreading Misandry_, analyzed "pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men.[29] _Legalizing Misandry_ (2005), the second in the series, gave similar attention to laws in North America.[30]

Wendy McElroy, an individualist feminist,[31] wrote in 2001 that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men [that] seems to have turned into a cold hatred."[32] She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or rapists.

In a 2016 article, author and journalist Cathy Young described a "current cycle of misandry" in feminism.[33] This cycle, she explains, includes the use of the term "mansplaining" and other neologisms using "man" as a derogatory prefix.[34] The term "mansplaining", according to feminist writer Rebecca Solnit, was coined soon after the appearance in 2008 of her essay _Men Explain Things to Me_.[35]


Public attitudes

Men's rights activists and other masculinist groups have criticized modern laws concerning divorce, domestic violence, and rape as examples of institutional misandry.[36][37]

In a study of 488 college students regarding ambivalent sexism towards men, researchers found that women who did not identify as feminists were more likely to be hostile towards men than self-identified feminists, but also more likely to hold benevolent views towards men.[38][39]

In a study of 503 self-identified heterosexual females, social psychologists found an association between insecure attachment styles and women's hostile sexism towards men.[40][41]

Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young examined the institutionalization of misandry in the public sphere in their 2001 three-book series _Beyond the Fall of Man_,[42] which refers to misandry as a "form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in North American society", writing, "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between Jews and Christians, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."[43]

Stanford University Professor Philip Zimbardo writing for Psychology Today, argued that there was an empathy gap between young men and young women, with young women receiving more empathy and sympathy, and that young men were sometimes demonized and given conflicting messages about acceptable behavior and that this contributed to negative effects such as high young male suicide rates. The piece was part of a promotion for his book "Man, Interrupted: Why Young Men are Struggling & What We Can Do About It".[44]


In government policy

In November 2015, it was reported that the Canadian government was going to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees, but they would exclude single men. Only single women, families and unaccompanied minors would be taken in.[45][46] In 2017, an article on newsdeeply claimed that similar policies were still being carried out. The author went on the say that resettlement countries are acting on the bigoted stereotype of Arab men as dangerous potential terrorists, rather than as the vulnerable refugees and survivors.[47]


Asymmetry with misogyny

Sociologist Allan G. Johnson argues in _The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy_ that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down feminists and to shift attention onto men, reinforcing a male-centered culture.[48] Johnson asserts that culture offers no comparable anti-male ideology to misogyny and that "people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people" and that "[given the] reality of women's oppression, male privilege, and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that _every_ woman should have moments where she resents or even hates 'men'".

Marc A. Ouellette argues in _International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities_ that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny"; in his view, assuming a parallel between misogyny and misandry overly simplifies relations of gender and power.[49]

Anthropologist David D. Gilmore also argues that misogyny is a "near-universal phenomenon" and that there is no male equivalent to misogyny,[50] further defending manifestations of perceived misandry as not "hatred of men's traditional male role" and a "culture of machismo". He argues that misandry is "different from the intensely _ad feminam_ aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do".[51]


In literature

Ancient Greek literature

Classics professor Froma Zeitlin of Princeton University discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy".[52] She writes:

Shakespeare

Literary critic Harold Bloom argued that even though the word misandry is relatively unheard of in literature it is not hard to find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of Shakespeare Bloom argued "I cannot think of one instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear that women in general have to marry down and that men are narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he gives us a darker vision of human males than human females."[53]

Modern literature

Racialized misandry occurs in both "high" and "low" culture and literature. For instance, African-American men have often been disparagingly portrayed as either infantile or as eroticized and hyper-masculine, depending on prevailing cultural stereotypes.

Critic of mainstream feminism Christina Hoff Sommers has described Eve Ensler's play _The Vagina Monologues_ as misandric in that "there are no admirable males ... the play presents a rogues’ gallery of male brutes, sadists, child-molesters, genital mutilators, gang rapists and hateful little boys" which she finds out of step with the reality that "most men are not brutes. They are not oppressors".[54]

Julie M. Thompson, a feminist author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "penis envy", a term coined by Sigmund Freud in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.[55] Nancy Kang has discussed "the misandric impulse" in relation to the works of Toni Morrison.[56]

In his book, _Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition_, Harry Brod, a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Northern Iowa, writes:
