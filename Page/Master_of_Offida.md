The MASTER OF OFFIDA (active mid to late 14th century) was an anonymous painter active in the towns of Offida and Ascoli Piceno in the Marche.

He painted circa 1360-1370 frescoes in the church and crypt of Santa Maria della Rocca in Offida, depicting prophets and saints including a _Santa Caterina di Alessandria_, but also an "Annunciation_, a "Madonna del Latte_.[1][2]

Frescoes in the church of San Vittore in Ascoli Piceno, are attributed to this painter. A folding tablet of tempera on gilded wood at the Fogg Art Museum depicting _The Virgin and Child Enthroned_; _Christ on the Cross between the Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist_ has been attributed to the painter.[3]
