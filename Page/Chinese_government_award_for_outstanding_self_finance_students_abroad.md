About the award

The Chinese government award for outstanding self-financed students abroad was established by the China Scholarship Council in 2003. The worldwide recipients are chosen annually based on a record of outstanding accomplishments in any discipline.[1] This award is considered the highest award given by Chinese government to graduate students studying outside China, who do not receive financial support from Chinese government.[2] To date, the recipients include students from 33 countries, including United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Australia and Canada.[3]

The number of Chinese students leaving China to study abroad is more than half a million each year, making this prestigious award highly competitive. Currently, 500 students are awarded yearly. The award includes a one-time $6000 cash award and a certificate.
