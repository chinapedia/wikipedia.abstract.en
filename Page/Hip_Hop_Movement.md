_Hip Hop Movement is a steaming channel on Roku TV it's channel is a on demand TV channel and one of it's popular shows is called Hip Hop Movement Open Mic Tour_ [1] [2]
THE HIP HOP MOVEMENT offers a critical theory and history of hip hop culture as stated by Reiland Rabaka[3] in his book _The Hip Hop Movement: From R&B and the Civil Rights Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Generation_. The movement connects R&B, the Civil Rights Movement, and hip hop culture.[4] [5]The six elements Of the Hip Hop Movement are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, Community Awareness in music. In 1990 while working with the rap/pop group Snap! Ronald "Bee-Stinger" Savage while in the State of New York carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement.The Hip Hop Movement is not only to entertain people but also to enlighten listeners of the struggle, the oppressed, and those who through lyrics to connect with.[6][7] [8][9][10][11][12]

The four elements of hip hop culture are graffiti, rapping, DJing, and break-dancing. Rabaka argues that the hip hop movement is just as deserving of critical scholarly inquiry as other black popular music, such as R & B. Hip hop has been documented to 1973 by Steven Hager.[13] The word "hip hop" first appeared in print on September 21, 1981, in _The Village Voice_ in a profile story of Africa Bambaataa written by Hager, who published the first comprehensive history of hip hop culture with St. Martins' Press. Taymullah Abdur-Rahman in a blog in The Huffington Press compares hip hop to The Civil Rights Movement.[14]

Taymullah Abdur-Rahman opined "We couldn't reproduce Frederick Douglass but we had KRS-One. We didn’t try to imitate MLK but we had Chuck D. We remembered Harriet Tubman when we looked at Lauryn Hill. We didn’t need the Queen of Sheba, we had our own Queen..._Latifah"_[15][16] Jeff Chang in his book, _Can’t Stop Won’t Stop_ states, "there was no manifesto. The kids who started it were simply trying to find ways to pass the time, they were trying to have fun. They grew up under the politics of abandonment and because of this, their pastimes contained the seeds for a kind of mass cultural renewal."[17][18]

Todd Boyd in his book _The New H.N.I.C.: The Death of Civil Rights and the Reign of Hip Hop,_ says "I would suggest that you might get a better read of what's going on in the world of Black people today by listening to DMX on _It's Dark and Hell is Hot_ than by listening to repeated broadcasts of Martin Luther King speeches."Hip hop is inherently political, the language is political," Boyd says. "It uses language as a weapon — not a weapon to violate or not a weapon to offend, but a weapon that pushes the envelope that provokes people, makes people think.""[19][20]

Ronald Savage[21] is the first known elected official in New York State in printed articles to come out of the Zulu Nation that paved the way for hip hop culture,[22] Savage inspired many people with his fight to help change the laws of the statute of limitations against child molesters in New York State (Child Victims Act) making another statement of the Hip Hop Movement.
