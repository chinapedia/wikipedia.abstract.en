The X2 TRANSCEIVER format is a 10 gigabit per second modular fiber optic interface intended for use in routers,[1] switches and optical transport platforms. It is an early generation 10 gigabit interface related to the similar XENPAK and XPAK formats.[2] X2 may be used with 10 gigabit ethernet or OC-192/STM-64 speed SDH/SONET equipment.

X2 modules are smaller and consume less power than first generation XENPAK modules, but larger and consume more energy than the newer XFP transceiver standard and SFP+ standards.

As of 2016 this format is relatively uncommon and has been replaced by 10Gbit/s SFP+ in most new equipment.
