History

The separate tribute-paying princely state under Lakhapadar _thana_ in Sorath _prant_ was ruled by Vala Kathi chieftains.[1][2]

In 1901 it comprised three villages, with a combined population of 915, yielding 13,500 Rupees state revenue (1903-4, nearly all from land), but paying no tribute.[3]

The population was 491 according to the census of 1872 and 770 according to that of 1881.[4]
