HOLOGENOMICS is the omics study of hologenomes. A hologenome is a whole set of genomes of an organism or ecological niche (the holobiont), including co-habitating microbes, other life forms, and viruses. This may include gut microbe[1] or viral[2] genomes linked to human or animal genomes for host-microbe interaction research.[3] Hologenomics approaches have also been used to explain genetic diversity in the microbial communities of marine sponges.[4]
