The SOUTH SUDAN GIRL GUIDES ASSOCIATION is a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.[1]

South Sudan became an independent country on July 9, 2011, at which time the South Sudan Girl Guides Association split from the Sudan Girl Guides Association.[2][3]

Alice Waweru, Development Executive for English-speaking countries in the WAGGGS Africa Region visited South Sudan Girl Guides in Juba from May 30 to June 2, 2012.[4] In 2013, the South Sudan Girl Guides Association was admitted as a member of the World Association Of Girl Guides And Girl Scouts[5] and formally welcomed at the 2014 World Conference in Hong Kong.[6]

With the recent history of war and violence in South Sudan, there is a particular emphasis on training in first aid, peace and reconciliation.[7]
