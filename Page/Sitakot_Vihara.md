SITAKOT VIHARA ( _Sitakot Vihara_)is an archaeological site located in Nawabganj upazila in Dinajpur district of Bangladesh.[1] The site is locally known as the residence of Sita. Through regular excavations in the years 1968 and 1972-1973, an ancient Buddhist monastery was discovered in the site.[2] The monastery dates from a similar time period to the nearby Somapura Mahavihara and Halud Vihara.

The monastery was built on a square area of 65 meters.[3]

On the northern and southern sides there was large open space inside the boundary. The outer gateway was in the northern side and there were two guard rooms inside the boundary. The inner gateway entered to an entrance hall. The hall is attached with monastic cells. There were 41 cells in this monastery: 8 in the northern wing and 11 cells each in the three other wings. The cells were almost equal in size (3.66 m by 3.35 m). The thickness of the front walls of the cells were 1.07 m, back walls 2.59 m and partition walls 0.91-1.22 m.[4] Each cell has a doorway in front side and niches on three side walls.[5]

A 2.59 meter wide verandah ran through the perimeter of the monastery and the cells were connected to it through a doorway of 1.68 meter length and 1.07 meter width.[6]

There is a courtyard in the middle of the monastery that measure 42.38 meter *41.16 meter. Three rooms located in the middles of east, west and south wings were used as prayer rooms.[7]
