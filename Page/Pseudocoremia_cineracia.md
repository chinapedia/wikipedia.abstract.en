_PSEUDOCOREMIA CINERACIA_ is a species of moth in the Geometridae family. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as Nationally Vulnerable by the Department of Conservation.


Taxonomy

This species was first described by George Howes in 1942 from specimens obtained at Moke Lake[1] and taken in January[2] and February.[3] Howes named it _Selidosema cineracia._ This name was also used when the species was discussed by George Vernon Hudson in 1950.[4] In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to the genus _Pseudocoremia_.[5] This classification of the species into _Pseudocoremia_ is regarded as unsatisfactory.[6] As such the species is also currently known as _Pseudocoremia_ (_s.l._) _cineracia_.[7] The hototype specimen is held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.[8]


Description

The larvae are coloured grey.[9]

Howes described the adult male of the species as follows:


Distribution

This species is endemic to New Zealand.[10][11] The species range of this moth is Mackenzie, Central Otago and Otago Lakes.[12] Other than its type locality, this species occurs at Stony Beach at Okains Bay,[13] Big Spur Creek & Cluden Stream at Cluden Station in Otago[14] and Kawarau Gorge.[15]


Biology and host species

The host species of this moth is _Olearia odorata_.[16] The species is attracted to sugar lures.[17] The adults are on the wing August until June with the species being more common in September.[18]


Habitat

_P. cineracia_ inhabits montane shrublands at an altitude of between 150-850m.[19]


Conservation status

This species has been classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Vulnerable.[20] _P. cineracia_ is classified as nationally vulnerable partially because of its reliance on its host plant which is suffering a decline as a result of habitat destruction.[21]
