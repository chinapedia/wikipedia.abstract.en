Description

_Eucalyptus conveniens_ is a mallee or shrub that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth greyish over green but there is sometimes a stocking of rough, ribbony bark near the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are glaucous and square in cross section with leaves arranged in opposite pairs, egg-shaped to oblong, long and wide. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, or almost so, and are lance-shaped to oblong, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and about wide. The floral cup is more or less square in cross-section with narrow wings on the corners and a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in January and February and the flowers are whitish. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped capsule that is glaucous at first, long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus conveniens_ was first formally described in 1998 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill and the description was published in the journal _Telopea_.[4] The specific epithet (_conveniens_) is a Latin word meaning "fit", "suitable" or "accordant",[5] referring to "its somewhat intermediate position between _E. tetragona_ and _E. gittinsii_".[6]


Distribution and habitat

This eucalypt is common in mallee heath on sandplains between Mount Adams and Badgingarra.[7]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus conveniens_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[8]
