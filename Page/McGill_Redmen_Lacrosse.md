The MCGILL REDMEN LACROSSE team is a men's varsity sports team at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

McGill competes in the CUFLA East conference versus Bishop's University, Carleton University, Nipissing University, University of Ottawa, Trent University and Queen's University. The hybrid Canadian-box-American-field lacrosse program includes student-athletes recruited from across Canada and the US. The team plays home games in McGill's Percival Molson Memorial Stadium.

The Redmen received the Harry Griffith's Award in 2007, 2008, 2012 and 2015. The team won eight Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association CUFLA East conference titles in 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The team has achieved a winning record of 84-8-1 since 2011 versus Canadian opponents. McGill has twice won Canada's national championship, the Baggataway Cup, in 2012 and 2015.

Lacrosse was played to a limited extent at McGill in the late 1800s. The 15-man McGill Lacrosse Club of 1898 was led by President F.L. Thompson, Vice President, R.H. Craig, and Secretary Treasurer, A.J. Grant. [source: McGill Year Book, 1898). At some point, the sport was discontinued.

Competitive lacrosse was re-established at McGill in 2001. McGill freshman Sachin Anand organized a student lacrosse club. In 2002 the team gained Level-3 varsity club status at McGill, and joined CUFLA. In 2007 the team was elevated to a Level-2 varsity team by McGill Athletics.

As of 2003, the Redmen were being coached by Tim Murdoch, a former NCAA Div-I lacrosse player at Princeton University. Murdoch was named as CUFLA's 'Coaching Staff of the Year' in 2008.
