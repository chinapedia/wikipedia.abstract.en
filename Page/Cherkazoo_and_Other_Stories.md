_CHERKAZOO AND OTHER STORIES_ is a compilation album comprising previously unreleased studio recordings by Ian Gillan from the early 1970s.

The album is divided into two parts. The first eight tracks are taken from the soundtrack to _Cherkazoo_, a children's story Gillan labored over circa 1972. These songs are reminiscent of psychedelic pop and whimsical British music hall numbers, sounding like _Sgt. Pepper's_-era Beatles or early pre-_Space Oddity_ Bowie.

Second part of the album features songs that were cut after Gillan's departure from Deep Purple, most likely circa 1974, and find the singer in more familiar territory, namely rock, including a cover of Elvis Presley's "Trying to Get to You".

Line-ups for both sessions have never been fully confirmed but are said to include Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass) and Pete York (drums) on _Cherkazoo_ sessions and Mike Moran (keyboards) and Dave Wintour (bass) on later recordings.

The album was originally released in 1992 on RPM in the UK. Further releases came from Spitfire/Eagle (1998, 2005) and Metal Mind (2009).
