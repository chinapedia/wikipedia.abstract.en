The AMERICAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE OF CHINA (AFLC) is the oldest, American-rules football organization in China. Founded in 2013, the AFLC has grown from a small recreational league into the premier showcase for American-rules football in China. The league is meant to be American football for China, with 92% of players in the 2016 season being Chinese nationals. In 2019, the AFLC officially renamed the organization to the CNFL.[1]


History

The AFLC was founded in 2013 by Chris McLaurin,[2] a former football player for the University of Michigan Wolverines. McLaurin, working in Chongqing at the time, helped to organize a group of locals and expatriates who were interested in football into the Chongqing Dockers, whose first season was profiled by the New Republic in The Year of the Pigskin.[3] After organizing the Dockers and building relationships with other football clubs that were beginning to pop up around the country, McClarren organized a meeting of the original eight AFLC teams in Shanghai to form the league (also attended by former Michigan and NFL running back Mike Hart). The first AFLC season featured two divisions: the Beijing Cyclones, Shanghai Titans, Shanghai Warriors and Tianjin Pirates in the East, and the Chongqing Dockers, Chengdu Mustangs, Guangzhou Tigers and Hong Kong Warhawks in the West. Not all of the early teams were accepted into the league, such as the Suzhou Blue Knights, who still play non-conference games with league teams. The 2013 season culminated in the first AFLC Championship Game at Luwan Stadium in Shanghai on January 12, 2014, and saw the Dockers defeat the Warriors 24-16[4] to capture the first AFLC Championship.

In 2014, the League expanded to 12 teams, shrank slightly to 10 teams in 2015, and in 2016 features 14 teams in three divisions. In 2017, the league expanded once again to feature 18 teams playing in 4 divisions. In addition, Chris McLaurin stepped down from the commissioner role and the AFLC named Datong Wang as his successor. In 2018, the League expanded once again to twenty teams in four divisions, and expanded to a twelve team playoff, with 4 division champions earning first round byes.


2016 Season

The 2016 AFLC regular season saw fourteen franchises with over 800 players competing in a four-game regular season from August through November.
