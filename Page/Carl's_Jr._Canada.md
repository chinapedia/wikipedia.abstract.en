CARL'S JR. CANADA is the Canadian expansion of the Carl's Jr. brand, currently operating in western Canada with locations in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.


History

When CKE Restaurants, parent company of both the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's American fast food chains, sought to expand into Canada, they came into a trademark dispute with the Harvey's Canadian fast food chain. As a result, CKE was prohibited from using the Hardee's brand in Canada (which was similar to "Harvey's"), but free to use the Carl's Jr. name.[1]

The first Carl's Jr. in Canada opened on June 22, 2011, in Kelowna, British Columbia.[2]

Ontario locations became affiliated with Toronto franchisee 6Points Food Services.[3] By May 2015, four locations had opened in SouthCentral Ontario, including two in Toronto that opened in April. The two Toronto restaurants closed in January 2016.[4] They had intended to open 30 locations within six years in the market.[5]

On October 30, 2016, Carl's Jr closed down all of its Okanagan locations, with the exception of the original Kelowna location, which remained open until November 17, 2016.[6][7]
