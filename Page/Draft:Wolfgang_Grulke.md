WOLFGANG GRULKE (born 19 June 1947) is an author and fossil collector with a particular interest in heteromorph ammonites.[1] A retired futurist, Grulke is an acknowledged expert in ammonite[2] and nautilus[3] cephalopods.

His private fossil collection is the envy of many museums[4] and includes some of the finest specimens of HETEROMORPH AMMONITES to be found anywhere in the world.[5][6]

Grulke is credited with putting heteromorph ammonites in the public eye in recent years. According to _The Times_, "Until Wolfgang Grulke began searching for them, they were virtually unknown. He has since discovered the largest, strangest and rarest of their kind."[7]


Early life

Grulke was born in Oberhausen, Germany in 1947. An only child, he was raised by his parents in Germany until he was ten, when the family moved to South Africa. Grulke was educated at Christian Brothers College and the University of the Witwatersrand, where he studied maths and physics.


Business career

Grulke joined IBM and had a 25-year-long career with the company. In 1987 he started FutureWorld as an informal business network.[8] In the 1990s, Grulke founded FutureWorld International as a networked global business and technology think-tank.

Grulke published several books on how to capitalise on the changing hi-tech future and became a prominent[9] speaker and futurist.[10]

Grulke was a Fellow of the Centre for Management Development at the London Business School and taught on the school's Senior Executive Programme.[11] He also worked with Duke Corporate Education and Oxford University's Said Business School.[12]

In 2014 he retired from FutureWorld to focus on his natural history interests.


Natural history

Growing up in Germany, Grulke had never seen the sea. When he moved to South Africa, he visited the seaside with his parents, became an avid shell collector and developed a passion for marine biology. He began collecting fossils, and soon focused on cephalopods, and more particularly heteromorph ammonites.[13]

Ammonite_cemetery.jpg Grulke started as an absolute amateur when it came to geology and palaeontology, but learnt from experienced geologists and palaeontologists. He noticed their lack of funds, and started sponsoring digs, so that he could accompany them, and learn from them.[14] On scuba diving expeditions, Grulke took many photographs and helped identify new species; he eventually served as a director of the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology.

In addition to diving expeditions to remote locations such as Aldabra and Papua New Guinea, Grulke travelled far and wide in his business career. He never missed an opportunity, when business was done, to explore, go diving or add to his growing collection.[15] When Grulke moved to Dorset in the UK around 2005, he converted an old barn into his "private museum"[16], where he installed cabinets to show the complete chronology of the origin and evolution of ammonites and their ancestors, from 500 million years ago to the time they died out.[17] Today his museum is considered to contain one of the world's best collections of ancient and modern cephalopods, especially ammonites and nautiloids.[18]

In 2014 Grulke published _HETEROMORPH: The rarest fossil ammonites. Nature at its most bizarre_, endorsed by the Geological Society of London. According to Prof. Chris Wilson, this work was significant in that Grulke shows that the modern view of heteromorph ammonites no longer regards them as rare oddities. "He describes how these ‘eccentric and bizarre members of the ammonites’ arose three times during the reign of the order and that ‘at a point during the mid-Cretaceous they represented almost half of all ammonite species in existence at that time’."[19]

Bob Henderson wrote in _Australian Geologist_: "Wolfgang Grulke's book _HETEROMORPH_ is both noteworthy and exceptional. This is a lifetime's work by a dedicated investigator of the topic, deeply informed through the literature and a network of relationships with active researchers, combined with the hands-on passion of an avid collector."[20]

In 2016 he published _NAUTILUS: Beautiful survivor. 500 million years of evolutionary history_, also endorsed by the Geological Society, and offering new insight into this interesting species.[21]

Grulke serves on the Advisory Board of Jurassica, a project to develop a major tourist attraction on the Isle of Portland on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site in southern England.[22] The Jurassic Coast displays the most complete record anywhere in the world of the 185 million years of the Earth's history that we call the Mesozoic era.[23]
