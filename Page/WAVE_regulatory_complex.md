The WAVE REGULATORY COMPLEX (WRC) is a five-subunit protein complex in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family involved in the formation of the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. The holocomplex comprises WAVE1 (also known as WASF1), CYFIP1, ABI2, Nap1 and HSPC300 in its canonical form, or orthologues of these.[1] WAVERegulatoryComplex.png


Composition

The proteins within the WRC form a CYFIP1-Nap1 heterodimer and a WAVE1-Abi2-HSPC300 heterotrimer,[2][3] and following interaction with Rac1, the holocomplex has been observed in a CYFIP1-Nap1-Abi2 heterotrimer subcomplex and an active WAVE1-HSPC300 heterodimer subcomplex.[4]


Function

WRC recruitment to the sites of actin nucleation events at the cell periphery is mediated by the binding of a number of ligands containing a conserved WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS) which binds to a conserved location shared across the surfaces of Abi2 and CYFIP1.[5] The WRC is activated by interaction with the Rac1 (via the CYFIP1 component of the complex) and Arf small GTPases[6] (such as ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6[7] ) or the similar protein ARL1,[8] which causes dissociation of the CYFIP1-Nap1-Abi2 heterotrimer at the membrane periphery.[9] This allows the V domain of the WAVE1 component to interact with the actin monomers while its CA domain interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, allowing the Arp2/3 complex to act as a nucleation core for the branching and extension of actin filaments.
