Reception

Reception for _Tharle Village_ has been mixed, with most critics feeling that the movie did not measure up favorably to _Thithi_.[3][4]_The Bangalore Mirror_ rated the movie at three out of five stars, commenting that "Tarle Village (Mischievous Village) lacks the wry humour and realistic portrayal of village life that was Thithi."[5] _The New Indian Express_ also felt that _Tharle Village_ was not _Thithi_'s equivalent, but gave it "a thumbs up for its honesty. The film is offbeat and is for people who miss the rustic past."[6]

_The Hindu_ was highly critical of the movie, writing that "K.M. Raghuâ€™s poorly conceived and executed film _Tharle Village_ makes you wonder about the relationship between the characters of a story and the story itself."[7]

Criticism

There was concern that _Tharle Village_, along with other movies that were casting the _Thithi_ actors in similar or nearly identical roles, were exploiting the actors, prompting _Thithi_ screenwriter Eragowda to state that he was "disturbed after seeing how the actors of _Thithi_ have been recently misused and misappropriated in recent Kannada films."[8] Director Raam Reddy commented that he felt that the actors deserve recognition but that "instead of playing characters that are very similar to their fictional roles in _Thithi,_ it would be much more exciting to see them playing original roles in all their new films."[9]
