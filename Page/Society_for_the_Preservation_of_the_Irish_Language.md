The SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE IRISH LANGUAGE (SPIL; )[1] was a cultural organisation in late 19th-century Ireland, which was part of the Gaelic revival of the period.

It was founded on 29 December 1876 by Douglas Hyde and Count Plunkett[2][3] Unlike similar organisations of the time, which were antiquarian in nature, the SPIL aimed at protecting the status of the Irish language, which was threatened with extinction at the time.[4] The society succeeded in having Irish included on the curriculum of primary and secondary schools and third-level colleges in 1878.[5]

The membership of the SPIL included Protestant Ascendancy figures such as Lord de Vesci and Colonel W. E. A. Macdonnell. Horace Plunkett represented the Society at the 1901 Pan-Celtic Congress in Dublin. [6] It took a conciliatory approach to the British government and civil service in pursuing its aims, in contrast to the later Gaelic League, which was anti-British in character.[7]
