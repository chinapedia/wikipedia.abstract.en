"FIGURE IT OUT" is a single by American rapper French Montana, featuring Kanye West and Nas. The track was released on May 6, 2016 as the first single from Montana's mixtape _MC4_ (2016).[1] It was also released as the first single from his mixtape _Wave Gods_ (2016), which was released at an earlier date than the single itself.[2]


Background

Montana initially revealed that he had been working on music with West in July 2014 when he shared a snippet of a collaboration between them via Instagram.[3] However, this snippet was revealed at a later date to be part of an unreleased track titled "Ass Shots" when it surfaced online in full.[4]

"Figure It Out" didn't mark the only time that Montana was involved musically with West in its year of release, since he had vocals on "Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission" from West's album _The Life of Pablo_ (2016).


Composition

Multiple elements are sampled from We Are the Take's 2010 song "Montreal Love Song" throughout the track, most noticeably the vocals "I can't figure it, I can't figure it out, out".[5] As well as this, drums from 1968 single "Get Out of My Life Woman" by Solomon Burke are sampled throughout.[6]


Music video

On March 6, 2016, Montana shared a photo online of him and the two featured artists filming a music video for the song.[7] It was officially released on May 5, 2016 and was filmed in a desert.[8] Two days after the release of the music video, West tweeted out a link to it and also expressed his enjoyment from filming with Montana and Nas.[9]
