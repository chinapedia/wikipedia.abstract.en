The 2017 NCAA DIVISION I FBS FOOTBALL SEASON was the highest level of college football competition in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The regular season began on August 26, 2017 and ended on December 9, 2017.

The Alabama Crimson Tide and Georgia Bulldogs played in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship. Alabama defeated Georgia in overtime by a score of 26–23 on a game-winning touchdown pass from Tua Tagovailoa to Devonta Smith. Alabama claimed its 17th national title in school history, the most of any current FBS team.

The University of Central Florida Knights finished the season as the only undefeated team in NCAA Division I FBS and beat the Auburn Tigers. Auburn defeated College Football Playoff national champion Alabama and split two games with runner-up Georgia during the season. Because of this, the UCF Knights also claimed a national title this season.[1]


Rule changes

Game rules

The following rule changes were recommended by the NCAA Football Rules Committee for the 2017 season:[2]

-   Prohibiting defensive players running toward the line of scrimmage from leaping or hurdling any offensive lineman on field goal or PAT attempts (15 yards). Previously, defensive players were allowed to leap or hurdle offensive linemen as long as they do not land on another player. The NFL also adopted this rule for the 2017 season.
-   Requiring players to wear knee pads and pants that cover the knees, repealing a change from the 2011 season that changed this from a requirement to a recommendation. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) also adopted a similar rule.
-   Include the nameplate on the back of the jersey in the definition of a "horse-collar tackle".
-   Expanded the interpretation of an "unfair act" to include committing intentional fouls designed to manipulate the game clock, which result in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties against each player committing the foul (which count towards their limit of two in the same game before ejection) and resetting of the game clock, similar to a rule change made in the NFL in 2017.

The committee left the current targeting rules unchanged for the 2017 season, despite discussions to modify the rule to eject a player for targeting only if the call is confirmed, not if the call stands due to lack of "indisputable video evidence" to overturn the ruling on the field.

Points of emphasis this season include speeding up games by:

-   Promptly starting the second half when the halftime clock reaches 0:00.
-   Penalizing coaches 15 yards and unsportsmanlike conduct for stepping onto the field to argue a call.
-   Starting the game clock immediately upon spotting the ball after a ball carrier goes out of bounds before the 2:00 mark of each half.

Recruiting rules

-   In April 2017, the NCAA Division I Council approved a suite of rule changes affecting the recruiting process. The most significant of these are:[3]
    -   Effective with the 2017–18 school year, a national early signing period for high school players was introduced. The exact timing of the signing period was not set at the date of announcement; it would eventually be set for December (see below).
    -   The current limit of 25 new scholarships (or financial aid agreements) per academic year became an absolute limit (with only narrowly defined exceptions). This was seen by media as ending the phenomenon of oversigning.
    -   FBS programs may no longer conduct so-called "satellite camps"—i.e., camps or clinics that feature active FBS coaches or football staff members held at locations distant from the school's campus. Effective immediately, FBS coaches may only work at camps for a total of 10 days in June and July, and can only attend camps if they are located on their school's campus, or at an off-campus facility where their program regularly practices or plays home games. Schools were allowed to honor contracts for satellite camps that were signed before January 18, 2017.[4]
-   The following month, the Collegiate Commissioners Association, which controls the letter of intent program, approved the recruiting changes approved by the Division I Council. The early signing period for high schoolers was fixed as the first three days of the midyear signing period for junior college players; in 2017, this window fell on December 20–22.[5]


Conference realignment

Membership changes

  School                          Former conference   New conference
  ------------------------------- ------------------- ----------------
  Coastal Carolina Chanticleers   FCS independent     Sun Belt
  UAB Blazers                     No team             Conference USA

Coastal Carolina was in the second year of its FBS transition. It was counted as an FBS opponent for scheduling purposes, with full FBS membership and bowl eligibility following in the 2018 season.

The UAB football team returned after a two-year absence. The program was shut down by school administrators following the 2014 season but was reinstated less than a year later. UAB resumed its place as a full football-sponsoring member of Conference USA.

Upcoming changes

Idaho and New Mexico State played their final seasons as football members of the Sun Belt Conference. Idaho also played its last season at the FBS level; following the decision of the Sun Belt to not extend its football membership agreements with the two schools after their expirations in 2017, Idaho announced that it would downgrade to FCS and add football to its standing membership in the Big Sky Conference. New Mexico State reverted to FBS Independent status for 2018 and beyond.


Updated stadiums

Two schools opened new stadiums for the 2017 season:

-   COLORADO STATE opened SONNY LUBICK FIELD AT COLORADO STATE STADIUM. The on-campus facility, with a capacity of 41,201, replaced the off-campus Hughes Stadium, which had been home to the Rams since 1968.
-   GEORGIA STATE moved from the Georgia Dome, which was demolished during the 2017 season, to GEORGIA STATE STADIUM. This is the third incarnation of a stadium that opened in 1996 as the Centennial Olympic Stadium, built for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The stadium was planned from the beginning to be retrofitted into a baseball park for the Atlanta Braves, and opened in that form as Turner Field in 1997. After the Braves vacated Turner Field following their 2016 season to move into SunTrust Park, Georgia State bought Turner Field and adjacent property for a major campus expansion project. In its football form, the stadium had an initial capacity of 24,333 with possible future expansion to 33,000.

Several other schools debuted major improvements to their existing venues for 2017:

-   ARIZONA STATE is continuing a four-phase renovation of SUN DEVIL STADIUM. The third phase, completed for the 2017 season, includes the addition of a new video board above the north end zone.
-   COASTAL CAROLINA made its FBS debut in an expanded BROOKS STADIUM. The expansion project began immediately after the 2015 season, a few months after Coastal announced it would join the Sun Belt Conference in 2016 for non-football sports and 2017 for football. The venue, which previously held 9,200 people, had a capacity of 15,000 for the 2017 season, and will be further expanded to 20,000 in 2018.[6]
-   WEST VIRGINIA completed approximately $50 million in renovations to MILAN PUSKAR STADIUM. Work on the west and south side gates and concourses, including renovations to concessions, restrooms, and additional space for EMS and police operations, was finished for 2017, mirroring similar work on the north and east sides completed for 2016.
-   LOUISIANA TECH opened a new pressbox and suite complex on the west side of JOE AILLET STADIUM which includes new ticketing facilities and restrooms. Also included in the renovations were new LED stadium lighting fixtures.
-   NOTRE DAME debuted the Campus Crossroads project, which added three new 8-story structures on the South, West and East sides of NOTRE DAME STADIUM. The expansion, which added new premium stadium seats on the East and West sides of the stadium, also features more than 750,000 square feet of teaching, research, and performance space.

Two schools announced naming rights deals for their stadiums:

-   KENTUCKY renamed its stadium from Commonwealth Stadium to Kroger Field per a 12-year naming rights deal with the Cincinnati-based supermarket company. This made UK the first Southeastern Conference school to enter into such a deal for its football stadium.[7]
-   NEW MEXICO renamed its stadium from University Stadium to Dreamstyle Stadium per a 10-year naming rights deal with Albuquerque-based construction firm Dreamstyle Remodeling.[8]


Kickoff games

"Week Zero"

-   A recent rule change allows Hawaii, and teams that have a scheduled game at Hawaii, to play during the "Week Zero" kickoff weekend in late August. This change better accommodates the long-standing "Hawaii rule" that allows schools which travel between Hawaii and the mainland (including schools based in Hawaii) to schedule an extra game each season. Four schools have taken advantage of the extra week:[9]
    -   Hawaii played at UMass on August 26, with the visitors winning 38–35.[10] UMass ended their 2016 season with a loss at Hawaii, and thus opened their 2017 season against the same opponent.
    -   BYU hosted FCS opponent Portland State on August 26, winning 20–6.[11]
    -   San Jose State hosted USF on August 26, with the visitors winning 42–22.[12]
    -   Colorado State hosted Oregon State on August 26 in the first game at the Rams' new stadium (see above), and won 58–27.[13]
-   Stanford and Rice played in Sydney on August 26 (August 27 local time) for the second Sydney Cup,[14] won by Stanford in a 62–7 blowout.[15] This was the second straight year a Pac-12 team went to Australia, as California defeated Hawaii in the first Sydney Cup to open the 2016 season.

Week 1

During the official Week 1 (as usual, held the weekend before Labor Day), several neutral-site "kickoff weekend" games were held, in addition to a full slate of games held at home stadiums around the U.S.:

-   Advocare Classic
    -   #17 Florida played against #11 Michigan at AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas) on September 2, with Michigan winning 33–17.
-   Belk Kickoff Game
    -   North Carolina State played against South Carolina at Bank of America Stadium (Charlotte, North Carolina) on September 2, with the Gamecocks winning 35–28.
-   Chick-fil-A Kickoff Games
    -   #1 Alabama defeated #3 Florida State. Alabama rolled past FSU 24–7 at the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta, Georgia) on September 2.
    -   #25 Tennessee defeated Georgia Tech. Tennessee came back and won in a classic 42–41 in double overtime at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on September 4.
-   Advocare Texas Kickoff
    -   #13 LSU shut out BYU 27–0 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome[16] (New Orleans, Louisiana) on September 2.

Conference summaries

Through the 2015 season, conferences were required to have a minimum of 12 football members to play a conference championship game outside of the NCAA limit of 12 regular-season games. The NCAA removed this requirement effective with the 2016 season.[17] At that time, all FBS conferences except the Big 12 and Sun Belt Conferences held championship games for football. The Big 12 reinstated its championship game for the 2017 season, while the Sun Belt determined its 2017 football champion solely by regular-season records before launching a championship game starting in 2018.

Rankings reflect the Week 14 AP Poll before the conference championship games were played.

Bowl eligibility

There were 39 post-season bowl games, with two teams advancing to a 40th – the CFP National Championship game. Normally, a team is required to have a .500 minimum winning percentage during the regular season to become bowl eligible. If there are not enough winning teams to fulfill all open bowl slots, teams with losing records may be chosen to fill all 78 bowl slots. Additionally, on the rare occasion in which a conference champion does not meet eligibility requirements, they are usually still chosen for bowl games via tie-ins for their conference. For the 2017 season, no team with a losing record was chosen for a bowl game. Three bowl-eligible teams, including one with a winning record, were denied bowl bids.
