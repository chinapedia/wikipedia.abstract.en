KYM GREELEY (born 1973, Topsail, NL) is a painter based in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, known primarily for her screen-printed paintings of the province's landscape and roads. In 2011, she was longlisted for the Sobey Art Award, one of Canada's most prestigious contemporary art awards.[1]


Career

Kym Greeley studied at the Cooper Union School for the Advancement of Art and Science in New York as part of an exchange program, graduating in 1996. She then graduated from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1997, where she majored in Painting and Drawing.

Greeley pursued a career as a contemporary artist in New York for five years, but found that her interests leaned towards the landscape. She returned to Newfoundland in 2003.[2]

Her Newfoundland paintings evolved from her studies in abstraction while in New York, and portray contemporary Newfoundland subjects as unromantic, largely monochromatic representations that are abstracted from their original surroundings, textures and colors.[3] She has described her paintings as "taken from a 'place' and made into a 'non-place'. ... This 'non-place' than becomes a representation of my feelings or experiences."[4]

Greeley's paintings have since been exhibited in Germany, Canada and the United States. In 2009, Greeley participated in a four month residency at The Rooms in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, which led to a solo exhibition entitled "Time Trial."[5] In 2013, her work was included in a major survey of painting in Canada titled "The Painting Project," organized by Galerie UQAM.[6]

After the birth of twins in 2014, Greeley's subject matter shifted to interiors.[7] This body of work was shown at The Rooms as part of the exhibition "All Day Within the Dreamy House" in 2016.[8]

Greeley has also worked with Fogo Island Arts as a consultant, and has collaborated with fellow artist Erika Jane Stephens Moore on caribou-themed wallpaper for the Fogo Island Inn.[9] The wallpaper was included in the exhibition "Folklore and Other Panics" at The Rooms in 2015.

Her work is included in the Canada Council Art Bank, The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and the Newfoundland Provincial Art Bank Collection. She is currently represented by Christina Parker Gallery.
