The Maratha community originally organised silent rallies across the state. A few cases of violence in July were noted after 2 years of silent protest. It was a silent protest against the rape and murder in Kopardi[1] (district Ahmednagar), the victim was a minor school girl. The incident took place on 13 July 2016 between 6.45 pm and 7.30 pm at Kopardi, in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. The protesters demand death sentence to rapists as early as possible.

No political leader, no slogans and well maintained environment were notable features of these marches. Millions of people from all parts of Maharashtra came together to protest, but no harm was done to any public or private property until the protests turned violent due to alleged ignorance of the government.

The demand for reservation was also a part of this protest. Recently, the Bombay Highcourt upheld the reservation given to the Maratha Community but also mentioned, that the percentage of quota given wasn't justifiable. [2] In Maharashtra, Maratha community demands reservation in education and government services. Most of farmers, who committed suicide belonged to Maratha caste. The division of land in small pieces makes the condition critical. Infertile of Land, drought hit Maratha community continuously. Due to the lack of reservation, unemployment became a major problem. Some castes of Maratha community known as Kunbi, however, do get the benefits of Other Backward Class category reservation, however, most people are allegedly out of benefits. More than 95% of Maratha are socially and educationally backward. Thus, their demand is reservation in education and employment. Maratha Kranti Morcha broke record of human crowd in silent march and continued to break their own records. The minorities like Muslim community also supported this Morcha.


Demands

Punishment to culprits in Kopardi rape and murder case, reservation in education and government jobs, implementation of recommendations of National Commission on Farmers chaired by Dr. M. S. Swaminathan and Amendment in Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 to stop its misuse.[3]


Role of social media

Social Media played a key role in the protest; various Facebook groups and pages were created to make this protest successful.[4] Many college students, graduates and IT professionals were actively managing the protest and providing information using social media.[5]

On 9 October 2016 the protest hit social media including Twitter and Facebook. Hashtag #MarathaKrantiMorcha was trending on Twitter[6]

Social

To counter the Maratha Kranti Morcha a consolidation of Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Dalits 10 splinter groups have forged an alliance and decided to organise silent morchas across Maharashtra with aim of defending their reservation quota and demand not to tampering with the reservation norms or any amendment to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.[7]

Impact

After continuous growing protest in each city and millions of peoples participation in each Maratha Kranti Morcha, on 13 October 2016 the Government of Maharashtra took decision[77] and

-   Increased the upper limit of the Economically Backward Class (EBC) to Rs.6,00,000 and announced extension of monetary benefits under this category to students from all castes (Marathi). The students from the EBC category studying in all professional courses will be eligible for the benefits such as fee reimbursement under the Rajshri Shahu Maharaj Scheme (Marathi) (Marathi)(Marathi) (Marathi) (Marathi), which was named after the Maratha king Rajshri Shahu of Kolhapur who introduced reservation policy for the first time in his kingdom Kolhapur State.
-   Announced schemes for children of small land holding farmers under the Panjabrao Deshmukh Scheme (Marathi) (Marathi) (Marathi).

As the Bombay high court had stayed the 16% reservation granted to Marathas in jobs and education on grounds that the data used by the government was faulty. The Government of Maharashtra on 5 December 2016 filed a 2,800-page affidavit to justify the reservation for Marathas as legal and that it did not violate constitutional provisions. The affidavit contained documents substantiating its claim that the community is socially and educationally backward.[78]
