FOOSE is an unincorporated community in western Dallas County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The community lies on Missouri Route EE, just west of U.S. Route 65, approximately seven miles south-southwest of Buffalo. The Dallas-Polk county line is two miles west along Route EE.[2] The community is at an elevation of 1207 feet[3] and Greasy Creek, a tributary of the Niangua River, drains the area to the east of Route 65.[4]


History

A post office called Foose was established in 1893, and remained in operation until 1905.[5] The community most likely derives its name from Foosland, Illinois, the native home of a share of the first settlers.[6]
