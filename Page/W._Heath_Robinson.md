WILLIAM HEATH ROBINSON (31 May 1872 – 13 September 1944) was an English cartoonist, illustrator and artist, best known for drawings of whimsically elaborate machines to achieve simple objectives.[1]

In the UK, the term "Heath Robinson" entered the popular language during the 1914–1918 First World War as a description of any unnecessarily complex and implausible contrivance, much as "Rube Goldberg machines" came to be used in the United States from the 1920s onwards as a term for similar efforts. "Heath Robinson contraption" is perhaps more often used in relation to temporary fixes using ingenuity and whatever is to hand, often string and tape, or unlikely cannibalisations. Its continuing popularity was undoubtedly linked to Britain's shortages and the need to "make do and mend" during the Second World War.


Early life

Robinson(WH)-('Uncle_Lubin').jpg William Heath Robinson was born at 25 Ennis Road on 31 May 1872 into a family of artists in an area of London known as Stroud Green, Finsbury Park, North London. His father Thomas Robinson (1838–1902) and brothers Thomas Heath Robinson (1869–1954) and Charles Robinson (1870–1937) all worked as illustrators.


Career

His early career involved illustrating books – among others: Hans Christian Andersen's _Danish Fairy Tales and Legends_ (1897), _The Arabian Nights_ (1899), _Tales from Shakespeare_ (1902), _Gargantua and Pantagruel_ (1904),[2] _Twelfth Night_ (1908), _Andersen's Fairy Tales_ (1913), _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ (1914), Charles Kingsley's _The Water-Babies_ (1915) and Walter de la Mare's _Peacock Pie_ (1916).

In the course of his work, Robinson also wrote and illustrated three children's books, _The Adventures of Uncle Lubin_ (1902), _Bill the Minder_ (1912) and _Peter Quip in Search of a Friend_ (1922). _Uncle Lubin_ is regarded as the start of his career in the depiction of unlikely machines.

During the First World War, he drew large numbers of cartoons, depicting ever-more-unlikely secret weapons being used by the combatants. He also depicted the American Expeditionary Force in France.[3]

He also produced a steady stream of humorous drawings for magazines and advertisements. In 1934 he published a collection of his favourites as _Absurdities_, such as:

-   "The Wart Chair. A simple apparatus for removing a wart from the top of the head"
-   "Resuscitating stale railway scones for redistribution at the station buffets"
-   "The multimovement tabby silencer", which automatically threw water at serenading cats

Most of his cartoons have since been reprinted many times in multiple collections.

The machines he drew were frequently powered by steam boilers or kettles, heated by candles or a spirit lamp and usually kept running by balding, bespectacled men in overalls. There would be complex pulley arrangements, threaded by lengths of knotted string. Robinson's cartoons were so popular that in Britain the term "Heath Robinson" is used to refer to an improbable, rickety machine barely kept going by incessant tinkering. (The corresponding term in the U.S. is _Rube Goldberg_, after the American cartoonist born just over a decade later, with an equal devotion to odd machinery. Similar "inventions" have been drawn by cartoonists in many countries, with the Danish Storm Petersen being on par with Robinson and Goldberg.)

One of his most famous series of illustrations was that which accompanied the first _Professor Branestawm_ book written by Norman Hunter. The stories told of the eponymous professor who was brilliant, eccentric and forgetful and provided a perfect backdrop for Robinson's drawings.

The last project Robinson worked on shortly before he died was illustrations for Lilian M. Clopet's short story collection _Once Upon a Time_, which was published in 1944.[4]

One of the automatic analysis machines built for Bletchley Park during the Second World War to assist in the decryption of German message traffic was named "Heath Robinson" in his honour. It was a direct predecessor to the Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.


Personal life

In 1903 he married Josephine Latey, the daughter of newspaper editor John Latey.[5] Heath Robinson moved to Pinner, Middlesex, in 1908. His house in Moss Lane is commemorated by a blue plaque.[6]


Death and legacy

He died in September 1944 during the Second World War and is buried in East Finchley Cemetery.

The Heath Robinson Museum opened in October 2016 to house a collection of nearly 1,000 original artworks owned by The William Heath Robinson Trust. The museum is in Memorial Park, Pinner, close to where the artist lived and worked. A nearby branch[7] of the PizzaExpress restaurants features designs inspired by the artist's work.


In popular culture

The name "Heath Robinson" became part of common parlance in the UK for complex inventions that achieved absurdly simple results following its use as services slang during the 1914–1918 First World War.[8]

In the _Wallace and Gromit_ films, Wallace often invents Heath Robinson-like machines, with some inventions being direct references.[9]

During the Falklands War (1982), British Harrier aircraft lacked their conventional "chaff"-dispensing mechanism.[10] Therefore, Royal Navy engineers designed an impromptu delivery system of welding rods, split pins and string which allowed six packets of chaff to be stored in the speedbrake well and deployed in flight. Due to its improvised and ramshackle nature it was often referred to as the "Heath Robinson chaff modification".[11]
