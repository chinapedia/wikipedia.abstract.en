In a movie a MEDIUM SHOT, MID SHOT (MS),[1] or WAIST SHOT[2] is a camera angle shot from a medium distance.[3]


Use

Medium shots are favored in sequences where dialogues or a small group of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background, such as when the shot is 'cutting the person in half'[4] and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language.[5] Medium shots are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters.[6] It is also used in interviews.[7] It is the most common shot in movies,[8][9] and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.[10]

A normal lens that sees what the human eye see,[11] is usually used for medium shots.[12]


Definition

The dividing line between what constitutes a long shot and medium shot is not definite, nor is the line between medium shot and close-up.[13] In some standard texts and professional references, a full-length view of a human subject is called a medium shot;[14] in this terminology, a shot of the person from the knees up or the waist up is a close-up shot. In other texts, these partial views are called medium shots.[15] In principal, the medium shot is what can be seen with the human eye in a single quick glance and convey all the action taking place in that field of view.[16][17]


Types

Medium shots are divided into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the shoulders or two-shots (featuring two people).[18] A medium wide shot, or American shot, shows a bit more of the background but is still close enough for facial expressions to be seen, although these facial expressions would be better seen in a waist-high shot.[19]
