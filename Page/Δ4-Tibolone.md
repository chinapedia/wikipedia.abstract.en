Δ⁴-TIBOLONE (developmental code name ORG-OM-38), also known as 7Α-METHYLNORETHISTERONE or as 7Α-METHYL-17Α-ETHYNYL-19-NORTESTOSTERONE, is a synthetic androgen and progestin which was never marketed.[1][2] The compound is a major active metabolite of tibolone, which itself is a prodrug of δ⁴-tibolone along with 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone (which, in contrast to δ⁴-tibolone, are estrogens).[3] Tibolone and δ⁴-tibolone are thought to be responsible for the androgenic and progestogenic activity of tibolone, while 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone are thought to be responsible for its estrogenic activity.[4]
