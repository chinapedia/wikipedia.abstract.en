SEKOLAH MENENGAH KEBANGSAAN DATUK PATINGGI HAJI ABDUL GAPOR (SMK DPHA GAPOR) is a public secondary school located in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. The school was named after the Sarawakian hero Datu Patinggi Abdul Gapur.


History

SMK DPHA Gapor was established by Sarawak State Education Department in 1974.

The first Principal of the school was Encik Haji Abdul Rahman bin Sahari. At that time, there were only 182 students studying in the school and a fraction of them were staying in the school's dormitories. There were only four teachers teaching in the school.

April 1974 marked an important date for the school because it was moved from SRK Lumba Kuda to new premises at Jalan Tun Jugah, Stampin. Due to the fact that SMK DPHA Gapor is now located in Stampin, it is also being referred to as SMK Stampin. It was the first ever school in Sarawak to use Malay as primary language for communication.

In 1976, the first entry of students to SMK DPHA Gapor from the student exchange programme initiated by Sarawak Foundation boasted 20 male students from Peninsular Malaysia and 6 from Sabah.

In 1977, there were 26 classrooms, 8 of them for Transition classes, 10 for Form 1, 7 for Form 2 and 1 for Form 3.

The year 1986 was the most challenging year in the history of the school because in this particular year, for the first time, the school accepted admission of students into Lower 6 Literature classes, which consisted of 3 classes, and hearing-impaired students into Form 3 special class. Ergo, in 1987, the school issued its first Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) candidates and Sijil Rendah Pelajaran (SRP) hearing-impaired candidates. The Form 3 special class, together with the teachers, were transferred from SMK Batu Lintang because of the reasons that SMK DPHA Gapor was a boarding school and SMK Batu Lintang had established a special class for visually impaired students.

On 18 July 1987, SMK DPHA Gapor was officiated by the Minister of Finance, Yang Berhormat Mulia Tan Sri Tengku Razaleigh.

In the beginning, the school emblem had the letters "BM" written on it which were short for _Berjaya Maju_ or _Bahasa Malaysia_, meaning succeed excellently and Malay language respectively. Nevertheless, the official meaning of the two letters was towards the path of excellence. However, Encik Bedui bin Une, who was the eighth Principal in SMK DPHA Gapor, did a little amendment to the motto of the school and changed it to "_Mudah, Logik, Praktikal_", literally meaning simple, logical and practical. The school anthem _Usaha dan Yakin_ was written by Encik Zainuddin Haji Suut.

Students are not allowed to switch between houses, unless there’s imbalance amount of distributions.) and compete with each other to earn the title of "Best Sports House of The Year". Each house has different colours. These houses include

-   Disciplinary Unit

-   Social and Welfare Unit

The councils include the Head Boy/Girl, Assistant Head Boy/Girl, Secretary, Treasurer, followed by the head of every unit.
