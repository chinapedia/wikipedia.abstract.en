It was directed by Brett Kelly and written by David A Lloyd, president of The Cousin Company Entertainment Group. The film stars Candice Lidstone, Peter Whittaker, Ian Quick, and Donna St-Jean.[3]


Plot

When a veteran cop is murdered by an underworld figure, it sets off a brutal crime wave. A black-clad vigilante figure on a motorcycle starts picking off gangsters one by one and turning the tables on the criminals.


Reception

Homicycle currently has a 3.3 rating on IMDb. Rock Shock Pop says the film has "the scratchy imperfection of an improperly handled print, the icy, synth score coolly evokes the time period, and the hero, decked in black leather and a motorcycle helmet, is reminiscent to those who populated numerous exploitation films of the era..."[4]
