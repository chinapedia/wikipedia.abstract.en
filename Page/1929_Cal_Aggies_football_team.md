The 1929 CAL AGGIES FOOTBALL TEAM represented the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture[1] in the 1929 college football season.[2] The team was known as either the Cal Aggies or California Aggies, and competed in the Far Western Conference (FWC).[3]

The Aggies were led by second-year head coach Irv "Crip" Toomey. They played home games in Sacramento, California. The Aggies finished as champion of the FWC, with a record of six wins and two losses (6–2, 3–1 FWC). The Aggies outscored their opponents 116–25 for the 1929 season, with all of their victories coming via shutout.

Kermit Schmidt, who played for the Cal Aggies from 1926 to 1929,[4] later played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Boston Braves and Cincinnati Reds.[5] Schmidt was the first Cal Aggie to play in the NFL. Following Schmidt, no other Aggie played in the NFL until Tom Williams in 1970.[6]
