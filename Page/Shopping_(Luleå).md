Luleå_Shopping_1955.jpg _SHOPPING_ is a shopping mall in down-town Luleå, northern Sweden. It was originally designed by Ralph Erskine with an intent to let "city life" move indoors during the cold seasons. Consequently, it was the first _purpose built indoor_ shopping centre in the world, when it opened in October 1955.[1] Since its inauguration it has seen multiple refurbishments and alterations, but is still used as a shopping mall.
