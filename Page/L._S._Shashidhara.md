LINGADAHALLI SUBRAHMANYA SHASHIDHARA (born 1963) is an Indian developmental biologist, geneticist and a professor of Biology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.[1] He heads the LSS Laboratory at IISER[2] and is known for his studies on Drosophila, particularly Evolution of appendages and functions of homeotic selector genes.[3] He is a J. C. Bose National Fellow of the Department of Science and Technology and an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy,[4] Indian Academy of Sciences[5] and the National Academy of Sciences, India.[6] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2008, for his contributions to biological sciences.[7]

He is also a member of visiting faculty of Biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat, India.[8]


Biography

L. S. Shashidhara, born on 23 March 1963 in the south Indian state of Karnataka, graduated in science from University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UAS) in 1985 and obtained a master's degree in Genetics and Plant breeding in 1987 from the same university.[9] After a brief stint (1987–88) at UAS as a teaching associate, he moved to University of Cambridge in 1988 for his doctoral studies to secure a PhD in 1991. On completion of his post-doctoral studies at Cambridge (1991–93), he returned to India to join National Centre for Biological Sciences and worked as a visiting fellow for two years. Subsequently, he moved to Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in 1995 as a scientist (group leader)[10] where he served till 2007 when he was transferred, on deputation, to the Pune centre of Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) as a professor.[11] Since then, he has been serving the institute as a professor and chair of Biology and is the co-ordinator of the department of Biology.[12] He pursues his research interests as the head of the LSS Laboratory at IISER where he hosts a number doctoral and post-doctoral scholars.[13] He also serves as an honorary professor at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research[14] and is the incumbent vice-president of the Indian National Science Academy.[15]


Legacy

Drosophila_melanogaster_-_side_(aka).jpg Shashidhara's researches were focused on developmental biology, specifically the development of limbs and the role played by Ultrabithorax, a Hox gene, functioning as a transcription factor.[16] Studying Drosophila melanogaster (commonly known as fruit fly) as a model, he elucidated the molecular pathways Wnt, TGF-? and EGFR/Ras that impact the growth control and developed a _fly model_ for studying Adenomatous polyposis coli, the colon cancer gene in humans. His studies are reported to have assisted in a wider understanding of the relation between genes and diseases in humans and in the development of cancer drug discovery systems.[17] His research findings have been published in a number of articles published in peer-reviewed journals,[18] several of them have been listed in online article repositories such as Metascience,[19] PubMed,[20] and ResearchGate.[21] He has also published many general articles on adacemics and has delivered keynote addresses and featured talks.[22][23] He is the secretary-general of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS),[24] and is associated with the Journal of Genetics and Current Science as their associate editor and with Scientific Reports as a member of its editorial board.[25]


Awards and honours

Shashidhara, a J. C. Bose National Fellow of the Department of Science and Technology, received the Technology Prize in Biological Sciences of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 2003[26] and the Outstanding Research Investigator Award of the Science Research Council of the Department of Atomic Energy in 2006.[27] The Indian academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow in 2007 and he became an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy[28] and the National Academy of Sciences, India in 2008. The same year he received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to Biological Sciences.[29]
