Early life

Rogers was born in Oamaru, North Otago, one of seven children.[2] The family later moved to Banks Peninsula, near Christchurch.[3] The name of her mother, a midwife, is unknown, however her father was Thomas Rogers.[4][5] She trained as a nurse at Christchurch Hospital from 1911 to 1913, then completed a midwifery certificate at St. Helens' Hospital.[6][7]

After qualifying, Rogers was a district nurse with the Nurse Maude organisation in Christchurch. While living in Christchurch, she was a member of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, and a leader of the church's Young Women’s Bible Class. She volunteered to go to Vanuatu as a nursing missionary, to assist with the establishment of a hospital there, however a natural disaster destroyed the area she was to go to.[8]


First World Wr

In July 1915, she enlisted in the New Zealand Army Nursing Service and left Wellington on board the SS _Maheno_. The ship sailed to Port Said, Egypt, and the contingent of nurses worked in a stationary hospital there.[9] In October 1915 Rogers was on board the SS _Marquette_ when it was torpedoed by a German submarine and sunk. Her body was found in a lifeboat with that of fellow nurse Helena Isdell, and four men, which washed ashore near the Greek town of Zagora.[10][11][12]

Recognition

Rogers is named on the Mikra British Cemetery in Greece and in the Nurses' Memorial Chapel at Christchurch Hospital.[13] She is also remembered in the Five Sisters Window at York Minster in York, England.[14] Her name appears on the Akaroa War Memorial.[15]
