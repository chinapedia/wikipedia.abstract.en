The 1946 ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 5, 1946. Incumbent Governor Sidney Preston Osborn ran for reelection, easily winning the Democratic primary, as well as defeating Republican challenger Bruce Brockett in the general election, and was sworn into his fourth term as Governor on January 7, 1947. Osborn died in office a year later.

In comparison to previous election cycles, Brockett signaled a shift in voters becoming more Republican, outperforming their past electoral failures significantly.[1]
