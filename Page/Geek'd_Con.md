GEEK'D CON is an annual fan convention held in Shreveport, Louisiana. The even was founded in 2015, and debuted as one of the largest Comic book convention in the state of Louisiana, with a first year attendance that topped 12,000 people over three days.

The event showcases comic books, science fiction/fantasy, pop culture and fandom elements, such as horror, anime, manga, animation, toys, collectible card games, video games and web entertainment. Like most comic book conventions, Geek'd Con features a large floorspace, taking up two full floors at the Hilton Hotel Convention Center (Shreveport) for exhibitors. The event includes a large autographs area, as well as an Artists Alley, where comic book artists can sign autographs and sell or do sketches.

Geek'd Con's economic impact for the Shreveport area exceeds $1.4 Million annually. [1]
