Closure

In January 2007, there was an incident where an employee drowned in one of the park's pools when he was trapped inside a high-pressure water pump while retrieving a visitor's items. Following that, it was revealed that the theme park had been operating for the last nine years without a license from the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ).[3]

The park was closed shortly after; a part of it was later reused as a restaurant, but largely deserted by 2014. Nevertheless, the shopping complex beneath it continued to operate until 2015.[4]
