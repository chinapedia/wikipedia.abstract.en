PÈNGCÍ (碰瓷 lit. touching or breaking porcelain) is the practice of crooks placing ostensibly expensive, fragile items (usually porcelain) in places where they may easily be knocked over, allowing them to collect damages when the items are damaged.[1] Recently, pengci has been expanded to include a predominantly Chinese crime where scammers feign injury in traffic accidents in order to extort money from drivers.[2][3]

Another variation of such a scam involves "defective" Terra-Cotta warriors at the factory shop of the Museum of Qin Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses and surrounding street markets in Xi'an. This is targeted at tourists who can cause these to break apart easily upon light touch.[4]

Pengci was invented by poor manchus in the Qing dynasty. They would carry a piece of counterfeit luxury china, and carefully run to the side of a wagon. They would then break the china against the wagon when the owner wasn't looking. Next. they would dupe their victim by claiming the broken fake china was ancient and valuable. If the wagoneer did not pay high compensation, a group of extortionists would get in a crowd to harass the owners. This extortion method was highly successful, and so was quickly learned by the Han people in the north and coastal areas.

The term has been extended to describe “broken porcelain” diplomacy, in which any foreign criticism of the Chinese government, or its strategic issues, is met with manufactured outrage, shattering the "porcelain of diplomacy" and fanning popular anger.[5]
