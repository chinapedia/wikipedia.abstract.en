Name history

The butte has been known by various names such as Modoc Mountain, Bald Mountain, and Yonna Butte. The name Yainax Butte was originally applied to a smaller mountain some northwest, which is now known as Council Butte.[3] Because of common usage, the US Board on Geographic Names officially changed the name to Yainax Butte in 1927.[4] [5]
