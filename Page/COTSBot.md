COTSBOT is a small intelligent underwater craft 4.5 feet long, which is being designed by Queensland University of Technology (QUT) to kill the very destructive crown of thorns starfish in the Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia. It identifies its target using an image-analyzing neural net to analyze what an onboard camera sees, and then lethal-injects the starfish with bile salts or similar using a needle on the end of a long underslung foldable arm.

It uses GPS to navigate. It has been in development since 2014. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

A smaller version of COTSBot called "RangerBot" is also being developed by QUT.[6]
