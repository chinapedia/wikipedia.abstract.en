HAROLD SCHEUB (born August 26, 1931) is an American Africanist, Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Scheub has recorded and compiled oral literature from across southern Africa.[1]


Life

Born in Gary, Indiana, Scheub was aware as a child of racial segregation in Gary. His family, of German descent, experienced harassment during the Second World War. After attending a Lutheran grade school and local high school, Scheub worked in a local steel mill. He joined the US Air Force, serving as a jet mechanic. On leaving the Air Force he was able to take advantage of the G.I. Bill to fund his college education, and studied literature at the University of Michigan. After a master's degree there, he taught composition classes at Valparaiso University before teaching for two years at Masindi Senior Secondary School in Masindi, Uganda. On his return to the United States he taught again at Valparaiso. Becoming involved in the civil rights movement, he studied Swahili at UCLA in the summer of 1965. Philip Curtin invited Scheub to study for a PhD in the department of African languages and literature at the University of Wisconsin. He worked with Archibald Campbell Jordan, who encouraged him to study Xhosa and do fieldwork research in South Africa.[2] He gained his PhD in 1969 with a thesis on the Ntsomi, a performing art practised by Xhosa women.[3] Crawford Young offered Scheub a job at Wisconsin, and he taught there for 43 years until his retirement in December 2013.[4]
