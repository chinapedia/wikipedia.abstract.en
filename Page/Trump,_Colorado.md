TRUMP is a ghost town in Park County, Colorado, United States.[1]


History

Trump was an agricultural and ranching settlement which prospered for a short time during the 1920s and early 1930s.[2][3]

Trump had a store, and a post office which served neighboring ranches. Trump also hosted rodeo competitions between local ranch hands.[4][5]

The population of Trump had declined to just three people by 1936.[6]

In 1937, a unique sandstone was identified in the vicinity by J. H. Johnson, and was named "Trump conglomerate" after the nearby settlement.[7][8]
