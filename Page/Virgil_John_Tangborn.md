VIRGIL JOHN TANGBORN (May 23, 1920 - June 14, 1944) PFC, U.S. Army, and Silver Star recipient for gallantry, was mortally wounded by enemy shellfire during the Invasion of Normandy on June 14, 1944 at the small village of Amfreville in Normandy, France. He was rescuing a wounded soldier trapped in a burning truck containing exploding ammunition. The action took place during ensuing explosions within a burning and heavily shelled artillery ammunition dump. He is the brother of Wendell Tangborn, American glaciologist.


Early life and education

Virgil was from a small farm near Nary, Minnesota, where he lived from 1930 until 1943. He attended grade school and high school at Nary through the 11th grade, the highest level offered there. Lacking an automobile and placing a priority upon necessary farm work, he was unable to travel the 10 miles from Nary to Bemidji High School, which offered 12th grade education. But Virgil threw himself into a quest to educate himself by reading books that he borrowed from the state library in St. Paul. A box of those books would arrive by mail every two weeks and were immediately devoured. The writers he chose were formidable, especially for a young man with a limited education. John Dewey, the imminent philosopher and educator was his idol. Dewey believed that education was more than just a preparation for life, but was life itself. Virgil fully agreed.


Military service and Silver Star action

Tangborn was drafted into the US Army on March 30, 1943, and sent to Camp Barkley, Texas for training. He auditioned for the French horn in the 90th Division band and was accepted as a band member. His unit's ship departed for England in January, 1944.

The official citation for action meriting gallantry and the Silver Star Medal follows:

  Pfc Virgil J. Tangborn 37172938, Inf, United States Army. On June 14, 1944 the field in which an artillery ammunition dump was located was heavily shelled. The ammunition dump was set on fire and during the ensuing explosions, Pfc Tangborn, seeing a wounded soldier trapped in a burning truck which was filled with exploding ammunition, hurried to the truck accompanied by two other enlisted men to effect a rescue of the wounded man. At this point Pfc Tangborn was mortally wounded by enemy shellfire. Entered service from Minnesota.


Daily Journal

Virgil maintained a journal dating from December, 1940. In it he recorded his thoughts and his perspectives on the world and books that he was reading. A sampling from the journal, now in possession of his brother Wendell, follows:

1941:
July 17) Draft Lottery - My number. Otherwise normal day. Studying correspondence. ...Following books forming my present education: _Why Forums_, Mary Ely; _Jean Christophe_, Romain Rolland; _Creative Music_.. .Trying to get musical ensemble ready to play at county fair.

August 25) Raining all day. Just finished reading a novel by Romain Rolland - a story of the life of a musical genius, a tremendous grasp of life experiment. ...My plans for the future are uncertain. This war makes planning almost impossible for me. Roughly speaking I would like to take a complete set of correspondence courses in college subjects, read a lot of books, see best motion pictures - this to form education. Headline: Russians and British march on Iran.

December 10) Tonight I spent the evening listening to the radio (Fred Allen and news) and read a few more chapters in a novel, _War and Peace_ by Tolstoy. I am reading two other books now also - Benjamin Franklin's _Autobiography_ and a book of the _Worlds' Great Short Stories_.
Last Sunday Japan attacked in the Pacific and brought U.S. into war. This makes an army life for me extremely probable. Must face it with resolution to do my best to adjust myself to such a life.

1942:
March 20) -- Got my orders to report for induction into army. Reading _Dramatic Opinions_ of G.B.S.

March 24) Warm, mild, spring-like. Military life grows more near. Black despair at prospect. ...Discussing future tonight with Father. He advises "educational" work. That's where I've often suspected my interests and talents... lay. But my ideas and desires are vague and unsure on this score. I have a desire which I hardly admit to myself - to be an artist of some kind. Motion pictures - Novelist, but I probably haven't the slightest talent.

March 26) Gloomy drizzling rain last two days. ...Next Tuesday I leave for Fort Snelling for physical exam. Hope I don’t pass it for very justified reasons. But hardly dare hope. Reading _Brothers Karamazov_ rather strange, almost unintelligible. But I gather some vague ideas from it. These characters seem to suffer so intensely from doubt, religious doubt and confusion. I believe I have a clearer philosophy of life. Thanks to J. Dewey, H. G. Wells, Shaw. Perhaps it is too simple. Maybe it won't stand any bitter experience - Life can be explained for the most part in terms of natural laws. The causes of suffering, pain then become plainer. Man should strive to enrich as much as possible life. To make himself an important tool in the general progress of mankind.

March 30) Tomorrow leave for army life if I'm not rejected for physical reasons. I fear what will probably be a terrible ordeal. Have been "celebrating" last three days by loafing. Haven't did a stroke of work. ...This will be my last day for recording until the present ordeal is over. Maybe I'll be back by end of week, maybe end of decade.


Memorial statue and Grave marker

On June 4, 2000, the "Les Quatre Braves" or "The Four Braves" memorial was dedicated in Périers, France. The memorial depicts four American soldiers killed during the Normandy invasion. Virgil is represented as the medic assisting his wounded comrade, sergeant Andrew Speese, who is trying to stand again. Richard Richtman guards to watch over and protect them. Behind, sergeant Tullio Micaloni signals his platoon of tanks to move.[1] The memorial was inspired by Henri Levaufre of Périers. Henri has dedicated his life to memorializing men of the 90th Division who died during the Normandy invasion. Périers was liberated by the 2nd Battalion, 359th Infantry Regiment, 90th Division, of the United States Army, on July 27, 1944.

PFC Virgil J. Tangborn, 37172938, is buried at Plot E, Row 25, Grave 20, Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, Colleville-sur-mer, France.[2]
