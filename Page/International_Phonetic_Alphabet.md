The INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ALPHABET (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language.[1] The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.[2][3]

The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables.[4] To represent additional qualities of speech, such as tooth gnashing, lisping, and sounds made with a cleft lip and cleft palate, an extended set of symbols, the extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet, may be used.[5]

IPA symbols are composed of one or more elements of two basic types, letters and diacritics. For example, the sound of the English letter may be transcribed in IPA with a single letter, , or with a letter plus diacritics, , depending on how precise one wishes to be.[6] Often, slashes are used to signal broad or phonemic transcription; thus, is less specific than, and could refer to, either or , depending on the context and language.

Occasionally letters or diacritics are added, removed or modified by the International Phonetic Association. As of the most recent change in 2005,[7] there are 107 letters, 52 diacritics and four prosodic marks in the IPA. These are shown in the current IPA chart, also posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA.[8]


History

In 1886, a group of French and British language teachers, led by the French linguist Paul Passy, formed what would come to be known from 1897 onwards as the International Phonetic Association (in French, __).[9] Their original alphabet was based on a spelling reform for English known as the Romic alphabet, but in order to make it usable for other languages, the values of the symbols were allowed to vary from language to language.[10] For example, the sound (the _sh_ in _shoe_) was originally represented with the letter in English, but with the digraph in French.[11] However, in 1888, the alphabet was revised so as to be uniform across languages, thus providing the base for all future revisions.[12][13] The idea of making the IPA was first suggested by Otto Jespersen in a letter to Paul Passy. It was developed by Alexander John Ellis, Henry Sweet, Daniel Jones, and Passy.[14]

Since its creation, the IPA has undergone a number of revisions. After revisions and expansions from the 1890s to the 1940s, the IPA remained primarily unchanged until the Kiel Convention in 1989. A minor revision took place in 1993 with the addition of four letters for mid central vowels[15] and the removal of letters for voiceless implosives.[16] The alphabet was last revised in May 2005 with the addition of a letter for a labiodental flap.[17] Apart from the addition and removal of symbols, changes to the IPA have consisted largely of renaming symbols and categories and in modifying typefaces.[18]

Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet for speech pathology were created in 1990 and officially adopted by the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association in 1994.[19]


Description

IPA_chart_2018.pdf

The general principle of the IPA is to provide one letter for each distinctive sound (speech segment), although this practice is not followed if the sound itself is complex.[20] This means that:

-   It does not normally use combinations of letters to represent single sounds, the way English does with , and , or single letters to represent multiple sounds the way represents or in English.
-   There are no letters that have context-dependent sound values, as do "hard" and "soft" {{angbr or [[hard_and_soft_G| _._ [21] Similarly, a doubled secondary stress mark is commonly used for tertiary stress.

Length is commonly extended by repeating the length mark, as in English _shhh!_ , or for "overlong" segments in Estonian:

-   _vere_ 'blood [gen.sg.]', _veere_ 'edge [gen.sg.]', _veere_ 'roll [imp. 2nd sg.]'
-   _lina_ 'sheet', _linna_ 'town [gen. sg.]', _linna_ 'town [ine. sg.]'

(Normally additional degrees of length are handled by the extra-short or half-long diacritics, but in the Estonian examples, the first two cases are analyzed as simply short and long.)

Occasionally other diacritics are doubled:

-   Rhoticity in Badaga "mouth", "bangle", and "crop".[22]
-   Aspiration, for example contrasting Korean mild aspiration with strong aspiration .[23]
-   Nasalization, as in Palantla Chinantec vs .[24]
-   Weak vs strong ejectives, , .[25]
-   Especially lowered, e.g. (or , if the former symbol does not display properly) for as a weak fricative in some pronunciations of _register_.[26]
-   Especially retracted (at least on a vowel), e.g. ,[27] though, depending on the font, on a consonant this could be confused with alveolar or alveolarized notation from the extIPA, though such an issue can be easily avoided by placing the second diacritic _to the right of_ the letter (), rather than below the first diacritic.
-   The transcription of strident and harsh voice as extra-creaky may be motivated by the similarities of these phonations.


Obsolete and nonstandard symbols

The IPA once had parallel symbols from alternative proposals, but in most cases eventually settled on one for each sound. The rejected symbols are now considered obsolete. An example is the vowel letter , rejected in favor of . Letters for affricates and sounds with inherent secondary articulation have also been mostly rejected, with the idea that such features should be indicated with tie bars or diacritics: for is one. In addition, the rare voiceless implosives, , have been dropped and are now usually written . A retired set of click letters, , is still sometimes seen, as the official pipe letters may cause problems with legibility, especially when used with brackets ([ ] or / /), the letter , or the prosodic marks (for this reason, some publications which use the current IPA pipe letters disallow IPA brackets ).[28]

Individual non-IPA letters may find their way into publications that otherwise use the standard IPA. This is especially common with:

-   Affricates, such as the Americanist barred lambda for or for . Some authors find the tie bars displeasing but the lack of tie bars confusing (i.e. for as distinct from ), while others simply prefer to have one letter for each segmental phoneme in a language.
-   Digits for tonal phonemes that have conventional numbers in a local tradition, such as the four tones of Standard Chinese. This may be more convenient for comparison between languages and dialects than a phonetic transcription because tones often vary more than segmental phonemes do.
-   Digits for tone levels, though the lack of standardization can cause confusion (with e.g. "1" for high tone in some languages but for low tone in others).
-   Iconic extensions of standard IPA letters that can be readily understood, such as retroflex {{angbr and {{angbr.

In addition, there are typewriter substitutions for when IPA support is not available, such as capital for .


Extensions

The "Extensions to the IPA", often abbreviated as "extIPA" and sometimes called "Extended IPA", are symbols whose original purpose was to accurately transcribe disordered speech. At the Kiel Convention in 1989, a group of linguists drew up the initial extensions,[29] which were based on the previous work of the PRDS (Phonetic Representation of Disordered Speech) Group in the early 1980s.[30] The extensions were first published in 1990, then modified, and published again in 1994 in the _Journal of the International Phonetic Association_, when they were officially adopted by the ICPLA.[31] While the original purpose was to transcribe disordered speech, linguists have used the extensions to designate a number of unique sounds within standard communication, such as hushing, gnashing teeth, and smacking lips.[32]

In addition to the Extensions to the IPA there are the conventions of the Voice Quality Symbols, which besides the concept of voice quality in phonetics include a number of symbols for additional airstream mechanisms and secondary articulations.


Segments without letters

The remaining blank cells on the IPA chart can be filled without too much difficulty if the need arises. Some _ad hoc_ letters have appeared in the literature for the retroflex lateral flap (having the expected form of plus a retroflex tail), the voiceless lateral fricatives (now provided for by the extIPA), the epiglottal trill (arguably covered by the epiglottal "fricatives" ), the labiodental plosives ( in some old Bantuist texts) and the near-close central vowels ( in some publications). Diacritics can supply much of the remainder.[33] If a sound cannot be transcribed, an asterisk may be used, either as a letter or as a diacritic (as in sometimes seen for the Korean "fortis" velar).

Consonants

Representations of consonant sounds outside of the core set are created by adding diacritics to letters with similar sound values. The Spanish bilabial and dental approximants are commonly written as lowered fricatives, and respectively.[34] Similarly, voiced lateral fricatives would be written as raised lateral approximants, . A few languages such as Banda have a bilabial flap as the preferred allophone of what is elsewhere a labiodental flap. It has been suggested that this be written with the labiodental flap letter and the advanced diacritic, .[35]

Similarly, a labiodental trill would be written (bilabial trill and the dental sign), and labiodental stops rather than with the _ad hoc_ letters sometimes found in the literature. Other taps can be written as extra-short plosives or laterals, e.g. , though in some cases the diacritic would need to be written below the letter. A retroflex trill can be written as a retracted , just as non-subapical retroflex fricatives sometimes are. The remaining consonants, the uvular laterals ( _etc._) and the palatal trill, while not strictly impossible, are very difficult to pronounce and are unlikely to occur even as allophones in the world's languages.

Vowels

The vowels are similarly manageable by using diacritics for raising, lowering, fronting, backing, centering, and mid-centering.[36] For example, the unrounded equivalent of can be transcribed as mid-centered , and the rounded equivalent of as raised or lowered (though for those who conceive of vowel space as a triangle, simple already is the rounded equivalent of ). True mid vowels are lowered or raised , while centered and (or, less commonly, ) are near-close and open central vowels, respectively. The only known vowels that cannot be represented in this scheme are vowels with unexpected roundedness, which would require a dedicated diacritic, such as and (or and ).


Symbol names

An IPA symbol is often distinguished from the sound it is intended to represent, since there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between letter and sound in broad transcription, making articulatory descriptions such as 'mid front rounded vowel' or 'voiced velar stop' unreliable. While the _Handbook of the International Phonetic Association_ states that no official names exist for its symbols, it admits the presence of one or two common names for each.[37] The symbols also have nonce names in the Unicode standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls "epsilon", but Unicode calls it "small letter open E".

The traditional names of the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters.[38] Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as , may have a variety of names, sometimes based on the appearance of the symbol or on the sound that it represents. In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.

For diacritics, there are two methods of naming. For traditional diacritics, the IPA notes the name in a well known language; for example, is _acute_, based on the name of the diacritic in English and French. Non-traditional diacritics are often named after objects they resemble, so is called _bridge_.

Geoffrey Pullum and William Ladusaw list a variety of names in use for IPA symbols, both current and retired, in addition to names of many other non-IPA phonetic symbols in their _Phonetic Symbol Guide_.[39]


Typefaces

IPA typeface support is increasing, and is now included in several typefaces such as the Times New Roman versions that come with various recent computer operating systems. Diacritics are not always properly rendered, however.

IPA typefaces that are freely available online include:

-   Several from the SIL (such as Charis SIL, Doulos SIL, and Gentium)
-   Dehuti
-   DejaVu Sans
-   TITUS Cyberbit
-   Lato (with its derivate Carlito)
-   Linux Libertine (with its derivates Linux Biolinum, Libertinus Serif, Libertinus Sans)

Some commercial IPA-compatible typefaces include:

-   Brill, available from Brill Publishers
-   Various fonts shipped with Microsoft products such as Segoe UI, Calibri, Cambria, Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS and the most recent versions of Times New Roman and Arial

These all include several ranges of characters in addition to the IPA. Modern Web browsers generally do not need any configuration to display these symbols, provided that a typeface capable of doing so is available to the operating system.


ASCII and keyboard transliterations

Several systems have been developed that map the IPA symbols to ASCII characters. Notable systems include SAMPA and X-SAMPA. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient keying of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.


Computer input using on-screen keyboard

Online IPA keyboard utilities[40] are available, and they cover the complete range of IPA symbols and diacritics. In April 2019, Google's Gboard for Android and iOS added an IPA keyboard to its platform.[41][42]

[6] The inverted bridge under the specifies it as apical (pronounced with the tip of the tongue), and the superscript _h_ shows that it is aspirated (breathy). Both these qualities cause the English to sound different from the French or Spanish , which is a laminal (pronounced with the blade of the tongue) and unaspirated . and are thus two different IPA symbols for two different, though similar, sounds.
