Albert_Visetti_001.jpg ALBERT ANTHONY VISETTI (13 May 1846–10 July 1928) was a Dalmatian musician who moved to London where he was Professor of Singing at the Royal College of Music, becoming a Fellow in 1921. He was the stepfather of the novelist Radclyffe Hall.


Early life

Born in Solin in Dalmatia to a landowner Italian father and an English mother, Visetti was originally intended by his father for a career as a surgeon so was sent to the University of Padua to study medicine, but affected by the sights of the dissecting room he withdrew and turned instead to music. He was awarded musical scholarships from the Austrian and Italian governments. He studied music at the Milan Conservatory where a friend was Arrigo Boito who wrote the libretto for Visetti's _Cantico des Cantici_, and where he was a pupil of Alberto Mazzucato in class composition, winning several awards. While here he made the acquaintance of Verdi.[1] Visetti was later engaged as a conductor at Nice before moving to Paris where he was an assistant to the composer Daniel Auber at the Court of Napoleon III. While in Paris he composed the opera _Le Trois Mousequetaires_ after he met Alexander Dumas, who wrote the libretto.[2] However, the almost complete manuscript was destroyed in a fire during the Siege of Paris.[3]

Visetti became one of the leading professors of singing in the country, teaching singing at the Guildhall School of Music where his students included Bruce Carey; the London Academy of Music, at Watford School and the Royal College of Music, where his students included Louise Kirkby Lunn, Clara Butt,[7] Denise Orme,[8] Gwynn Parry Jones, Phyllis Lett and Agnes Nicholls.

He was Director and Conductor of the Philharmonic Society of Bath from 1878 to 1890 and for whom he wrote two cantatas, _The Desert_ and _The Praise of Song_. In 1880 Umberto I the King of Italy conferred on him the Order of the Crown of Italy for his literary achievements.[9] He wrote and translated several books including a life of Giovanni Palestrina and wrote a biography of Verdi for the Bells Miniature Series of Musicians (1905).
