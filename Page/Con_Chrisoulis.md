CON CHRISOULIS is a multidisciplinary artist, most famous for his long-running independent comic _Tales of Unsurpassed Vanity_ (Greek: ) and his graphic novels, _Giant-Size Fascists_, _Tales of The Smiths_, _Dryland_ and _Rebel Rebel_. The themes in his work almost exclusively involve matters of social injustice and prejudice (from sexism to racism to classism) to the broader plagues of society like nationalism, war or state violence and political corruption.


Career

Chrisoulis was born in Victoria (Australia), to Greek Australian migrants.[1] Totally self-taught in comics,[2] in 2010 he earned an ISCED Level 4 degree in Film Editing, in 2014 earned a BA (Hons) in Graphic Design at the University of Brighton and in 2015 was awarded a Master of Research in Arts and Cultural Research, during which he experimented on the digital future of the comic book medium.[3]

In 1996 he self-published his first comic book series, _Clans_, in Melbourne, Australia, which lasted three issues.[4] The following year he collaborated with writer Nick Bugeja on the superhero comic book series _Bloodsport_ (Impulse Comics).[5] In the late 1990s he migrated to Athens, Greece, and began self-publishing his personal comic book anthology, _Tales of Unsurpassed Vanity_ (Greek: ), one of Greece's longest-running self-published independent comics.[6][7] _Tales of Unsurpassed Vanity_ lasted ten issues, ending in 2004.

In 2002 he formed the group that would eventually publish the Greek independent comics anthology _SubArt Comics_. The group self-published 6 issues collectively.[8] As the group imploded in 2005, Chrisoulis and three other members initiated the first 24-hour comic event in Greece; his story was included in the subsequent _24 Hours SubArt Comics_ collection (2005)[9]

From 2002 to 2006, Chrisoulis collaborated with __ magazine, a Greek comics anthology that was included as a free supplement every Wednesday within _Eleftherotypia_ newspaper. He serialized his science fiction series _Vacant Testament_ (Greek: Κενή Διαθήκη) within the pages of _9 (Ennea)_ magazine, making it the first long-running sci-fi comics series published in a Greek mainstream comic book.

During the 2000s, he initiated campaigns within his self-published comics in order to advise and help creators set up their own self-published comics, and participated in various self-published comic books, also distributing many in independent stores in Athens and local zine and comics festivals.[10] Some of the comics he participated in include _Sapilla_ #1-3 (2004-2005),[11] _Red.Dot Comix_ #10 (2004) and #12 (2005),[12] Giannis Milonogiannis' _Roppongi_ #2 (2006)[13] and many more.

In 2007 he released the first volume of his acclaimed political satire comic book series, _Giant-Size Fascists_. After the first volume was released, the series continued in monthly episodes in __ (_Γαλέρα_) magazine from 2007 to 2008. The two volumes of _Giant-Size Fascists_ earned him Greek comic book of the year awards by popular vote in 2008 and 2010.[14]

His graphic novel _Dryland_, which narrates the violent deaths of most of his ancestors in Interwar Greece, was a finalist at the Myriad Editions' First Fictions competition [15][16] and was released in 2016 by Markosia Enterprises.[17]

Singer-songwriter of two concept art bands, Autodivine[18] and the UK-based band Ghosts of Future Past,[19] he has released two illustrated concept albums with linear narratives and post-punk aesthetics.

From 2012 until 2014 he wrote and drew a daily online comic strip entitled _Tales of The Smiths_ about the early unknown days of Morrissey and seminal indie band The Smiths, a 450-page collected edition of which will be released by Omnibus Press in 2018.[20]

He has been researching, writing and drawing _Rebel Rebel_, the biweekly online graphic biography of David Bowie, since June 2016 for the webcomic site SoComic.gr,[21] whilst in 2017 he began researching and serializing his latest series _King: The graphic biography of Jack Kirby_,[22] about the life and times of the visual creator of Marvel Comics.

He is the creator and content editor of the Brighton-based arts and cultural website The Streets Today,[23] which showcases undiscovered artists and new events, as well as Museums News,[24] a website that focuses on museum and exhibition culture.
