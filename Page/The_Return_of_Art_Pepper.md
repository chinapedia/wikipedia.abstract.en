_THE RETURN OF ART PEPPER_ is an album by saxophonist Art Pepper featuring sessions from 1956 recorded for the Jazz: West label after his release from prison.[1][2] The album was rereleased on CD on Blue Note Records with bonus tracks as _THE RETURN OF ART PEPPER: THE COMPLETE ART PEPPER ALADDIN RECORDINGS VOLUME 1_ in 1988.


Reception

The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine observed: "Pepper's chops are a little rusty, but you can hear that he still has a passion for playing, and he does improve over the course of these tracks. For serious Pepper fans, it's worth a listen, but for less dedicated fans, there are better places to become acquainted with his work".[3]
