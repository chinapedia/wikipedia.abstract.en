GREATER PETERBOROUGH UNIVERSITY TECHNICAL COLLEGE (GPUTC) is a STEM and built environment specialist school for students aged 14–19 in Peterborough, England.

Located in Peterborough city centre, the £12 million school opened in September 2016. UTCs are secondary schools for young people that are sponsored by university providers and local employers. They were set up by the government to encourage young people to study technical subjects and to give them the opportunity to learn the skills that employers are looking for.

Students can join GPUTC in year 10 and study engineering and the built environment (made up of architecture, design, surveying and construction) along with their core GCSE subjects. Students are also given the opportunity to pick from employability GCSEs such as computer science, business studies or art and design. Alternatively students can join GPUTC in year 12 and have the choice to study a technical qualification in either engineering or the built environment, in addition to A-levels.

GPUTC's employer and education sponsors are represented on the governing body and work closely with the school and students. This is done through offering work experience, industry exposure and a guaranteed job interview upon completion of study in year 11 or year 13, dependent on results at the end of the study.


Sponsors

The UTC is sponsored by Anglian Water, Larkfleet Group, Perkins Engines, Marshall Aerospace, Anglia Ruskin University, Baker Perkins and Peterborough Regional College.
