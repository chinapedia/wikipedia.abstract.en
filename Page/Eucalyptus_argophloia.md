It has smooth white bark ageing to other colours, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, more or less spherical flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and small, hemispherical to cup-shaped fruit.Eucalyptus_argophloia_buds.jpgEucalyptus_argophloia_bark.jpg]]


Description

_Eucalyptus argophloia_ is tree that typically grows to a height of with bark that is white but dappled with grey and brown and shed in long ribbons. Leaves on young plant and on coppice regrowth are arranged in opposite pairs and linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long. The leaves are the same glossy green on both sides. The flowers buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to more or less spherical, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in May and June and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical to cup-shaped capsule, long and wide.[5][6][7][8]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus argophloia_ was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely and the description was published in his book _A key to the Eucalypts_ from a specimen collected near Burncluith north of Chinchilla.[9] The specific epithet (_argophloia_) is derived from the Ancient Greek words _argos_ meaning "white" or "bright"[10] and _phloios_ meaning "bark",[11] referring to the bark of this tree species.[12]


Distribution and habitat

Queensland white gum has a limited range and is known only from a small area north east of Chinchilla where it grows in brown to black clay or clay-loam soils. The number of populations and the total number of plants is unknown. It is often found in association with brigalow (_Acacia harpophylla_) or _Eucalyptus microcarpa_ on flat terrain in areas that were once open forest.[13]


Conservation

This eucalypt is classified as "vulnerable" under the Australian Government _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ and under the Queensland Government _Nature Conservation Act 1992_. The main threat to the species is habitat destruction caused by land clearing and grazing.[14][15]
