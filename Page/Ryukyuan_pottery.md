RYUKYUAN POTTERY (琉球焼, or Okinawan language: 焼物 ; _Yachimun_) include earthenware and stoneware items that are traditionally made on the Ryukyu Islands in east Asia.


History

Ryukyuan pottery first appeared during the Gusuku period (c. 1100s-1400s), when it was introduced from China.

Tsuboya became the centre of production in 1682 after the kilns of Chibana, Wakuta, and Takaraguchi were consolidated under the Ryukyu Kingdom government. The two sub-types of Tsuboya ware were the generally unglazed _Ara-yachi_ and the glazed _Jō-yachi_.[1][2]

Most of the kilns had to move out of Tsuboya after the end of the Pacific War due to the smoke they produced. Production moved to the villages of Yuntan () and Ujimi () and they continued the tradition of _Yachimun_.[3]

In addition to dishes, vessels, and roof tiles, Ryukyuan pottery is especially known for the production of funerary urns, and _shisa_, lion-like guardians placed on rooftops and at gates to protect homes and other spaces from evil spirits.[4]
