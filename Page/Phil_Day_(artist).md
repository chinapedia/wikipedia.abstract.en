PHIL DAY (born in August, 1973) is an Australian artist. He is formally recognised as a Notable Graduate[1] from the Graphic Investigation Workshop, Australian National University (ANU), alongside Alex Hamilton, Paul McDermott, Danie Mellor and Paul Uhlmann.

Day's body of work comprises prints, artist's books, drawings and watercolours. Various institutions have collected his work, including the National Library of Australia, State Library of New South Wales, State Library of Queensland, State Library of Victoria, and the Baillieu Library (Melbourne University).


Life

Day, a lineal descendant of Wong Ah Sat, was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, living in the same house for his entire childhood and adolescent years. At age 16, he briefly trained as a graphic designer at the NSW Police Academy. Rather than pursue graphic design as a career, Day enrolled at the local technical college to study art. In 1992, he moved to Canberra to study at the Canberra School of Art, ANU (graduating with a Bachelor of Art with First Class Honours). While still a student, he worked as an illustrator and caricaturist at The Canberra Times.[2] He abandoned this path in 1996, choosing instead to work as a printer, binder, and designer of books for the Edition + Artist's Book Studio, ANU. In 1997, Day co-founded Finlay Press, and in the same year he lost the vision in his left eye due to a congenital deformity. In early 2010, he moved to Melbourne, founded Mountains Brown Press, and met his future wife. Together they moved to Toronto, Canada (2010), then to Brooklyn, NY (2011). Day lives in Melbourne, with his wife and their daughter.


Drawings

Day first came to public attention in 2000 when he was invited to exhibit in the Australian Drawing Biennale.[3] There his drawings were shown alongside those of Davida Allen, Rick Amor, Guo Jian, Euan Macleod, John Olsen, Gloria Petyarre, and Harry Wedge, among others. The exhibition catalogue states:

_"[Day] looks at things for himself … This is a rare quality, particularly when so many practitioners in the visual arts claim to be bored with image-making and, as a substitute, flirt with ideas."_[4]

Primarily, Day's work is pictorial: at times detailed and realistic, while at other times brief and gestural - Peter Keneally describes Day's brief-gestural drawings as: _deliriously smudgy and slapdash_.[5]

There is an understated mood in Day's work, both in subject and material. His pictures invite the viewer into a one-on-one relationship with common things, this includes domestic objects, urban animals, garden plants, and the occasional portrait. It also includes memories, thoughts, and imaginary figurative inventions. All of which, are almost exclusively worked on modest size sheets of paper with modest materials (often coloured pencil and watercolour). In 2003, Sasha Grishin, art historian and critic, said:

_"There is a certain disarming honesty in [Day's] drawing, which are as much visual observations as they are thought-pictures ... between the seen and observed reality, and the realm of abstract thoughts and carnal desires."_[6]

From 2004 onward, Day has almost exclusively created images for artist's books, often in collaboration with Australian authors, including: Cassandra Atherton, Gary Catalano, Julian Davies, James Grieve, and Robin Wallace-Crabbe. In 2015, Day discussed aspects of illustration as a guest panellist on _Collaboration_ at the Adelaide Writers' Week.[7]


Artist's books

A brief biographical note states: Phil Day has enjoyed illustrating other people's writing, then binding the results into books, since he was sixteen.[8] An early example of an artist's book illustrated by Day is _Imaginary Thoughts and Their Beings_ (1995).[9] Day became more prolific when he co-founded Finlay Press in 1997. By the close of Finlay Press in 2009, Day had illustrated 16 of Finlay Press's 23 titles. They are: _Burly Gryphon_ (1997), _Hungry Magpies_ (1997), _Bomber_ (1997), _Fth_ (1998), _The Last Lost Doughnut_ (1998), _Formingle_ (1998), _Household: Eleven Poems_ (1998), _A Pile of Hair_ (2003), _Top Ten Twentieth Century Monsters_ (2003), _Through Hoops_ (2005), _Familiar Objects_ (2005), _Goodbye Eggcup_ (2006), _Cat's Eye_ (2008), _I’ll Build A Stairway To Paradise_ (2008), _Day By Day_ (2009), _Four Men and Their Ideas on the Erotic_. Caren Florance remarked:

_" ... some of the most exciting untraditional private press work in Australia."_[10]

In 2010, Day moved to Melbourne, and founded his private press - Mountains Brown Press. No longer having access to printing presses, Day altered his approach in order to continue his interest in making books. The most notable change being each book written in pencil by his hand. State Library of Victoria, History of the Book manager, Des Cowley observed:

_"… [Day's Mountain Brown Press artist's books] represent an art stripped back to basics, a cathartic attempt to re-engage with the physical properties of the book, without the intervening layer of metal type and presses … there is a sense of spiritual renewal to be found here."_[11][12]

Writings

Day's earliest writings appear in two Finlay Press titles: _Familiar Objects_ (2005),[13] and _Goodbye Eggcup_ (2006).[14] From 2010 to 2013 all Mountains Brown Press titles contain his writing. In 2012, Day wrote an essay for publication and review: _Why Qi Baishi is better for me than Damien Hirst_.[15] Scott McCulloch, _Australian Book Review_, commented:

_"Spontaneous in his approach, Day utilizes various bits of visual information: tables, lists, Shakespeare quotes, typography that verges on concrete poetry … it sounds messy, but the connection and slippages of these digression make for an intoxicating and dissonant piece of prose."_[16]

Day has continued to write using 'connections', 'slippages', and 'digressions', evident in his _A Chink in a Daisy-Chain_ (2017), the first in a three-book series. _A Chink in a Daisy-Chain_ concentrates on the embattled nature of individual intellectual and creative autonomy. Fiona Capp (Sydney Morning Herald) comments:

_"In the spirit of the absurdist and playful logic that characterises the Alice books, A Chink in a Daisy-Chain takes us into the rabbit warren of Day's mind as he free associates, one thought leading to another in a stream of consciousness ..."_[17]

Similar to his artist's books, included in _Chink in a Daisy-Chain_ is a drawing by Day illustrating _The Wasp in a Wig_ - the suppressed chapter from Carroll’s _Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There_. Day’s illustration recreates the style of John Tenniel’s original illustrations.

Illustrated books

I995, while still a student, Day held his first solo exhibition displaying his illustrations for François Rabelais's _Gargantua and Pantagruel_. Inspiration from these early illustrations have carried into Day's recent work. Dorothy Johnston, Sydney Morning Herald, observed:

_His line drawings enhance the mood of each scene, lightening it, sending up characters locked in earnest or self-serving conversation, or hopelessly in love; at other times giving a darker, sinister flavour to events ... revellers disguised as politicians, celebrities and cartoon animals tumble over one another right out of the frame_.

Day has created illustrations (cover or page) for the following titles.
