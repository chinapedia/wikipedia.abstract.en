MERCEDES LÓPEZ-MORALES is a Spanish-American astrophysicist at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who works on detection and characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.[1][2]


Education and career

López-Morales studied physics during her undergraduate program at Universidad de La Laguna, in the Canary Islands, Spain.[3] She received her PhD in astronomy from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2004.[4] After completing her doctoral degree, she was a Carnegie postdoctoral fellow from 2004 until 2011 at the Carnegie Science Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) in Washington, DC.[5] During her tenure at the Carnegie Science DTM, López-Morales was also a postdoc at the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI).[6] In 2007, López-Morales was awarded a Hubble Fellowship.[7] While at the NAI, she worked on two different projects, _From Molecular Clouds to Habitable Planetary Systems_ and _Looking Outward: Studies of the Physical and Chemical Evolution of Planetary Systems_.[8]


Work

Between 2011 and 2012, López-Morales returned to Spain as a researcher at the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, Spain.[9], and was awarded a prestigious Ramón y Cajal Fellowship. She joined the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 2012.[10] In 2014-2015, she was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, where she worked on _Searching for Atmospheric Signatures of Other Worlds_.[11]

At the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, López-Morales is the Co-PI (with Daniel Apai) of the Exoplanet Spectroscopy Survey (ACCESS) project where she investigates optical properties of exoplanet atmospheres using spectroscopy techniques.[12] López-Morales's work also focuses on the discovery and characterization of terrestrial exoplanets using HARPS-N, a high-resolution optical spectrograph with broad wavelength coverage located in the Northern hemisphere.[13][14]
