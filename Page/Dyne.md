The DYNE (symbol DYN, from Greek δύναμις, _dynamis_, meaning power, force) is a derived unit of force specified in the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units, a predecessor of the modern SI.


History

The name DYNE was first proposed as a C.G.S. unit of force in 1873 by a Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.[1]


Definition

The dyne is defined as "the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second per second".[2] An equivalent definition of the dyne is "that force which, acting for one second, will produce a change of velocity of one centimetre per second in a mass of one gram"[3]

One dyne is equal to 10 micronewtons, 10^(−5) N or to 10 nsn (nanosthenes) in the old metre–tonne–second system of units.

    1 dyn = 1 g⋅cm/s² = 10^(−5) kg⋅m/s² = 10^(−5) N

    1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s² = 10⁵ g⋅cm/s² = 10⁵ dyn


Use

The DYNE PER CENTIMETRE is a unit traditionally used to measure surface tension. For example, the surface tension of distilled water is 71.99 dyn/cm at 25 °C (77 °F).[4] (In SI units this is or .)
