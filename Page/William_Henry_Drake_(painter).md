WILLIAM HENRY DRAKE (June 4, 1856 – 1926) born in New York, was an American painter and illustrator known for his illustrations of _The Jungle Book_ by Rudyard Kipling.[1]


Biography

Drake studied at the Académie Julian in Paris, with Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and Henri Lucien Doucet.[2]

Back from Europe, he studied at the Cincinnati School of Design, and would often go to the zoo, where he could draw the animals. He was then employed by the Museum of Natural History. He continued to study at the Art Students League of New York. In 1878 he worked as a freelance pen-and-ink artist for such periodicals as _Century_ or _Harper’s_ with animal studies, still lifes and landscapes.

Having developed skills in drawing wild animals, particularly wild cats, in 1894, he received commissions to illustrate books, including _The Jungle Books_, by Kipling. In 1902 he was made an associate member of the National Academy of Design. Drake moved to California in 1920.[3]
