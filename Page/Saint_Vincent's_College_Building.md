ST. VINCENT'S COLLEGE BUILDING, also known as the ST. VINCENT'S SEMINARY, is a historic educational building located at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. It built between 1843 and 1871, and is a three-story, 52,000-square-foot, L-shaped brick building on a limestone foundation. The building and its additions reflect the influences of Colonial American Georgian architecture and the popular mid-19th century Italian Villa style. The building served as the College's main residential, classroom, and chapel building. The college closed in 1910, after which it housed a private high school.[1]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.[2]
