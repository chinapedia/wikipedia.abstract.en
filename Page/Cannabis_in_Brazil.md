CANNABIS IN BRAZIL is illegal and criminalized, but possession and cultivation of personal amounts and for private use were de-penanalized in 2006.[1] Limited cannabis-based medicines are permitted as of 2017.


History

Cannabis was introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese colonists in the early 1800s. Their intent may have been to cultivate hemp fiber, but the slaves the Portuguese trafficked from Africa were familiar with cannabis and used it psychoactively, leading the Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro in 1830 to prohibit bringing cannabis into the city, and punishing its use by any slave.[2]


Medical cannabis

In January 2017 Brazil issued its first license for a cannabis-based medicine, allowing sales of Mevatyl oral spray (internationally known as Sativex).[3]


Enforcement

Since 2006, public use of cannabis entails a warning, community service and education on the effects of drug use. The same measures apply to public use any illegal drug.[4]

Selling, transportation and trafficking of drugs are considered criminal acts and are punished with 5 to 15 years in prison and a significant fine.[5]
