is a graphic adventure survival horror video game developed by Nude Maker and published by Playism Games. _NightCry_ is directed and written by _Clock Tower_ series creator Hifumi Kono, and is considered a spiritual successor to the series. It was first released for Microsoft Windows in March 2016, and later for the PlayStation Vita in January 2019. Ports for Android and iOS were also planned, but were never released.


Development

The game was directed by Hifumi Kono as a spiritual successor to the _Clock Tower_ series. Kono notes that the female protagonist of _NightCry_ is louder and more confident than the female protagonist from _Clock Tower_. He cites the differences as a result of his changing perception of women, who he no longer idealises as docile and ladylike.[1] Kono collaborated with film director Takashi Shimizu on the project, who directed a 12 minute short film to promote the game.[2]

Originally intended to be released for Android and iOS, the game took to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise funds for a PC version in January 2015. The campaign was successful, raising 314,771 in February 2015. The Windows version was released on 29 March 2016, while a PlayStation Vita port was released in North America on 31 January 2019.[3][4]


Reception

Western critical reception to _NightCry_ was mixed. Caitlin Cooke of _Destructoid_ gave the game a 2 out of 10, saying that she could not "recommend anyone play _NightCry_ unless you have a steel resolve, unlimited time on your hands, and a penchant for terrible physics and animations straight out of the PS2 era".[5] In contrast, L. Harvard of _Digitally Downloaded_ gave the game a 4.5 out of 5, saying "an authentic _Clock Tower_-style, classic stalker horror experience for the modern day. The ambition and the unique vision of _NightCry_ genuinely make me excited that there is a future in traditional gameplay".[6]
