JOSEPH CHESHIRE COTTEN JR. (May 15, 1905 – February 6, 1994) was an American film, stage, radio and television actor. Cotten achieved prominence on Broadway, starring in the original stage productions of _The Philadelphia Story_ and _Sabrina Fair_.

He first gained worldwide fame in three Orson Welles films: _Citizen Kane_ (1941), _The Magnificent Ambersons_ (1942), and _Journey into Fear_ (1943), for which Cotten was also credited with the screenplay. He went on to become one of the leading Hollywood actors of the 1940s, appearing in films such as _Shadow of a Doubt_ (1943), _Love Letters_ (1945), _Duel in the Sun_ (1946), _Portrait of Jennie_ (1948), _The Third Man_ (1949) and _Niagara_ (1953). One of his final films was Michael Cimino's _Heaven's Gate_ (1980).


Early life

Jo-Cotten-American-FC-1931.jpg'' (September 1931)]] Joseph Cotten was born in 1905 in Petersburg, Virginia, the first of three sons born to Joseph Cheshire Cotten, Sr., an assistant postmaster, and Sally Willson Cotten.[1] He grew up in the Tidewater region and showed an aptitude for drama and a gift for storytelling.

In 1923, when Cotten was 18, his family arranged for him to receive private lessons at the Hickman School of Expression in Washington, D.C., and underwrote his expenses.[2]


Career

Cotten earned spending money playing professional football on Sundays, for $25 a quarter. After graduation, he earned enough money as a lifeguard at Wilcox Lake to pay back his family's loan, with interest.[3]

He moved to Miami in 1925 and worked as an advertising salesman for _The Miami Herald_ at $35 a week. He started performing at the Miami Civic Theatre, and worked there for five years, also reviewing the shows for the _Herald_.[4]

Broadway

Cotten moved to New York and went to work for David Belasco as an assistant stage manager. He understudied Melvyn Douglas in _Tonight or Never_ then took over Douglas' role for the Copley Theatre in Boston, where he worked on over 30 plays.[5]

Cotten struggled to find work in the depression so turned to modeling and acting in industrial films. He also performed on radio. Cotten made his Broadway debut in 1932 in _Absent Friends_ which ran for 88 performances.[6]

He followed it with _Jezebel_ (1933), staged by Katherine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, which only had a short run.[7]

He was in _Loose Moments_ which ran for 8 performances.[8]

Orson Welles

In 1934, Cotten met and became friends with Orson Welles, a fellow cast member on CBS Radio's _The American School of the Air_.[9] Welles regarded Cotten as a brilliant comic actor,[10] and gave him the starring role in his Federal Theatre Project farce, '' Horse Eats Hat''[11][12] (September 26 – December 5, 1936).[13] Cotten was sure that _Horse Eats Hat_ won him the notice of his future Broadway co-star, Katharine Hepburn.[14]

Cotten said Welles later told him "You're very lucky to be tall and thin and have curly hair. You can also move about the stage without running into the furniture. But these are fringe assets, and I'm afraid you'll never make it as an actor. But as a star, I think you well might hit the jackpot." [15]

In 1937, Cotten became an inaugural member of Welles's Mercury Theatre company, starring in its Broadway productions _Caesar_ as Publius; it ran for 157 performances.

He followed it with _The Shoemaker's Holiday_ (1938) and _Danton's Death_ (1938) for Welles. Cotten also performed in radio dramas presented on _The Mercury Theatre on the Air_ and _The Campbell Playhouse_.

Cotten made his film debut in the Welles-directed short, _Too Much Johnson_, a comedy that was intended to complement the aborted 1938 Mercury stage production of William Gillette's 1890 play. The film was never screened in public and was lost until 2013.[16]

_The Philadelphia Story_

Cotten returned to Broadway in 1939, creating the role of C. K. Dexter Haven opposite Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord in the original production of Philip Barry's _The Philadelphia Story_. The play ran for 417 performances at the Shubert Theatre, and in the months before its extensive national tour a film version was to be made by MGM. Cotten went to Hollywood, but discovered there that his stage success in _The Philadelphia Story_ translated to, in the words of his agent Leland Hayward, "spending a solid year creating the Cary Grant role." Hayward suggested that they call Cotten's good pal, Orson Welles. "He's been making big waves out here," Hayward said. "Maybe nobody in Hollywood ever heard of the Shubert Theatre in New York, but everybody certainly knows about the Mercury Theatre in New York."[17]

_Citizen Kane_

After the success of Welles's _War of the Worlds_ 1938 Halloween radio broadcast, Welles gained a unique contract with RKO Pictures. The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director below an agreed budget limit, and Welles's intention was to feature the Mercury Players in his productions. Shooting had still not begun on a Welles film after a year, but after a meeting with writer Herman J. Mankiewicz Welles had a suitable project.

In mid-1940, filming began on _Citizen Kane_, portraying the life of a press magnate (played by Welles) who starts out as an idealist but eventually turns into a corrupt, lonely old man. The film featured Cotten prominently in the role of Kane's best friend Jedediah Leland, eventually a drama critic for one of Kane's papers.

When released on May 1, 1941, _Citizen Kane_ — based in part on the life of William Randolph Hearst — did not do much business at theaters; Hearst owned numerous major newspapers, and forbade them to carry advertisements for the film. Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1942, the film won only for Best Screenplay, for Mankiewicz and Welles. _Citizen Kane_ launched the film careers of the Mercury Players, including Agnes Moorehead (who played Kane's mother), Ruth Warrick (Kane's first wife), and Ray Collins (Kane's political opponent). However, Cotten was the only one of the four to find major success as a lead in Hollywood outside of _Citizen Kane_; Moorehead and Collins became successful character film actors and Warrick spent decades in a career in daytime television.

Alexander Korda then hired Cotten to play Merle Oberon's leading man in _Lydia_ (1941). "I didn't care about the movies, really," Cotten said later. "I was tall. I had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do."[18]

_The Magnificent Ambersons_ and _Journey Into Fear_

Cotten starred in Welles's adaptation and production of _The Magnificent Ambersons_ (1942). After the commercial disappointment of _Citizen Kane_, RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by nearly an hour before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the Academy.

Cotten was cast in the Nazi-related thriller _Journey into Fear_ (1943) based on the novel by Eric Ambler. It was originally scripted by Ben Hecht but Welles, who was supervising, disliked it, and he rewrote it with Cotten.[19] Released by RKO, the Mercury production was directed by Norman Foster. It was a collaborative effort due to the difficulties shooting the film and the pressures related to Welles's imminent departure to South America to begin work on _It's All True_.[20][21]

Alfred Hitchcock hired Cotten to play a charming serial killer in _Shadow of a Doubt_ (1943). It was made for Universal Pictures, who for whom Cotten then appeared in _Hers to Hold_ (1943), as Deanna Durbin's leading man.

After Welles's return he and Cotten co-produced _The Mercury Wonder Show_ for members of the U.S. armed services. Opening August 3, 1943, the all-star magic and variety show was presented in a tent at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. Featured were Welles (Orson the Magnificent), Cotten (Jo-Jo the Great), Rita Hayworth (forced to quit by Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn and replaced by Marlene Dietrich), Agnes Moorehead (Calliope Aggie) and others. Tickets were free to servicemen, and more than 48,000 of them had seen show by September 1943.[22]

David O. Selznick

In late 1943, Cotten visited Welles's office and said that producer David O. Selznick wanted to make two or three films with him, but that he wanted him under his own contract. Welles then tore up Cotten's contract with Mercury Productions, saying, "He can do more for you than I can. Good luck!"[23] Cotten signed a long term deal with Selznick.

Selnick loaned out Cotten and Ingrid Bergman to MGM for the thriller _Gaslight_ (1944) which was a major hit. Selznick then put Cotten in a wartime drama _Since You Went Away_ (1944) alongside Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple; it was another major success.[24]

Selznick followed this up by teaming Cotten with Ginger Rogers and Temple in _I'll Be Seeing You_ (1945), another melodrama. Hal Wallis borrowed Cotten and Jones to make _Love Letters_ (1945). Exhibitors voted him the 17th most popular star in the United States in 1945.[25]

Selznick used Cotten, Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck in _Duel in the Sun_ (1946), an epic Western that was hugely popular at the box office.

Dore Schary, who had worked for Selznick, went to run RKO and hired Cotten for _The Farmer's Daughter_ (1947), where he was Loretta Young's leading man. Cotten then made _Portrait of Jennie_ (1948) for Selznick, co starring with Jones; Cotten played a melancholy artist who becomes obsessed with a girl who might have died many years before. His performance won Cotten the International Prize for Best Actor at the 1949 Venice International Film Festival. [26]

_The Third Man_

Cotten was reunited with Welles in _The Third Man_ (1949), produced by Korda and Selznick. Cotten portrays a writer of pulp fiction who travels to postwar Vienna to meet his friend Harry Lime (Welles). When he arrives, he is told that Lime has died. Determined to prove to the police that his friend was murdered, he uncovers an even darker secret.

(Welles and Cotten remained close friends until Welles's death in 1985. According to Welles, Cotten was always uncomfortable as a leading man and preferred to play supporting or character roles.[27])

Cotten then reunited with Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman in _Under Capricorn_ (1949) as an Australian landowner with a shady past; it was a box office disappointment. So too was _Beyond the Forest_ (1949) with Bette Davis at Warner Bros.[28][29]

Cotten co-starred with Joan Fontaine in _September Affair_ (1950) for Hal Wallis. Selznick loaned him to 20th Century Fox for the dark Civil War Western _Two Flags West_ (1950), then to RKO for _Walk Softly, Stranger_ (1950, shot in 1948) which reunited him with Alida Valli from _The Third Man_. It was a huge flop.[30]

At Fox he did _Half Angel_ (1951) with Young, then did another with Wallis at Paramount, _Peking Express_ (1951) and went to MGM for _The Man with a Cloak_ (1951) with Barbara Stanwyck. He had a cameo in Welles' _Othello_ (1951).[31]

Cotten did a Western at Universal, _Untamed Frontier_ (1953), during the filming of which he was injured.[32] He did a thriller for Andrew L. Stone, _The Steel Trap_ (1952), which reunited with Teresa Wright from _Shadow of a Doubt_.[33]

At Fox he was in the Marilyn Monroe vehicle _Niagara_ (1953), after James Mason turned down the role. He narrated _Egypt by Three_ (1953) and was reunited with Stone in _A Blueprint for Murder_ (1953).

_Sabrina Fair_ and television

On the stage in 1953, Cotten created the role of Linus Larrabee, Jr., in the original Broadway production of _Sabrina Fair_, opposite Margaret Sullavan. The production ran November 11, 1953 – August 21, 1954, and was the basis of the Billy Wilder film _Sabrina_, which starred Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn.[34] He and Sullivan did a TV production of _State of the Union_ for _Producers' Showcase_ directed by Arthur Penn.

Cotten made _Special Delivery_ (1955) in West Germany, did a TV adaptation of _Broadway_ for _The Best of Broadway_ (1955) directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. He appeared in episodes of _Celebrity Playhouse_, _The Ford Television Theatre_, _Star Stage_, _Alfred Hitchcock Presents_ (several times) and _General Electric Theater_.[35]

In 1955 Cotten hosted _The 20th Century Fox Hour_ on television.[36]

In 1956, Cotten starred in the NBC anthology series _On Trial_[37] (renamed at mid-season _The Joseph Cotten Show_). It ran for 41 episodes.[38]

He returned to features with _The Bottom of the Bottle_ (1956), _The Killer Is Loose_ (1957) and _The Halliday Brand_ (1957).

He guest starred on _Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre_, _Telephone Time_, _Playhouse 90_, _Schlitz Playhouse_, _Zane Grey Theater_, _Suspicion_, and _Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse_. He made a cameo appearance in Welles's_Touch of Evil_ (1958) and a starring role in the film adaptation of Jules Verne's _From the Earth to the Moon_ (also 1958).

Cotten had another success on Broadway when he appeared in _Once More, With Feeling_ (1958-60) which ran for 263 performances.[39] For the third time Cotten was in a Broadway hit but did not reprise his role in the film version - Yul Brynner did.

1960s

Joseph_Cotten_&_Patricia_Medina.jpg In 1960, Cotten married British actress Patricia Medina after his first wife, Lenore Kipp, died of leukemia earlier in the year.[40] [41]

Cotten had a supporting role in the films _The Angel Wore Red_ (1960) and _The Last Sunset_ (1961), the latter directed by Robert Aldrich, and guest starred on _The DuPont Show with June Allyson_, _Checkmate_, _The Barbara Stanwyck Show_, _Bus Stop_, _Theatre '62_ (an adaptation of _Notorious_), _Dr. Kildare_, _Wagon Train_, and _Saints and Sinners_.

Cotten returned to Broadway to appear in _Calculated Risk_ (1962-63), which ran for 221 performances and meant he had to turn down a role in a film _Harrigan's Halo_[42].[43] He guest starred on _The Great Adventure_, and _77 Sunset Strip_, and did the pilot _Alexander the Great_ (1963).[44]

After some time away from film, Cotten returned in the horror classic _Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte_ (1964) for Aldrich, with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Agnes Moorehead.

Final leading man roles

Cotten was top billed in _The Great Sioux Massacre_ (1965) and _The Tramplers_ (1965), but back to support parts for _The Money Trap_ (1965) and _The Oscar_ (1966). He was top billed in _Brighty of the Grand Canyon_ (1966), directed by Foster, _The Cruel Ones_ (1967), _Some May Live_ (1967) and _Gangsters '70_ (1968).[45]

He guest starred on _Cimarron Strip_, _Ironside_, and _Journey to the Unknown_ and had a support role in _Jack of Diamonds_ (1967). He had the lead in _White Comanche_ (1968) and _Latitude Zero_ (1969) (shot in Japan with his wife) and supported in the TV movies _The Lonely Profession_ (1969), _Cutter's Trail_ (1970).[46]

Final roles

Cotten's final performances included _The Hearse_ (1980), _Casino_ (1980), _Heaven's Gate_ (1980), _The Love Boat_ (1981), _The Survivor_ (1981), shot in Australia, and _Delusion_ (1981). Cotten suffered a stroke in 1981 which caused him to temporarily lose his voice.[52]


Illness and death

On June 8, 1981, Cotten experienced a heart attack followed by a stroke that affected his brain's speech center. He began years of therapy which in time made it possible for him to speak again. As he began to recover, he and Orson Welles talked on the phone each week for a couple of hours. "He was strong and supportive," Cotten wrote, "and whenever I used the wrong word (which was frequently) he would say, 'That's a much better word, Jo, I'm going to use it.'" He and Welles would meet for lunch and reminisce, and when Cotten said he had written a book Welles asked for the manuscript and read it that same night.[53]

In a phone conversation on October 9, 1985, Welles told his friend and mentor Roger Hill that Cotten had written a book, and Hill asked how it read. "Gentle, witty, and self-effacing, just like Jo," Welles replied. "My only complaint is that it's too brief."[54] Welles died the following day. "Somewhere among his possessions is a manuscript of this book," Cotten wrote on the last page of his autobiography, published in 1987 under the title _Vanity Will Get You Somewhere_.[55][56][57]

In 1990, Cotten's larynx was removed due to cancer.[58] He died on February 6, 1994, of pneumonia, at the age of 88.[59] He was buried at Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia.[60]


Accolades

At the 10th Venice International Film Festival, Cotten was given the Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his performance in the film _Portrait of Jennie_ (1948). He was also given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.


Cultural references

Cotten was portrayed by Tim Robbins in the 1985 TV film _Malice in Wonderland_, James Tupper in the film _Me and Orson Welles_ (2008)[61] and by Matthew Glave in the television series _Feud_ (2017), which depicts the filming of _Whatever Happened to Baby Jane_.
