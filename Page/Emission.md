-   Emission (radiocommunications), a radio signal (usually modulated) emitted from a radio transmitter
-   Emission coefficient, a coefficient in the power output per unit time of an electromagnetic source
-   Emission line, or "spectral line", a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum
