Career

Youth

Elvir Omerbegovic was born in Mettmann, Germany in 1979 as the son of Bosnian parents.[1][2] At the age of twelve, Omerbegovic began to play streetball and won the German championship with his team several times. From 1993 onwards, he performed his sport semi-professionally, playing for Bayer Giants Leverkusen and Brandt Hagen. At the age of 16, he competed against AAU teams in New York as a member of a selected squad. Prior to finishing High School in Germany, he also played basketball at a High School in Kentucky, USA for one season.[3] Upon graduation, Omerbegovic worked for RTL Newmedia in Cologne, Germany. He then earned a bachelor's degree in Political Science, Media and Sociology. Subsequently, he received a master's degree in Political communication.[4][5]

In 1999, he met Philipp Dammann during a community service training in Herdecke, Germany. Dammann, alias Flipstar, was a member of the Hip Hop group Creutzfeld & Jakob. Omerbegovic then began to appear as a rapper under the artist name Slick One. Flipstar also provided Omerbegovic with initial contacts in the German Hip Hop scene.[6] In 2003, Omerbegovic was featured in the song _Game Over_ for the first time on the Creutzfeld & Jakob album _Zwei Mann gegen den Rest_.[7][8] In 2005, Omerbegovic recorded some songs in collaboration with Flipstar. _Wo ich herkomm_ was used as one of the tracks for the Sampler _Schwarzes Gold_.[9][10] Within the next two years, he recorded contributions to five releases by _Selfmade Records_.[11][12][13][14][15][16] On the track _Bruderkrieg_, a collaboration with Edo Maajka on the album _Chronik 2_ in 2009, Omerbegovic appeared as a rapper for the last time.[17]

Business activities

Sefmade records

Initially, the label was only supposed to serve as a platform for Dammann's releases as Flipstar, as well as for other Hip Hop acts in the region.[18] Following a short-term cooperation with Jan Mehlhose from the Sublabel _Subword_, Omerbegovic arranged a distribution agreement with _Groove Attack_. At this point, producer Rizbo and Rapper Favorite from the city of Essen had already been contracted as the label's first artists. In April 2005, the sampler _Schwarzes Gold_ was released as the first _Selfmade Records_ production.[19] Over the course of the year, Shiml and Kollegah also received contracts as artists.[20][21] With respect to his selection of Rappers, Omerbegovic explained that it was his "_intention to sign and develop artists who […] have outstanding technical skills and brought something entirely new to the German Hip Hop scene._"[22]

At the end of 2005, Dammann left the music label and Omerbegovic took over single-handedly.[23] Due to its infrastructural advantages, he relocated the _Selfmade Records_ headquarters to Düsseldorf in 2007. In addition to his work as label manager, Omerbegovic also took over the positions of product and tour manager. In addition, he helped with the production of the releases, "_subtly influencing the albums_" by suggesting the modification of sounds, lyrics or selected verses.[24] In 2007, _Alphagene_ by Kollegah was the label's first album to enter the German charts.[25] In the following two years, the label achieved similar successes with Favorite and Shiml. In 2009, another Rapper by the name of Casper was signed.[26] _Selfmade Records_ presented Casper as part of the sampler _Chronik 2_. In the following months, the contractual collaboration with Shiml and Casper was terminated.[27][28] At the end of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012, the Hip Hop groups Genetikk and 257ers were presented as new additions to the label, respectively.[29][30]

The release of the album _Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 2_ by Kollegah and Farid Bang in 2013 marked the first time a _Selfmade Records_ album entered the charts at the number one spot.[31] After the album went Gold, _Universal Music_ contacted Omerbegovic to discuss a potential collaboration.[32][33] Omerbegovic initially refused the offer and instead extended the distribution agreement with _Groove Attack_.[34] After another successful release, namely Genetikk's album _D.N.A._, various labels approached _Selfmade Records_.[35] In early 2014, a joint venture with _Universal Music_ was finally announced. According to Omerbegovic, the advantage of this cooperation lies in the ability to "_operate with the speed of an indie label and the power of a major label._"[36] His major label counterpart was Frank Briegmann, President Central Europe of Universal Music Group International, as well as the Deutsche Grammophon. By means of the contract with _Universal Music_, Omerbegovic received the position of _President of Rap Selfmade Records and Universal Music Germany_.[37]

The label's next releases, i.e. _King_, _Boomshakkalakka_, _Neues von Gott_, _Achter Tag_ and _Zuhältertape Volume 4_ all ranked number one in the German charts as well.[38][39][40][41][42] In the summer of 2014, Rapper Karate Andi was signed as an artist.[43] At the end of 2015, _Selfmade Records_ presented Karate Andi to a larger audience through his appearances on the sampler _Chronik 3_. Like the previous albums, the sampler also rose to the top of the charts.[44] Omerbegovic used the release of _Chronik 3_ for a review of the ten-year history of his record label. He appeared as the editor of the book _Selfmade Records – Die ersten 10 Jahre des erfolgreichsten HipHop-Labels_.[45]

Pusher Apparel

At the end of May 2009, Omerbegovic founded the fashion label _Pusher Apparel_.[46] That same year, the new fashion label's products were integrated in the marketing efforts of the album _Jung, brutal, gutaussehend_, with Rappers Kollegah and Farid Bang presenting the label's products in their music videos, press photos and on pictures in the album's booklet. _Pusher Apparel_ is part of the network of the _Bravado Merchandise GmbH_, a sub-company of _Universal Music Group_, and it is run by Frank Briegmann.[47] The label's product line primarily targets sporty male clients between thirteen and 28 years of age. Sales are exclusively made via the company's online shop.[48] In June 2016, Rappers Gzuz and Bonez MC of the 187 Strassenbande signed a cooperation agreement with _Pusher Apparel_. At the same time, Gzuz and Bonez MC released their first streetwear collection through the label.[49]

Suckit

In early 2014, Omerbegovic and Maximilian Scharpenack founded the _Suckit GmbH_, together with Marco Knauf and Inga Koster, founders of the company true fruits. _Suckit_ specializes in the production of alcoholic water ice (freeze-pops). Shortly after sales started through the company's website in April 2014, _Suckit_ was able to sell 30,000 units of its products. By now, the product is present on the shelves of numerous supermarkets.[50] According to _Suckit_, 750,000 units of ice were sold in the first two-year, of which 500,00 in 2015.[51][52] In 2016, 1.4 million units were sold.[53][54] In October 2016, the company was featured in the show _Die Höhle der Löwen_. However, the investors involved refrained from acquiring business shares.[55][56] So far, MoTrip, Marteria, Farid Bang, KC Rebel, Schwesta Ewa, 257ers, Favorite, Joko Winterscheidt, Klaas Heufer-Umlauf and Micaela Schäfer had appearances with the product.[57]
