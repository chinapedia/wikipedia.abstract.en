History

In the early 1860s, Ernest Renan noted here a decorated Sarcophagus.[2]

In 1875 Victor Guérin found the village to be inhabited by 400 Metualis.[3] He further noted: "Here I saw an ancient rock-cut basin, many cut-stones built up in private houses or forming the enclosure of gardens and cisterns, and, on the surface of a block lying on the ground, figures carved, to the number of five, each in a different frame. Unfortunately they are much mutilated by time and rough usage. The best preserved has the head surmounted by the high Egyptian coiffure known under the name of pschent, and holds in one hand a sort of curved stick."[4]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A village, built of stone, situated on the top of a hill, surrounded by gardens, fig-trees, olives, and arable land, containing about 250 Metawileh; water supply from springs, birket, and cisterns."[5]
