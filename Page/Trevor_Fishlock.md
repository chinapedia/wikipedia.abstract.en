Foreign correspondent

Fishlock worked as a foreign correspondent for The Times in numerous countries for 17 years, reporting from more than 60 countries including Wales (1969–77), India (1980–83) and the USA (1983–86), later becoming Moscow correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, and writing a travel column. At The Press Awards he won Foreign Reporter of the Year in 1982 and International Reporter of the Year in 1986.[3]


Author

Fishlock writes books about the people and places he has encountered while working abroad and at home, covering politics, history, biography and society. He was inspired to write _Senedd_ (2011) after seeing early sketches of the planned Welsh Assembly building and watching them evolve into the completed Senedd.[4] His book _India File_ (1987) was in The Daily Telegraph's Michael Kerr's list of his top ten travel books in 2011 and about which he said that while it was first published “… in 1983, and could hardly be said to be up to the minute, but its 200 pages still make for a great primer in what can initially be an overwhelming country.”[5] _A Gift of Sunlight_ tells the story of the Davies sisters who collected paintings and bequeathed them to the Welsh nation. Fishlock presented a BBC documentary about the sisters, broadcast in May 2014,[6] and gave a talk about the book at Swansea’s National Waterfront Museum in 2015.[7]
