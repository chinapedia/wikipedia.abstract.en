The BOSTON MAJOR was a professional _Dota 2_ esports tournament that took place in Boston in the United States.[1] The main event was played live at the Wang Theatre from December 7–10, 2016. Like other tournaments in the _Dota 2_ Major Championship series, the event featured 16 teams from around the world and had a $3,000,000 prize pool, with the victor winning $1,000,000.[2] The event was presented and produced by PGL, who also had the same role at the previous Major in Manila.[3]

Unlike previous _Dota 2_ Majors, the Boston Major was the first one to have a single elimination bracket.[4] The event was won by OG, their third _Dota 2_ Major championship victory, who defeated Ad Finem in the best-of-five grand finals 3–1.[5]
