Organization and structure

Metzada unit is nationwide and directly subordinate to the chief of operations of the IPS. Unit's operators are IPS personnel on payroll with combat experience from their military service within the Israel Defense Forces.[13]

Recruitment requirements are: IDF combat service (training level 08 minimum), sergeant\ officer course graduate and high level of physical fitness. The selection process includes a number of long physical and psychological tests. In the end of the process only the few candidates proceed to Metzada Operator training course, which takes place in the unit's training center. Overall, only one percent of candidates become Metzada Operators.[14]

After the completion of a six-month course, the unit members are divided into sections. The unit is formed of two major sections: takeover and the break in. The takeover section specializes in aspects related to any takeover, including the takeover of cells within the prison or a prisoner transport vehicles. The break in section specializes in deployment of explosives and door breaching.[15]

At the sections, the operators specialize in various professions: roping, breach and entry, K-9, sniping, negotiation, etc.[16]


History

Metzada unit was established in 2003 by IPS Commissioner Yaakov Ganot as a response to increased level of personnel assaults and hostage kidnapping attempts performed by prisoners during that period.[17] Until 2003 there was no hostage rescue unit in IPS, so in case of emergency situations it would have to depend on other organizations, such as Israel Police and IDF.[18]

Since 2006 Metzada is also IDF General Staff subordinate unit and it's responsible for hostage rescue at IDF correctional facilities.[19]
