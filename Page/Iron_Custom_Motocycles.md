Projects

The first

The company's first project, which participated in the international championship. Donor bike for the project was the HD Night Rod Special, released in 2009. Custom designed in the style of HD and is fully compliant with HD-standards. Engineering calculations were borrowed from Porsche, engine – company Rotax. Body kit and motorcycle wheels — V-Rod - No-Limit-Custom. Tire casings from Avon Venom. The fuel controller and exhaust pipe – Vance&Hines. The model is equipped with full pneumatic suspension and front fork with traverses from Tricky Air. The computerized system allows to change the suspension height, stiffness and pumping order.[10]

Fetish

Donor for the future custom became Harley Davidson HD Rocker C of 2008. The project is equipped with a hydraulic clutch linkage and suspension B-17 PD “Black Widow”. In addition, ICM craftsmen installed unilateral idler arm War Eagle and progressive suspension Air Tail.[11]

Sturmvogel

The custom was based on the idea of “Dieselpunk” style model, rocket shaped and with maximal functionalism. Harley-Davidson XR 1200 of 2009 model year was the basis.[12] The model is equipped with sports slick tires RSD, braking systems and machines from PM, running boards and damper from LSL. The rear suspension was designed on the basis of racing technology — with a single shock absorber under the engine. Creators made the custom’s back lighter by shifting down the center of gravity. Oil tank is moved under the engine and control unit — to the tail of the model. Under the lower cowling radiator and other parts are located. Titanium exhaust system of the company Zard is installed.[13][14]

“Dry” system of nitrous oxide, which increases the power of the bike by 20 horsepower to the already existing 80 is added. Semi-automatic clutch EFI adapted specifically for the custom.[15]

Body kit is made of fiberglass popular in the 50s, 60s — a design decision within the framework of the selected futuristic style. The style is supplemented with a custom body kit in the form of the monocoque without visible mounting points.[16]

Beckman

The basis for the idea of this model customizing has served the domestic motorcycle. By all parameters the project was created as a Café Racer of the late 1970s - early 1980s. For this reason, in creation of this model only domestic parts of 1960-1980s were used, the remaining components were created by ICM craftsmen by hand, but with preservation of the technologies of the above-mentioned period.[17]

The project name was chosen in honor of William Beckman – Soviet design engineer, professor, sportsman and instructor of motorcycle sport. Wilhelm Beckmann – the author of many books on motorsport and motorcycle design, based on which the custom was built, fully modified by engineering and design technologies of the time.[18]

Custom was created from a donor IZH Jupiter-4 1982. After complete modification of the model, the original parts in the motorcycle are almost gone.[19]


World speed record of the motorcycle Inspirium
