_HEIDI_ is a Swiss-French animated children's TV series, based indirectly on Heidi by Johanna Spyri.[1] The original 2007 television series was a Swiss-French-Italian-Australian co-production in 27 episodes of 26 minutes. A "remake" (rather than a re-telling) of Heidi, Girl of the Alps, much of the story is the same; the titular character is a then-five-year-old girl, who's taken to her grandfather on the Swiss Alps by her aunt, Dete to live with him and while the girl ends up improving his life, she also befriends Peter, the goatherd of the village Dorfli below and the one who causes her to find a big passion of hers, goats and other animals in general. But in this version, there is also a trio, Karl, Theresa, and William, who usually try to do something that would downgrade Peter, whom they often refer to as a mountain goat, in some way or another. But in the first winter up there, a letter is eventually gotten and what results from there will end up changing another's life, as well.

The series has been distributed in 138 countries around the world.

Production

On the behalf of ZDF, one of the series' co-producers, with the intention of renewing Heidi, Girl of the Alps and fellow series to the modern children's audience, the series was produced from 2013–14, mainly in France, that much like Maya the Bee and Vicky the Viking before, including being done by the same main studio, on the behalf of ZDF, but in this production, multiple other companies, including the Australia-based, specifically-made Heidi Pyl, joined in on making the series.

In the first production, from the writing bible, written by Christel Gonnard, was the first twenty-seven episodes first had their locations shot with high-definition footage, for reference to the animators making the now-fictionalized locations of the series, in Haute-Savoie for the Alps (referred to as that, rather than the Alm, as in the base series and novel) and in Friborg for Frankfurt, similarly to Zuyio (later Nippon)'s team shooting pictures of the official locations themselves, for the setting references to background painters and writers, for the base series. The two halves that happened to be made in that production were directed, respectively, by Pierre-Antoine Hiroz and Anne Deluz. The theme music was two songs at the time; the credits song, replaced by a bit of a piece of background music from the series, when the series was bought the rights out of, was sung by Cindy Santos, first known in 2006, when she participated in the French show Nouvelle Star.

The first three episodes were screen as a "world preview" at Geneva's Tout Ecran Movie Festival (Festival Cinéma Tout Ecran) on October 31, 2007 (albeit only coincidentally for Halloween). Later, was a twenty-episode documentary series, of three minutes each episode, and produced by Rita and Chocolat TV Productions, aired on Télévision Suisse Romande as well as on Chocolat's website, before the latter was removed, which documented the first production. Afterwards, an account of a promoter, impersonating an now-teenage Heidi, was opened on a blog and a MySpace page, where the character promoted the series. The series premiered on the Swiss network Télévision Suisse Romande on December 22, 2007, in Swiss HD. In France, Studio 100 Animation bought the rights in 2013 and produced a 3D series of 39 episodes of 26 minutes each, now directed by Jérôme Mouscadet, from that year to 2014 and the completed series began airing in 2015.

Due to the partnership of Eurovision Fiction, was the series sent to their affiliated countries, including Ireland, Norway (see below), Cyprus (in Greek dub), Slovakia (also see below), Bulgaria and Poland and aired (as of recent, at least part-finished) on the EBU member chains of those countries.


Changes

From Heidi, Girl of the Alps, for time and/or other reasons, were several changes made in this version:

-   The characterizations were heavily simplified; with Heidi, her emotions were more prominent and her friendship with Peter is less affected by his beating tendencies of the goats, partly because they're stopped at once, when Heidi sees that and does her action.
-   Sub-plots, from Heidi's relationship with the fir trees to the eventual living in the winter home, are either altered (including being simplified) or removed entirely or even created for this series: of the last one, partway through Heidi learning how to read, Clara and her grandmother inform Heidi of: "Princess and the Frog", which they turn to making performance out of; based on that fairy tale being one of those shown with its illustration to Heidi, while Clara's grandmother first encouraged her to learn how to read, that night.
-   Many of the base series' more episodic plots are re-told; the "Sad News-Snowflake" two-parter is told as: "Save Sweetheart", where the butcher is independent of the goat, the plants searched for saving the goat are in a singular place and adds the sub-plot of Therese trying to keep one of the flock at bay, while Peter and Heidi climb the nearby mountains for the plants.
-   Clara's training to being walking begins while Heidi's still in Frankfurt and progresses from there to episode thirty-eight.
-   Elements from the two-part novel, including the religious elements (generally removed in the base series for comprehensibility issues with the more current Buddhist audience) are returned, sometimes loosely; Heidi's tendend prayers to the little star is based on her praying to God, to find a way to get her home to the Alm, inspired by Clara's grandmother's advice.
-   A "terrible trio" group of villains are introduced, most prominent in the first third of the series, where they usually try to get Peter's secret cabin to themselves, especially from Heidi. Their trio ends when Carl moves away.


Critical reception

While it was a simple success in France, in countries where the original series is well-loved, from Mexico to Germany, it has, at the most positive, gotten a lukewarm reaction, including claims from Latin American fans that the story changes "ruined" the entire series, much like other series like this. In Germany, the series had its reincarnation of the famous German theme song, now sung by Austrian folk star Andreas Gabalier, attacked for his "horrendous" singing ability.[2]
