_EUCALYPTUS FULGENS_, commonly known as GREEN SCENTBARK,[1] is a small to medium-sized tree that is endemic in Victoria, Australia.


Description

_Eucalyptus fulgens_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, fibrous dark grey bark on the trunk and larger branches, sometimes smooth bark on the thin branches. Young plants have sessile or shortly petiolate, elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that are long, wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long, wide on a petiole wide. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long, wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs in autumn and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or cup-shaped capsule long, wide with the valves near rim level or slightly beyond.[2][3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus fulgens_ was first formally described in 1996 by Kevin James Rule in the journal _Muelleria_, from a specimen he collected from Upper Beaconsfield.[6][7] The specific epithet (_fulgens_) is derived from a Latin word alluding to the lustrous appearance of the adult leaves.[8]


Distribution and habitat

This eucalypt grows in heavy soils over sandstone between Healesville, Woori Yallock and Driffield in the Latrobe Valley.[9][10]


Use in horticulture

This species is suitable as a shade tree for moist, but not wet areas and is bird and butterfly attracting.[11]
