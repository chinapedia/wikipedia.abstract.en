Pair skating

In spring 2013, Fancy teamed up with Christopher Boyadji to compete in pair skating.[5][6] In November 2013, the pair won the British national title ahead of defending champions Stacey Kemp / David King.[7] Fancy/Boyadji placed 15th at the 2014 European Championships in Budapest, Hungary, and 18th at the 2014 World Championships in Saitama, Japan.
