NURA AFIA is an American beauty vlogger. In November 2016, CoverGirl cosmetics company named her one of its brand ambassadors. Afia is the company's first brand ambassador who wears a hijab.[1]


Early life

Afia grew up in Aurora, Colorado with five siblings, and attended Smoky Hill High School. Her mother Anne was born a Christian in Lebanon to Swiss-Lebanese parents, and converted to Islam prior to marrying Afia's father who is Moroccan.[2] When she was 18, Afia married a childhood friend.


Career

While at home with her first baby in 2011, Afia began watching beauty videos online.[3] She was inspired to start recording her own videos, using electronics borrowed from family. Over time she grew her channels to reach 213,000 YouTube subscribers and 300,000 Instagram followers.[4][5] Afia also began to do photo shoots and work with modest fashion brands.[6]

In November 2016, as part of a campaign to feature models from diverse backgrounds, CoverGirl cosmetics named Afia as a brand ambassador.[7] She received many messages of support from Muslim women pleased to see a model in a hijab, however she was also criticised as hypocritical for both covering up with a hijab and seeking attention through make-up.[8]
