TECHNICOLOR INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED (formerly PAPRIKAAS) is an Indian animation studio based in Bangalore. The company was founded as Paprikaas in August 2001. In 2010, Technicolor SA acquired a majority stake in company and rebranded it Technicolor India.


History

Papirkaas was incorporated on 31 August 2001.

On 13 February 2007, Thomson Multimedia's Technicolor Content Services division announced that it had invested in Paprikaas to expand its entertainment services capabilities.[1] On 20 December 2007, Technicolor partnered with DreamWorks Animation to assist Paprikass in the "recruitment, training and development of top-tier animation talent".[2] By 26 January 2010, Technicolor had raised its ownership in Paprikaas to 100%, making it the studio's sole owner.[3] Following the acquisition, Technicolor's previous Indian offices in Delhi were merged into Paprikaas, and the resulting studio was rebranded Technicolor India on 14 May 2010.[4][5]

On 4 October 2012, Technicolor announced that a new business development unit, entitled the Rockstar Dedicated Unit (RDU), would be established within Technicolor India.[6] The team, set to size around 80â€“90 people, would work exclusively on games published by Rockstar Games.[7] Technicolor India had previously collaborated with Rockstar Games on titles like _Red Dead Redemption_ (2010), _L.A. Noire_ (2011) and _Max Payne 3_ (2012).[8] The new RDU would focus especially on art and animation, so to take advantage of their "state-of-the-art technology infrastructure".[9][10] Regarding the opening, Jeronimo Barrera, vice president of development at Rockstar Games, stated: "Technicolor were a fantastic resource for us during the development of _Max Payne 3_ [...] We're looking forward to building the partnership on future projects."[11][12] The first projects to be developed by the RDU were said to be _Grand Theft Auto V_, which Technicolor India was already working on before-hand, and the cancelled-thought _Agent_.[13]
