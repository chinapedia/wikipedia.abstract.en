_AMARANTHUS_, collectively known as AMARANTH,[1] is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants. Most of the _Amaranthus_ species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed.[2] Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn.[3] Approximately 60 species are recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple, through red and green to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus _Celosia_.

"Amaranth" derives from Greek [4] (), "unfading", with the Greek word for "flower", (), factoring into the word's development as _amaranth_. _Amarant_ is an archaic variant.


Taxonomy

Día_de_muertos.jpg in Mexico]] Dulce_de_amaranto..JPG _Amaranthus_ shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species. Although the family (Amaranthaceae) is distinctive, the genus has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included.[5] This complicates taxonomy and _Amaranthus_ has generally been considered among systematists as a "difficult" genus.[6]

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between monoecious and dioecious species: _Acnida_ (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and _Amaranthus_.[7] Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.

Currently, _Amaranthus_ includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to hybridization and species concepts.[8] Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.[9] A modified infrageneric classification of _Amaranthus_ was published by Mosyakin & Robertson (1996) and includes three subgenera: _Acnida_, _Amaranthus_, and _Albersia_. The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.[10]

==Nutrition==

Uncooked amaranth grain is 12% water, 65% carbohydrates (including 7% dietary fiber), 14% protein, and 7% fat (table). A reference amount of uncooked amaranth grain provides 371 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folate, and several dietary minerals (table). Uncooked amaranth is particularly rich in manganese (159% DV), phosphorus (80% DV), magnesium (70% DV), iron (59% DV), and selenium (34% DV). Cooking decreases its nutritional value substantially across all nutrients, with only dietary minerals remaining at moderate levels.[14]

Cooked amaranth leaves are a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and manganese, with moderate levels of folate, iron, magnesium, and potassium.[15] Amaranth does not contain gluten.[16][17][18]

Phytochemicals

Amaranth grain contains phytochemicals that are not defined as nutrients and may be antinutrient factors, such as polyphenols, saponins, tannins, and oxalates. These compounds are reduced in content and antinutrient effect by cooking.[19][20]


Human uses

History

Known to the Aztecs as ,[21] amaranth is thought to have represented up to 80% of their energy consumption before the Spanish conquest. Another important use of amaranth throughout Mesoamerica was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, amaranth grains are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey, molasses, or chocolate to make a treat called , meaning "joy" in Spanish. Diego Durán described the festivities for the Aztec god (whose name means "left side of the hummingbird"; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to . People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially _A. cruentus_ and _A. hypochondriacus_) revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America. Amaranth and quinoa are pseudocereals because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.

Seed

Several species are raised for amaranth "grain" in Asia and the Americas.

Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species, _Amaranthus caudatus_, _Amaranthus cruentus_, and _Amaranthus hypochondriacus_.[22] Although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there, along with India, China, Nepal, and other tropical countries; thus, the potential exists for further cultivation in those countries, as well as in the U.S. In a 1977 article in _Science_, amaranth was described as "the crop of the future".[23] It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:

-   A small amount of seed plants a large area (seeding rate 1 kg/ha).
-   It is easily harvested.
-   Its seeds are a good source of protein.[24][25]
-   In cooked and edible forms, amaranth retains adequate content of several dietary minerals.[26]
-   It is easy to cook.
-   It grows fast and, in three cultivated species, the large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kg and contain a half-million small seeds.[27]

Leaves, roots, and stems

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a leaf vegetable in many parts of the world. Four species of _Amaranthus_ are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: _Amaranthus cruentus_, _Amaranthus blitum, Amaranthus dubius_, and _Amaranthus tricolor_.[28]

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called . In the Philippines, the Ilocano word for the plant is ; the Tagalog word for the plant is or . In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India, it is called _chaulai_ and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called _saag_). It is called _chua_ in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called _harive_. It is used to prepare curries such as _hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee_, and so on. In Kerala, it is called _cheera_ and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make _cheera thoran_. In Tamil Nadu, it is called _mulaikkira_ and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chili, and cumin. It is called _keerai masial_. In _Andhra Pradesh_, this leaf is added in preparation of a popular _dal_ called in (Telugu). In Maharashtra, it is called _shravani maath_ and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called _khada saga_, it is used to prepare _saga bhaja_, in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called and is used to make soup. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: (_Amaranthus tricolor_) and or (_Amaranthus viridis_).

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care.[29]

In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as _doodo_ or _litoto_.[30] It is also known among the Kalenjin as a drought crop (_chepkerta_). In Lingala (spoken in the Congo), it is known as or .[31] In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in Yoruba as a short form of (meaning make the husband fat) or (meaning "we have money left over for fish"). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called _bhaji_ in Trinidad and _callaloo_ in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as _morug_ and cooked as a staple green vegetable.

In Greece, green amaranth (_A. viridis_) is a popular dish called , or . It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported _A. caudatus_ cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of or , which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, rice and beans.

Oil

Making up about 5% of the total fatty acids of amaranth, squalene[32] is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive shark oil for use in dietary supplements and cosmetics.[33]

Dyes

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the Hopi (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red dye. Also a synthetic dye was named "amaranth" for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth pigments known as betalains. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.[34]

Ornamentals

Amaranthus_flowers.jpg The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as _Amaranthus caudatus_ (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish flowers crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, _A. hypochondriacus_ (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including the nutmeg moth and various case-bearer moths of the genus _Coleophora_: _C. amaranthella_, _C. enchorda_ (feeds exclusively on _Amaranthus_), _C. immortalis_ (feeds exclusively on _Amaranthus_), _C. lineapulvella_, and _C. versurella_ (recorded on _A. spinosus_).


Ecology

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,[35] and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in tillage, reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.[36] The following 9 species of _Amaranthus_ are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: _A. albus_, _A. blitoides_, _A. hybridus_, _A. palmeri_, _A. powellii_, _A. retroflexus_, _A. spinosus_, _A. tuberculatus_, and _A. viridis_.[37]

A new herbicide-resistant strain of _Amaranthus palmeri_ has appeared; it is glyphosate-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species _Amaranthus palmeri_ (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.[38] Palmer amaranth is among the "top five most troublesome weeds" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to dinitroaniline herbicides and acetolactate synthase inhibitors.[39] This makes the proper identification of _Amaranthus_ species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

An evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the carbon fixation pathway, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency. This probably occurred in the Miocene.[40][41]
