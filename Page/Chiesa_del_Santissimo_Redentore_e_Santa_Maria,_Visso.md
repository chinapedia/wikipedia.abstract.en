The CHIESA DEL SANTISSIMO REDENTORE E SANTA MARIA (Church of the Holiest Redeemer and St Mary) is a Romanesque-style, deconsecrated Roman Catholic church located in the town of Visso, province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy. Typically, the Italian title is _S.S. Redentore e S. Maria_.


History

The stone church was built in the 13th century. It has a single nave with three internal arches, somewhat acute, and adjoining square-based bell tower. The main altar was erected by the Confraternity of Santa Maria, which patronized the church. The interior were frescoed with a _Madonna of the Rosary surrounded by the mysteries of the Rosary_[1] and a _God the father with the Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah_. During a pastoral visit in 1712, the church was noted to be overburdened with seven lateral altars. The church underwent restoration in 1978 and after the 1997 earthquake.[2]
