SOUTHEAST VERMONT TRANSIT (SEVT) is the public transportation network serving Windham County, Vermont, southern Windsor County, and parts of southern Bennington County by local bus. The agency was born in July 2015 when the more localized Connecticut River Transit, doing business as the CURRENT (including the former Brattleboro BeeLine), and the Deerfield Valley Transit Association, doing business as the MOOVER, merged.[1]

As of February 21, 2015, route planning for all SEVT routes are available on Google Maps.[2]

All MOOver routes are fare free.[3] Fares on the Current range from nothing on local circulator routes in and around Bellows Falls and Springfield and the 55 and 57 routes to $2 one-way on the commuter routes between Bellows Falls and the Upper Valley.[4]

The MOOVER division of SEVT serves southern Windham County and parts of southern Bennington County with most routes meeting and transferring passengers at either the Wilmington Shaw's Supermarket or the Deerfield Valley Health Center (operated by Southwestern Vermont Medical Center), both located east of downtown. There are also circulator bus routes serving the Mount Snow ski resort during the winter season each year.

Current service area

The_Current_bus_at_Bellows_Falls_station,_October_2011.jpg The CURRENT division of SEVT serves eastern Windham County, Vermont and southern Windsor County. This division provides bus service in and around the town of Brattleboro on what was previously called the BRATTLEBORO BEELINE. These three routes are served from the Brattleboro Transportation Center, just outside the lower level of a parking garage in that town's downtown business district. Four other commuter bus routes run in a peak-direction, linear schedule between the village of Bellows Falls and the Upper Valley regional and commercial centers of White River Junction and Lebanon, New Hampshire. Also, bidirectional weekday commuter bus routes are available between Bellows Falls to Ludlow, Springfield, and Brattleboro.

In addition, the Current offers dial-a-ride service in more rural and remote regions of their service area, given that riders meet certain eligibility requirements.[5]

A 27 ride pass on the Bellows Falls/Brattleboro Commuter was also available for $25. Currently, there is no discount fare schedule for seniors, the disabled or Medicare cardholders on these fixed routes or on the Brattleboro BeeLine.

Brattleboro BeeLine

These routes generally operate between 6 am and 6 pm Monday through Saturday at uneven time intervals, excluding major federal holidays.[8] The Blue Line also serves Guilford and Hinsdale, New Hampshire on select trips, and the Red Line also serves West Brattleboro. The one-way fare for each of these routes is $1. The former BeeLine bus system is composed of the:

-   4 Red Line
-   5 Blue Line
-   8 White Line

Prior to December 4, 2016, rolls of 20 BeeLine bus tokens were available directly from Current bus drivers for $20, payable via cash or check. The Current now uses electronic fare boxes on these routes that accept both cash, change and stored value cards. Stored value cards may also be purchased at their Rockingham headquarters. One-way transfers are also available and are good on local routes only when transferring between the three local bus routes and are only issued at the Brattleboro Transportation Center.[9]
