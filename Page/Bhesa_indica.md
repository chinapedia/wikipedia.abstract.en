_BHESA INDICA_ is a flowering plant tree species in the Centroplacaceae family. It is distributed along the tropical wet evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India.[1] It is considered synonymous with _Bhesa paniculata_ by some authors.


Taxonomy

_Bhesa indica_ has been considered as synonymous with _Trochisandra indica_, _Kurrimia bipartita_, _Kurrimia indica_, and _Kurrimia paniculata_.[2][3] Other authors have distinguished Indian from Malayan species. Brandis noted that _Trochisandra indica_ Bedd., reported from 3-6,000 feet in the Anamalai hills of the Western Ghats, should be referred to the southern Indian species, _Kurrimia bipartita_ Lawson, instead of the Malayan species, _K. paniculata_ Wall., as quoted by Lawson.[4] The two species were also distinguished by Ding Hou on the basis of flower and fruit characters.[5] The flowers of the two species differ in that _Bhesa paniculata_ has solitary, paniculate inflorescence with deeply 5-lobed disk, extrorse anthers, and ovary with a tuft of hairs on top. _B. indica_ has disk entire, anthers introrse, and glabrous ovary. In fruits, both species are characterized by paniculate infructescence and 2-lobed fruits with distinct pedicels, but the fruits are obovoid or cordate, 1-1.75 (up to 2) cm long and acute to attenuate at the base in _B. paniculata_, and oblong, 2.5–3 cm long and obtuse at the base in _B. indica_.[6]


Distribution

Considered together _Bhesa indica_ and _Bhesa paniculata_ are distributed in parts of southern India, Thailand, Malay peninsula, Indonesia, Borneo, and the Philippines. _Bhesa indica_ is known from southern India, mainly from the Western Ghats, while _B. paniculata_ extends also into parts of south-east Asia. _Bhesa indica_ occurs along the Western Ghats from the Agasthyamalai hills in the south to the Anaimalai hills in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, mainly in the evergreen forests from around 900 m to 1800 m.[7]


Characteristics

Evergreen trees of mature forest growing up to 30 m tall, with smooth, grey-brown BARK. The BRANCHLETS are stout and cylindrical and carry scars of fallen leaves and stipules. The LEAVES are simple, alternate and clustered at twig ends, with large stipules up to 2.5 cm long that are caducous (lost through dehiscence). The PETIOLE is 2.5 cm to 4.5 cm long, swollen at the base and tip and attached to a LEAF that is 10–18 cm long and 4.5-8.5 cm wide, elliptic-oblong to narrow-ovate in shape. The leaf apex is obtusely acute or short acuminate and the leaf base is rounded. The leaves are leathery, shining above and below, darker green above and paler below, and hairless. The leaves have 11 to 20 pairs of distinct secondary NERVES (raised beneath, parallel, and oblique to midrib), with fine parallel and percurrent tertiary nerves. The INFLORESCENCE is at the ends of branches formed as panicled racemes. The FLOWERS are small and white. The FRUIT is a capsule, red, and prominently 2-lobed. The fruit contains a single SEED per lobe.[8][9]

Ecology

The tree is mostly restricted to mature evergreen forests in the Western Ghats, more common at elevations above 1000 m and less abundant in forest fragments.[10] It is considered a species of relatively narrow ecological amplitude and a characteristic species of an identified high elevation (1400 – 1800 m) wet evergreen forest type called the _Bhesa indica_ – _Gomphandra coriacea_ – _Litsea spp._ Type in the southern Western Ghats.[11] The fruits of _Bhesa indica_ are dispersed by fruit bats and possibly other mammals such as macaques as in the case of other _Bhesa_ species in south-east Asia[12] and Sri Lanka.[13] The seeds are recalcitrant, losing viability rapidly on drying (seed germination decreasing from 77% to 13% in a month).[14]
