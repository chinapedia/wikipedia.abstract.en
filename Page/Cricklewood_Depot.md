CRICKLEWOOD SIDINGS currently provides stabling for passenger trains, and is the site of a former steam shed and diesel Traction Maintenance Depot located in Cricklewood, Greater London, England. It is situated beside the Midland Main Line, to the east of Cricklewood station.[1]

The depot code was CW.


Passenger train stabling

Trains berthing in the stabling roads between services are cleaned and have their water tanks refilled. Train types include East Midlands Trains Class 43 HSTs[2] and Class 222 Meridians[3] and Thameslink Class 700 EMUs.[4]


Domestic waste operations

The North London Waste Authority operates Hendon transfer station,[5] which is located immediately behind the northern end of the site and accessed through the passenger sidings. Freightliner Heavy Haul hauls a waste container train, nicknamed "The Binliner" from here to a landfill site at Calvert in Buckinghamshire.[6]
