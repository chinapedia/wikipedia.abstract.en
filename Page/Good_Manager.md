Reception

Despite competing against big-budget drama _Saimdang, Light's Diary_ in the same time slot and having no big-name stars, the drama managed to top ratings during its run and enjoyed explosive popularity.[12] It received positive reviews for its punchy and satirical lines on the corrupt corporate owners and the society, which resonated with the viewers; and the multifaceted performance of lead actor Namkoong Min, whose perfect amalgamation of character creation and acting saves “Good Manager” from what could have been an average office crime comedy.[13] _Korea Times_ said that the drama "has the ability to tell uncomfortable stories (story of embezzlement cases, mass layoffs and other societal issues regarding fierce competition) in a witty way".[14]
