SAMUEL OETTLI (29 July 1846, in St. Gallen – 23 September 1911, in Illenau near Achern) was a Swiss Protestant theologian, who specialized in Old Testament studies.

He studied theology at the universities Basel, Zürich and Göttingen, and later served as a pastor in the communities of Roggwil (from 1872) and Wangen. In 1878 he became an associate professor of Old Testament studies at the University of Bern, where two years later he gained a full professorship. Due to serious illness, Adolf Schlatter took over his lectures at the university during the winter semester of 1880/81. From 1895 onward, he was a professor at the University of Greifswald.[1][2]
