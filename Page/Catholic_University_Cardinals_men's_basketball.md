The CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY CARDINALS MEN'S BASKETBALL team represents The Catholic University of America in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III college basketball competition as a member of the Landmark Conference. They won the national championship in the 2000–2001 season, and are the only program in Division III to reach the Sweet Sixteen five consecutive seasons, from 1998–2002.


History

The team began as a club sport in the 1909–10 season, and gained varsity status the following year.[1] Although it did not have an official head coach, the roster listed Joseph Bollin as the team's "manager."[2] The first game during the club sport era was against Georgetown University, and the first official game was a 42–33 home victory over Gallaudet University on January 7, 1911.[3] They followed it with a 37–34 victory over St. John's College in Annapolis, but lost the remaining six games of the season to finish 2–6.[4]

Fred Rice, a graduate student, joined the team in the 1911–12 season as a player coach.[5] Rice had previously played at Georgetown, where he earned a law degree.[6] The team improved to 10–7, and then 13–3 in 1912–13.[7]

The December 1916 edition of The Catholic University of America Bulletin declared that, under Rice's leadership,

The Brookland Gymnasium, the first on-campus arena, opened in 1924. The team won their first two games in it, and went 38–15 from 1925 to 28.[8]
