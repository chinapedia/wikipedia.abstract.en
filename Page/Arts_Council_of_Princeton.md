THE ARTS COUNCIL OF PRINCETON was established in 1967, by Bill Selden, in Princeton, New Jersey. Selden was also the first President of the organization.[1][2]


History

In 1982, Anne Reeves, then President of Arts Council of Princeton, entered into an agreement with the Borough of New Jersey for the occupation of 102 Witherspoon Street.[3]

In April 1997, the Arts Council of Princeton purchased its facility at 102 Witherspoon Street from the Borough of Princeton. Michael Graves, an American architect and native to Princeton, designed the renovated building and agreed to donate his design to the Council.[4][5] Anne Reeves announced her retirement in 2005 and assumed the role as _Founding Director_. She served as Executive Director since the founding of the Council. The Board of Trustees hired current Executive Director, Jeff Nathanson, in May 2005.[6] In November 2016, the board announced it had appointed Taneshia Nash Laird to succeed Nathanson who announced his intent to retire in June 2016. Laird is scheduled to begin in January 2017.[7]

In June 2008, the Arts Council of Princeton’s building at 102 Witherspoon Street was re-opened. The arts center includes a gallery, theater, multi-disciplinary art studios and public meeting space. The Arts Council of Princeton will commemorate its 50th anniversary in 2017 with a year-long celebration.[8]
