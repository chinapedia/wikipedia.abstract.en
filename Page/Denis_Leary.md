DENIS COLIN O'LEARY (born August 18, 1957) is an American actor, comedian, singer, writer and producer. Leary was the star and co-creator of _Rescue Me_, which ended its seventh and final season on September 7, 2011. He has starred in many films including playing Captain George Stacy in Marc Webb's film, _The Amazing Spider-Man_, Cleveland Browns Head Coach Vince Penn in Ivan Reitman's film, _Draft Day_, and as the voice of Francis in _A Bug's Life_ and Diego in the _Ice Age_ franchise.

From 2015 to 2016, Leary wrote and starred in the comedy series, _Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll_ on FX.


Early life

Denis Colin Leary was born on August 18, 1957, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Roman Catholic immigrant parents from County Kerry, Ireland.[1] His mother, Nora (née Sullivan) (b. 1929), was a maid, and his father, John Leary (1924–1985), was an auto mechanic.[2][3] Being the son of Irish parents,[4][5] Leary is a citizen of both the United States and Ireland.[6] Through marriage, Leary is a third cousin of talk show host Conan O'Brien.[7][8]

He attended Saint Peter's High School (now Saint Peter-Marian High School), in Worcester and graduated from Emerson College,[9] in Boston. At Emerson, he met fellow comic Mario Cantone, whom to this day Leary considers his closest friend.[10][11] At the school, he founded the Emerson Comedy Workshop, a troupe that continues on-campus today.[12]

After graduating with the Emerson Class of 1981, he took a job at the school teaching comedy writing classes and maintained the job for five years.[13] He received an honorary doctorate and spoke briefly at his alma mater's undergraduate commencement ceremony on May 16, 2005;[14] he is thus credited as _Dr. Denis Leary_ on the cover of his 2009 book, _Why We Suck_.


Career

Leary began working as a comedian in the Boston comedy scene of the 1980s at the underground club, Play It Again Sam's; however, his first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show, _The Rascals Comedy Hour_, on October 18, 1990. He wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, _The Late, Late Show_, hosted by his friend, Lenny Clarke, and written by writer, Martin Olson. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film, _When Standup Stood Out_ (2006), and during this time, he developed his stage persona. He appeared in skits on the MTV game show _Remote Control_, playing such characters as Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the brother of co-host Colin Quinn, and artist Andy Warhol.

Leary earned fame when he ranted about R.E.M. in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing alternative scene. One of these rants serves as an introduction to the video of "Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)" by House of Pain. He released two records of his stand-up comedy: _No Cure for Cancer_ (1993) and _Lock 'n Load_ (1997). In late 2004, he released the EP _Merry F#%$in' Christmas_, which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings, and some tracks from _Lock 'n Load_.

In 1993, his sardonic song about the stereotypical American male, "Asshole", achieved much notoriety; however, this bit was allegedly stolen from Louis C.K., discussed by Louis on an interview on the Opie and Anthony Show.[15] It was voted No. 1 in an Australian youth radio poll (the Triple J Hottest 100).[16] The song was used as part of the Holsten Pils series of ads in the UK, in which Leary was participating, with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver.[17] The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1996.[18]

In 1995, he was asked by Cam Neely to help orchestrate a Boston-based comedy benefit show for Neely's cancer charity; this became Comics Come Home, which Leary has hosted annually ever since.[19]

Leary has appeared in many films including: _The Sandlot_ as Scott's stepfather Bill, _Monument Ave._, _The Matchmaker_, _The Ref_, _Draft Day_, _Suicide Kings_, _Dawg_, _Wag the Dog_, _Demolition Man_, _Judgment Night_, _The Thomas Crown Affair_, and _Operation Dumbo Drop_. He had a tiny part in Oliver Stone's _Natural Born Killers_ that was eventually cut. He held the lead role in two television series, _The Job_ and _Rescue Me_, and he co-created the latter, in which he played Tommy Gavin, a New York City firefighter dealing with alcoholism, family dysfunction and other issues in post-9/11 New York City.

He received Emmy Award nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for _Rescue Me_, and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the HBO movie _Recount_.[20] Leary was offered the role of Dignam in _The Departed_ (2006) but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with _Rescue Me_. He provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series _The Agents_, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in _A Bug's Life_ and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the _Ice Age_ film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central's _Shorties Watchin' Shorties_, the stand-up special _Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas_, and the movie _Blow_.

As a Boston Red Sox fan, he narrated the official 2004 World Series film (Q Video/MLB Productions, 2004). In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson's antisemitic comments.[21] As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video _NHL's Greatest Goals_.[22] In 2003, he was the subject of the _Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary_.[23]

Leary did the TV voiceover for MLB 2K8 advertisements, where he used his trademark rant style in baseball terms, and ads for the 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck. He has also appeared in commercials for Hulu and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package. Leary was a producer of the Fox Broadcasting series _Canterbury's Law_, and wrote and directed its pilot episode. _Canterbury's Law_ aired in the spring of 2008 and was canceled after eight episodes. On September 9, 2008, Leary hosted the sixth annual _Fashion Rocks_ event, which aired on CBS. In December of the year, he appeared in a video on funnyordie.com critiquing a list of some of his "best" films, titled "Denis Leary Remembers Denis Leary Movies".[24] Also in 2008, Leary voiced a guest role as himself on the "Lost Verizon" episode of _The Simpsons_.

On March 21, 2009, he began the "Rescue Me Comedy Tour" in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 11-date tour, featuring _Rescue Me_ co-stars Lenny Clarke and Adam Ferrara, was Leary's first stand-up comedy tour in 12 years.[25] The Comedy Central special _Douchebags and Donuts_, filmed during the tour, debuted on American television on January 16, 2011, with a DVD release on January 18, 2011.[26]

He played Captain George Stacy in the movie _The Amazing Spider-Man_, released in July 2012.[27] He wrote the American adaptation of _Sirens_.[28]

He is an Executive Producer of the documentary, _Burn_, that chronicles the struggles of the Detroit Fire Department. _Burn_ was the winner of the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award.[29]

He created a television series for FX, in which he also stars in the lead role, called _Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll_. A 10-episode first season was ordered by FX, which premiered on July 16, 2015.[30][31] The show was renewed for a second season, which was broadcast in the summer of 2016, and was canceled after the broadcast of the second season. Leary has been the narrator for NESN's documentary show about the Boston Bruins Behind The B since the show began in 2013.


Personal life

Leary has been married to author Ann Lembeck Leary since 1989.[32] They met when he was her instructor in an English class at Emerson College. They have two children, son John Joseph "Jack" (born 1990) and daughter Devin (born 1992).[33] Ann Leary published a memoir, _An Innocent, a Broad_, about the premature birth of their son on an overseas visit to London. She has also written a novel, _Outtakes From a Marriage_, which was published in 2008. Her second novel, _The Good House_, was published in 2013.[34]

Leary is an ice hockey fan, and has his own backyard hockey rink at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, with piping installed under the ice surface to help the ice stay frozen.[35] He is a fan of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Red Sox,[36] as well as the Green Bay Packers.[37][38]

Leary describes himself as a "Jack Kennedy Democrat" with some conservative ideologies, including support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, "I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want."[39]

Leary has said of his religious beliefs, "I'm a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy...."[40]

Denis resides in New York, New York.


Leary Firefighters Foundation

On December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey and his close childhood friend Lt. Tommy Spencer.[41] In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5 million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston, and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles, and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire_. Leary has close ties with 107.3/WAAF, which in 2000 released the station album _Survive This!_ Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation.

A separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2 million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001 in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.[42]


Controversies

Plagiarism

For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. When Leary's comedy album _No Cure for Cancer_ was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hicks's act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.[43] In April 1993, the _Austin Comedy News_ remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance, "Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx." When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did".[44]

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude.[45][46][47] One similar routine was about the so-called Judas Priest "suicide trial," during which Hicks says, "I don't think we lost a cancer cure."[48]

During Leary's 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.[49]

The feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True's biography _American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story_:

According to the book, True said upon hearing a tape of Leary's album _No Cure for Cancer_, "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and _recorded_ it."[50]

In a 2008 appearance on _The Opie and Anthony Show_, comedian Louis CK claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.[51] On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.[52]

Autism

In his 2008 book _Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid_, Leary wrote:

In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.[53][54]
