The aquatic reserve covers the extent of the Barker Inlet located to the south of the St Kilda boat channel as well as two natural channels, the Angas Inlet and the east part of the North Arm, and land subject to tidal inundation on the east side of Torrens Island, all sides of Garden Island and in the suburbs of Gillman, Dry Creek, Bolivar and St Kilda (from west to east). It is bounded to its immediate north by the St Kilda – Chapman Creek Aquatic Reserve.[3][4][5]
