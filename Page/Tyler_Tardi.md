Junior career

Tardi first came onto the national curling scene skipping the host British Columbia team at the 2015 Canada Winter Games in Prince George, British Columbia where he would pick up a bronze medal. After losing in the British Columbia junior finals in both 2013 and 2014, Tardi and his rink of Daniel Wenzek, brother[4] Jordan, Nicholas Meister, and Sterling Middleton won the 2016 British Columbia men's junior championship. The team represented the province at the 2016 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, and went 7-3 after the round robin portion, making the playoffs in third place. The team would have to settle for a bronze medal after they lost to Manitoba's Matt Dunstone in the semi-final.

A month later, Tardi would throw third stones (Joined by teammate Sterling Middleton, and Mary Fay and Karlee Burgess of Nova Scotia) for Team Canada at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The team steamrolled through the opposition, winning all 10 of their games before claiming a gold medal for their country. In the mixed doubles event, Tardi was teamed up with Japan's Honoka Sasaki. The pair made it to the semi-finals before losing to China's Han Su and Great Britain's Ross Whyte. They then lost in the bronze medal final to China's Zhao Ruiyi and Norway's Andreas Hårstad.

Tardi and his team of Middleton, Jordan Tardi, and Meister won a second provincial junior title in 2017. Representing British Columbia at the 2017 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, the team lost one round robin game en route to winning the national championship, defeating Ontario's Matthew Hall rink in the final. The team represented Canada at the 2017 World Junior Curling Championships, where they finished the round robin with a 6-3 record, but lost to Norway in a tiebreaker game. That year, Tardi also skipped British Columbia at the 2017 Canadian U18 Curling Championships, losing just round robin game. However, he was not successful in the playoffs, losing in the semifinal.

In 2018, Tardi, Middleton, Jordan and new lead Zac Curtis won a third provincial junior title. At the 2018 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, Tardi would defend his title. After losing three round robin games, he had to fight through a tiebreaker before winning two playoff games, including defeating Northern Ontario's Tanner Horgan rink in the final. The team represented Canada at the 2018 World Junior Curling Championships, where they were much more successful. The team lost two round robin games, and won both playoff games, including defeating Scotland in the final to claim the gold medal.


Mixed doubles career

In addition to playing in the mixed doubles event at the 2016 Youth Olympics, Tardi has also won two BC mixed doubles championships (2013 and 2015) with Dezaray Hawes. The pair would go 4-3 at both the 2013 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Trials and 2015 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Trials. In 2015, their record was good enough to make it to the playoffs, where they lost in the round of 12 to Glenn Howard and daughter Carly. They also competed in the 2019 Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, where they were first in their round-robin pool, but lost in the quarterfinal to Kadriana Sahaidak and Colton Lott.
