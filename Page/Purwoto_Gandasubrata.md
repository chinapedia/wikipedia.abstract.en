PURWOTO GANDASUBRATA was the eighth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia. Alongside the Ministry of Justice officials in the Sixth Development Cabinet, Gandasubrata was a part of a general return of civilian officials to the judiciary of Indonesia in the early 1990s after a period of former military officials dominating the branch from the late 1970s.[1] Gandasubrata had initially served as the chief of the district court of Semarang, as well as the chairman of the regional branch of the Indonesian Judges Association.[2]

Gandasubrata was the first Chief Justice appointed from the professional judiciary since Umar Seno Aji.[3] During his two years in the position, much of his efforts were spent on attempts to increase the autonomy, power, and status of the judicial branch of government.[4] On the occasion of his retirement in 1994, Gandasubrata announced a 100% salary increase for Indonesian judges in a move that was seen as a parting gift.[5] The increase was later offset by a 45% reduction in benefits enacted by the government.[6]
