Initially constituted on 1 July 1968, the 159th Aviation Battalion served in the Regular Army as Company B and a part of the 101st Airborne Division while it served in Vietnam. It was reorganized and redesignated on 16 November 1987 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2d Battalion, 159th Aviation.
