_THE THIRD NERO: OR NEVER SAY NERO AGAIN_ is a historical novel by British writer Lindsey Davis, the fifth in her Flavia Albia series. It was first published in the UK on 6 April 2017 by Hodder & Stoughton () and in the United States in 2017 by St. Martin's Press.[1][2]

The tale is set in Ancient Rome and opens in September AD 89, immediately after the previous novel _The Graveyard of the Hesperides_ closes (Flavia's husband having been struck by lightning during their wedding celebration).[3]

The story revolves around the third Pseudo-Nero, who had the support of the Parthians. Falco and Helena, Albia's adoptive parents, are mentioned but do not appear. The plot also involves a vicious white cat, a war elephant, a military archive, cataphracts and several references to public toilets including "the event which would supersede everything else when the _Daily Gazette_ wrote up today's events".[4]

The UK paperback cover image is of a two-faced Janus head from Vulci.[5]
