History

In August 2012, master brewer Scott Freitas resigned as the Head Brewer at the Maui Brewing Co in Hawaii to open a brewing company in Portage, Michigan.[6][7] With more than 20 years of brewing experience, Scott and co-founders Todd Neumann and Joe Stoddard designed and built the 11000 square foot Brewery and Restaurant. The Brewery was called Latitude 42 due to the geographical location of the brewery on the latitude line of 42 degrees and Scott hopes to open more breweries along this specific latitude line. The brewery opened in August 2013 with a menu of 14 beers[8] and now has brewed, distributed and served more than 57 varieties of beer to date. Some varieties of their beer are available in cans.[9]

In 2016, Latitude 42 Brewing Company won a Can Can award, which is an international beer competition focused on canned beers from the US and Canada. Latitude 42 won first place in the American Style Indian Pale Ale category with their I.P.EH! beer.[10]
