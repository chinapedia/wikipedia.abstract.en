The ROSS MEMORIAL CHURCH is a Uniting Church building on Hay Street in West Perth, Western Australia.


History

It is named after Reverend Daniel Ross, who was minister of the church from its inception until his death in 1917. It was completed in 1917 at a total construction cost of £4,147.

The architect for the project was James Hine, FRIBA, and the building contractor was R. A. Gamble. It was built in the Federation Gothic revival style.[1] The church contains a pipe organ chamber with case, and display pipes arranged in 3 towers.[2]

Senator Agnes Robertson was a longtime member of the church, teaching the girls' Bible class and becoming one of the first women to serve as a lay preacher.[3]

Heritage trail

   
    The West Perth Presbyterian Church was first 
    established in Havelock Street in 1898.  However, as the 
    congregation swelled during the gold boom years of the 
    1890s and early 1900s, it was found to be too small.  
    The Ross Memorial Church was built during the First 
    World War (1914 - 18), largely as a result of the efforts of 
    the Reverend Ross, who died only a few months after its 
    completion in 1917.
   


Present day

As well as services, the church is used for community functions and weddings.

The church is currently the home of the Wesley worshipping community of the Uniting Church in the City, part of the Uniting Church in Australia

It is currently listed with the Heritage Council of Western Australia, as Heritage Place No. 2235.[4]
