The EUPHRATES TUNNEL was allegedly a tunnel which was built under the Euphrates river to connect the two halves of the city of Babylon, in the old Mesopotamia.[1]

Archaeologists believe it was built between 2180 and 2160 BCE.[2]

No other sub-aqueous pedestrian tunnel was attempted until Marc Brunel built the Thames Tunnel beginning in 1824 CE.[3]


Characteristics

Construction allegedly began with a temporary dam across the Euphrates river, and proceeded using a "cut and cover" technique.[4]

The tunnel allegedly spanned 12 feet high and 15 feet wide,[5] it is presumed that it was used by pedestrians and horse driven chariots and connected a major temple with the royal palace on the other shore of the river,[6] it was supposedly lined with brick and waterproofed with asphalt.[7][8]

Descriptions

A description of the tunnel as being built and used by Queen Semiramis is given by Diodorus (fl. 50 BCE) in the _Bibliotheca Historica_:[9]

Philostratus (d. 250 CE) also describes the tunnel's construction in the _Life of Apollonius of Tyana_:[10][11]
