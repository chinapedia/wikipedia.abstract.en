_ESTUDIS FRANCISCANS_ or _ESTUDIOS FRANCISCANOS_ (Franciscan Studies), is a review about church and Franciscan studies, which was founded, with an apologetic aim, by Miquel d'Esplugues in 1907. It ceased to be published in 1936 and it was published again since 1948. Nowadays it is a scientific media of research of all the Capuchin provinces of Spain and Portugal. It publishes articles in all the languages that are spoken in the Iberian Peninsula.

This review, which was born in Catalonia, is nowadays the main review with research and scientific articles[1] from the provinces that form the Capuchin Iberic Conference (C.I.C.). The CIC is the owner of the review, but the headquarters are located in Catalonia.[2]
