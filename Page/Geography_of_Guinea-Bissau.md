Terrain and ecology

Guinea-Bissau_Topography.png

The terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east.[1]

The lowest point on Guinea-Bissau is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean.[2] The highest point on Guinea-Bissau is 300 metres above sea level at an unnamed location in the eastern part of the country.[3]

Natural resources found in Guinea-Bissau include fish, timber, phosphates, bauxite, clay, granite, limestone and unexploited deposits of petroleum.[4] 10.67% of the land is arable and 235.6 square kilometres is irrigated.[5]

Natural hazards include a hot, dry, dusty harmattan haze that may reduce visibility during the dry season and brush fires.[6] Severe environmental issues include deforestation; soil erosion; overgrazing and overfishing.[7]

Near the Senegal border there have been historic sightings of the painted hunting dog, _Lycaon pictus_, but that endangered canid may now be extirpated in that locale.[8]


Climate

Guinea-Bissau's climate is tropical. This means it is generally hot and humid. It has a monsoonal-type rainy season (June to November) with southwesterly winds and a dry season (December to May) with northeasterly harmattan winds.[9]

From December through April, the country receives very little rainfall.
