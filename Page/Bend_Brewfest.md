BbfcirclelogoWEB.jpg BEND BREWFEST is a three-day beer festival held each August in Bend, Oregon, which features popular and rare beers from regional breweries.[1] The event is Central Oregon's largest beer festival[2] and is held in the Old Mill District's Les Schwab Amphitheater, which has been nationally recognized as a leading outdoor venue.[3][4] Founded in 2002, the annual festival hosts several regional breweries and features close to 200 craft beverages. [5]

The Bend Brewfest has become a notable part of the burgeoning beer culture in Bend, which has one of the highest levels of breweries per capita in the nation [6] and has been referred to as one of the top beer towns in the nation or BeerTown USA.[7] The festival is noted as one of the top draws for the town in many national articles.[8] Each year, the growing festival welcomes approximately 40,000 through its gates.[9]

The festival benefits local charities each year, such as NeighborImpact, a Central Oregon non-profit organization that helps individuals and families access resources in times of need.[10]
