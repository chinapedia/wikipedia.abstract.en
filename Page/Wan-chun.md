_WAN-CHUN_ (or _WANJUN_) is a 1990 Taiwanese television series produced by Ping Hsin-tao and his company Yi Ren Communications Co. (怡人傳播公司) in conjunction with Chinese Television System, based on Chiung Yao's (Ping's wife) 1964 novellette _Wan-chun's Three Loves_, which is set in Republican era Beijing.

This is the first Taiwanese TV series filmed in mainland China, and as such suffered from red tape by Taiwan's Government Information Office. Despite receiving prior approval, the production was accused of "cooperating with Chinese communists", "receiving mainland funds", and "featuring mainland actors in excess" (even though most actors were from Taiwan). Chiung Yao refused to comply with censorship demands to delete scenes that "featured mainland actors in excess", and only after the interventions of politician Jaw Shaw-kong was the series allowed to air. (Chiung Yao and Ping Hsin-tao's company was however fined for several violations.)[1]
