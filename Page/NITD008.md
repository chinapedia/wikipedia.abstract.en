NITD008 is an antiviral drug, an adenosine analog (a type of nucleoside analog). It was developed as a potential treatment for flavivirus infections, and shows broad spectrum antiviral activity against many related viruses such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Powassan virus, hepatitis C virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus and Zika virus.[1][2][3] However, NITD008 proved too toxic in pre-clinical animal testing to be suitable for human trials, but it continues to be used in research to find improved treatments for emerging viral diseases.[4]
