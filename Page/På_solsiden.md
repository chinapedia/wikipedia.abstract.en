Plot

On a warm summer day, the writer Joachim Bris comes to the Riibe estate. He has been invited by Hartvig, the son running the farm. However, not everyone is happy with the visit, which has unexpected consequences for several people in the family. All of them have a part to play when Esther must eventually have a big showdown with those that have always lived "on the sunny side."
