Recognition

William Speirs Bruce named the meteorological station in Scotia Bay on Laurie Island OMOND HOUSE in recognition of him, during his Antarctic expedition of 1902.[4] The building was officially opened on 1 April 1903 and was manned by Robert Mossman until 1905. The British government declined to accept responsibility for the long term maintenance and operation of the weather station and in was instead passed to the government of Argentina in 1906.[5]
