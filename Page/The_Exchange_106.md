THE EXCHANGE 106 (formerly TRX Signature Tower) is a skyscraper under construction within the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) area, a new financial district currently being developed in Kuala Lumpur. The 106-floor building is topped with a 65-meter, 12-storey high illuminated crown making it tall.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The tower will have a net lettable area of [9][10] and is benchmarked against similar buildings in large international financial centers, such as London's Canary Wharf and The Shard, New York's Freedom Tower, and Shanghai IFC[11]

As of January 2018, more than half of the Exchange 106's floor space has been taken up by large tenants, predominantly local financial institutions, each taking up between 2 and 8 floors, which have column-less floor plates ranging from .[12]


Proposal and development

The skyscraper was first conceptualised when TRX was controlled by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund owned by the Malaysian government. On 13 May 2015, 1MDB Real Estate Sdn Bhd (1MDB RE), the master developer of TRX, and the Mulia Group announced that, through Mulia Property Development Sdn Bhd, they had signed a Sale and Purchase agreement for the development rights of the plot of land for the Exchange 106 (then known as the Signature Tower), with the land transacted at a value of RM665 million.[13] Ground work on the Exchange 106 plot commenced on 1 March 2016, with the mat concrete foundation laid in May 2016 (see "Progress" section below).[14]

0n 21 December 2016, whilst construction of the Exchange 106 was well in progress, the Second Finance Minister Johari Abdul Ghani said the Ministry of Finance had taken over the whole of 1MDB's TRX project itself, as part of its attempt to address the fund's unsustainable debt and restructure the company's management.[15] 1MDB was unable to develop TRX smoothly and on time as it was mired in various allegations of corruption and financial abuses.[16]

Subsequently, in July 2017, the Minister of Finance Inc, through its unit MKD Signature Sdn Bhd, acquired a 51% majority stake in Mulia Property Development Sdn Bhd for the joint development of the Exchange 106 with the Mulia Group, with the actual construction costs to be borne by the two parties based on their shareholding percentages in Mulia Property Development Sdn Bhd. MKD obtained a standby line of credit from HSBC to finance its 51% share of the actual construction costs. The MOF Inc said that its participation in the development of the Exchange 106 was agreed at the onset to only materialise when the project had reached a certain development milestone.[17][18][19]

When completed, the skyscraper will be the tallest building in Malaysia, until the completion of the Merdeka PNB 118, which is being developed by one of Malaysia's largest fund manager, Permodalan Nasional Berhad.[20] The Exchange 106 will also be the first ever South East Asian skyscraper to have more than 100 storeys. The Exchange 106 will have a total land area of 148,896 square feet and will feature 106 floors and six basement levels.[21]


Progress

The main contractor for this project is China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation and this building will be the tallest building built by a PRC construction company outside of China.[22] Exchange_106.png

In May 2016, the tower's foundation concrete pour took place over a weekend, and was the second largest continuous concrete pour in the world.[23] Construction of the tower broke the local construction speed record by having completed a single floor in only two days at its peak.[24] In December 2017, the structure was recorded at 450 meters above ground,[25] close to surpassing the Petronas Twin Towers and taking the title of tallest building in Malaysia and South East Asia.[26] Recently the Malaysian government agreed to inject RM2.8 billion into the Tun Razak Exchange (of which The Exchange 106 is a part) in order to complete the project after discovering money was misappropriated to pay the debts of 1Malaysia Development Berhad.[27]

The construction of the TRX's shopping mall (called The Exchange) which is located at the foot of the Exchange 106 is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2021.The_Exchange,_TRX_Kuala_Lumpur.png [28]
