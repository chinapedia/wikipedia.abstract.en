The EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION SELECT COMMITTEE is one of a number of select committees of the British House of Commons, which scrutinises the work of the Department for Exiting the European Union. The Department was launched by Prime Minister Theresa May in July 2016, following the 'Leave' vote in the UK's referendum on membership of the European Union.[1]

In November 2017 Parliament voted that a humble address be made to the monarch to direct the government to release its impact assessments regarding the effects of Brexit on the national economy.[2]

The motion, put forward by the opposition, requested:

    _That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, That she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the list of sectors analysed under the instruction of Her Majesty's Ministers, and referred to in the Answer of 26 June 2017 to Question 239, be laid before this House and that the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union._[3]


Membership

On 19 October 2016, Hilary Benn was elected as the first chairman of the committee.[4] Labour MPs voted for their remaining four representatives from a shortlist on 25 October.[5] The Conservatives selected their representatives on 26 October.[6] The remaining members were published in the House of Commons Order Paper for 27 October, except the SDLP's choice.[7] After the 2017 general election another committee election was held Hilary Benn being re-elected as chair and members announced on 8 September 2017 due to be approved by the House of Commons on 11 September 2017.[8][9] Of the committee 13 backed the remain campaign and 7 backed the leave campaign.
