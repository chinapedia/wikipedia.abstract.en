VAGEATA, also known as VAGEATENSIS,[1] was a Roman-Berber town in the province of Mauretania Caesariensis.[2] It is also known as BAGATENSIS,[3] and epigraphical evidence remains attesting to this etymology,[4][5][6] due to the interchange of 'v' for 'b' is a common phenomenon in Latin and Greek place names.

The city has been identified with ruins at El-Haria, located east of Cirta en route to Thibilis.[7] It was mentioned by Optatus of Milevis, in Numidia.[8]


Bishopric

The city was also a seat of an ancient bishopric though only two bishops are known to history. Donatus of Vageaensis was known from the Council of Carthage (411).[9][10]

Fulgentius (Catholic bishop) fl.484 was exiled by Vandal king Huneric in 484AD. Richard Oliver Gerow of Natchez-Jackson was bishop in the 1970s. Long-term bishop Franz Xaver Schwarzenböck(1972-2010) [11] was then succeeded by Wieslaw Szlachetka, who has been bishop since December 21, 2013.[12]
