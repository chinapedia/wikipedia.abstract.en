1,1,1,2-TETRAFLUORODISULFANE, also known as 1,2-DIFLUORODISULFANE 1,1-DIFLUORIDE or just DIFLUORODISULFANEDIFLUORIDE (FSSF₃) is an unstable molecular compound of fluorine and sulfur. The molecule has a pair of sulfur atoms, with one fluorine atom on one sulfur, and three fluorine atoms on the other. It has the uncommon property that all the bond lengths are different.[1] The bond strength is not correlated with bond length but is inversely correlated with the force constant (Badger's rule).[2] The molecule can be considered as sulfur tetrafluoride in which a sulfur atom is inserted into a S-F bond.[3]

Atoms are labelled with the sulfur atom connected to three fluorine atoms as S_(_hyp_) (for hypervalent) and S_(_top_). The fluorine atoms are labelled F_(_top_) attached to S_(_top_), and on the hypervalent S atom: F_(_cis_), the closest F atom to F_(_top_), F_(_trans_) the furthest away F atom from F_(_top_), and F_(_eq_)[4]

Carlowitz first determined the structure in 1983.[5]

F_(_eq_) is 90° from F_(_trans_), and 84° from F_(_cis_), and the torsion compared to F_(_top_) is about 95°.[9]


Reactions

The dimerization reaction 2SF₂ FSSF₃ is reversible.[10] It also disproportionates: SF₂ + FSSF₃ → FSSF + SF₄.[11] A side reaction also produces the intermediate F₃SSSF₃.[12] hydrogen fluoride catalyses disproportionation to sulfur and sulfur tetrafluoride by forming a reactive intermediate HSF molecule.[13] When FSSF₃ dissociates, the F_(_cis_) atom forms a new bond to the S_(_top_) atom, and the S-S bond breaks.[14] As a gas, at ambient and totally clean conditions, FSSF₃ decomposes with a half life of about 10 hours. Disproportionation to SSF₂ and SF₄ catalysed by metal fluorides can take place in under one second. However it is indefinitely stable at -196 °C.[15]

A symmetrical molecule F₂SSF₂ is calculated to be 15.1 kcal/mol higher in energy than FSSF₃.[16]

FSSF₃ is easily hydrolysed with water.[17]

FSSF₃ spontaneously reacts with oxygen gas to make thionyl fluoride, the only sulfur fluoride that does not need any assistance to do this.[18] FSSF₃ reacts with copper at high temperatures producing copper fluoride and copper sulfide.[19]


Formation

SF₃SF can be made in the laboratory when low pressure (10mm) SCl₂ vapour is passed over potassium fluoride or mercuric fluoride heated to 150 °C. Byproducts include FSSF, SSF₂, SF₄, SF₃SCl, and FSSCl.[20] SF₃SCl can be removed from this mixture in a reaction with mercury.[21] Separation of the sulfur fluorides can be achieved by low temperature distillation. SF₃SF distills just above -50 °C.[22]

SF₃SF is also made in small amounts by reacting sulfur with silver fluoride, or photolysis of disulfur difluoride and SSF₂.[23] The molecule is formed by the dimerization of sulfur difluoride.[24]


Properties

The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of FSSF₃ shows four bands, each of eight lines at -53.2, -5.7, 26.3 and 204.1 ppm.[25]

FSSF₃ is stable as a solid, as a liquid below -74 °C and dissolved in other sulfur fluoride liquids.[26] This is in contrast to SF₂ which is only stable as a dilute gas.[27]

Infrared vibration bands for FSSF₃ are at 810, 678, 530, 725, and 618(S-S) cm^(−1).[28]


Related

The related compound FSSSF₃ has a similar structure, but with an extra sulfur atom in the chain. Thiothionyltetrafluoride, S=SF₄ may exist as a gas. It is less energetically favourable to FSSF₃ by 37 kJ/mol, but has a high energy barrier of 267 kJ/mol.[29] However it may disproportionate rapidly to sulfur and sulfur tetrafluoride.[30] The other known sulfur fluorides are sulfur difluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, sulfur hexafluoride, disulfur decafluoride, disulfur difluoride and 1,1-difluorodisulfane, difluorotrisulfane, and difluorotetrasulfane.[31] The F_(_top_) atom can be substituted with Cl to yield ClSSF₃ (2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluorodisulfane).[32]
