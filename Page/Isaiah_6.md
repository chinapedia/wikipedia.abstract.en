Textual witnesses

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew language:

-   Masoretic Text (10th century)
-   Dead Sea Scrolls:
    -   1QIsa^(a): complete[2]
    -   4QIsa^(a) (4Q55): extant: verses 4-7
    -   4QIsa^(f) (4Q60): extant: verses 3‚Äë8, 10‚Äë13

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; ùîä^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: ùîä^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; ùîä^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; ùîä^(Q); 6th century).


Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[3] Isaiah 6 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12)_. {P}: open _parashah_.

    {P} 6:1-13 {P}

In Jewish Worship, the entire Isaiah 6 is part of the prophetic reading (Haftarah) on the Sabbath when Parasha Ytro, which includes the Ten Commandments, is read from the Torah.


Verse 1

    _In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple._[4]

Cross reference: The date of the death of Uzziah has been estimated as around 740 BCE.[5][6] Archaeologist William F. Albright dated Uzziah's reign to 783 ‚Äì 742 BCE.[7]


Verse 2

Octavian_Smigelschi_-_Serafim_(Cat._Blaj),_1903.png]]

    _Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew._[8]

-   "Seraphim": described here as the 'messengers in the divine council', but has no real biblical parallel. The root word _≈õ-r-p_, for Seraph, gives a portrayal of the 'burning ones'.


Verse 3

    _And one called to another and said:_

        _"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;_
        _the whole earth is full of his glory!"_[9]

This verse is repeated several times in daily Jewish services, including the Kedushah prayer during the repetition of the Amidah, and is part of the Sanctus in Christian Eucharistic Prayer.


Verse 8

    _Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,_

        _Whom shall I send,_
        _and who will go for us?_

    _Then said I,_

        _Here am I; send me._[10]

-   "Us": the plural form refers to 'the entire divine assembly'.
-   "Here am I; send me": This declaration is remarkable because it is in contrast to the despair Isaiah said in and for the fact that his human voice is heard in the heavenly court (cf. ; ).


Verse 13

    _"But yet a tenth will be in it,_
    _And will return and be for consuming,_
    _As a terebinth tree or as an oak,_
    _Whose stump remains when it is cut down._
    _So the holy seed shall be its stump."_[11]

Cross reference: Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 53:2; Jeremiah 23:5
