BABA BUDDHA JI (6 October 1506 â€“ 8 September 1631) was a prime figure in early Sikhism. He was one of the earliest disciples of Guru Nanak. He performed the formal coronation ceremonies of five Sikh gurus, till Guru Hargobind. It is said that in his childhood, he was blessed with a long life by Guru Nanak, who called him Buddha (old man) after he was amused by his mature queries related to spirituality.[1][2]
