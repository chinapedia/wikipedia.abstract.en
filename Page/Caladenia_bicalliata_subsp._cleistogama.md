_CALADENIA BICALLIATA_ SUBSP. _CLEISTOGAMA_, commonly known as the SHY LIMESTONE SPIDER ORCHID or SANDHILL SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is native to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers which are smaller than those in subspecies _bacalliata_ .


Description

_Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _cleistogama_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which occurs singly or in small clumps. It has a single erect, very hairy, linear to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with one or two flowers, each flower about long and wide. The dorsal sepal abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are much shorter than those of subspecies _bicalliata_, lack reddish-brown tips and are a paler greenish-cream colour. The labellum is white with red spots and a serrated edge and has two rows of white-tipped calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early September, however the flowers only rarely open fully.[1][2]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia bicalliata_ was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909.[3] In 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies _cleistogama_ and the description of the two subspecies was published in _Nuytsia_.[4] The specific epithet (_cleistogama_) is from the Latin _cleistogamus_ (fertilised within the unopened flower), referring to the self-pollinating habit of this subspecies.[5]


Distribution and habitat

Shy limestone spider orchid occurs in a narrow coastal strip, growing on consolidated sand dunes between William Bay National Park and Cape Arid National Park in the Esperance Plains and Warren biogeographic regions.[6][7]


Conservation

_Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _cleistogama_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[8]
