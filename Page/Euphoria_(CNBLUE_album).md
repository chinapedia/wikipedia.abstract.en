Background

CNBLUE announced _Euphoria_ as its fifth studio album on the September 5, 2016 broadcast of Abema TV's _Fresh!_, with a release date of October 19.[1] The date marks the five-year anniversary since the band's major-label debut in Japan with "In My Head".[2] The album serves as the gratitude the band holds for its fans since then.[3]


Music structure

In "Glory Days", CNBLUE expresses gratitude towards its fans.[4] The lyrics encourage one to "keep going on despite being lost on the path".[5] Dealing with the future, "Take Me Higher" conveys the band's sentiment of exceeding its potential.[6][7] Drummer Kang Min-hyuk described "Face to Face" as "good rhythmic song" and compared it to previously released songs "With Me" (_Code Name Blue_) and "Don't Care" (_What Turns You On?_).[8] "Puzzle" is a wedding-themed song that revolves around "eternal love".[9] "Royal Rumble" compromises a "rhythmical tone" and deals with "the next stop" for the band.[10] The song revolves around the battle royals depicted in the professional wrestling organization WWE. Frontman Jung Yong-hwa described it as a general idea, in which he remarked, "anyone has to keep fighting, right?".[11] Similar to "Daisy" (_Colors_), "Stay with Me" shows the band's thankfulness to its fans.[12]

In an interview with EMTG Music, the interviewer noted the positivity in the _Euphoria_ singles, in contrast to singles released in the years prior which dealt with "conflicts and anxiety". In response, Jung stated: "When you listen to positive music, it makes you feel good, right? Now I wish more that you would listen to our music and become happy. Before, when something doesn’t work out the way I want, I would turn that into a song. Now, it also plays a big part that I have a very happy environment when making music."[13]
