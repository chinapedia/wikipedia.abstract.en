THE GUNGA DIN was an American rock band, formed in 1998 in New York City. Featuring vocalist Siobhan Duffy, guitarist/vocalist Bill Bronson, bassist Chris Pravdica, drummer Jim Sclavunos, and keyboardist Maria Zastrow, the band released two albums, _Introducing: The Gunga Gin_ and _Glitterati_, in 1999 and 2000, respectively.[1] Its members came from a diverse musical background, playing in the bands such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Swans, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.[2]

Described as a "New York-style art rock band,"[3] The Gunga Din combined a Farfisa organ and psychedelic music-inspired drumming.[4] Its debut album was described as "an equal blend of post-punk and new wave" with occasional psychobilly influences[5] and was compared to the works of the bands such as the Doors, X and Suicide.[6] The band's second studio album also drew comparisons to the works of PJ Harvey and The Velvet Underground.[7]
