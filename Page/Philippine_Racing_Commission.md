The PHILIPPINE RACING COMMISSION (), abbreviated as PHILRACOM, is a government agency under the Office of the President that functions as the supervisory and regulating body of horse racing in the Philippines. The agency was established in March 20, 1974 through Presidential Decree No. 420 signed by then President Ferdinand Marcos.[1]

Under Sec. 1 of PD 420, it is the Commission's mandate to "promote and direct the accelerated development and continued growth of horse racing not only in pursuance of the sports development program but also in order to ensure the full exploitation of the sport as a source of revenue and employment".

Under Sec. 3 of PD 420, the Commission's aims and objectives are: a. To promote, ensure, and maintain efficient and unbiased operation of racing, exclusive of the supervision of betting therein; b. To raise public confidence in the sport and to minimize infractions of the rules of racing; and c. To improve the breed of Philippine horses and to prevent illegal importation of race-horses.

The supervision and regulation of the betting aspect of horseracing is handled by the Games and Amusement Board. [2]

In April 2016, Philracom was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.[3][4]


History

HORSE RACING IN THE PHILIPPINES The sport as practiced in the country is flat racing on dirt; there are no turf tracks in the Philippines.

Horse racing in the Philippines had its origins during the Spanish colonial era. For a decade in the late 1860s to 1870s, members of prominent families held “fun runs”, racing Philippine ponies on a quarter-mile (400 meters) straight course from San Sebastian Church to Quiapo Church. Organized purely for recreation, there was no official betting on these races. The races were held only once a year, in April or May, with tokens such as gold and silver medals, watches, or other ornaments as the prizes. [5]

Racing in the Philippines had its formal start with the establishment of the Manila Jockey Club in 1867 by 100 socio fundadores, members of prominent and affluent Spanish, Filipino, and English families of the time. The club's first racetrack was in Sta. Mesa. A more permanent structure. the San Lazaro Hippodrome, was built in Tayuman, Manila, where it stayed for decades until the track was transferred in 2003 to Carmona, Cavite, where it is now called the San Lazaro Leisure Park. [6]

In 1937, the Philippine Racing Club was founded by a group of Filipino and American investors. Their racetrack was Santa Ana Park, located at the boundary of Makati City and Manila. The track was moved to Naic, Cavite in January 2009, where it is now located within Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park.

In 2013, horseowner Dr Norberto Quisumbing Jr. established Metro Manila Turf Club, Inc. in Malvar, Batangas.

ESTABLISHMENT OF PHILRACOM Republic Act No. 309, An Act to Regulate Horse Racing in the Philippines, was promulgated in 1948. It established the Commission on Races which was mandated to supervise and regulate the sport. [7]

In 1950, Executive Order No. 392 signed by then-president Elpidio Quirino created the Games and Amusements Board (GAB). The duties and functions of the Commission on Racing as well as the Boxing and Wrestling Commission and "the Jai-Alai" [sic] were transferred to the newly-created GAB. [8]

Philracom was founded in 1974 to handle the growing Philippine Thoroughbred industry, which not only included racing among its activities but also breeding. Horses and feeds were increasingly being imported from abroad, and the Philracom regulated related processes and procedures.

The duties and functions related to horse racing that had been with GAB were transferred to Philracom, except for supervision and regulation of betting which was a function retained by GAB as provided for in Sections 6, 11, 15, 18 and 24 of Republic Act No. 309, and by PD 420. [9]

The agency also implemented greater supervision over the conduct of the sport and wagering system, instituting live broadcast coverage of the races, photo patrol cameras, and other innovations of the time that protected the interest of the betting public.


Leadership

The Commission is presently composed of one chairman and six commissioners. All are appointive positions. Each commissioner represents a sector of the horse racing industry - horseowners, jockeys, trainers, and the racing public.

Programs

PHILRACOM TRAINERS ACADEMY [13] In 2015 the Commission, in order to professionalize the horse training sector, established the Philracom Trainers' Academy. It offers a two-year course for horse trainers. The Academy's administrators are veterinarians Dr. Ceferino Maala, member of the National Academy of Science and Technology, and Dr. Romy Modomo, equine medicine practitioner.

In 2017, the Academy graduated its first cohort of trainers, which took the batch name 'First Impact'. Among their members are trainers Dr. Grace Sandoval and Dewey Santos. A second round of training will be opened in April 2019.

The Academy is structured upon the 'educational cohort model', defined as "purposefully grouped students entering and pursuing a program of study together, characterized by social and cultural processes, shared experiences and interactions, collective efforts, and mutual commitment to an educational goal" (Horn, 2001; Maher, 2001, 2005; McPhail, 2000; Norris & Barnett, 1994; Yerkes, Basom, Barnett, & Norris, 1995). Specifically, the Academy follows the 'closed-cohort format', where students are "admitted as an identified group, and provided with a specific rotation of courses over a defined period of time" (Barnett & Muse, 1993; Maher, 2001, 2005). [14]

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM [15] Philracom also sponsors charity races for qualified beneficiaries, wherein the prize of the day is donated to the chosen recipient. The agency also holds regular medical and dental missions for the racing community, blood-letting sessions in cooperation with the Red Cross (national), tree-plantings, clothes donations drives, and other initiatives.

SPONSORED STAKES RACES The Commission regularly sponsors stakes races that provide prize money higher than the usual prize of the day. Among its important annual events are the Commissioner's Cup, the Philippine Triple Crown series (held in summer), Lakambini Stakes (for 3YO fillies), the Ambassador Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr. Cup (also known as the ECJ Cup), Grand Sprint Championship, and the Chairman's Cup.
