KÄRSTIN EHRNLUND (born 10 February 1959 in Karlstad) is a Swedish professional golfer.

Ehrnlund was a pioneer of professional golf in Sweden. She was the first Swedish woman to join a professional golf tour and the first Swede to record a victory on an international tour. After winning the Swedish Championship in 1977 and 1978 she turned professional on the nascent Women's Professional Golf Association (WPGA) Tour, later renamed Ladies European Tour. In August 1980 Ehrnlund played the Welsh Classic at Whitchurch Golf Club in Cardiff. She was in the lead after two rounds with 68–74, and after the last round was cancelled due to rain she was declared the winner. Four years later she won another Ladies European Tour title, the United Friendly Tournament at two-time Ryder Cup-venue Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club near Liverpool.[1] Ove Sellberg became the first Swede to record a victory on the European Tour in 1986.
