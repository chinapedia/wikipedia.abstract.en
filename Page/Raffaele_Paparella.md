RAFFAELE PAPARELLA (26 December 1915 â€“ 11 November 2001) was an Italian comic artist and illustrator.


Life and career

Born in Carmagnola, after getting a teaching diploma Paparella worked two years as a school teacher. In 1937 he began collaborating with the magazine _Il Vittorioso_ and with several Mondadori publications as an illustrator.[1][2]

Paparella debuted as a comic artist in 1940, drawing Gian Luigi Bonelli's stories "Il terrore del colorado" and "I tre gigli", both published in _Il Vittorioso_.[3] In 1948 he collaborated with Federico Pedrocchi for the _Topolino_'s story _La compagnia dei sette_, and illustrated the comic adaptations of several Emilio Salgari's novels which were published in the magazine _Salgari_.[4][5] In 1949 he created with Guido Martina his major success, the popular western series _Pecos Bill_, and in 1952 the adventure series _Oklahoma_.[6][7]

Following the end of the _Pecos Bill_ series, Paparella collaborated with the publisher Edizioni Araldo, and from the second half of the 1960s, with the French publishing house Lug. Starting from the late 1970s, he abandoned comics, focusing on satirical cartoons and illustrations.[8][9]
