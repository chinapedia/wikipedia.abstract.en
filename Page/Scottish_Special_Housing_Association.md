The SCOTTISH SPECIAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION was established in 1937 to provide good-quality social housing. It had headquarters in Edinburgh, where it employed a large team of architects, engineers and quantity surveyors.[1] It was responsible for the construction of many social housing estates. It was an early adopter of Computer Aided Architectural Design.[2]

Its chairman from 1968 to 1972 was Sir William Gray who went on to be Lord Provost of Glasgow.[3]

In 1989 it was abolished and some of its functions transferred to Scottish Homes. The 75,000 housing units were transferred to housing associations and co-operatives between 1990 and 2005.[4]
