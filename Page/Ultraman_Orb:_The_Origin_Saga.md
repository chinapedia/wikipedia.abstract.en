Meanwhile on Earth, two scientists Shohei and Yui discovered the Tree of Life's seed in an ancient temple 4,000 metres beneath Japan's sea level. As a result of touching the seed, Shohei was evolved, being able to contact Amate by the time her planet was under Psychi's invasion. The destruction of the Tree of Life caused said tree to grow on Earth as well, attracting Psychi's attention to go to said planet. After the series entered its second phase, the , Gai entered Earth under Amate's orders to help Shohei protect the Tree of Life as he was joined by Gamu Takayama and Hiroya Fujimiya (both are protagonists of _Ultraman Gaia_) into the battle.[7][8] When the Earth soldiers commenced their attacks on the Tree of Life, Amate stepped in and establish a contact with the until said monster sprung her trap to infect the War God. By this point, the Queen show its true colors by abandoning Psychi and plans to spread the Kugutsu towards the universe, resulting all life forms robbed of their free will and civilizations perish. Juggler interferes the battle again and rescued Ultraman Orb/Gai from the effects of Kugutsu under his own proxy to surpass the giants of light.

With the Queen perished by Juggler, Psychi made his final attempt by combining with her into and tries to destroy the Tree of Life. Gai joins his predecessors in the final battle while Shohei and Yui's will caused the Tree of Life's fruits to mature, allowing them to purify the War God and other Kugutsu victims. With all plan fails, Psyqueen tries to combine with the War God but the five Ultras open fire on the monster while Orb saved Psychi from his death. After being congratulated by his seniors, Gai visited the O-50 again where he received another mission, along with a black coloration added to Ultraman Orb, finally becoming Orb Origin.
