BRANDON DEL POZO (born 1974) is the chief of police in the city of Burlington, Vermont, United States. He assumed the position on September 1, 2015.[1] His appointment was contested by some locals due to his prior work with the New York Police Department (NYPD)[2] and an article about racial profiling he published in a peer-reviewed law journal in 2002.[3] After a public discussion of this work of scholarship and his views, his nomination was unanimously approved by the Burlington City Council.[4]

Prior to coming to Burlington, del Pozo served with the NYPD for nearly two decades, rising to the rank of deputy inspector. While there, he commanded the 6th and 50th Precincts,[5][6] and served overseas as an intelligence liaison to the Arab world and India (based in Jordan's capital, Amman), where he investigated terror attacks to see what lessons they offered for better protecting New York.[7][8] He has received recognition for his commitment to innovation and reform.[9]


Education

Born in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of the New York borough of Brooklyn to a Cuban father and Jewish mother,[10] del Pozo graduated from Stuyvesant High School[11] in New York then subsequently earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College.[12] He then earned a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.[13] While at the Kennedy School, he was a 9/11 Public Service Fellow, in recognition of the sacrifices made by first responders on that day.[14][15] He also holds master's degrees in Criminal Justice and Philosophy from John Jay College and the City University of New York Graduate Center, respectively.[16]


Career

Citing the challenges of policing in the United States,[17] del Pozo came to Burlington with a desire to improve police services in the city as a model for progress in the profession.[18] After a Burlington police officer killed Phil Grenon, a man who attacked the police with knives at the end of a prolonged standoff,[19] del Pozo began a program to improve outcomes in the use of force, piloting the Police Executive Research Forum's (PERF) new force guidelines and curriculum[20][21] and introducing new tactics and technologies that avert physical confrontations.[22] In January 2017, he travelled to Wisconsin with a small group of police chiefs to brief Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on PERF's efforts.[23]

Opioid abuse and dependency have been a concern for the city and its police in light of the state of Vermont's wider struggles with opioid addiction.[24][25] Burlington mayor Miro Weinberger directed del Pozo to create and implement a strategy[26] for addressing its effects that focuses on public health rather than law enforcement[27] and uses data and collaboration as cornerstones of the approach.[28] Shortly after taking on the leadership of the Burlington Police Department, del Pozo began a wide-ranging initiative.[29] He directed all patrol officers to carry Naloxone, the overdose reversal drug,[30] and assisted the mayor's office with the creation of the city's Opioid Policy Coordinator. Based out of the police department, the coordinator vets police work for better public health outcomes and assists the city in formulating policies, directives and public engagements to help free the city from the grip of opioid abuse.[31]

Del Pozo has been known to personally meet with and try to help members of the community suffering from addiction.[32] He has also been vocal about the need for all people suffering from opioid addiction to have prompt access to the medications proven to treat it,[33] including all prisoners,[34] and he adopted a policy where his department would not arrest people for unprescribed possession of buprenorphine.[35] Del Pozo serves on the board of trustees of the Howard Center, Vermont's largest addiction and mental health service provider.[36]

In 2018, as the rest of Vermont saw a 20% increase in opioid overdose deaths, Burlington's county saw a 50% decline in these deaths, to their lowest levels since 2013, when the state began keeping records.[37]

An advocate for greater transparency in policing and government, del Pozo created a police data transparency portal where he discloses a range of raw and processed data about the work of the Burlington Police under a quote by legal philosopher Jeremy Waldron: "In a democracy, the accountable agents of the people owe the people an account of what they have been doing, and a refusal to provide this is simple insolence."[38] He has spoken at the White House to an audience of police leaders on the value of the practice as part of efforts to implement the recommendations of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.[39] During his tenure, the police department has made concerted efforts to diversify its rank and file, with moderate success.[40]

Del Pozo frequently uses social media as a means of engagement and has used Facebook and Twitter to defend his officers from allegations of brutality and corruption that he asserts were unfounded.[41][42] He has also used it to national viral effect to raise awareness about the challenges of the opioid crisis.[43] It has raised questions about the use of these platforms in policing and government.[44]In April 2017, del Pozo took to Facebook criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions while defending the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (or JAG). He argued against the Trump Administration's immigration policy stating “I don’t care what a person’s immigration status is, I want them to call the police to report crimes in their neighborhood and not be scared of the consequences. We hold up our end of the deal by keeping routine immigration enforcement out of it.”[45]

In May 2016, the PERF awarded del Pozo its Gary Hayes Memorial Award for his innovation and leadership.[46] He is also an executive fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Police Foundation, a "national, independent non-profit organization dedicated to advancing policing through innovation and science."[47]_New York Times_ editor and book critic Dwight Garner characterized del Pozo as "thoughtful and sane."[48]

He is presently writing a book about police work for Farrar, Straus & Giroux.[49]


Personal life

Del Pozo married Sarah Carnevale in 2002.[50] They moved to Burlington from the village of Cold Spring, New York.[51] He wrote and directed a narrative short film, _Sunday 1287_,[52] which screened at the Middlebury and Vermont International Film Festivals.[53] The film was based on a crime he investigated while commanding a precinct in the New York borough of the Bronx. In 2018, he suffered multiple serious injuries in a bicycle accident, was evacuated to an intensive care unit by helicopter, and went on to recover and return to full duty in his role.[54] An outdoors enthusiast,[55] he has climbed New Hampshire's 48 highest mountains,[56] completed the Lake Placid Half Ironman and other triathlons, and written for publications about cycling and climbing.[57][58]
