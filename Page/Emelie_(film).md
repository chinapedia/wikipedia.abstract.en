Plot

A girl named Anna is supposed to be babysitting a family, but is kidnapped by Emelie and a man. Emelie then poses as Anna and enters the house of the kids she's supposed to be babysitting: 4-year-old Christopher, 9-year-old Sally, and 11-year-old Jacob.

Emelie exhibits several odd behaviors when the parents leave. She tells Sally not to smile when taking a picture of the kids in costumes. During a game of hide-and-seek, Emelie turns off the Internet modem, removes the laces from the kids' shoes, and breaks open the safe in the master bedroom. She calls Jacob to the bathroom and asks him for a new tampon, as she's on her period. He retrieves one for her. She makes him unwrap it, then inserts it in front of him, flushing blood down the toilet. In the restaurant, the children's parents, Dan and Joyce, are being watched by the man who helped kidnap Anna. Dan tells Joyce that he thinks he needs to have "the talk" with Jacob who is going through puberty. He implies that Jacob has been exploring adult content sites.

Emelie lets the children run wild, eating too many cookies and drawing on the walls. She feeds Sally's hamster to Jacob's python and forces Sally to watch. She shows Sally and Christopher a sex tape made by their parents. Jacob goes through Emelie's things and finds out that she's not actually Anna. He is horrified to see what Emelie has put on TV and turns it off, angering Emelie.

At bedtime, Emelie tells Christopher and Sally a story of a mama bear who had a cub that she loved. The cub died, and Mama Bear met Skinny Hyena, who liked the mama bear and said he'd help her make a new cub. Mama Bear and Skinny Hyena got into trouble and escaped to a new land to search for a new cub. It is revealed that Emelie is the mama bear in the story: one night, she fell asleep with her baby on the couch, accidentally suffocating him. She met Skinny Man (Skinny Hyena), but couldn't have any more children and was unable to adopt a new child. They got passports and Emelie is later seen watching small children at a playground. She texts Skinny Man that she's found her cub.

Jacob takes his dad's gun, aiming it at Emelie. She tells him to shoot her but Jacob drops it. The doorbell rings and Emelie tells the kids not to say anything, slapping Jacob when he retorts. It is Maggie, the kids' usual babysitter, who is checking in since she hasn't heard from Anna, her friend. Sally shoves a note asking for help into Maggie's bag. Maggie reads the note about the imposter but Emelie knocks her unconscious. She forces the kids to drink sleeping syrup mixed into blue juice and for good measure tries to put a pillow over Jacob's face for five seconds after Christopher and Sally have fallen asleep, but Jacob has forced himself to vomit up the syrup so he remains awake and goes to get help from his friend and neighbor Howie, who has fireworks stashed in his treehouse.

Jacob tells Howie about Emelie and asks if he has his cell phone. Maggie wakes and attacks Emelie to protect the children, but Emelie kills her, although Maggie does wound Emelie. Emelie plans to kidnap Christopher so he can become her new child but Jacob has hidden him. Emelie calls Skinny Man that she needs more time. When Dan and Joyce are on their way home, Skinny Man drives into their taxi and dies. Police tell the parents that he had no ID.

Jacob finds Maggie's dead body in the basement. Emelie threatens Jacob that she has Sally, whom she does not want, and will kill her unless Jacob brings her Christopher, the one she does want. She also drops down Howie's yellow jacket with blood stains for Jacob to see. She tells Jacob to meet her in the backyard in five minutes where she will trade Sally for Christopher. Jacob subdues Emelie by rolling a trash can towards her which she opens, thinking that Christopher is hidden inside, only to have the lit fireworks that Jacob had placed inside the trash can explode in her face. While Emelie is stunned and in pain, Jacob takes Sally back. Police open the trunk of the crashed car and find Anna's corpse. Dan and Joyce learn this when the police at the scene of the crash use the police radio to contact the police officer who's taking Dan and Joyce home, and they all start rushing home. Jacob loads his brother and sister into his father's car and hits Emelie with it as she's aiming a gun at him. Police and his parents arrive and the kids reunite with them. Emelie pants and hurriedly limps away.
