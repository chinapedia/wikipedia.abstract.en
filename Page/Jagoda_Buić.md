JAGODA BUIĆ (born 14 March 1930) is an acclaimed Croatian visual artist best known for her monumental fiber art installations and tapestries.

Born in the coastal city of Split, Buić studied at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts and Art History at the University of Zagreb before graduating in interior architecture and scenography, textiles and costume design at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1953.[1] After graduation she went on to study film set design at the Cinecittà studio in Rome and the history of costume design at the International Centre for Arts and Costume housed at Palazzo Grassi in Venice.[2]

She went on to work on more than 120 projects as a costume and stage designer in various opera, ballet, theatre and film productions at various theatres in Vienna, Zagreb, Osijek, Dubrovnik and Split.[3] In 1965, at the Lausanne Biennial of Textile Art, Buić impressed contemporary art critics with her first textile installation which was immediately bought by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.[4] She continued to exhibit her monumental textile works at art shows and contemporary art museums around the world, becoming known for vast installations made out of textile cords, hemp and wool, and experiments with unusual surface textures and space. Since the 1970s, Buić, together with Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz, is credited with pioneering innovative textile forms in contemporary arts.

In the 1980s she started using metals in her sculptures and installations, and in the 2000s she turned to using collages of assorted materials, including paper, cardboard, wool, etc.[5]

Buić won numerous awards for her work, including the Grand Prize at the São Paulo Art Biennial, the Herder Prize (1976), and the Vladimir Nazor Award for Life Achievement (2014).[6]
