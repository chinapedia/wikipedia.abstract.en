_DEADPOOL 3_ is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool, to be produced by Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is intended to be part of either the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or the _X-Men_ film series and the sequel to 2016's _Deadpool_ and 2018's _Deadpool 2_.

Plans for two sequels to _Deadpool_ began by November 2016, with Fox searching for two filmmakers to take on each film after the original film's director, Tim Miller, chose not to return for the sequels.

Development

By November 2016, with development underway on _Deadpool 2_, Fox was also planning _Deadpool 3_, which was said to include the team X-Force.[2] The first film's director, Tim Miller, chose not to return for the sequel due to creative issues with star Ryan Reynolds, and David Leitch replaced him for _Deadpool 2_. It was revealed that Fox was looking for a third filmmaker to take on directing for _Deadpool 3_.[3] In March 2017, Reese said that _Deadpool 2_ would set up the X-Force team, but a future film focused on that group would be separate from _Deadpool 3_, "so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [_X-Force_] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [_Deadpool 3_ is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small.[4] After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney,[5] and that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Deadpool films "as long as we let the audiences know what's coming". He added that "there might be an opportunity for a Marvel-R brand for something likeÂ _Deadpool_".[6] In May 2018, Reynolds stated that a third Deadpool film may not be made given the franchise's shift of focus to X-Force,[7] though Reese and Wernick felt a third film would "absolutely" be happening after Reynolds took a break from the character and _X-Force_ was released, which they compared to the _Iron Man_ franchise having _Iron Man 3_ (2013) release after the crossover film _The Avengers_ (2012).[8] Also, Leitch expressed interest in returning to the franchise, saying "I would be grateful to work on something [starring Reynolds' Deadpool] again. It just depends on time and place, so we'll see what happens".[9]

_Deadpool 3_ was believed to be in active development by August 2018, with production planned to take place in Atlanta, Georgia in a departure from the previous _Deadpool_ films which were both filmed in Vancouver.[10] While promoting _Once Upon a Deadpool_ in China, Reynolds confirmed that the third Deadpool film was in development, and would go in a "completely different direction".[11] After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) under Disney, with Reynolds reprising his role from the _X-Men_ film series.[12]
