_TACTIQ_ is the debut studio album of Society Burning, released on July 15, 1997 by Re-Constriction Records.[1] _Sonic Boom_ praised the band for exploring new sounds, saying "by not choosing to remain stuck in a musical rut, the band has chosen to stride forth into new musical territory without forgetting their original musical roots."[2] The secret song located on track sixty-nine is a cover of Adam Ants's "Stand and Deliver", which is a reworked version of what appeared on the _Shut Up Kitty_ compilation.[3]
