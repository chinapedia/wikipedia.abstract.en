The TWELLO TRAIN ACCIDENT was a railway accident on 22 December 1900 at 21:00 in front of the Twello railway station, Twello.[1] The express train from Amsterdam (Sneltrein 238; pulled by an NS 1600) collided head-to-head with a regional train (Stoptrein 927; pulled by an NS 1600) from Almelo to Apeldoorn. Normally these trains pass each other at Bathmen, but due to a delay of the express train, the crossing was changed to Twello. The crash happened because the person who takes care of the railroad switch failed to set a switch, allowing two trains on the same track. The express train rode into the still standing regional train.[2][3][4][5] Two men from Deventer died. Five passengers were seriously injured and two conductors were minor injured. Two station officials were sentenced in January 1901 to six weeks' imprisonment.[6]
