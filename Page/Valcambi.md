History

The company was formed on May 15, 1961 as Valori & Cambi by a group of 5 Swiss businessmen/entrepreneurs from Mendrisio. The name was changed to Valcambi on June 30, 1967. In 1967, Credit Suisse bought 50% of the Valcambi refinery, followed by the purchase of another 30% stake in 1968. The remaining 20% was purchased in 1980, giving Credit Suisse 100% control of the firm.[3]

In 2003, European Gold Refineries SA purchased 100% of Valcambi from Credit Suisse for approximately $400 Million.[4][5][6]
