In 1948 he moved to Scotland to join the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen as a Research Officer. Here he gained a doctorate (PhD) from Aberdeen University for his work on the fermentation of pentoses.

His first medical role was on the diagnostic staff at Maudsley Hospital in south London in 1952. He also then took on lecturing roles at the University of London. Growing fame gained him a travelling professorship to lecture at the Mayo Clinic in the United States.[1]
