Biography

Nora Elizabeth Scott was born in Prestwick, Scotland in 1905.[1] The family moved to Kingston, Ontario, Canada, a few years later when her father, Ernest F. Scott, took up a post as professor at Queen's College.[2] In 1919, the family moved to New York, where Ernest Scott became a professor at Union Theological Seminary.[3] Scott got her undergraduate degree in classics from Barnard College.[4][5] She continued her education at Oxford University in 1927, studying Egyptology with Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Aylward M. Blackman, leaving with a second B.A. followed by an M.A.[6]

Scott began archaeological field work with the Egypt Exploration Society at Armant (1929–30), following which she took a job with the Metropolitan Museum of New York's Department of Egyptian Art.[7] Initially her activities at the Met were focused on archival work with expedition photographs. She later expanded into organizing exhibitions and contributed over a dozen articles to the _Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art_.[8][9] She also took part in a 1933 Danish expedition at Hama in Syria.[10] By 1968, she had risen to be the curator and head of department of Egyptian art at the Met and was the editor of several museum monographs.[11] Her main areas of curatorial interest were daily life and decorative arts.[12] She worked at the Met for over 40 years, retiring in 1972.[13][14]

Scott also taught as an adjunct professor at Columbia University.[15] She served at different times as secretary and president of the New York Society of the Archaeological Institute of America.[16]

After retiring, she moved to Pennsylvania, where she died in 1994.[17][18]
