ELLEN _KRISTINA_ ABELLI ELANDER (born 25 June 1952) is a Swedish artist.[1] She received her education at Birkagårdens folkhögskola between 1972 and 1973, and made her solo debut at Galleri Händer in Stockholm in 1978.[2] Early on, she worked with paintings in acrylic and canvas, and openly criticized the gender issues of the time.[3]

She released several drawings during the 1980s and 2000s in the comic books _Galago_ and _Hjälp!_[4] She later worked with larger room installations and wall paintings, and figures in ceramics and textiles that have been shown in the gallery Schaper & Sundberg in Stockholm.[5]
