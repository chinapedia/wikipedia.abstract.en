In the spelling of Hebrew and some other Semitic languages, _MATRES LECTIONIS_ (; from Latin "mothers of reading", singular form: _mater lectionis_, from , 'em k'ri'a) are certain consonants that are used to indicate a vowel. The letters that do this in Hebrew are _aleph_ , _he_ , _waw_ and _yod_ . The yod and waw in particular are more often vowels than they are consonants.

In Arabic, the _matres lectionis_ (though they are much less often referred to thus) are _ʾalif_ , _wāw_ and _yāʾ_ .

The original value of the _matres lectionis_ correspond closely to what is called in modern linguistics glides or semivowels.[1]


Overview

Because the scripts used to write some Semitic languages lack vowel letters, unambiguous reading of a text might be difficult. Therefore, to indicate vowels (mostly long), consonant letters are used. For example, in the Hebrew construct-state form _bēt_, meaning "the house of", the middle letter in the spelling acts as a vowel, but in the corresponding absolute-state form _bayit_ ("house"), which is spelled the same, the same letter represents a genuine consonant. _Matres lectionis_ are extensively employed only in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac and Arabic, but the phenomenon is also found in the Ugaritic, Moabite, South Arabian and Phoenician alphabets.


Origins and development

Historically, the practice of using _matres lectionis_ seems to have originated when and diphthongs, written with the yod and the waw consonant letters respectively, monophthongized to simple long vowels and . This epiphenomenal association between consonant letters and vowel sounds was then seized upon and used in words without historic diphthongs.

In general terms, it is observable that early Phoenician texts have very few _matres lectionis_, and that during most of the 1st millennium BCE, Hebrew and Aramaic were quicker to develop _matres lectionis_ than Phoenician. However, in its latest period of development in North Africa (referred to as "Punic"), Phoenician developed a very full use of _matres lectionis_, including the use of the letter Ayin , also used for this purpose much later in Yiddish orthography.

In pre-exilic Hebrew, there was a significant development of the use of the letter He to indicate word final vowels other than _ī_ and _ū_. This was probably inspired by the phonological change of the third-person singular possessive suffix from > > in most environments. However, in later periods of Hebrew, the orthography was changed so word-final _ō_ was no longer written with the letter He (except in a few archaically-spelled proper names, such as Solomon and Shiloh ). The difference between the spelling of the third-person singular possessive suffix (as attached to singular nouns) with He in early Hebrew vs. with waw in later Hebrew has become an issue in the authentication of the Jehoash Inscription.

According to Sass (5), already in the Middle Kingdom there were some cases of _matres lectionis_, i.e. consonant graphemes which were used to transcribe vowels in foreign words, namely in Punic (Jensen 290, Naveh 62), Aramaic, and Hebrew (he, waw, yod; sometimes even aleph; Naveh 62). Naveh (ibid.) notes that the earliest Aramaic and Hebrew documents already used _matres lectionis_. Some scholars argue that the Greeks must therefore have borrowed their alphabet from the Arameans. However, the practice has older roots, as the Semitic cuneiform alphabet of Ugarit (13th century BC) already had _matres lectionis_ (Naveh 138).

Hebrew

The earliest method of indicating some vowels in Hebrew writing was to use the consonant letters _yod_ , _waw_ , _he_ ,and _aleph_ of the Hebrew alphabet to also write long vowels in some cases. Originally, and were only at the end of words, and and were used mainly to write the original diphthongs and as well as original vowel+[y]+vowel sequences (which sometimes simplified to plain long vowels). Gradually, as it was found to be insufficient for differentiating between similar nouns, and were also inserted to mark some long vowels of non-diphthongal origin.

If words can be written with or without _matres lectionis_, spellings that include the letters are called _malē_ (Hebrew) or _plene_ (Latin), meaning "full", and spellings without them are called _ḥaser_ or _defective_. In some verb forms, _matres lectionis_ are almost always used. Around the 9th century CE, it was decided that the system of _matres lectionis_ did not suffice to indicate the vowels precisely enough for purposes of liturgical recitation of Biblical texts so a supplemental vowel pointing system (_niqqud_) (diacritic symbols indicating vowel pronunciation and other important phonological features not written by the traditional basic consonantal orthography) joined _matres lectionis_ as part of the Hebrew writing system.

In some words in Hebrew, there is a choice of whether to use a _mater lectionis_ or not, and in modern printed texts _matres lectionis_ are sometimes used even for short vowels, which is considered to be grammatically incorrect according to traditional norms, though instances are found as far back as Talmudic times. Such texts from Judaea and Galilee were noticeably more inclined to _malē_ spellings than texts from Babylonia. Similarly, in the Middle Ages, Ashkenazi Jews tended to use _malē_ spellings under the influence of European languages, but Sephardi Jews tended to use _ḥaser_ spellings under the influence of Arabic.

Arabic

In Arabic there is no such choice, and the almost invariable rule is that a long vowel is written with a _mater lectionis_ and a short vowel with a diacritic symbol, but the Uthmanic orthography, the one in which the Quran is traditionally written and printed, has some differences, which are not always consistent. Also, under influence from orthography of European languages, transliterating of borrowed words into Arabic is usually done using _matres lectionis_ in place of diacritics, even when the latter is more suitable or when words from another Semitic language, such as Hebrew, are transliterated. That phenomenon is augmented by the neglect of diacritics in most printed forms since the beginning of mechanical printing.

The name given to the three _matres lectionis_ by traditional Arabic grammar is _ḥurūf al-līn wa-l-madd_, ‘consonants of softness and lengthening’, or _ḥurūf al-ʿilal_, ‘causal consonants‘ or ‘consonants of infirmity’, because as in Greek grammar, words with ‘accidents’ were deemed to be afflicted, ill, in opposition to ‘healthy’ words without accidents.[2]

Informal orthographies of spoken varieties of Arabic also use _ha_ to indicate a shorter version of alif, a usage augmented by the ambiguity of the use of _ha_ and _taa marbuta_ in formal Arabic orthography. It is a formal orthography in other languages that use Arabic script, such as Kurdish alphabets.

Syriac

Syriac-Aramaic vowels are classified into three groups: the Alap (), the waw (), and the yod (). The _mater lectionis_ was developed as early as the 6th century to represent long vowels, which were earlier denoted by a dot under the line. The most frequent ones are the _yod_ and the _waw_, while the _alap_ is mostly restricted to some transliterated words.[3]


Usage in Hebrew

Most commonly, yod indicates _i_ or _e_, while waw indicates _o_ or _u_. Aleph was not systematically developed as a _mater lectionis_ in Hebrew (unlike in Aramaic and Arabic), but it is occasionally used to indicate an _a_ vowel. (However, a silent aleph, indicating an original glottal stop consonant sound that has become silent in Hebrew pronunciation, can occur after almost any vowel.) At the end of a word, He can also be used to indicate that a vowel _a_ should be pronounced.

Influence on other languages

Later, in some adaptations of the Arabic alphabet (such those sometimes used for Kurdish and Uyghur) and of the Hebrew alphabet (such as those used for the Yiddish and Judaeo-Spanish), _matres lectionis_ were generally used for all or most vowels, thus in effect becoming vowel letters: see Yiddish orthography. This tendency was taken to its logical conclusion in fully alphabetic scripts such as Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic. Many of the vowel letters in such languages historically go back to _matres lectionis_ in the Phoenician script. For example, the letter was originally derived from the consonant letter _yod_. Similarly the vowel letters in the Avestan alphabet were adapted from _matres lectionis_ in the version of the Aramaic alphabet adapted as the Pahlavi scripts.
