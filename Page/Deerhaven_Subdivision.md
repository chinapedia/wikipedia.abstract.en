History

FWCR_map.png The Deerhaven Subdivision was originally built as part the Live Oak, Tampa, and Charlotte Harbor Railroad in the early 1880s by Henry B. Plant. It was the final segment of Plant's first rail line into Florida, which originated in Du Pont, Georgia. The line connected to the Florida Southern Railway in Gainesville. Plant's system of railroads would eventually become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1899. The Atlantic Coast Line would become part of CSX by 1986.[3]
