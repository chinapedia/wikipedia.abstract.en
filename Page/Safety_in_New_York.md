Plot

Bertie escapes Aunt Agatha's plot to get him married to Honoria Glossop by taking a ship to New York, accompanied by Jeeves. On board he meets Tuppy Glossop who is going to buy a car there. Tuppy's uncle is Bertie's nemesis (and later good friend) Sir Roderick Glossop and his cousin is Bertie's ex-fiancée Honoria Glossop. Meanwhile, Tuppy has fallen in love with the daughter of an American automobile manufacturer. He wants to import American cars to Britain and promises to buy 48 cars, but he barely has enough money for one American car.

Bertie is then lumbered with Wilmot "Motty", Lord Pershore, who is the son of Aunt Agatha's friend Lady Malvern.

Once in America, she leaves for a tour of prisons for an upcoming book. She has left strict instructions as to how to look after the very delicate Wilmot, who cannot travel with his mother as he gets ill when traveling by train.

But once out of his mother's eye, he turns from a withdrawn little man into someone who's out clubbing and getting drunk every night and yielding to the temptations of New York in a big way. Bertie escapes to the woods to stay with poet friend Mr Todd while Jeeves sorts things out calling a policeman. Wilmot assaults the policeman whilst drunk, and is sent to prison. But his mother sees Wilmot as prisoner on her tour of prisons. Wilmot does not want her to find out what he has done. He turns to Jeeves for help.
