KIRITI ROY is an iconic professional and fictional detective of Bengali literature created by noted dermatologist, Dr. Nihar Ranjan Gupta.[1] Standing over 6 ft tall, stoutly built, stylish, ingenious and rational, KIRITI ROY is known for his sartorial statements. The first story introduces him as follows: "Kiriti Roy is six and a half feet tall, fair and stout. His curled hair is mostly combed back, and the black celluloid spectacles make his clean-shaven face highly attractive." One of the most popular yesteryear detective characters, he is also sophisticated, classy and dignified, in a manner of speaking. He is immaculately suited and booted during his professional duties and wears a dressing gown at home, a silk kimono and tatami grass slippers (at home).

With a long coat and cap, and a Briar pipe hanging from his lips, he is a dashing detective and very different from other sleuths. Kiriti Roy brings in a sense of suave and scientific rationality to the job. Mostly, he carries a magnifying glass with him. His stories have a sense of adventure, of stalking criminals in the night, in general, a certain blood-curdling quality. He is perhaps the only Bengali detective who deconstructs a crime. Kiriti solves crimes with the help of his associate, Subrata Roy. The gluttonous local police officer, inspector Rathin Sikdar and Subrata are ‘regulars’ at Kiriti's place where they devour huge rajbhogs from a special shop, with luchi or radhaballabi and aloor chhenchki.

Kiriti's stories were set in the early 1940s. His clientele were the creme de la creme of society — royal figures, zamindars and affluent businessmen. They were posh and equally well-dressed. Adding drama and pace to the stories are Kiriti's pet favourites of a black Ambassador car, a Havana cigar (substituted for the Briar pipe) and a black Panama hat.

Always a class apart, Kiriti is a deadly combination of intelligence and physical power. Though this private eye doesn't wear Bangaliana on his sleeve, but flaunts a Western look, he is roundly Bengali and nationalistic in thought. Kiriti Roy is described as a 'rahasyabhedi' (private eye in Bengali) and one of the few sleuths who takes the rich legacy of Bengali detective novels forward, with the tales being gripping and edgy. In his own words, "In this universe, virtue and sin reside in parallel. Reward for virtue and scorn for sin is the thumb rule of the universe." [2]


Kiriti's personal life

After saving her from a difficult situation in the tale "Kalo Bhromor", Kiriti falls in love with Krishna Mehta, a Parsi lady. The courtship ends in marriage (In the tale "Holud Shoitan"). Krishna is intelligent, happens to be a good singer (can sing Rabindrasangeet), can speak Bengali, has a mind of her own and takes keen interest in her husband's work.
