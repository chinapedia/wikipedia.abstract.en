SIGRID AUGUSTA "GUSTA" GREEN (3 December 1920 â€“ 12 October 2012) gathered intelligence in preparation for the sabotage of Telemark during the Second World War. She worked for the Norwegian Resistance and then at Bletchley Park.

She joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force at the age of 22, attesting on 10 December 1942.[1] Her bilingual ability from her Norwegian mother (Edith Stafford Green) was quickly recognised and she was seconded to the Norwegian Resistance. She was sent to Nazi-occupied Norway to research the Heavy water factory at Telemark. She was secretly landed in Norway by submarine as she refused to parachute.[2][3][4]
