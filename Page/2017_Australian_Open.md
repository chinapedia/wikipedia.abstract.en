The 2017 AUSTRALIAN OPEN was a tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park between 16–29 January 2017. It was the 105th edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam tournament of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's title sponsor was Kia.

Novak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber were the defending champions and both were unsuccessful in their title defence; they lost to Denis Istomin and Coco Vandeweghe in the second and fourth rounds, respectively. For the first time since the 2004 French Open, both No. 1 seeds lost before the quarterfinals, with both Andy Murray and Kerber defeated in the fourth round.

Roger Federer won his eighteenth men's singles Grand Slam title by defeating Rafael Nadal in a five-set final. It was his first major title since 2012 Wimbledon and a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Nadal won in five sets. Serena Williams overcame her sister Venus in the women's singles final, surpassing Steffi Graf to become the player with the most major wins in the women's game in the Open Era.

Day-by-day summaries

Day 2

-   Ivo Karlović came from two sets to love down to defeat Horacio Zeballos 6–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–2, 22–20. The 84 games which were played is the longest Australian Open match (by number of games played) since the introduction of tiebreaks in 1971. Time-wise, the match was the second-longest in Australian Open history, only behind the five-hour and 53-minute 2012 final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Karlovic also set a new Australian Open record, hitting 75 aces in the match.[3]

Day 4

-   Denis Istomin defeated 6-time champion Novak Djokovic in five sets. It was Djokovic's earliest exit from a grand slam since his second round loss at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships.[4]
-   Mirjana Lučić-Baroni defeated Agnieszka Radwańska in two sets. It was Radwańska's earliest exit in the tournament since her first round loss at the 2009 Australian Open. As a result, Lučić-Baroni advanced to the third round of the Australian Open for the first time since the 1998 Australian Open.[5]

Day 6

-   Grigor Dimitrov defeated Richard Gasquet in three sets. The 122-minute match began at 11:58 pm which is the latest start to a match in Australian Open history.[6] This late start occurred as a result of the Alexander Zverev–Rafael Nadal match, which lasted 245 minutes and delayed the beginning of the night session. The first night session match, between Daria Gavrilova and Timea Bacsinszky, began at 9:00 pm, and did not conclude until shortly before midnight.[7]

Day 7

-   50th ranked Mischa Zverev defeated men's No. 1 seed Andy Murray in four sets. The last time Murray fell to an opponent ranked outside the top 50 at a Grand Slam was to 51st-ranked Juan Ignacio Chela at the 2006 Australian Open. Murray is the first top seed to exit the Australian Open this early in the competition since Lleyton Hewitt lost at the same stage in 2003.[8] It marks the first time since 2002 that neither the Men's No. 1 nor the No. 2 seed has reached the Australian Open quarterfinals.[9]
-   Coco Vandeweghe defeated defending champion and women's No. 1 seed Angelique Kerber. The loss marked the first time in the Open era that both men's and women's No. 1 seeds have been knocked out of the Australian Open before the quarterfinals.[10]

Day 8

-   David Goffin became the first Belgian man to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Open.[11]
-   Mirjana Lučić-Baroni reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final in 18 years. Her previous Grand Slam quarter-final came at the 1999 Wimbledon Championships, where she reached the semi-finals.[12]

Day 9

-   Venus Williams defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarter final. This was her 50th singles victory at the Australian Open. She also became the oldest woman to make a grand slam semi-final since Martina Navratilova at 1994 Wimbledon Championships.[13]

Day 10

-   Rafael Nadal defeated Milos Raonic in the quarter final. This was his 50th singles victory at the Australian Open.[14]

Day 11

-   Venus Williams defeated Coco Vandeweghe to reach her second Australian Open final, last appearing in 2003 where she lost to her sister Serena. Venus, at 36 years old, became the oldest Australian Open singles finalist of the Open Era. This was her first Grand Slam singles final since she lost the 2009 Wimbledon final to Serena.[15]
-   Serena also made the final, making it the ninth time the Williams sisters would meet in a grand slam final.[16]
-   Roger Federer defeated the 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka and became the second man in open Era to reach six Australian Open Finals, after Novak Djokovic.

Day 12

-   Rafael Nadal also made the final, making it the ninth time he would meet Roger Federer in a grand slam final.
-   For the first time in the Open era, all four singles finalists were older than 30.[17]
-   All four singles finalists were former world No.1 and multiple Grand Slam champions.

Day 13

-   After Serena Williams defeated her sister Venus Williams in straight sets, she set a new record by winning the tournament for the 7th time. Serena also reclaimed the No. 1 ranking and claimed her 23rd Grand Slam, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slams.[18]

Day 14

-   Roger Federer defeated Rafael Nadal in a five-set match, 6–4, 3–6, 6–1, 3–6, 6–3 extending his record for the most Grand Slams won in men's singles to 18 and becoming the first man ever to win at least 5 times in 3 different Grand Slam tournaments each. Nadal was leading the fifth set after breaking Federer's service in the first game, but Federer mounted a comeback, breaking back and then going up another service break. The Swiss held on to win the set and match for his first Major victory over Nadal since the 2007 Wimbledon Championships. Federer, brought to tears when Nadal's challenge to a forehand winner on championship point was ruled unsuccessful, admitted after the match that he would have been "happy to lose" and said, "Tennis is a tough sport, there are no draws but if there was going to be one I would have been very happy to accept a draw tonight and share it with Rafa."[19] The 2017 Australian Open men singles final between Federer and Nadal was the most highly anticipated tennis match in not only the tournament's history but also all of Grand Slam and tennis history.[20][21]


Champions

Seniors

Men's Singles

-   _' Roger Federer_' defeated Rafael Nadal, 6–4, 3–6, 6–1, 3–6, 6–3

This was a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Rafael Nadal won to become the first (and to date, only) Spaniard to win the Australian Open title; as of 2018 it remains his only title at the tournament. The final saw the two holding service for six games of the first set, whilst during the seventh game was the pivotal break of serve giving Federer the opening set. Nadal quickly broke Federer's serve in the second set racing out to a lead that Federer could not overcome, giving him the second set and levelling the match at one set apiece. The third set was a rather lopsided affair seeing Nadal secure his service game only in the fourth game of the set. The fourth set started off competitively with the two holding serve, until Nadal broke in the fourth game of the set, a lead he would never surrender, evening the match at two sets apiece. The decisive fifth set commenced with a break of Federer's serve by Nadal, giving him a lead in the early going; however, Nadal's serve got broken during the sixth game of the set, levelling the match at two sets and three games apiece. Federer won the next three games breaking Nadal's service in the eighth game of the set to allow him to successfully serve out the match in the final ninth game. This was Roger Federer's 18th Grand Slam singles title, the most ever by a man in the history of tennis, and it was his fifth Australian Open title, just one shy of the record co-held by Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson. [22]Federer would go on to equal this record by defending his title successfully the next year.

Women's Singles

-   SERENA WILLIAMS defeated Venus Williams, 6–4, 6–4

This was a rematch of the 2003 Australian Open final, where Serena Williams completed the first "Serena Slam" and her career Grand Slam, whilst Serena won five more Australian Open titles in the interim and her sister Venus had no other final appearances at the event. They each broke the others' serve twice to start the match with Venus finally holding serve in the fifth service game and her sister Serena holding her own serve in the subsequent game. The seventh game was the pivotal break of service that Serena Williams got on her sister Venus' serve, costing her the set just a mere three games later. During the second set, the two traded held service games for the first six games to start the set, whilst Venus started serving first. She would get broken again during the seventh game of the set, which eventually surrendered the match to sister Serena. This was Serena Williams' 23 Grand Slam singles title and seventh Australian Open title for her career, both being Open era records, whilst being one shy of Margaret Court's record of 24 in the history of tennis.[23]
