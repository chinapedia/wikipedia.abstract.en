Early life and education

After graduation, Ting worked at the documentary distribution company Docurama in New York for several years[6], and later founded her own production company, Unbound Feet Productions[7].

Her first feature-length documentary, _What’s Love Got to Do with It?_, premiered in 2002_._[8] She also made a documentary short entitled _Reality Check_ in 2006, which is about college graduates facing unemployment.[9]

When Ting ran her family's business in Hong Kong，she made a documentary about her family business, _Family Inc_, which was released in 2008. It is a highly personal documentary, following how she gave up her filmmaking dream and returned home to help her father run a big toy manufacturing empire.[10]

_Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong_ (2015), Ting's first scripted feature, received primarily good reviews and was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and the New York Asian Film Festival.[11] The movie is partially based on Ting's life and inspired by Sofia Coppola’s _Lost in Translation_.[12] _Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong_, a romantic drama, follows a Chinese woman from Los Angeles who makes a business trip to Hong Kong, and has a romance with an American expat.[13] They visit various parts of the city, from Lan Kwai Fong and Central to Chungking Mansions and Temple Street.[14] _Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong_ has been lauded for capturing Hong Kong’s vibrant nightlife.

Ting's next film, _Go Back to China_, is about an American heiress who blows through her trust fund, causing her parents to send her to China to work for their toy making business.[15] Ting has stated that this film, like _Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong_, is also semi-autobiographical.[16]
