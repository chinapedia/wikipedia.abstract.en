A typical minimoto is approximately one-quarter the size of a regular motorcycle, and is powered by a two-stroke internal combustion engine of between 40–50 cc producing somewhere between 2.4 and 17 hp (1.8 and 11 kW). The machines have no suspension, relying on the tires to absorb bumps and handle cornering, and weigh approximately . The entry-level models produce about 2.4–4.2 hp, but the more expensive racing models can have a power output of about 11–17 hp. This provides a power-to-weight ratio favorable to racing. Despite their tiny size both adults and children race them at speeds of up to in organized racing leagues.

In most countries, a licence is not required to ride miniature bikes. However, they are usually not street legal and should be ridden on private land, such as car parks, gardens or on race tracks..

A notable racer who learned on a minimoto is Valentino Rossi.
