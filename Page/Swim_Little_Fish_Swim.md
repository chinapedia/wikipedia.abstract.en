Critical reception

-   "Refreshingly free of cliches."[10] - _The Hollywood Reporter_
-   Indiewire's Eric Kohn praised the film, describing it as "a gentle NYC delight" and giving it a B+ grade.[11]
-   “An elegance of construction scarcely seen in like-minded indie comedies." - MTV[12]
-   "Mumbly dialogue, relentlessly jittery camerawork, a star who is also co-director and co-writer: Yes, it's time for another movie that mistakes the claustrophobic world of young New York artsy types for something interesting." - _New York Times_[13]
-   "Featuring gorgeous photography, solid performances and an absolutely killer soundtrack."[14] - CriterionCast
-   "What comes through strongest is its Woody Allen-esque treatment of Brooklyn, complete with golden light, beautiful young women, glamorous locations and plenty of appealingly tortured—or insufferably neurotic, depending on your point of view—artists."[15] - _Slant Magazine_
-   "Inspired by John Cassavettes and the Nouvelle Vague’s observations of human beings and Jacques Demy’s charming atmosphere."[16] The Red List
