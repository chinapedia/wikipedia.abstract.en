DAVID PAUL CRONENBERG (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian filmmaker, writer, and actor. He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infection, technology, and the intertwining of the psychological with the physical. In the first third of his career, he explored these themes mostly through horror and science fiction films such as _Scanners_ (1981) and _Videodrome_ (1983), although his work has since expanded beyond these genres.

Cronenberg's films have polarized critics and audiences alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence.[1][2] _The Village Voice_ called him "the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world".[3] His films have won numerous awards, including, for _Crash_, the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury, who in this case gave the award "for originality, for daring and for audacity".[4]


Early life

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Cronenberg is the son of Esther (_née_ Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor.[5] He was raised in a "middle-class progressive Jewish family".[6][7] His father was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his mother was born in Toronto; all of his grandparents were from Lithuania.[8]

He began writing as a child and wrote constantly. He attended high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute and North Toronto Collegiate Institute. A keen interest in science, especially botany and lepidopterology, led him to enter the Honours Science program at the University of Toronto in 1963, but he switched to Honours English Language and Literature later in his first year.

Cronenberg's fascination with the film _Winter Kept Us Warm_ (1966), by classmate David Secter, sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses, learning the art of filmmaking, and made two 16mm films (_Transfer_ and _From the Drain_). Inspired by the New York underground film scene, he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and Ivan Reitman. After taking a year off to travel in Europe, he returned to Canada in 1967 and graduated from University College at the top of his class.[9]


Career

After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black-and-white _Stereo_ and the colour _Crimes of the Future_) Cronenberg went into partnership with Ivan Reitman. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. He alternated his signature "body horror" films such as _Shivers_ with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs (_Fast Company_). _Rabid_ provided pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers with work in a different genre. (Cronenberg's first choice for the role had been a then little-known Sissy Spacek). _Rabid_ was a breakthrough with international distributors, and his next two horror features gained stronger support.

Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression: a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. _Shivers_, _Rabid_). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. _The Brood_, _Scanners_, _Videodrome_). In the later middle period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of _The Fly_). This trajectory culminates in _Dead Ringers_ in which a twin pair of gynecologists spiral into codependency and drug addiction. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (_eXistenZ_, _M. Butterfly_, _Spider_).

Cronenberg has cited William S. Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov as influences.[10] Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's 1991 "adaptation" of _Naked Lunch_ (1959), his literary hero William S. Burroughs' most controversial book. The novel was considered "unfilmable", and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would "cost 400 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world". Instead—much like in his earlier film, _Videodrome_—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be hallucinations brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's "moments" (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for _Naked Lunch_ (1991), he felt a moment of synergy with Burroughs' writing style. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, "I'll just write his next book."

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen "from the point of view of the disease", and that in _Shivers_, for example, he identifies with the characters _after_ they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, "But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute."[11] Similarly, in _Crash_ (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as "a fertilizing rather than a destructive event". In 2005, Cronenberg publicly disagreed with Paul Haggis' choice of the same name for the latter's Oscar-winning film _Crash_ (2004), arguing that it was "very disrespectful" to the "important and seminal" J.G. Ballard novel on which Cronenberg's film was based.[12]

Aside from _The Dead Zone_ (1983) and _The Fly_ (1986), Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by George Lucas as a possible director for _Return of the Jedi_ (1983) but was passed over. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of _Total Recall_ (1990), but experienced "creative differences" with producers Dino De Laurentiis and Ronald Shusett; a different version of the film was eventually made by Paul Verhoeven. A fan of Philip K. Dick's, author of "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale", the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related in the biography/overview of his work, _Cronenberg on Cronenberg_ (1992) that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a migraine just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.[13]

In the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, _Basic Instinct_ (1992), but this also fell through. His thriller _A History of Violence_ (2005) is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted _Spider_ (2002), but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with _Eastern Promises_ (2007), a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.

Director_DAVID_CRONENBERG_of_the_film_'Spider'_during_the_Toronto_International_Film_Festival.jpg]] Cronenberg has collaborated with composer Howard Shore on all of his films since _The Brood_ (1979), (see List of noted film director and composer collaborations) with the exception of _The Dead Zone_ (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, art director Carol Spier, sound editor Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, costume designer Denise Cronenberg, and, from 1979 until 1988, cinematographer Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first opera, _The Fly_.

Since _Dead Ringers_ (1988), Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky on each of his films (see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations). Suschitzky was the director of photography for _The Empire Strikes Back_ (1980), and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film "was the only one of those movies that actually looked good",[14] which was a motivating factor to work with him on _Dead Ringers_.

Although Mr. Cronenberg worked with a number of Hollywood stars, he remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles _The Dead Zone_ and _The Fly_) having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include _M. Butterfly_ (1993), most of which was shot in China, _Spider_, and _Eastern Promises_ (2007), which were both filmed primarily in England, and _A Dangerous Method_ (2011), which was filmed in Germany and Austria. _Rabid_ and _Shivers_ were shot in and around Montreal. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by Telefilm Canada, and Cronenberg, a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, has said: "Every country needs [a system of government grants] in order to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood".[15]

Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are cameo appearances, as in the films _Into the Night_ (1985), _Blood and Donuts_ (1995), _To Die For_ (1995), and _Jason X_ (2002) and the television series _Alias_, but on occasion he has played major roles, as in _Nightbreed_ (1990) and _Last Night_ (1998). He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in _The Fly_; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in _Shivers_; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in _Crash_; his hands can be glimpsed in _eXistenZ_ (1999); and he appeared as a stand-in for James Woods in _Videodrome_ for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.

In 2008, Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition _Chromosomes_ at the Rome Film Fest, and the opera _The Fly_ at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on _A Dangerous Method_ (2011), an adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play _The Talking Cure_, starring Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, and frequent collaborator Viggo Mortensen. The film was produced by independent British producer Jeremy Thomas.[16][17]

In 2012, his film _Cosmopolis_ competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.[18][19]

In the October 2011 edition of _Rue Morgue_, Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of _The Fly_, which he would like to direct if given the chance. He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a "parallel story".

For a time it appeared that, as _Eastern Promises_ producer Paul Webster told Screen International, a sequel is in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, Steven Knight, and Viggo Mortensen. The film was to be made by Webster's new production company _Shoebox Films_ in collaboration with Focus Features, and shot in early 2013.[20] However, in 2012, Cronenberg commented that the _Eastern Promises_ sequel had fallen through due to budget disagreement with Focus Features.[21]

Filming for Cronenberg's next film, a satire drama entitled _Maps to the Stars_ (2014)—with Julianne Moore, Mia Wasikowska, John Cusack, and Robert Pattinson[22][23]—began on July 8, 2013 in Toronto, Ontario and Los Angeles.[24][25] This was the first time Cronenberg filmed in the United States.

In a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: "It wouldn't disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn't bother me." In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the "time of day" as to whether or not he is afraid of death.[26]

On June 26, 2014, Cronenberg's short film _The Nest_ was published on YouTube. The film was commissioned for "David Cronenberg - The Exhibition" at EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam and was available on YouTube for the duration of the exhibition, until September 14, 2014.[27]

In a May 2016 interview, Viggo Mortensen revealed that Cronenberg is considering retiring due to difficulty financing his film projects.[28]

Fiction

In 2014, Cronenberg published his first novel, _Consumed_.[29]


Personal life

He married his first wife, Margaret Hindson, in 1972: their seven-year marriage ended in 1979 amidst personal and professional differences. They had one daughter, Cassandra Cronenberg.

He was married to film editor Carolyn Zeifman until her death in 2017.[30] The couple met on the set of _Rabid_ while she was working as a production assistant.[31] They have two children, Caitlin and Brandon.[32] In the book _Cronenberg on Cronenberg_ (1992), he revealed that _The Brood_ was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be "very satisfying".

Cronenberg lives in Toronto.

Cronenberg describes himself as an atheist.[33][34] His atheism was further explained in a September 2013 interview:

  "Anytime I've tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive. I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real."[35]

In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director Martin Scorsese admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg's early work but was subsequently "terrified" to meet him in person. Cronenberg responded to Scorsese: "You're the guy who made _Taxi Driver_ and you're afraid to meet me?"[36]

Awards and recognition

Cronenberg has appeared on various "Greatest Director" lists. In 2004, Science Fiction magazine _Strange Horizons_ named him the second greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Jean-Luc Godard, and Ridley Scott.[39] In the same year, _The Guardian_ listed him 9th on their list of "The world's 40 best directors".[40] In 2007, Total Film named him as the 17th greatest director of all-time.[41] Film professor Charles Derry, in his overview of the horror genre _Dark Dreams_, called the director one of the most important in his field, and that "no discussion of contemporary horror film can conclude without reference to the films of David Cronenberg."[42]

Cronenberg received the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival for _Crash_.[43] In 1999, he was inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame,[44] awarded the Silver Bear Award at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.[45] and that November received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts.[46]

In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada (the order's highest rank) in 2014.[47] In 2006 he was awarded the Cannes Film Festival's lifetime achievement award, the Carrosse d'Or.[48] Also in 2006, Cronenberg was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the senior national body of distinguished Canadian scientists and scholars.[49] In 2009 Cronenberg received the Légion d'honneur from the government of France.[50] The following year Cronenberg was named an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin. In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.[51]

The opening of the "David Cronenberg: Evolution" Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) exhibition occurred on October 30, 2013. Held at the TIFF Bell Lightbox venue, the exhibition paid tribute to the director's entire filmmaking career and the festival's promotional material referred to Cronenberg as "one of Canada's most prolific and iconic filmmakers". The exhibition was shown internationally following the conclusion of the TIFF showing on January 19, 2014.[52][53]

In 2014, he was made a Member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being "Canada's most celebrated internationally acclaimed filmmaker".[54]

In April 2018, it was announced that Cronenberg would receive the honorary Golden Lion at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.[55]
