Exo_monster_160618_suwon.png Written and composed by Kenzie and LDN Noise, "Monster" is described as a "dark and intense" medium-tempo dance song with lyrics about a man's "excessive fixation on his lover".[1] The song served as one of the "double title tracks" for _Ex'Act_, the other being "Lucky One", and was released together with the album on June 9, 2016. Exo began performing the song on South Korean music TV shows on the same day.


Music videos

The Korean and Chinese music videos for "Monster" were released one hour after the song itself. Apart from Exo's performances of the song at various settings, the videos also depict the members as rebels that were eventually captured but ultimately released from a prisoner transport vehicle by Baekhyun, who has been disguised as the driver. The Korean version was the fourth most-watched K-pop music video on YouTube in 2016.[2] An additional music video exclusively showcasing the song's choreography was released on June 15, 2016.

On June 8, 2018, the Korean music video exceeded 200 million views on YouTube, becoming their first music video to do so.[3]


Reception

"Monster" topped both South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the _Billboard_ World Digital Songs chart, becoming Exo's first number one on the latter.[4][5] The song won first place nine times in total on South Korean weekly music TV shows, and was the most awarded song by a boy group in 2016. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards, and was named the second and third best K-pop songs of 2016 by _Dazed_ and _Billboard_ respectively.[6][7]
