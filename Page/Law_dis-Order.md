It premiered on Hong Kong's TVB Jade and Malaysia's Astro On Demand on September 19, 2016 airing Monday through Sunday during its 9:30-10:30 pm timeslot and concluding October 16, 2016 with a total of 28 episodes.[1]

_Law dis-Order_ centers around the office politics of a prestigious Hong Kong law firm. Liu Kai-chi plays KC Lau (劉謹昌) and Alex Fong plays Kent Cheung (張強), both are powerful attorneys struggling to become the main authority at the law firm they both work at.


Synopsis

As the co-founder of the Chinese law firm Donald & Co., Charles Cheuk (Lau Dan), has been a chairman of its committee for many years. Though he had promised his managing partner KC Lau (Liu Kai-chi) that he would step down, Charles hires the money-minded lawyer Kent Cheung (Alex Fong) as a new partner for the firm, hoping that he would be able to counterbalance KC’s growing obsession for authority.

KC had built up great influence in his years with Donald & Co. His associates include the abled lawyers Duncan Yam (Raymond Cho) and Martha Fong (Mandy Wong). With Patricia Lee (Florence Kwok) and Nick Chau (Matthew Ho) as Kent’s only strongsuits, KC assumed he had the upper edge in their game of power.

However, a traffic accident catches KC off guard, and Kent takes advantage of the situation. He gets himself a lucrative offer from Charles, who promotes Kent to senior partner. During this time, Kent re-encounters assistant solicitor Hazel Cheuk (Ali Lee), and they develop a close mentor-student friendship.

Feeling his power ebbing away, KC becomes a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment. But while fighting for control, a toothless tiger comes out from under the radar, ready to seek revenge.[2]
