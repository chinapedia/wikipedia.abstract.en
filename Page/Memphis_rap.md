MEMPHIS RAP, also known as MEMPHIS HIP HOP and in some forms MEMPHIS HORRORCORE,[1] is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in Memphis, Tennessee in the early 1990s. It has been characterized by its often low budget, repetitive production and its occasional lo-fi sound[2] that also heavily utilizes the Roland TR-808 drum machine[3] and minimal synth melodies,[4] as well as double time flows and samples ranging from soul and funk to horror film scores and classical music, as well as hooks from songs by related rappers in the same genre, although DIY production without sampling is common as well.[5]

Early artists and groups associated with Memphis rap include T-Rock, Tommy Wright III, Playa Fly, Al Kapone, MC Mack[6] DJ Spanish Fly,[7] Lil Noid,[8] 8Ball & MJG and Three 6 Mafia, with the latter two achieving relative commercial success.[9][10][11] Three 6 Mafia's _Mystic Stylez_ and other releases by members of the group such as Come with Me 2 Hell by DJ Paul and Lord Infamous,[12] and Lil Noid's _Paranoid Funk_,[13] as well as DJ Spanish Fly's early mixtapes were particularly influential in the genre's development. Despite largely staying underground, it has attained a cult following from MP3 blogs, influencing rappers such as Lil Ugly Mane, Denzel Curry, 1S1K SeanMario, Marco Pav√© and SpaceGhostPurrp, as well as the rise of crunk and trap music.[14]
