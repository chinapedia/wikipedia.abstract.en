Rear Admiral GEORGE DUNBAR MOORE, (10 October 1893 – 27 July 1979) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Navy and a diplomat.[1]

Moore was appointed Australia's first Minister to the Philippines in 1950, leaving his position as naval flag officer in charge of Sydney to take up the post in Manila.[2][3] In 1954, Moore made front-page news in the Philippines when local media claimed he lashed out at security officers at his residence.[4] Moore retired from the position a year later in July 1955.[5]
