AIMO JOHAN KUSTAA TUKIAINEN (1917–1996) was a sculptor from Finland. His best-known work is the Equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim in Helsinki.

Tukiainen's wide and versatile production mainly consists of a large amount of monumental works, portraits, medals and small sculptures.[1]

Tukiainen played a central role in the Finnish art world of 20th century. In addition to his artist's career he chaired both the Artists' Association of Finland and the Association of Finnish Sculptors.[2]

In 1962, Tukiainen bought a property caller Purnu in Orivesi near place of birth and made it his summer atelier. In 1967, he invited his six fellow artist to organize a summer exhibition to celebrate their 50th birthday. The summer exhibitions were organized then roughly every second year. The original group had also their 60th and 75th birthday exhibitions there.[3]
