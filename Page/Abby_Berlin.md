ABBY BERLIN (August 7, 1907 â€” August 16, 1965) was best known as a director of feature films and television productions. He began on Broadway and Vaudeville as part of a comedy team with Ken Brown in the 1920s. By 1939 he had moved to Hollywood, where he worked as an assistant director, before getting his opportunity to helm his own films with 1945's _Leave It to Blondie_. He was married at least twice, his first wife, Jean, committed suicide after arguing with him; his second wife was B-movie actress Iris Meredith.


Life and career

Berlin was born in New York City on August 7, 1907). By the late 1920s he had teamed up Ken Brown as a comedy song/dance duo, who performed on both Broadway and on the Vaudeville circuit.[1][2] The team had garnered the nickname the "Two Knights of Knonsense".[3][4]

In the 1930s he moved to Hollywood, and was working as an assistant director on films by the end of the decade, many of them in the _Blondie_ franchise. His first film as 1939's _Blondie Takes a Vacation_. Over the next six years, he would assist on nineteen movies. Outside of the _Blondie_ films, he would work on such notable productions as _Go West, Young Lady_ (1941), _City Without Men_ (1943), _Sahara_ (1943), _What a Woman!_ (1943), _The Boy from Stalingrad_ (1943), _The Impatient Years_ (1944), and 1945's _A Song to Remember_. In 1945 he was given the opportunity to helm his own picture, _Leave It to Blondie_. It was the first film after Columbia re-booted the series.[5] He directed a total of twelve feature films, nine of which were in the _Blondie_ franchise. His other features included the romantic comedy, _Father Is a Bachelor_ (1950 - which he co-directed with Norman Foster), which stars William Holden and Coleen Gray; and the 1950 crime drama, _Double Deal_.[6]

With the advent of television, Berlin moved to the small screen, where he directed on numerous series, including _Blondie_, _Lassie_, and _The Ann Sothern Show_. His direction of William Bendix in transforming the radio program to the small screen, was credited with making _The Life of Riley_ a success.[7] In 1965 he would return to the big screen one last time, as an assistant director on _The Great Sioux Massacre_.[8] On August 19, 1965 Berlin died shortly after working on _The Great Sioux Massacre_, before it opened in September.[9]

Berlin was married at least twice. During the 1930s he married actress Jean Berlin. Just as he was beginning his directing career, in November 1939, the couple had an argument. Afterwards, Jean committed suicide by poisoning herself.[10] Later, in 1943, he married Iris Meredith, when the two eloped to Yuma, Arizona while he was working on _Sahara_.[11] The two remained married to until his death in 1965.
