YOU FELL VICTIM (Russian: _Вы жертвою пали_; _Vy zhertvoiu pali_), or YOU FELL VICTIM TO A FATEFUL STRUGGLE,[1] is a Russian Marxist and revolutionary funeral march. It acted as the funeral dirge of the Russian revolutionary movement, among them the Bolsheviks.[2]

The song was written in 1878; the lyrics were written by Anton Arkhangelsky, and the musical arrangements were made by Nikolay Ikonikov.[3]

During the funeral of the Bolshevik Nikolay Bauman, a student orchestra joined the procession near the St. Petersburg Conservatory, playing "You Fell Victim to a Fateful Struggle" repeatedly.[4]

The melody of "You Fell A Victim" was used by Dmitri Shostakovitch in the third part of his Symphony No. 11; it had since the end of the 19th century often been the funeral march of Russian revolutionaries.[5] The same melody was used in Edmund Meisel's score for Sergei Eisenstein's _Battleship Potemkin_, in the scene of the funeral of Grigory Vakulinchuk.[6]
