Biography

Born in Dunedin in 1912,[1] Lowe was educated at the Christian Brothers' High School in that city.[2] He twice won the national amateur welterweight title, in 1930 and 1931.[3]

Lowe was one of three New Zealand boxers to compete at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.[4] Fighting in the middleweight division, Lowe lost his first round fight to Hans Bernlöhr, a German.[5]

After returning from the Olympic Games, Lowe turned professional, winning his first three fights,[6] including defeating George McEwan for the New Zealand professional middleweight title in Dunedin on 12 June 1933.[7] However, in a fight at Greymouth against Harry Lister on 21 October 1933, Lowe collapsed during the 12th round, and died two days later in Grey Hospital from a haemorrhage of the brain.[8] He was buried at Dunedin Southern Cemetery.[9]
