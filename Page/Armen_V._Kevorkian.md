He then merged to _Star Trek: Enterprise_, where he worked in effects for 70 episodes. He was then hired to coordinate visual effects for the two-part pilot of J.J. Abrams{{'}} _Lost_. He went on to work for Abrams again on the final season of _Alias_. His first job as a supervisor came with ABC{{'}}s new fall 2005 series _Invasion_.

Arrowverse

Having worked for prolific producer Greg Berlanti on _Brothers & Sisters_, _The Tomorrow People_, and _Political Animals_, Kevorkian joined him yet again for his new _Arrow_ spin-off _The Flash_. Working on the series he gained fame and recognition for his visual achievements. In 2015, Kevorkian boarded _Supergirl_, which was initially broadcast on CBS and not a part of The CW{{'}}s Arrowverse. However, after the conclusion of the first season the series moved to the sibling network. In 2016, Kevorkian began work on Berlanti's newest addition to the universe _DC's Legends of Tomorrow_. The same year, he made his directorial debut, helming _The Flash_{{'}}s second-season episode, "Rupture". He most recently directed the third episode of the third season, "Magenta". He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2015 for his work on the episode "Grodd Lives" of the series.[3]
