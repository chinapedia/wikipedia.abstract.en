ICHIRO MARUYAMA (22 May 1928 – 27 April 2013), who wrote under the pen name HIROSHI SANO, was a Japanese mystery writer and critic.


Early life

Maruyama was born in Omori, Tokyo City (now Tokyo, Ota-ku, Omori). In 1953, he graduated from the University of Tokyo Department of Psychology and began work as a part-time writer in Hokkaido for _Yomiuri Shimbun_. In 1958, he submitted essays to a weekly essay contest co-sponsored by _Asahi Shimbun_, for which he won third and second prizes. The following year, he published a novel titled _A Lead_, his official debut in the detective genre. In 1959, he left the newspaper. He produced over a thousand short stories, many of which were made into bunko, but the introduction of a consumption tax led to price revisions, and many publishers stopped printing them.

Shigero Kurosawa criticized his writing and described it as "novels that do not shed blood and sweat", that go through mystery as an intellectual game but in which, on the other hand, the patterns of work repeatedly become mannered, eliminating eccentric and large-scale crimes, creating realism and a characteristic moderation.[1]

Maruyama named Paul Winterton his favorite writer. He befriended other writers and maintained those friendships. Aside from close friend Satoshi Kuroiwa, his other friends included Kyo Takigawa, Norio Kono, Shinichi Hoshi, Tsutomu Mizukami and Shoji Yuki, young artists who formed a friendship ring they called a "murder club." The group later included Sasazawa Hidariho, Oyabu Haruhiko, Michio Tsuzuki, Jiro Ikushima, and Masako Togawa.

He won the Japan Mystery Literature Award in 1997 and the Kikuchi Kan Prize in 2009.

On April 27, 2013, he died of pneumonia in hospital at Kawasaki City. He was 84 years old.[2]
