IFEOLUWA ADENIKE DAMILOLA AJAYI known professionally as LUVVIE AJAYI (born January 5, 1985[1]) is a Nigerian author, speaker, and digital strategist.[2] Her first book, _I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual_, was a _New York Times_ best-seller_._[3]


Early life

Lovette Ajayi was born in Nigeria; she moved to Chicago with her family when she was nine. She attended Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago, then the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studying psychology.[4]


Career

Ajayi began her career in marketing and digital strategy, and started blogging in 2003. Her site AwesomelyLuvvie.com amassed a following, particularly for Ajayi's recaps of television shows like _Scandal_, drawing the attention of _Scandal_ showrunner Shonda Rhimes.[5] In 2016, _The New York Times_ reported that Ajayi had an audience of approximately 500,000 between her personal Twitter feed and the Awesomely Luvvie website.[6]

Ajayi published her first book, _I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual_, with Henry Holt & Co in September 2016; it debuted at number five on the _New York Times_ best-seller list.[7] Ajayi has said the inspiration for the book came after she learned a journalist had plagiarized several paragraphs of her writing—and when confronted, he said he was unaware he should have credited her work.[8] Consequently, a "return to ethics—a return to a higher level of behavior for oneself and others—becomes the central idea of Ajayi’s book," in _The Root_'s description, but the "collection of witty essays is less about pointing fingers and more about building a positive, healthy self and society."[9] _The Chicago Tribune_ called the book "whip-smart, take-no-prisoners hilarious."[10] Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers have acquired _I'm Judging You_ to adapt as a cable comedy series through their company Shondaland and ABC Signature.[11]

In 2016, Ajayi was the first writer invited to speak at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and her event sold out.[12]

In 2018, Ajayi launched two podcasts: "Rants and Randomness with Luvvie Ajayi"[13] and "Jesus and Jollof," cohosted by Yvonne Orji.[14]
