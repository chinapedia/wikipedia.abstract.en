CENTRAL STATION is an intermodal transportation terminal being constructed in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.[1] It initially serves the Ion light rail line and Grand River Transit local buses, with service to Via Rail and GO Transit trains,[2] as well as Greyhound, Coach Canada and GO Transit intercity buses, to come at a later date.

The station will replace the current Kitchener railway station and partially replace the Charles Street Terminal. Intercity bus services which currently depart from Charles Street will be relocated to the new Central terminal.

In the vicinity are the University of Waterloo's Health Sciences campus (including their School of Pharmacy); the 'One Victoria' condominium development; and the 'Kaufman Lofts' condominium (occupying the former Kaufman Footwear factory). Just north of the mainline tracks is a former industrial building, the 'Breithaupt Block', which currently houses offices of Google Canada.


Ion light rail

The light rail (LRT) station opened along with the start of LRT service in 2019, but as of 2016 there is no timeline for the construction of the remainder of the transit components. As a result, the intermodal facility will not open until 2022 at the earliest.[3]

The LRT platforms are located on either side of King Street in Kitchener, on the north side of Victoria Street.[4] North of the station, the LRT tracks become adjacent through the Moore/Breithaupt intersection and proceed within the median of King beyond, towards Waterloo. South of the station, the tracks split: southbound, they take Victoria to reach Charles Street, which they follow alongside; northbound, they continue along King to Francis Street, which connects them to Duke Street, which they follow alongside.

The platforms are connected with King Street's sidewalks at either end, and pedestrians passing through walk along the platform. The station's feature walls consist of glass tiles in a varying pattern of blues and greys and displays "Innovation District" under the station's name.
