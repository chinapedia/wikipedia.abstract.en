PAUL WILLIAMS "TOMMY" THOMPSON (19 December 1906 in Alliance, Nebraska – 9 February 1996 in Daytona Beach, Florida) was an American Colonel in the United States Army during World War II. He also was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross which was awarded for having distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy in circumstances which do not justify the award of the Medal of Honor.

Retiring from the Army as a brigadier general in 1946, he was hired by Reader's Digest, and rose to global business manager, at which point he insisted owner DeWitt Wallace institute a rule of mandatory retirement for executives at age 65, but later proved reluctant when Wallace in turn insisted that Thompson himself comply with this rule.[1][2]
