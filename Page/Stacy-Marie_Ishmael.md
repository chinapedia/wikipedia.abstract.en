Career

She was born and raised in San Fernando, Trinidad, where she went to Naparima Girls' High School, graduating in 2002 and then moving to Europe.[1] She attended University of Franche-Comté and the London School of Economics, going on to become in 2006 a graduate trainee at the _Financial Times_ (_FT_).[2] There, Ishmael started Alphaville, one of the _FT_{{'}}s first blogs.[3] _Business Insider_ described her work as "ridiculously knowledgeable" as well as "great on camera" in appearances for CNBC. Ishmael has also drawn praise for "astute" commentary on hiring and organizational diversity.[4]

After five years at the _FT_, Ishmael departed for technology company Percolate,[5] but returned in 2013 to the _FT_, where she became vice-president for communities,[6] working with the FT Live series that produces 200 events a year.[7]

Ishmael moved to BuzzFeed in 2014[8] as managing editor of mobile news as the company developed a news app, which launched in June 2015.[9] She has also been a regular guest on BuzzFeed's popular podcast _Another Round_, hosting a segment called "Stacy's Career Corner". _The Frisky_ praised Ishmael's advice for negotiations as "absolutely required listening for anyone who’s ever been afraid of walking into a room and asking for what they want"[10] and said her recurring segment "is competent, clear-headed and extremely useful. It’s the kind of advice you wish you had when faced with a work challenge; it’s the advice you want when navigating the trenches of a workplace peppered with microaggressions and untoward overtures...It’s the kind of advice I wish I’d had when I was a young person figuring out how to navigate a world that they don’t prepare you for in college."[11]

In 2016–17 Ishmael was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford.[12]
