Plot

Brian and Stewie watch an extended director's cut of _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_. Lois enters stating that the movie is not appropriate and changes the channel to a baby-appropriate show starring Turtlenecks (a parody of The Wiggles). Stewie feels as though that the baby songs in the show are lacking in quality. Challenged by Brian, Stewie decides to write songs for babies that address actual baby related issues. Stewie and Brian form a band they call 'Red Shirt, Blue Shirt', and he books a gig at a children's party. While there, they meet Olivia Fuller, who somehow managed to survive the playhouse fire in _Chick Cancer_. After the song, they are given a positive reception, which Olivia mysteriously surveys. Just as the duo is about to celebrate, Olivia comes up and states that she and Stewie are going on a date, much to Brian's disappointment. Olivia becomes president of Brian and Stewie's fan club, making Brian uncomfortable, but Stewie is laid-back about it. Stewie and Brian perform at a number of gigs. At Cheesie Charlie's, after Brian leaves for a minute, Olivia says in confidence to Stewie that at the end of every gig, everybody gives Brian the attention and not Stewie, and Stewie impulsively believes this.

Meanwhile, Chris asks his parents for money for a shamrock tattoo, but his parents tell him to get a job. Chris has a difficult time searching for employment, but when he and Peter help Lois unload groceries, they notice Quagmire sending away a potential sex partner. Quagmire tells Peter that he is unable to manage his personal life. Peter offers Chris as his personal assistant, and both Chris and Quagmire eventually agree after initial hesitation. After showing Chris the ropes, Quagmire sees that Chris makes an excellent assistant, following another stand with another one of his sexual clients.

While rehearsing, Stewie asks that Brian's microphone be cut off, irking the dog, and the duo have a spat that ends with Stewie walking off. Afterwards, Olivia approaches Brian and tells him that they should kick Stewie out of the band. Brian is at first hesitant, but Olivia states that Stewie is contemplating on firing Brian, provoking Brian to fire Stewie, and Olivia takes his place in the band.

When Lois finds out about Chris' job upon finding Quagmire's sex toys in the dishwasher, she calls Quagmire's house, only to receive a voice message made by Chris. They approach Chris, who is walking a horse gimp (which is actually Mort Goldman in a horse costume), and Lois tells him to quit. Chris refuses stating that he's getting paid for the job, prompting Lois to nonchalantly say that she has $1,100 in a paint can in the garage, and will give it to Chris if he agrees to quit. Chris does so, as she plans not to speak of Chris' job again.

Doing another gig while opening for the Turtlenecks, Brian sees Stewie in the crowd and tells Olivia that he cannot do this anymore since Stewie is responsible for instigating the band. However, Olivia coldly shows no pity, prompting Brian to quit. Brian finds Stewie and apologizes for his actions. The duo reconcile and Brian reveals that Olivia got a new dog to join the band. They assume it is one they never met. That dog turns out to be Vinny as he and Olivia perform at their latest gig.
