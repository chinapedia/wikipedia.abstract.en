DURLABHA-RÄ€JA I (r. c. 784-809 CE ) was an Indian ruler belonging to the Chahamana dynasty. He ruled parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India as a vassal of the Gurjara-Pratihara king Vatsaraja.

Durlabha was the son of the Chahamana king Chandraraja I, and succeeded his uncle (Chandraraja's brother) Gopendraraja.

The _Prithviraja Vijaya_ states that Durlabha's sword bathed in _Ganga-sagara_ (presumably the confluence of the Ganga river and the ocean), and tasted the sweet juice of Gauda. This refers to Durlabha's military achievements in the Gauda region. His son Guvaka is known to have been a vassal of the Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II. This suggests that Durlabha was also a feudatory of the Pratiharas, most probably that of Nagabhata's father Vatsaraja. He appears to have achieved his victories in Gauda during Vatsaraja's campaign against the Pala king Dharmapala. R. C. Majumdar theorized that "Gauda" here refers to the Ganga-Yamuna Doab in present-day Uttar Pradesh. Dasharatha Sharma, on the other hand, identifies it with the Gauda region in Bengal, which was the core Pala territory. Both Vatsaraja and Dharmapala were later subdued by the Rashtrakuta king Dhruva. As Dhruva died in 793 CE, Durlabha military successes in Gauda can be dated before this year.

Durlabha was succeeded by his son Govindaraja I alias Guvaka.
