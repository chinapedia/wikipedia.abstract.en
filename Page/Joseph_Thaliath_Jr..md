JOSEPH THALIATH JR. is an Indian film director and producer.[1]


Early life

Hailing from a Christian family, he was the son of a High Court Judge in Thiruvananthapuram when it was known as Trivandrum in the Princely State of Travancore before independence. After completing his degree, he developed a flair for cinema and, much against his father's wishes, went to Madras (now Chennai) and worked as an assistant to a multi lingual film director called S. Soundararajan (S. Soundararaja Aiyengar, owner of the Tamil Nadu Talkies Laboratory.[2]).


Career

F. Nagoor was an art director, film producer and a partner of Newtone studios in Chennai. Joseph Thaliath Jr. joined him as a partner. With the help of F. Nagoor, he launched a new film company named Citadel Film Corporation. He wrote a story based on a Christian folklore and together with F. Nagoor, produced and directed the film _Gnana Soundari_. The film was released in 1948 and was a great success.

Following the success of _Gnana Soundari_, he established his own studio and named it as "Citadel Studios", inspired by the A. J. Cronin novel _The Citadel_.[3] It was built on a spacious plot in Kilpauk, Chennai with two entrances. One entrance faced Poonamallee High Road and the other, Landon's Road.

In 1950, he wrote, produced and directed _Ithaya Geetham_, all on his own. The film was shot mostly in his Citadel Studios. He later dubbed the film into Hindi with the title _Jeeva Taara_.[4]

Film stars C. L. Anandan of Vijayapuri Veeran fame and Jaishankar were introduced to the screen by Joseph Thaliath Jr.[5]
