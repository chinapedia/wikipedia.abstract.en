Sarafa is the only market in India which remains as a jewellery marketplace at daytime and converts itself into a street food court at night.[2] The market consists of two sub-markets namely Bada Sarafa Bazaar and Chhota Sarafa Bazaar. Indore's Sarafa Bazaar is a popular tourist place because of its cuisine and night lifestyle.[3]
