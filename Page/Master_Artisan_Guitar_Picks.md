MASTER_ARTISAN_GUITAR_PICK.jpg MASTER ARTISAN GUITAR PICKS, also known as _Nashville Picks_[1] is a brand of guitar picks created by Nashville, Tennessee musician, producer, artist and picksmith[2] Dustin Michael Headrick.[3] These guitar picks are handcrafted from a variety of materials including antique metals, cymbals, coins, wood, glass, bone, animal horn, natural stone, clay, vinyl records, Acrylic and Formica (plastic).[4] The guitar picks are recognized as being extremely aesthetic, having liquid smooth beveled edges that glide across the guitar strings without causing string wear, create a unique tonal palette, and improve the sound of the electric guitar and acoustic guitar.[5]
