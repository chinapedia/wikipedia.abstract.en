SANTA FRANCESCO is a Roman Catholic church in the town limits of Trecate, province of Novara, Piedmont, Italy.


History

Franciscans arrived to this town in 1494, and occupied a convent formerly of nuns of the Umiliati order. That convent had been established in the 13th-century. In 1514, the convent was assigned to the Franciscans.[1] The church was rebuilt in the 17th century in its present layout.

A 1985 restoration of the church uncovered frescoes (1595) attributed to il Cerano, depicting the _Conversion of St Paul_. It is documented that the frescoes were commissioned by the Cicogna family from Trecate. The vault of the choir contains frescoes depicting _Scenes from the Bible_ by Carlo Francesco Nuvolone.[2]
