The participation of POLAND IN THE TURKVISION SONG CONTEST was expected to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Turkvision Song Contest 2016. The national broadcaster responsible for the selection process of Poland's participants has yet to be known. Poland had selected Olga Shimanskaya with her song "Masal gibi bu dünya", as their debut entry. However, the 2016 contest was subsequently cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings. Poland confirmed on 28 February 2017 that they will make their debut at the Turkvision Song Contest 2017, with the same representative they had selected for the 2016 edition.


Origins of the contest

Turkvision is an annual song contest which was created by TÜRKSOY in cooperation with the Turkish music channel TMB TV. Based on the similar format of the Eurovision Song Contest, Turkvision focuses primarily on participating Turkic countries and regions. The participating countries and regions have to take part in the Semi Final. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. An amount of 12 to 15 nations qualify for the Grand Final where the jury determines the winner. TÜRKSOY has stated that televoting is going to be introduced in the future.[1] Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the Turkish Capital of Culture.[2]
