Work

Ervinck creates, in his own words, a dialogue between craft and technology, and between the virtual and the physical. His shapes are inspired by the work of Henry Moore (1898–1986), Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975) and Hans Arp (1886-1966). The futuristic blob architecture (a term of Greg Lynn) and the work of Zaha Hadid also inspire him. Ervinck often used the color yellow in his work, but also other colors. ^([1])
