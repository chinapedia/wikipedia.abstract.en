_NOI DONNE_ (meaning _We Women_ in English) is an Italian language monthly feminist magazine published in Rome, Italy. It is one of the most significant feminist publications in the country.[1]


History and profile

_Noi donne_ was illegally published between 1937 and 1939 in Paris by the Italian women exiled there before its official start in 1944.[2][3][4] Its publication was possible only after the liberation of Rome.[5] The founders led by Valentina Palumbo[6] and Adele Cambria[7] were communist women.[8] The headquarters of the magazine was in Naples, then it moved to Rome.[9] From 1945 to the 1990s it was the official magazine of the Unione Donne in Italia (UDI; Union of Italian Women).[10] The Union was closely connected to and financed by the Italian Communist Party (PCI).[11] The magazine is circulated monthly, and its website was launched in 2004.[12] It was previously published on a weekly basis.[13][14]

_Noi donne_ was not established as a magazine targeting bourgeois Italian women.[15] Its target audience is women on the left.[16] Maria Casalini claimed that the magazine was instrumental in introducing Italian women to the political arena of democratic Italy.[17] However, at the beginning of the 1950s its focus was on entertainment, daily life and culture.[18] Later, the magazine again began to cover articles on politics, social change, culture, women's equality, violence against women and health.[19][20] In 2001 _Newsweek_ described _Noi donne_ as a popular semifeminist magazine.[21] In addition, it was less feminist than other magazines such as _Effe_ and _Differenze_.[22]

The editors of _Noi donne_ have been women.[23] Maria Antonietta Macciocchi, an Italian politician and writer, served as the editor of the magazine[24][25] from 1950 to 1956.[26][27] She replaced Fidia Gambetti in the post.[28] Bia Sarasini was the cultural editor during the 1990s.[29]

In the 1970s _Noi donne_ enjoyed higher levels of circulation.[30]
