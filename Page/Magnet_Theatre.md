MAGNET THEATRE is an independent physical theatre company based in Cape Town, South Africa. It was formed in 1987 by Mark Fleishman and Jennie Reznek who have since been the company's artistic directors. Besides creating original theatre productions, Magnet Theatre is actively engaged in youth development work in the Cape Town area as well as in the Cederberg Municipality.


History

Magnet Theatre was founded in 1987 to produce _Cheap Flights_ (director: Roz Monat), starring Reznek. It re-emerged in 1991 to produce _The Show's Not over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings_ (director: Mark Fleishman), again starring Reznek. The show toured nationally and internationally for two and a half years.[1]

In 1994, Magnet Theatre returned to South Africa. For the next few years, the company focused mainly on its professional theatre productions. These included eight collaborations with Cape Town-based Jazzart Dance Theatre between 1994 and 2007 (including _Medea_, _Rain in a Dead Man's Footprints_, and _Cargo_); stage adaptations of Herman Melville's _Moby Dick_ (1994) and Mia Couto's _Voices Made Night_ (2000/01); two performance pieces with Jennie Reznek (1997/2002); and four outdoor productions between 1998 and 2011.

In 1998, Magnet Theatre established the _Magnet Theatre Educational Trust_ dedicating itself to training and developing skills for impoverished and marginalised youth.

In 2001, Magnet Theatre initiated several youth development projects in addition to its theatre and performance productions. These include the _Clanwilliam Arts Project_ (2001-2018); the _Community Groups Intervention_ in Khayelitsha (2002-2007); the _Community Arts Development_ in Clanwilliam (since 2007, which grew out of the Clanwilliam Arts Project); the _Culture Gangs Project_ (since 2011); and the _Farm Schools Project_ (since 2014).

In 2006, Magnet Theatre produced _Every Year, Every Day, I Am Walking_ (director: Mark Fleishman) for the _African Festival of Youth and Children's Theatre_. The piece about refugees in Africa subsequently toured five continents from 2007-2014 and was published in 2011[2]. It was part of a focus on migration which included works in isiXhosa and Afrikaans: _ingcwaba lendoda lise cankwe ndlela_ (2009) and _Inxeba Lomphilisi_ (2010), both directed by Mandla Mbothwe, and _Die Vreemdeling_ (director: Mark Fleishman).

In 2008, Magnet Theatre initiated a two-year _Fulltime Training and Job Creation Programme_. Since then, 58 trainees from townships in and around Cape Town have participated in the programme. As part of their training, each group of trainees has created several theatre productions. Among these are pieces in isiXhosa as well as a collaboration with the Cape Town Opera and young singers from the Cape Town Opera Studio (_Heart of Redness_, 2013).

In 2013, Magnet Theatre initiated a creative focus on Early Years performance and training, developing performances for under seven-year-olds. Their first piece, _TREE/BOOM/UMTHI_ (director: Jennie Reznek) toured the Cape Town townships, Italy, Germany, the UK, and the US. Since then Magnet Theatre has produced five new Early Years works that have been performed in crèches and aftercare centres in Cape Town, the Cederberg Municipality, and Okiep. One of the pieces, _SCOOP: kitchen play for carers and babes_ (director: Koleka Putuma), was the first ever South African work for mothers/fathers and babies under the age of 12 months.
