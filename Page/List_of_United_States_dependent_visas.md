A DEPENDENT UNITED STATES VISA is a type of visa which allows spouses and children to travel to the United States for the purpose of accompanying a family member with a corresponding visa type. While many visa classes have their own dependent visa, others do not. Some of these require all family members to apply for the same visa class, such as E-2 and C-2 visas. Others such as the D-1 visa do not allow travel for dependents at all.[1] Certain restrictions apply depending on the type of dependent visa an individual is seeking.
