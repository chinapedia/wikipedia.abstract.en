MAX GIESINGER (born 3 October 1988) is a German singer-songwriter and musician from Waldbronn, Germany. He first gained widespread popularity with his single _80 Millionen_, placing as high as second position in the German charts. His music is usually labeled as pop and pop-rock.


Early life

Giesinger grew up in Waldbronn, which is in Baden-Württemberg and belongs to the administrative district Karlsruhe. At the age of 13, he played in his first band the _Deadly Punks_. At the age of 20, he played in the bands _Bud Spencer Group_, _Sovereign Point_ and as a solo project _Maxville,_ and completed 70 performances per year.[1] He completed his high school diploma at the Gymnasium Karlsbad. After graduating from high school, he travelled to Australia and New Zealand where he worked as a street musician for a work & travel program.[2]


Music career

Following his return to Germany, Giesinger applied to the Baden-Württemberg Pop Academy in Mannheim, but was not admitted as a student because he did not pass the entrance examination. He participated in the singing casting show The Voice of Germany in 2011 after being approached by the producers. With the help of his coach Xavier Naidoo, he reached the final of the show on 10 February 2012, in which he finished fourth. His song _Dach der Welt_ reached 14th place on the German charts.[3]Saarspektakel_2014_(5138),_Max_Giesinger.jpg stage at the Saarspektakel 2014 in Saarbrücken]]This was followed by a tour of Germany with performances in twelve cities. In 2013, Giesinger published his EP _Unser Sommer_ and then went on his second tour of Germany. Max_Giesinger_-_Leverkusener_Jazztage_2017-5093.jpg 20171105-H14A0310.jpgn 2017]]

After separating himself from his label for personal differences, Giesinger launched a Crowdfunding campaign in February 2014 to finance his first album. He reached the financing goal within 24 hours. His debut album "_Laufen lernen" is_ published by Giesinger himself with the help of _Rent a Record Company_. However, he failed to build on the success of his time at The Voice of Germany.[4] In April 2016, Giesinger released his second album _Der Junge, der rennt,_ managing to win label rights with BMG. In addition, the pre-released single _80 millionen_ developed into a radio success and rose into the German charts in April 2016. Two weeks later, the album reached 20th place in the charts in Germany and also rose to the Swiss charts. Giesinger recorded a new version of _80 Milionen_ for UEFA Euro 2016 which quickly rose and finished second in the German charts.[5][6] On 16 September 2016, Giesinger released a second single _Wenn sie tanzt_ which reached the top 10 of the German single's chart_._[7]
