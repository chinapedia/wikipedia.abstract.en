The HYPOGEUM OF SANT'IROXI (also known as the _Tomb of the warriors_) is an archaeological site located near the town of Decimoputzu in the province of South Sardinia. Fig._18_Le_spade_Sant_Iroxi_in_rame_arsenicato.jpg The site (a domus de janas), discovered in 1987, dates back to 3000 BC in the late Neolithic Age,[1] and was used for about 1,500 years by the nearby village to which it belonged, from the Ozieri culture period until that of Bonnannaro.

It owes its name to the large number of skeletons (more than 200), deposited in 13 chronological strata, and for the rich military kit, dated to c. 1650-1600 BC, which includes swords and daggers of arsenical copper (19 in all). The swords and triangular blades range in length from 27 up to 66Â cm and show some similarities to the swords of the El Argar culture (Spain).[2] The kit is kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari.
