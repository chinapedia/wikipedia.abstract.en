The HELLO BITCHES TOUR (stylized as HELLO BI+CHES TOUR) was the debut concert tour of South Korean singer CL.[1][2][3] The tour visited nine cities in 2016 in the United States and Canada, kicking off in New York City's Hammerstein Ballroom on 29 October and concluding in Toronto at the Sound Academy on 14 November.

The setlist consisted mostly of CL's previous work with K-pop girl group 2NE1.

The tour was promoted by SIVA Entertainment Group.


Background and development

On 23 September 2016 YG Entertainment announced that CL would hold her first American tour. She will visit nine cities in North America, with a total of nine shows.[4] The tour's name derives from CL's 2015 Korean language single "Hello Bitches". The tour's announcement followed the release of CL's debut American single "Lifted" on 19 August, amid news of an upcoming English-language debut EP.


Controversy

On 7 November, fans and concertgoers had noticed that CL had been using the "controversial" version of her song "MTBD (Mental Breakdown)" since the tour started.[5] CL apologized on her Twitter account stating that her "engineer [had] sent the old version for [the] tour".[6] CL performed the alternative version for the later shows.[7]
