On September 11, 1951, an Egyptian newspaper, _al-Ahram_, published a fatwa on whether or not the consumption of the soft drinks Coca-Cola and Pepsi were allowed under Islamic law. The mufti, or Islamic judge, Hasanayn al-Makhluf was the individual who ruled on this matter.[1] The reason that this was investigated under Islamic law was because of rumors and conspiracies spreading among the public about these brands. One of these conspiracies was that the Coca-Cola logo, when reflected in a mirror, spelled out "No Mohammed no Mecca" in Arabic.[2]


Issuing the fatwa

Mufti Hasanayn al-Makhluf explained in this fatwa that all foods and drinks are assumed to be permissible under Islamic law unless found otherwise. According to the fatwa, if a person does not know the condition or ingredients of a food or beverage, its consumption is permitted until its nature is determined. Thus, the results of this fatwa would serve to remove the uncertainty regarding the consumption of cola beverages such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. In order to get an accurate answer on whether or not Pepsi and Coca-Cola were prohibited by Islamic law, the Department of Fatwas collaborated with the Ministry of Public Health in order to ascertain the composition of the two sodas. On August 25, 1951, the Ministry of Public Health wrote to the Department of Fatwas to share their findings. They found that neither Pepsi-Cola nor Coca-Cola had any narcotics, alcohol, or pepsin present in them.[3] The use of narcotics and the consumption of alcohol are both prohibited under Islamic law. Pepsin is created from the membrane of pig stomachs, and any product coming from a pig is not permitted under Muslim Sharia law.[4] The Ministry of Public Health goes on to explain that the drinks also have no harmful microbes in them. Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Public Health that assured the Department of Fatwas of the lack of narcotics, alcohol, pepsin, and microbes in both Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola, Hasanayn al-Makhluf declared the drinks to be permissible under Islamic law.[5]
