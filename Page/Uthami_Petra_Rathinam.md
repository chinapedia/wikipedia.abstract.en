Reception

Though the film had a formidable cast, interesting dialogues and pleasing music, it did not do well at the box-office, mainly because of the complicated and familiar story line. Film historian Randor Guy wrote in 2014 that the film is "remembered for the impressive performances of Balaji, Malini, Rajam, Pandari Bai, Sahasranamam, and Subbaiah and the comedy scenes of Rajagopal and Manorama.[6]
