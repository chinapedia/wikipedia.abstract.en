Three of the trawlers were destroyed; a fourth vessel headed back out to sea and, because it got more than away from the coast and reached international waters, the U.S. Navy was forbidden from firing on the North Vietnamese ship. "American patrol boats were powerless to do anything except to request the flagless, unmarked trawler to identify itself. It refused and continued unscratched." An unidentified navy officer told the UPI, "Sure it's crazy, but it's the rules of the game." [3]

That evening, the new organization, Oriental Actors of America, picketed the opening of the Broadway musical _Here's Where I Belong_ at the Billy Rose Theatre; the producers had bypassed Chinese-American actors to cast the role of a Chinese servant character, and awarded the part to a white actor in makeup.[13]
-   Television Wales and the West (TWW) an independent British TV network known in some areas of Wales as Teledu Cymru, broadcast its last original programming.

Almost two years later, another Air France Flight 212 on the same Santiago to Paris route would crash after taking off from Caracas to Pointe-à-Pitre, killing all 62 people on board.
-   What would become known as the "East L.A. walkouts" began in large numbers when thousands of Hispanic students walked out of two high schools in East Los Angeles, California. At Garfield High School, which would later become famous in the film _Stand and Deliver_, "2,700 of the 3,750 predominantly Mexican-American students" walked across the street when classes were dismissed for lunch, and refused to come back inside until the day's end. Hispanic students also walked out of Jefferson High School, where African American students were in the majority.[27][28]

In a speech to Congress titled "The Forgotten American", Johnson said, "The American Indian, once proud and free, is torn between white and tribal values; between the politics and language of the white man and his own historic culture. His problems, sharpened by years of defeat and exploitation, neglect and inadequate effort, will take years to overcome." [30]

Under the agreement, the three nuclear superpowers offered joint protection to any nation that ratified what would become the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The U.S., the U.S.S.R. and U.K. "pledged immediate assistance for any treaty signator which feels it is being threatened by nuclear attack or becomes the victim of nuclear aggression." [33]
-   Chemical dispersants were first used successfully in the cleanup of an oil spill after the tanker ship _General Colocotronis_ struck a reef outside the Eleuthera group of islands of the Bahamas and spilled 37,500 barrels (6,000 cubic meters) of heavy fuel oil in the Caribbean Sea. While some oil reached the Bahamian beaches, most was diluted by the spraying of 250 drums of dispersant from a fireboat and from trucks at the beach. After two months, the oil slick had been dispersed and diluted, cleanup was completed and the tanker was salvaged; a study by British marine biologists concluded that there was "no damage to the intertidal marine life following the use of dispersant".[34]
-   A drunk, and apparently suicidal, driver killed himself and 19 passengers on a Greyhound bus outside of Baker, California when he drove westward on the Interstate 15 eastbound lanes and caused both his car and the bus to burst into flames.[35] Michael Barry, a 39-year old cook who was reportedly "depressed over a divorce and failure to have a song published."

In 2005, authors Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond would advance the theory in their bestselling book, _Red Star Rogue: The Untold Story of a Soviet Submarine's Nuclear Strike Attempt on the U.S._, that _K-129_ had actually been trying to launch a nuclear warhead at Hawaii's Pearl Harbor and that the failed launch had caused the submarine's demise.
-   A political crisis in Poland was sparked by the first student protests seen in that nation since its Communist takeover.

-   U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson barely edged out antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, the opening event in nominations for the 1968 U.S. presidential election.[67] The vote highlighted deep divisions in the country, and the party, over Vietnam, and would demonstrate President Johnson's increasing unpopularity. Johnson received 49.6% of the votes cast, but U.S. Senator McCarthy of Minnesota— who had campaigned on a platform of ending U.S. involvement in Vietnam— got 41.9% despite being relatively unknown outside of his home state.[68] The result, "which demonstrated that Johnson was vulnerable" [69] to being defeated for re-election, would prompt other candidates to challenge the President.

A F-4 aircraft had sprayed 320 gallons of the nerve agent VX in a target deep within the restricted proving ground, then released the emptied tanks. Two days later, ranchers in Skull Valley in Tooele County, Utah, began reporting that their herds of sheep had become ill, with 6,400 of the animals becoming seriously ill; those that did not die from the gas exposure would be euthanized.[70] Initially, the Army denied that it had conducted any outdoor nerve gas tests in more than a year; on March 21, however, the Army Testing Command would acknowledge the test in a letter to U.S. Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah, and "an aide to the Senator... ignored or was unaware of the fact that the Pentagon regarded the letter as private and released it to the press." [71] No human beings were affected by the VX contamination, but the U.S. Army would admit its negligence and pay $376,000 to compensate farmers for their lost livestock, and another $198,000 for the damage to their grazing lands.[72]

-   The Philippine Army summarily executed 28 Moro Muslim soldiers who had mutinied after not being properly paid by the Army while training. While there is a dispute as to the circumstances of the execution, including whether it actually happened, news of the event would be "an important factor giving rise to the founding of the Muslim Independence Movement" with the Muslim minority seeking autonomy or independence in the southern Philippine islands in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.[107]
-   Two adults were killed, and 28 high school students from the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium were wounded when an Israeli school bus was blasted by a Palestinian fedayeen land mine that had been planted in the road near Israel's border with Jordan. The bus had been making a field trip from Tel Aviv to the Negev Desert and struck the mine near Be'er Ora, 12 miles north of Eilat.[108][109] Israeli Defense Forces would retaliate with an attack on the Jordanian village of Karameh.[110]
-   The U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued nationwide guidelines to prevent racial discrimination, "applying the racial rules for the first time to the entire nation rather than to the South alone".[111]

-   In a ceremony that was not reported until a week after it happened, the American flag was lowered at Japan's Iwo Jima after 23 years. A group of about 50 American servicemen climbed to Mount Suribachi, where a U.S. flag had flown since February 23, 1945, during the bloody Battle of Iwo Jima, and "Suribachi was one of the few places in the world where the American flag flew 24 hours a day instead of from dawn to sunset".[112] The lowering came as the United States prepared to return Iwo Jima and the neighboring Bonin islands before year's end. After the old flagpole was removed, a copper replica of the U.S. flage was placed at the Iwo Jima Memorial.[113]

March 19, 1968 (Tuesday)

-   Student protests began at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and were marked by "the first building takeover on a college campus",[115] signalling a new era of militant student activism on American college campuses. For five days, students staged a sit-in of the administration building, temporarily shutting down the historically-black university.[116] The impetus for the demonstration was the punishment of 37 students who had disrupted the university's Charter Day celebration on March 1.[117] Additional causes that were protested the school's ROTC program and military recruitment; the disproportionate number of African-Americans being sent into combat in the Vietnam War; and the lack of curriculum of African-American studies.
-   In response to the student protests at Warsaw, the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, Wladyslaw Gomulka, blamed the uprising on Zionist revisionists" and told his fellow Communists that there were three types of Polish Jews—the "patriotic Jews" who were loyal to the government; Zionists who wanted to undermine the state; and "cosmopolitans" "who were neither Jews nor Poles" and who tended to avoid any line of work toward building the socialist fatherland.[118] When the complete text of the speech was published in the Soviet Union, Gomulka's demand that Zionist Jews be encouraged to leave Poland, had the "unplanned effect of reinforcing the hopes of many Soviet Jews eager to emigrate to Israel or the West." [119]
-   The United Kingdom's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Roy Jenkins, announced a 10% increase in taxes in the form of higher surcharges on alcohol, tobacco, gasoline and oil, and gambling, as well as a long list of consumer goods. The move was made to add £774 million ($2.2 billion) to the budget.[120] The basic British income tax rate of 41.25%, however, remained the same.[121]

The destruction of the tower brought down two 115,000 volt transmission lines, cutting off power to the University of California and to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. Power at the radiation laboratory was quickly fixed by emergency backup generators, and the PG & E utility restored partial service to the university by 8:00 in the morning. Two days later, the aerial cable of Pacific Bell was brought down in Contra Costa County, disrupting phone service in Berkeley and Oakland.[123]

Ten hours later, IDF retreated back across the border, but not before 28 of its members had been killed and 90 wounded. The Palestinians had more than ten times the number of casualties, but the legend of their defense against superior numbers would lead to more Palestinians joining the fight against Israel.[126]
-   Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York surprised supporters who had been expecting him to challenge former Vice President Richard Nixon for the Republican Party nomination for President. "Quite frankly," Rockefeller said, "I want it clear at this time that the majority of party leaders want the candidacy of Richard Nixon at this time. It would therefore be illogical and unreasonable that I would try to arouse their support.[127]
-   Australia's ban on the _Kama Sutra_ was lifted by order of Senator Malcolm Scott, the Minister for Customs, who announced his decision to take Vātsyāyana's classic 2nd Century book, known for its descriptions of "the art of making love", off of the federal list of banned books. "[128]

A reporter at the time noted that Novotny's resignation "was the first time a Communist leader has been removed by public pressure." [131] Two months earlier, Novotný had been replaced in the more powerful job of General Secretary of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party by Alexander Dubček. Czechoslovakia's National Assembly voted, 282 to 6, to name Ludvík Svoboda as the new President.,[132] causing alarm in the other Communist nations of Eastern Europe and would "mark the beginning of the Prague Spring, a period of high hopes that ran into the summer, underscored by Dubček's pledge: 'There is only one path and that is forward.'" [133]
-   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who soon be nicknamed "Danny the Red", and 150 other students occupied the eighth-floor faculty lounge in the administration building at University of Paris X Nanterre, commonly referred to as the University of Nanterre.[134] The action, originally set to protest the arrest of six Nanterre students who had been protesting the Vietnam War, would set in motion a chain of events that would lead France to the brink of revolution in May.[135] After the publication of their demands, the students left the building without any trouble, but the incident would become known as the "Movement of 22 March".[136]
-   U.S. Army General William C. Westmoreland, who had guided the military operations in the Vietnam War since 1964, was recalled by President Johnson, effective July 2. General Westmoreland was reassigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as Johnson changed American conduct of the war.[137]

The meeting was attended, without notice, by several generals from the Soviet Union's Red Army. Dubcek of Czechoslovakia was heavily criticized by the other leaders, starting with his counterpart from Poland, Wladyslaw Gomulka [138] However, no plan for suppressing the reforms was recommended at the meeting, and Dubcek would report later that the other states pledged to maintain their policy of "non-interference in internal affairs." [139]

-   Marco Aurelio Robles was removed from office as President of Panama after that nation's National Assembly voted, 29 to 0, to convict him on articles of impeachment following a ten-day trial. Another 12 deputies who were supporters of Robles had boycotted the trial. First Vice President Max Delvalle was then administered the oath of office, but Robles refused to accept the legislative decision. General Bolívar Vallarino, commander of the Panamanian National Guard, announced that it would keep Robles in office.[143] The Guard invaded the opposition party headquarters after midnight and began making arrests, then barred the deputies from entering the legislative building. On April 5, Panama's Supreme Court ruled, 8 to 2, that Robles had been deprived of his right to a fair trial, and that Robles was legally the President.[144]

March 26, 1968 (Tuesday)

-   U.S. President Lyndon Johnson met with his group of advisers, led by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, who had come to be known as "The Wise Men". After long supporting and encouraging Johnson's conduct of the Vietnam War, a majority of the group informed him bluntly that "an American military solution in Vietnam was no longer attainable" and that he should take steps to disengage the U.S. from further participation.[150] Another author would note that former Secretary of State Dean Dean Acheson told Johnson "the financial and social costs of the struggle... would be hard for the United States to sustain" and noted that "The Wisemen's conclusion that the United States had to find a new way out of Vietnam rocked Johnson as nothing else had."

After a few hours, the protesters left, and Columbia's Dean of Students ordered Rudd and five other student leaders to report to his office for discipline action. The student protests at the university would attract more participants the following month.[152]
-   The Gallup Poll organization announced the results of a cross-section survey of 1,145 registered voters and noted that, for the first time in opinion surveys, Richard M. Nixon was favored over U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace in a three-way race. Nixon's was favored by 41% of voters, Johnson by 39% and Wallace by 11%.

-   Ozark Airlines Flight 965 from Sioux Falls, South Dakota to St. Louis, a DC-9 jetliner, was in a collision with a small Cessna 150 as both aircraft made approached the Lambert-St. Louis Airport. The Ozark captain, Russell J. Fitch, was able to regain control of the jet after its right wing had been clipped by the Cessna and sustained a fuel tank rupture. Witnesses reported that the Cessna apparently banked to the left and into the path of the DC-9 as the two planes prepared to land on separate runways.

-   Lyndon Johnson announced, in a nationally televised address, that he would not seek re-election as President of the United States.[177] One historian would write later that the speech was "a political event that would wreck not only the Democratic Party but the liberal consensus that Democrats had forged in the 1960s." [178] Another would note that the speech "marked a critical turning point in the Vietnam War" as Johnson put a limit on the increasing deployment of ground troops, a halt to bombing north of the 20th parallel, and an offer of unconditional peace negotiations with North Vietnam.[179] Johnson began speaking from the White House at 9:00 in the evening, and continued for 35 minutes in describing why he had committed to fighting the war; and then he spoke about his own career, observing that Americans had united to make "a stronger nation, a more just society, and a land of greater opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement." "What we won when all of our people united," he added, "just must not now be lost in suspicion, distrust, selfishness, and politics among any of our people." Those people still listening at 9:40 p.m. were stunned when Johnson concluded his address by saying, "With America's sons in the fields far away; with America's future under challenge right here at home; with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office--the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President." [180][181]
