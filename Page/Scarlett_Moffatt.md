Career

On 24 September 2013, it was confirmed that Moffatt would be appearing in MTV's new series _Beauty School Cop Outs_, which follows British and Irish youngsters as they move to a beauty school in Manchester to learn the tricks of the trade.[5]

In 2014, Moffatt became a regular cast member on the Channel 4 reality TV show _Gogglebox_ alongside her parents Mark and Betty, making their debut in the third series in March 2014. Scarlett's younger sister Ava-Grace joined the family on the sofa during the seventh series; her then boyfriend Luke Crodden first appeared in the eighth series. Her relationship with Luke ended in March 2017. Moffatt has not appeared in _Gogglebox_ since her appearance in _I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!_[6]

On 30 November 2015 she joined the presenting team for _Capital Breafast_ on Capital North East.[7] On 16 December 2016 it was understood she had left this role.[8]

On 8 November 2016, it was confirmed that Moffatt would be participating in the sixteenth series of _I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!_[9]

After winning _I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!_ she began appearing as a panellist on _Virtually Famous_ in December 2016. On 8 January 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 would be reviving dating show _Streetmate_ with Moffatt as the presenter. "I can't believe Channel 4 have asked me to present this iconic show. I remember watching Davina McCall on _Streetmate_ when I was younger and thinking, 'Females can present entertainment shows too. I want to do that when I'm older. It's such a fun show and it's two of my favourite things to do, chat to randomers and a love story."[10] In January 2017, she was the backstage presenter for the _National Television Awards_.[11]

On 9 January 2017, it was announced that Moffatt would be joining Ant & Dec on _Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway_. "I've watched Saturday Night Takeaway with my family for as long as I can remember, I'm such a huge fan, so to be part of one of the biggest entertainment shows out there, with two of my all-time TV heroes Ant and Dec, is an absolute dream." Moffatt said in a statement.[12]

On 2 April 2018, Moffatt guest hosted an evening radio show on Heart, as part of _Heart's Feel Good Easter Weekend_.[13]


Controversy

In March 2018, details emerged which questioned the claims behind Moffatt's fitness DVD "SuperSlim Me Plan", released on Boxing Day 2016. In the DVD, Moffatt claimed that the regime outlined in her fitness DVD and a 1,200 calories a day diet allowed her drop 3 stone from her original 11st 4lb to 8st, and drop from a dress size 18 to a size 8. It was later claimed that she had signed up under a contract with former TV-am presenter Jayne Irving's Big Shot Productions Ltd, where by in the five months before filming the DVD she had to attend regular fitness sessions mentored by trainer David Souter, which was completed by a six week boot-camp stay in Anzere, Switzerland, where she consumed only 700 calories per day. Big Shot Productions Ltd are now legally requesting return payment of £100,000 from Moffatt, as she had regained weight too quickly after the DVD's release.[14]


Personal life

Before finding fame, Moffatt worked as a checkout operator for ASDA in her home town of Bishop Auckland. She is also an ex-ballroom and Latin dancer, and has danced in local, regional and national competitions. During her tenure on _I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!_, she revealed that she suffers from Bell's palsy after being run over by a car when she was 11.[15]
