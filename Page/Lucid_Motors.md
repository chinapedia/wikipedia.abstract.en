LUCID MOTORS, INC. (formerly known as ATIEVA)[1] is an American automotive company specializing in electric cars. The company was founded in 2007, and it is based in Newark, California.[2]


History

Some of Lucid's 300 employees previously worked at Mazda, Tesla[3][4], and other car companies. The company is financed by Tsing Capital, Sumitomo, Venrock, LeEco, JAFCO, and others,[5][6] providing $131 million by 2016.[7]

On November 29, 2016, state and company officials announced the planned construction of Lucid's $700 million manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona which was projected to employ up to 2,000 workers by 2022,[8][9][10] eventually building 20,000 to 130,000 cars per year. The city was a candidate for Tesla's Gigafactory 1 in 2014.[11]

On September 17, 2018, Lucid Motors announced that they were in talks with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia for a funding valued at over $1 billion.[12] The investment was a major milestone for the company, which is slated to launch its Lucid Air model commercially in 2020.[13][14] The bulk of the funding — $700 million — will go to construction of its manufacturing plant in Casa Grande, Arizona;[15] it will also enable the completion of engineering development and testing of the car, and the subsequent commencement of commercial production its retail strategy.[16][17]


Cars

Lucid mainly developed battery technology in its early years, but began making an aluminium prototype car in 2014.[18]

Development prototype

Atieva's drivetrain development platform is called "Edna" and was used to develop the powertrain.[19]

Lucid Air

Originally teased as the "Atieva Atvus";[20] it was unveiled as the "Lucid Air" in December 2016[21][22] and planned to be available about two years later.[23] It has a 400 hp front motor and a 600 hp rear motor for a combined horsepower of 900[24] to 1,000 hp[25][26]. Lucid has agreed with Mobileye to use their EyeQ4 chips and 8 cameras for driver assist features.[27] Parts of the media view Lucid's 2018 production plans as 'challenging'.[28] This 4-door sedan is able to reach a software limited top speed of 217 mph; but, in July 2017, running on the high-speed track at the Transportation Research Center in Ohio, a special version of the car (with the speed limiter disabled via software and other modifications) has hit 235 mph.


Batteries

Lucid's car uses the 2170[29] standard for its lithium-ion battery[30] cells from Samsung SDI.[31]

Lucid has designed, developed, manufactured and supplied battery packs for all race teams in Formula E 2018-2019 season,[32] and will continue to do so for 2019-2020 season,[33] in collaboration with McLaren Applied Technologies and Sony.[34][35] The Formula E specification[36] calls for a battery weight of 250 kg (551 pounds), 54 kWh energy, and peak power of up to 250 kW.[37]
