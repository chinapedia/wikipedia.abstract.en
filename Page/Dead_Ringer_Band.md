DEAD RINGER BAND is an Australian Country music band.[1] Their album _Home Fires_ won the 1996 ARIA Award for Best Country Album[2] and the next year _Living in the Circle_ was nominated for the same award.

Dead Ringer Band had its roots in a duo of husband and wife Bill and Diane Chambers. Their daughter Kasey joined them on stage and son Nash soon followed. This four piece band became known as the Dead Ringer Band. The family released two cassettes, credited as Bill Chambers, _Sea Eagle_ in 1987 and _Kindred Spirit_ in 1991. In 1992 they released an EP credited to Dead Ringer Band and released four full albums from 1993 to 1998.[3]
