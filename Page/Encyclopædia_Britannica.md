The (Latin for "British Encyclopaedia"), formerly published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., is a general knowledge English-language encyclopaedia. It was written by about 100 full-time editors and more than 4,000 contributors. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes[1] and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition.

The _Britannica_ is the English-language encyclopaedia that was in print for the longest time: it lasted 244 years. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, as three volumes. (This first edition is available in facsimile.) The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes,[2] and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes.[3] Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the _Britannica_ shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the _Britannica_ became the first encyclopaedia to adopt "continuous revision", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on _Encyclopædia Britannica Online_.[4]

The 15th edition had a three-part structure: a 12-volume of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), a 17-volume of long articles (two to 310 pages), and a single volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ; readers are advised to study the outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the _Britannica_ has remained steady, with about 40 million words on half a million topics. Though published in the United States since 1901, the _Britannica_ has for the most part maintained British English spelling.

}}; the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the and the , respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine).]] Since 1985, the _Britannica_ has had four parts: the , the , the , and a two-volume index. The _Britannica_{{'s}} articles are found in the and , which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors.[5] The articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the . The articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.[6] The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. The 2013 edition of _Britannica_ contained approximately forty thousand articles.[7]

Information can be found in the _Britannica_ by following the cross-references in the and ; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.[8] Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the , which organizes the _Britannica_{{'s}} contents by topic.[9]

The core of the is its "Outline of Knowledge", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.[10] Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the _Britannica_{{'s}} editors to decide which articles should be included in the and .[11] The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of _Britannica_ articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth.[12] However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia.[13] The also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the _Britannica_.

Taken together, the and comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images.[14] The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the _Britannica_, together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.[15] The _Britannica_ generally prefers British spelling over American;[16] for example, it uses _colour_ (not _color_), _centre_ (not _center_), and _encyclopaedia_ (not _encyclopedia_). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as _defense_ rather than _defence_.[17] Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as "Color: _see_ Colour."

Since 1936, the articles of the _Britannica_ have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year.[18][19] According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;[20] however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.[21]

The alphabetization of articles in the and follows strict rules.[22] Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as "1812, War of" are alphabetized as if the number had been written out ("Eighteen-twelve, War of"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in _Britannica_ as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were "Charles, France, 3" and "Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1".) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.

In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution.[23] The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990 when 120,000 sets were sold, but it dropped to 40,000 in 1996.[24] 12,000 sets of the 2010 edition were printed, of which 8,000 had been sold .[25] By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica's online store. , a replica of Britannica's 1768 first edition is sold on the online store.[26]

_Britannica Junior_ was first published in 1934 as 12 volumes. It was expanded to 15 volumes in 1947, and renamed _Britannica Junior Encyclopædia_ in 1963.[27] It was taken off the market after the 1984 printing. A British _Children's Britannica_ edited by John Armitage was issued in London in 1960.[28] Its contents were determined largely by the eleven-plus standardized tests given in Britain.[29] Britannica introduced the _Children's Britannica_ to the US market in 1988, aimed at ages seven to 14.

In 1961 a 16 volume _Young Children's Encyclopaedia_ was issued for children just learning to read.[30]

_My First Britannica_ is aimed at children ages six to 12, and the _Britannica Discovery Library_ is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991).[31]

There have been, and are, several abridged _Britannica_ encyclopaedias. The single-volume _Britannica Concise Encyclopædia_ has 28,000 short articles condensing the larger 32-volume _Britannica_;[32] there are authorized translations in languages such as Chinese[33] and Vietnamese.[34][35] _Compton's by Britannica_, first published in 2007, incorporating the former _Compton's Encyclopedia_, is aimed at 10- to 17-year-olds and consists of 26 volumes and 11,000 pages.[36]

Since 1938, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has published annually a _Book of the Year_ covering the past year's events. A given edition of the _Book of the Year_ is named in terms of the year of its publication, though the edition actually covers the events of the previous year. Articles dating back to the 1994 edition are included online.[37] The company also publishes several specialized reference works, such as _Shakespeare: The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard_ (Wiley, 2006).

Optical disc, online, and mobile versions

The _Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2012 DVD_ contains over 100,000 articles.[38] This includes regular _Britannica_ articles, as well as others drawn from the _Britannica Student Encyclopædia_, and the _Britannica Elementary Encyclopædia._ The package includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from Merriam-Webster.

_Britannica_ Online is a website with more than 120,000 articles and is updated regularly.[39] It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from _The New York Times_ and the BBC. , roughly 60% of Encyclopædia Britannica's revenue came from online operations, of which around 15% came from subscriptions to the consumer version of the websites.[40] , subscriptions were available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis.[41] Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannica's business. Beginning in early 2007, the _Britannica_ made articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non-subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising.[42]

On 20 February 2007, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to launch a mobile encyclopaedia.[43] Users will be able to send a question via text message, and AskMeNow will search _Britannica_{{'s}} 28,000-article concise encyclopaedia to return an answer to the query. Daily topical features sent directly to users' mobile phones are also planned.

On 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica's online content (in the spirit of a wiki), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced.[44][45] Approved contributions would be credited,[46] though contributing automatically grants Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable license to those contributions.[47]

On 22 January 2009, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that the company would be accepting edits and additions to the online _Britannica_ website from the public. The published edition of the encyclopaedia will not be affected by the changes.[48] Individuals wishing to edit the _Britannica_ website will have to register under their real name and address prior to editing or submitting their content.[49] All edits submitted will be reviewed and checked and will have to be approved by the encyclopaedia's professional staff.[50] Contributions from non-academic users will sit in a separate section from the expert-generated _Britannica_ content,[51] as will content submitted by non-_Britannica_ scholars.[52] Articles written by users, if vetted and approved, will also only be available in a special section of the website, separate from the professional articles.[53][54] Official _Britannica_ material would carry a "Britannica Checked" stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content.[55]

On 14 September 2010, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced a partnership with mobile phone development company Concentric Sky to launch a series of iPhone products aimed at the K-12 market.[56] On 20 July 2011, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that Concentric Sky had ported the Britannica Kids product line to Intel's Intel Atom-based Netbooks[57][58] and on 26 October 2011 that it had launched its encyclopedia as an iPad app.[59] In 2010, Britannica released Britannica ImageQuest, a database of images.[60]

In March 2012, it was announced that the company would cease printing the encyclopaedia set, and that it would focus more on its online version.[61][62]

Personnel and management

Contributors

The 2007 print version of the _Britannica_ has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey.[65] Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.

While _Britannica_{{'s}} authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein,[66] Marie Curie,[67] and Leon Trotsky,[68] as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov,[69] some have been criticized for lack of expertise. In 1911 the historian George L. Burr wrote:

in the fifteenth edition of _Britannica_, Dale Hoiberg, a sinologist, was listed as _Britannica's_ Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief.[70] Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were Hugh Chisholm (1902–1924), James Louis Garvin (1926–1932), Franklin Henry Hooper (1932–1938),[71] Walter Yust (1938–1960), Harry Ashmore (1960–1963), Warren E. Preece (1964–1968, 1969–1975), Sir William Haley (1968–1969), Philip W. Goetz (1979–1991),[72] and Robert McHenry (1992–1997).[73] Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor.[74] Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.

Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of Treasurer, Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.[75]

The 2007 editorial staff of the _Britannica_ included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the and some sections of the .[76] The preparation and publication of the required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 , the staff were organized into ten departments:[77]

1.  Editorial staff (19 editors and 1 executive assistant)
2.  Art and Cartography (9 employees)
3.  Compositional Technology and Design (4 employees)
4.  Copy Department (12 employees)
5.  Editorial and Publishing Technologies (5 employees)
6.  Information Management (9 employees)
7.  Media Asset Management and Production Control (4 employees)
8.  Reference Librarians (3 employees)
9.  World Data (5 employees)
10. Manufacturing (1 employee)

Some of these departments were organized hierarchically. For example, the copy editors were divided into four copy editors, two senior copy editors, four supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by Dale Hoiberg and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.

Editorial advisors

The _Britannica_ has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:[78][79] non-fiction author Nicholas Carr, religion scholar Wendy Doniger, political economist Benjamin M. Friedman, Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb, computer scientist David Gelernter, Physics Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann, Carnegie Corporation of New York President Vartan Gregorian, philosopher Thomas Nagel, cognitive scientist Donald Norman, musicologist Don Michael Randel, Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood, President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and cultural anthropologist Michael Wesch.

The and its _Outline of Knowledge_ were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler.[80] Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects — Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned articles.[81]

Corporate structure

In January 1996, the _Britannica_ was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra,[82] who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[83] In 1999, a new company, Britannica.com Inc., was created to develop digital versions of the _Britannica_; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses.[84] In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies.[85] Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the _Britannica_{{'s}} Board of Directors.

In 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the _Britannica's_ Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the _Britannica_ brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.[86]

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the _New York Post_, the _Britannica_ management has eliminated employee 401(k) accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the _Britannica_ staff have gone years without pay rises. [87]

In the fall of 2017, Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopædia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (Reed Elsevier, FT SE 100) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for "driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth".[88]

Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250th anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K-12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year.

First was Britannica Insights,[89] a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to "provide trusted, verified information" in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and "fake news."

The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica's online classroom solutions, and a partnership with YouTube[90] in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading.  

Krishnan, himself an educator at New York University's Stern School of Business, believes in the "transformative power of education"[91] and set steering the company toward solidifying its place among leaders in educational technology and supplemental curriculum. Krishnan aimed at providing more useful and relevant solutions to customer needs, extending and renewing Britannica's historical emphasis on "Utility",[92] which had been the watchword of its first edition in 1768.

Krishnan also is active in civic affairs, with organizations such as the Urban Enterprise Initiative and Urban Upbound, whose board he serves on.


Competition

As the _Britannica_ is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the _Encyclopaedia of Mathematics_ or the _Dictionary of the Middle Ages_, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the _Britannica_{{'s}} main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, _Rees's Cyclopædia_ and Coleridge's _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_. In the 20th century, successful competitors included _Collier's Encyclopedia_, the _Encyclopedia Americana_, and the _World Book Encyclopedia_. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the _Britannica_ was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia,[93] especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.[94][95] The print version of the _Britannica_ was significantly more expensive than its competitors.[96][97]

Since the early 1990s, the _Britannica_ has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine.[98][99] In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.[100] In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the _Britannica_ has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust.[101] Eventually, the _Britannica_ turned to focus more on its online edition.[102]

Print encyclopaedias

The has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively.[103][104][105] A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the _Britannica_ with two comparable encyclopaedias, _Collier's Encyclopedia_ and the _Encyclopedia Americana_.[106] For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the _Britannica_ received one "D" and seven "A"s, _Encyclopedia Americana_ received eight "A"s, and _Collier's_ received one "D" and seven "A"s; thus, _Britannica_ received an average score of 92% for accuracy to _Americana_{{'}}s 95% and _Collier's_ 92%. In the timeliness category, _Britannica_ averaged an 86% to _Americana_'s 90% and _Collier's_ 85%.

Digital encyclopaedias on optical media

The most notable competitor of the _Britannica_ among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was _Encarta_,[107] now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: _Funk & Wagnalls_, _Collier's_ and the _New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia_. _Encarta_ was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.[108] Both occupied the same price range, with the _2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate_ CD or DVD costing US$40–50[109][110] and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.[111] The _Britannica_ contains 100,000 articles and _Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus_ (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions.[112] _Encarta_ contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition.[113] Like _Encarta_, the _Britannica_ has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.[114] Like the _Britannica_, _Encarta_ was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.[115]

Internet encyclopaedias

The dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to _Britannica_ is Wikipedia.[116][117][118] The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an encyclopedic project; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike _Britannica_, Wikipedia is a not-for-profit and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks.

The 699 printed articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a _Britannica_ article either has known authorship or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the _Britannica_{{'s}} contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates.[119] By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials.[120] It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former _Britannica_ editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the _Britannica_ in accuracy.[121]

In 2005, the journal _Nature_ chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. _Nature_ got back 42 usable reviews.

In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in _Britannica_, an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for _Britannica_.[122][123] Although ''Britannica ''was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with fewer errors, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called _Nature_'s study flawed and misleading[124] and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a _Britannica_ yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from _Compton's Encyclopedia_ (called the _Britannica Student Encyclopedia_ on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalized for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what _Nature_ called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. _Nature_ defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of _Britannica_, it used whatever relevant material was available on _Britannica_{{'}}s website.[125]

Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of _Britannica UK_ said:


Critical and popular assessments

Reputation

by Andrew Bell from the 1st edition.]]

Since the 3rd edition, the _Britannica_ has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence.[126][127][128] The 3rd and the 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States,[129] beginning with _Dobson's Encyclopaedia_.[130] On the release of the 14th edition, _Time_ magazine dubbed the _Britannica_ the "Patriarch of the Library".[131] In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the _Britannica_ was "beyond comparison because there is no competitor."[132] References to the _Britannica_ can be found throughout English literature, most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, "The Red-Headed League". The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the _Britannica_.[133]

The _Britannica_ has a reputation for summarising knowledge.[134] To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire _Britannica_, taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so.[135] When Fat'h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the _Britannica's_ 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the ".[136] Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles[137]—and Richard Evelyn Byrd took the _Britannica_ as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934, while Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A.J. Jacobs, an editor at _Esquire_ magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, _The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World_. Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester[138] and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.[139] Several editors-in-chief of the _Britannica_ are likely to have read their editions completely, such as William Smellie (1st edition), William Robertson Smith (9th edition), and Walter Yust (14th edition).

Awards

The CD/DVD-ROM version of the _Britannica_, _Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite_, received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers.[140] On 15 July 2009, was awarded a spot as one of "Top Ten Superbrands in the UK" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.[141]

Coverage of topics

Topics are chosen in part by reference to the "Outline of Knowledge".[142] The bulk of the _Britannica_ is devoted to geography (26% of the ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%).[143] A complementary study of the found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%.[144] Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the "range, depth, and catholicity of coverage [of the _Britannica_] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia."[145]

The _Britannica_ does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.[146] However, the _Britannica_ has been lauded as the _least_ biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers[147] and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.[148]

Criticism of editorial decisions

On rare occasions, the ''Britannica ''was criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.[149] Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the and .[150][151] Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a "qualified failure...[that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving."[152] More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 , along with the article on psychology.[153]

Some very few _Britannica_-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the _Britannica's_ early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire.[154] The _Britannica_ has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).[155]

Other criticisms

The _Britannica_ has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the _Britannica_, and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).[156] For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, _The Myth of the Britannica_,[157] the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.[158] It is still difficult to keep the _Britannica_ current; one recent critic writes, "it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision", noting that the longer articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter articles.[159] Information in the is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other.[160][161] The bibliographies of the articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.[162][163][164]

In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish civil war was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.[165][166]

Writing about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), _Britannica_{{'}}s chief editor George Gleig observed that "perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects."[167] In March 2006, the _Britannica_ wrote, "we in no way mean to imply that _Britannica_ is error-free; we have never made such a claim."[168] The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, William Smellie:

However, Jorge Cauz (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that "_Britannica_ [...] will always be factually correct."[169]


History

Past owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable, Scottish publisher A & C Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck and William Benton.

The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, _Encarta_ and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias.[170] To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the _Britannica_, reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.[171]

Editions

The _Britannica_ has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.

Throughout history, the _Britannica_ has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material.[172] In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.[173] The history of the _Britannica_ can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary.

1768–1826

article on Egypt, which included the translation of the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone (pictured).]] In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the _Britannica_ was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The _Britannica_ was first published between December 1768[174] and 1771 in Edinburgh as the _Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan_. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French _Encyclopédie_ of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by Chambers's _Cyclopaedia_ (first edition 1728). It went on sale December 10.[175]

The _Britannica_ of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment.[176] In this era, the _Britannica_ moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—William Smellie[177]—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities.[178] Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees's _Cyclopædia_ and Coleridge's _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_ and David Brewster's _Edinburgh Encyclopædia_.

1827–1901

During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the _Britannica_ was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A & C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the _Britannica's_ reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.

Production of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes, the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the "Scholar's Edition", the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all _Britannicas_.[179][180] After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith.[181] No biographies of living persons were included.[182] James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science.[183] However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the _Britannica_ faced financial difficulties.

1901–1973

'']]

In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the _Britannica_ was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection.[184]

When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the _Britannica_ was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the _Britannica_; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions.[185] Powell developed new educational products that built upon the _Britannica_{{'}}s reputation.

In 1943, Sears donated the to the University of Chicago. William Benton, then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock.[186] Benton became Chairman of the Board and managed the _Britannica_ until his death in 1973.[187] Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the _Britannica_ until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the _Britannica_ celebrated its bicentennial.

1974–1994

In the fourth era (1974–94), the _Britannica_ introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organized into three parts: the , the , and the . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of _Britannica_ from 1965),[188] the _Britannica_ sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the and ) provoked a "firestorm of criticism" of the initial 15th edition.[189]

-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   In response, the 15th edition was completely re-organized and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the _New Encyclopædia Britannica_, although it has also been promoted as _Britannica 3_.[190]

On 9 March 1976 the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.[191]

1994–present

In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the _Britannica_ was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the _Britannica_ name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.[192][193]

_Britannica_{{'}}s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set.[194] _Britannica Global Edition_ was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller "compact" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain and sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is _Britannica_{{'}}s description of the work:[195]

Dedications

The _Britannica_ was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States.[196] Thus, the 11th edition is "dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America."[197] The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second."[198] Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was "dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, George W. Bush, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II",[199] while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."[200]

| ⁷ At this point _Encyclopædia Britannica_ began almost annual revisions. New revisions of the 14th edition appeared every year between 1929 and 1973 with the exceptions of 1931, 1934 and 1935.[207]                                                                                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ⁸ Annual revisions were published every year between 1974 and 2007 with the exceptions of 1996, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2006.[208] The 15th edition (introduced as "Britannica 3") was published in three parts: a 10-volume (which contained short articles and served as an index), a 19-volume , plus the (see text).                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ⁹ In 1985, the system was modified by adding a separate two-volume index; the articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 US states were all included into the "United States of America" article), with some medium-length articles moved to the . The had 12 vols. and the 17. |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2001.                                                                                       |

[171]  Aside from providing an excellent summary of the _Britannica's_ history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical _Britannica_ edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. Elkan Harrison Powell identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.
