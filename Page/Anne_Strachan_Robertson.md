She was recognised by her research regarding Roman Imperial coins and as "a living link with the pioneers of archaeological research".[1][2]


Early life and education

R_5_49_14_ASRobertsonii_(40843308693).jpg Anne Strachan Robertson was born in Glasgow on 3 May 1910. Her parents, Margaret Purden and John Anderson Robertson, were both school teachers.[3]

She was educated in Glasgow at Hillhead High School and the Glasgow High School for Girls. In 1928 she attended the University of Glasgow, where she was impressed by the work and teachings of S.N. Miller relating to Roman history. In 1930 Robertson won the Cowan Medal and she obtained the approval of Sir George Macdonald, then Honorary Keeper of the Hunterian Coin Cabinet.[4] After graduating with a Master of Arts with Honours in Classics in 1932, she started her studies for a second MA, this time in archaeology, at the University of London.

In London, she obtained different scholarships to participate in Mortimer Wheeler's excavations, to work at the Coin Room of the British Museum, and to several academic papers on numismatics.[5] She graduated in 1934, having acquired considerable experience in archaeological methods, particularly as result of her participation in Wheeler's excavation of Maiden Castle.[6]


Career

Robertson returned to Glasgow in 1936 when she was appointed Dalrymple Lecturer in Archaeology. In 1938, she joined the staff of the University of Glasgow involved in the curation of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. In 1952 she became Under (Deputy) Keeper of the Museum. In 1964 she was appointed Keeper of Cultural Collections, and was promoted to Reader in archaeology at the University in the same year.[7] In 1974 she was given the honorary title of Professor and became the Keeper of Roman Archaeology at the museum.

She was President of the Glasgow Archaeological Society from 1954 to 1957, having been Vice-President from 1945 to 1954. Following her Presidency, Robertson served as Honorary Secretary of the Society from 1965 to 1972. A special issue of the _Glasgow Archaeological Journal_ was published in her honour in 1976 "in gratitude for her outstanding services to scholarship - specifically, to the study of Roman Scotland - and to the Glasgow Archaeological Society".[8]

She served on the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1946, and was the first woman to be elected to Council.[9]

Robertson was a prolific excavator of Roman sites, notably Castledykes near Lanark (1937), Duntocher on the Antonine Wall (1947–51), Birrens in Dumfriesshire (1962-7), and Cardean in Angus (1968–75).[10] She was Secretary of the Scottish Field School of Archaeology from 1948 to 1973.[11]


Honours

Robertson became a Fellow of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1937, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1941.

Robertson was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1958.[12] Robertson was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1975 (FRSE). Her proposers were Alex Haddow, Robert Alexander Rankin, Stuart Piggott, Sheina Marshall, Edward McGirr and Agnes Miller.[13][14] She was elected to an Honorary Membership of the Glasgow Archaeological Society in 1976.[15]

In 1964, she was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society, followed by the Huntington Medal from the American Numismatic Society in 1970.[16][17]
