Hence, peptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological oligomers and polymers, alongside nucleic acids, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, etc.

Peptides are distinguished from proteins on the basis of size, and as an arbitrary benchmark can be understood to contain approximately 50 or fewer amino acids.[2][3] Proteins consist of one or more polypeptides arranged in a biologically functional way, often bound to ligands such as coenzymes and cofactors, or to another protein or other macromolecule (DNA, RNA, etc.), or to complex macromolecular assemblies.[4] Finally, while aspects of the lab techniques applied to peptides versus polypeptides and proteins differ (_e.g._, the specifics of electrophoresis, chromatography, etc.), the size boundaries that distinguish peptides from polypeptides and proteins are not absolute: long peptides such as amyloid beta have been referred to as proteins, and smaller proteins like insulin have been considered peptides.

Amino acids that have been incorporated into peptides are termed "residues". A water molecule is released during formation of each amide bond.[5] All peptides except cyclic peptides have an N-terminal and C-terminal residue at the end of the peptide (as shown for the tetrapeptide in the image).


Classes

Many kinds of peptides are known. They have been classified or categorized according to their sources and function. According to the Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides, some groups of peptides include plant peptides, bacterial/antibiotic peptides, fungal peptides, invertebrate peptides, amphibian/skin peptides, venom peptides, cancer/anticancer peptides, vaccine peptides , immune/inflammatory peptides, brain peptides, endocrine peptides, ingestive peptides, gastrointestinal peptides, cardiovascular peptides, renal peptides, respiratory peptides, opiate peptides, neurotrophic peptides, and blood–brain peptides.[6]

Some ribosomal peptides are subject to proteolysis. These function, typically in higher organisms, as hormones and signaling molecules. Some organisms produce peptides as antibiotics, such as microcins.[7]

Peptides frequently have posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, hydroxylation, sulfonation, palmitoylation, glycosylation and disulfide formation. In general, peptides are linear, although lariat structures have been observed.[8] More exotic manipulations do occur, such as racemization of L-amino acids to D-amino acids in platypus venom.[9]

Nonribosomal peptides are assembled by enzymes, not the ribosome. A common non-ribosomal peptide is glutathione, a component of the antioxidant defenses of most aerobic organisms.[10] Other nonribosomal peptides are most common in unicellular organisms, plants, and fungi and are synthesized by modular enzyme complexes called _nonribosomal peptide synthetases_.[11]

These complexes are often laid out in a similar fashion, and they can contain many different modules to perform a diverse set of chemical manipulations on the developing product.[12] These peptides are often cyclic and can have highly complex cyclic structures, although linear nonribosomal peptides are also common. Since the system is closely related to the machinery for building fatty acids and polyketides, hybrid compounds are often found. The presence of oxazoles or thiazoles often indicates that the compound was synthesized in this fashion.[13]

Peptide fragments refer to fragments of proteins that are used to identify or quantify the source protein.[14] Often these are the products of enzymatic degradation performed in the laboratory on a controlled sample, but can also be forensic or paleontological samples that have been degraded by natural effects.[15][16]

Example families

The peptide families in this section are ribosomal peptides, usually with hormonal activity. All of these peptides are synthesized by cells as longer "propeptides" or "proproteins" and truncated prior to exiting the cell. They are released into the bloodstream where they perform their signaling functions.

Terminology

Length

Several terms related to peptides have no strict length definitions, and there is often overlap in their usage.

-   A _polypeptide_ is a single linear chain of many amino acids (any length), held together by amide bonds.
-   A _protein_ consists of one or more polypeptides (more than about 50 amino acids long).
-   An _oligopeptide_ consists of only a few amino acids (between two and twenty).

BLUE marked carboxyl end (L-ALANINE)]]

Number of amino acids

Peptides of defined length are named using IUPAC numerical multiplier prefixes.

-   A _dipeptide_ has two amino acids.
-   A _tripeptide_ has three amino acids.
-   A _tetrapeptide_ has four amino acids.
-   A _pentapeptide_ has five amino acids.
-   A _hexapeptide_ has six amino acids.
-   A _heptapeptide_ has seven amino acids.
-   An _octapeptide_ has eight amino acids (_e.g._, angiotensin II).
-   A _nonapeptide_ has nine amino acids (_e.g._, oxytocin).
-   A _decapeptide_ has ten amino acids (_e.g._, gonadotropin-releasing hormone & angiotensin I).

Function

-   A _neuropeptide_ is a peptide that is active in association with neural tissue.
-   A _lipopeptide_ is a peptide that has a lipid connected to it, and _pepducins_ are lipopeptides that interact with GPCRs.
-   A _peptide hormone_ is a peptide that acts as a hormone.
-   A proteose is a mixture of peptides produced by the hydrolysis of proteins. The term is somewhat archaic.
-   A PEPTIDERGIC AGENT (or drug) is a chemical which functions to directly modulate the peptide systems in the body or brain. An example is opioidergics, which are neuropeptidergics.
