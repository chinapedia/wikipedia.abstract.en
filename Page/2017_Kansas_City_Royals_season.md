Regular season

The team's 16–4 win over the Detroit Tigers on July 20, 2017, was the first time in franchise history that the Royals had recorded four 4-run innings in a game.[1] In the month of August, the Royals set a dubious franchise record of 45 innings without scoring a run, spanning more than 4 games. It was the longest such streak by any team since the pitching mound was lowered in the late 1960s.[2]
