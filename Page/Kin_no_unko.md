Kin_no_unko.jpg or "golden poo" is a Japanese cultural phenomenon. It is a symbol of good luck, as the name is a pun meaning "golden poo" and "good luck" in Japanese.[1] By 2006, 2.7 million mobile phone charms in this form had been sold.[2] The symbol, or something similar to it called _unchi_, appears as an emoji available on many mobile devices that support a Unicode expansion made in the summer of 2014.[3] The charm is unusual outside of Japan but has been available from the English-language website ThinkGeek.[4]

The flame ornament atop the Asahi Beer Hall in Tokyo is called _Kin no unko_ for its similarity.


In popular culture

The 2017 video game _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ contains an item known as Hestu's Gift,[5] which resembles a Kin no unko.
