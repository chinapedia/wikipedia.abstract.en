Reception

Writing in the _Philippine Daily Inquirer_, entertainment editor Rito P. Asilo remarked on the "riotous ludicrousness" of this "wacky comedy" that "fail[s] to say anything significant",[2] while an ABS-CBN reviewer focused on the quality of the lead's acting, saying that "Kaye Abad shines in her role as Angela Velasco".[3]
