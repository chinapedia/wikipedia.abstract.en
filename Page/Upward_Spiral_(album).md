_UPWARD SPIRAL_ is an album by the Branford Marsalis Quartet with vocalist Kurt Elling. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album.[1]


Recording and music

The album was recorded at the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, New Orleans, on December 16–19, 2015.[2] The leader of the quartet, saxophonist Branford Marsalis, had not previously recorded an entire album with one vocalist.[3] The other members were pianist Joey Calderazzo, bassist Eric Revis, and drummer Justin Faulkner.[4] The music is a mix of upbeat material and some that "ponders loss, pain, dashed expectations and accommodation to all three".[5] Elling sings "Só Tinha De Ser Com Você" in Portuguese.[6]


Release and reception

_Upward Spiral_ was released by Marsalis Music/OKeh Records on June 10, 2016.[7] The AllMusic reviewer wrote: "_Upward Spiral_ is less an album featuring a singer backed by a jazz ensemble, and more of an album that details the meeting of two highly creative artists whose talents intertwine to find new avenues of expression."[8] The _DownBeat_ reviewer concluded: "When the albums ends, your first thought may well be, When are these guys going to do this again?"[9]
