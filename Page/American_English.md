AMERICAN ENGLISH (AME, AE, AMENG, USENG, EN-US),[1] sometimes called UNITED STATES ENGLISH or U.S. ENGLISH,[2][3] is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States.[4] American English is considered one of the most influential dialects of English globally, including on other varieties of English.[5][6][7][8][9]

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the _de facto_ common language used by the federal and state governments, to the extent that all laws and compulsory education presume English as the primary language. English is explicitly given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments.[10][11] While the local courts in some divisions of the United States grant equivalent status to both English and another language—for example, English and Spanish in Puerto Rico—under federal law, English is still the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.[12]

The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 17th century, dialects from many different regions of England existed in every American colony, allowing a process of extensive dialect mixture and levelling in which English varieties across the colonies became more homogeneous compared with varieties in England.[13][14] English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first massive immigrations of non-English speakers from Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century.[15] Since then, American English has developed into distinct new varieties; its regional dialects in some cases show minor influences from successive waves of immigrants of diverse language backgrounds in the last two centuries,[16] though primarily from Europeans.[17]

American English varieties include many common pronunciations, vocabulary, spelling, and other features found nationwide in comparison to other English dialects around the world.[18] Any North American English accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called "General" or "Standard" American, a fairly uniform standard dialect continuum used in broadcast mass media, highly educated speech, and certain regions. Otherwise, according to William Labov, with the major exception of Southern and some Inland Northern accents, regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this standard,[19] and historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single "mainstream" American accent.[20][21] On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.[22]


Phonology

Compared with English as spoken in England, North American English[23] is more homogeneous, and any phonologically unremarkable North American accent is known as "General American". This section mostly refers to such General American features.

Conservative phonology

Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but is conservative in some ways, preserving certain features contemporary British English has since lost.[24]

-   Full rhoticity (or R-fulness): Most American accents are firmly rhotic, pronouncing the phoneme , corresponding to the letter in all environments, including after vowels, such as in _pearl_, _car_, and _court_.[25][26] Non-rhotic American accents, those that do not pronounce in some positions in a word, such as some Eastern New England, New York, or African American vernacular accents, are often quickly noticed by General American listeners and perceived to sound especially ethnic, regional, or "old-fashioned".[27][28][29]

    Rhoticity is common in most American accents (yet nowadays rare in England), because, during the 17th-century British colonization, nearly all dialects of English were rhotic, and most North American English simply remained that way.[30] This preservation of rhoticity in North America was also supported by continuing waves of rhotic-accented Scots-Irish immigrants, most intensely during the 18th century (and moderately during the following two centuries), when the Scots-Irish eventually made up one-seventh of the colonial population. Scots-Irish settlers spread from Delaware and Pennsylvania into the larger Mid-Atlantic region, the inland regions of both the South and North, and throughout the West, all American dialect areas that consistently resisted upper-class non-rhotic influences and that consequently remain rhotic today.[31] The pronunciation of is a postalveolar approximant or retroflex approximant ,[32] though a unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant _r_ sound is also associated with the United States, and perhaps mostly in the Midwest and the South.[33]

-   Many British accents have evolved in other ways, too, compared to which General American English has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's widespread British English features of a _trap–bath_ split, H-dropping, non-rhoticity (or R-dropping), fronting of , none of which is typical of General American accents, the former two items being especially rare in American English dialects.

Innovative phonology

On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:

-   [[Phonological_history_of_the_low_back_vowels#Father–bother_merger|Unrounded

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:

-   _Horse–hoarse_ merger: This merger makes the vowels and before homophones, with homophonous pairs like _horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,_ etc. homophones. Many older varieties of American English still keep these sets of words distinct, particularly in the extreme Northeast, the South (especially along the Gulf Coast), and the central Midlands,[34] but the merger is evidently spreading and younger Americans rarely show it.
-   _Wine–whine_ merger: This produces pairs like _wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,_ etc. homophones, in most cases eliminating , also transcribed , the voiceless labiovelar fricative. However, scatterings of older speakers who do not merge these pairs still exist nationwide and perhaps most strongly in the South.[35]


Vocabulary

The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as English-speaking British-American colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages.[36] Examples of such names are _opossum, raccoon, squash_, _moose_ (from Algonquian),[37] _wigwam_, and _moccasin_. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, _cookie_, from Dutch; _kindergarten_ from German,[38] _levee_ from French; and _rodeo_ from Spanish.[39][40][41][42] Landscape features are often loanwords from French or Spanish, and the word _corn_, used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the maize plant, the most important crop in the U.S.

Most Mexican Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West, like _ranch_ (now a common house style). Due to the Mexican culinary influence, many Spanish words are incorporated in general use when talking about certain popular dishes: cilantro (instead of coriander), queso, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tostadas, fajitas, burritos, and guacamole. These words don't really have an English equivalent and are found in popular restaurants. New forms of dwelling created new terms _(lot, waterfront)_ and types of homes like _log cabin, adobe_ in the 18th century; _apartment, shanty_ in the 19th century; _project, condominium, townhouse, mobile home_ in the 20th century; and parts thereof _(driveway, breezeway, backyard)_. Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through railroading (see further at rail terminology) and transportation terminology, ranging from types of roads (_dirt roads_, _freeways_) to infrastructure _(parking lot, overpass, rest area),_ to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally.[43] Already existing English words—such as _store, shop, lumber_—underwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain. Science, urbanization, and democracy have been important factors in bringing about changes in the written and spoken language of the United States.[44] From the world of business and finance came new terms (_merger, downsize, bottom line_), from sports and gambling terminology came, specific jargon aside, common everyday American idioms, including many idioms related to baseball. The names of some American inventions remained largely confined to North America (_elevator, gasoline_) as did certain automotive terms (_truck_, _trunk_).

New foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from Yiddish _(chutzpah, schmooze_) and German (_hamburger, wiener_).[45][46] A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from _OK_ and _cool_ to _nerd_ and _24/7),_ while others have not _(have a nice day, for sure);_[47][48] many are now distinctly old-fashioned _(swell, groovy)._ Some English words now in general use, such as _hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze_ and _jazz,_ originated as American slang.

American English has always shown a marked tendency to use words in different parts of speech and nouns are often used as verbs.[49] Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are _interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, hashtag, head, divorce, loan, estimate, X-ray, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, vacation, major,_ and many others. Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance _foothill, landslide_ (in all senses), _backdrop, teenager,_ brainstorm, bandwagon, hitchhike, smalltime, and a huge number of others. Other compound words have been founded based on industrialization and the wave of the automobile: five-passenger car, four-door sedan, two-door sedan, and station-wagon (called an estate car in England).[50] Some are euphemistic _(human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility)._ Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: _stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, makeover,_ and many more. Some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin (_win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to_ and many others).[51]

Noun endings such as _-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)_ and _-cian (beautician)_ are also particularly productive in the U.S.[52] Several verbs ending in _-ize_ are of U.S. origin; for example, _fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, weatherize,_ etc; and so are some back-formations _(locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster_ and _enthuse)._ Among syntactical constructions that arose are _outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,_ etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably _pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay_ and _kitty-corner._ Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, _lengthy, bossy, cute_ and _cutesy, punk_ (in all senses), _sticky_ (of the weather), _through_ (as in "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as _peppy_ or _wacky_.

A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots. Terms such as _fall_ ("autumn"), _faucet_ ("tap"), _diaper_ ("nappy"; itself unused in the U.S.), _candy_ ("sweets"), _skillet_, _eyeglasses_, and _obligate_ are often regarded as Americanisms. _Fall_ for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year."[53] _Gotten_ (past participle of _get_) is often considered to be largely an Americanism.[54][55] Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include _hire_ ("to employ"), _I guess_ (famously criticized by H. W. Fowler), _baggage_, _hit_ (a place), and the adverbs _overly_ and _presently_ ("currently"). Some of these, for example, _monkey wrench_ and _wastebasket_, originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives _mad_ meaning "angry," _smart_ meaning "intelligent," and _sick_ meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.[56][57][58]

Linguist Bert Vaux created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about their specific everyday word choices, hoping to identify regionalisms.[59] The study found that most Americans prefer the term _sub_ for a long sandwich, _soda_ (but _pop_ in the Great Lakes region and generic _coke_ in the South) for a sweet and bubbly soft drink,[60] _you_ or _you guys_ for the plural of _you_ (but _y'all_ in the South), _sneakers_ for athletic shoes (but often _tennis shoes_ outside the Northeast), and _shopping cart_ for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods.


Differences between British and American English

American English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography. The first large American dictionary, _An American Dictionary of the English Language_, known as Webster's Dictionary, was written by Noah Webster in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some auxiliary verbs; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: _learned_/_learnt_, _burned_/_burnt_, _snuck/sneaked_, _dove/dived_) although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE _in school,_ BrE _at school_ ); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE _to the hospital_, BrE _to hospital_; contrast, however, AmE _actress Elizabeth Taylor_, BrE _the actress Elizabeth Taylor_). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,[61] and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in orthography are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as _flavor_ for British _flavour_, _fiber_ for _fibre_, _defense_ for _defence_, _analyze_ for _analyse_, _license_ for _licence_, _catalog_ for _catalogue_ and _traveling_ for _travelling_. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology."[62] Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of the 19th century Victorian era Britain (for example they preferred _programme_ for _program_, _manoeuvre_ for _maneuver_, _cheque_ for _check_, etc.).[63] AmE almost always uses _-ize_ in words like _realize_. BrE prefers _-ise_, but also uses _-ize_ on occasion (see Oxford spelling).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark ("like this") over single ('as here').[64]

Vocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in England, whereas fall is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (England) vs. antenna, biscuit (England) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (England) vs. parking lot, caravan (England) vs. trailer, city centre (England) vs. downtown, flat (England) vs. apartment, fringe (England) vs. bangs, and holiday (England) vs. vacation.[65]

AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE _transportation_ and BrE _transport_ or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE _burglarize_ and BrE _burgle_ (from _burglar_). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differs from American English in that "schedule" can be pronounced with either or .[66]


Varieties

While written American English is largely standardized across the country and spoken American English dialects are highly mutually intelligible, there are still several recognizable regional and ethnic accents and lexical distinctions.

Regional accents

The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of "both convergence and divergence": some accents are homogenizing and levelling, while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.[67]

Having been settled longer than the American West Coast, the East Coast has had more time to develop unique dialects, and it currently comprises three or four linguistically significant regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: New England, the Mid-Atlantic States (including a New York accent as well as a unique Philadelphia/Baltimore accent), and the South. As of the twentieth century, the middle and eastern Great Lakes area, Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the fronting of the vowel in the mouth toward and tensing of the vowel wholesale to . These sound changes have triggered a series of other vowel shifts in the same region, known by linguists as the "Inland North".[68] The Inland North shares with the Eastern New England dialect (including Boston English) a backer tongue positioning of the vowel (to ) and the vowel (to ) in comparison to the rest of the country.[69] Ranging from northern New England across the Great Lakes to Minnesota, another Northern regional marker is the variable fronting of the sound,[70] for example appearing four times in the stereotypical Boston shibboleth _Park the car in Harvard Yard_.[71]

throughout the whole country.[72]]] Several other phenomena serve to distinguish regional U.S. accents. Boston, Pittsburgh, Upper Midwestern, and Western U.S. accents have fully completed a merger of the vowel with the vowel ( and , respectively):[73] a _cot–caught_ merger, which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country. However, the South, Inland North, and a Northeastern coastal corridor passing through Rhode Island, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore typically preserve an older _cot–caught_ distinction.[74] For that Northeastern corridor, the realization of the vowel is particularly marked, as depicted in humorous spellings, like in _tawk_ and _cawfee_ (_talk_ and _coffee_), which intend to represent it being tense and diphthongal: .[75] A split of {{sc2 into two distinct phonemes, using different _a_ pronunciations for example in _gap_ versus _gas_ , further defines New York City as well as Philadelphia/Baltimore accents.[76]

Most Americans preserve all historical sounds, using what is known as a rhotic accent. The only traditionally _r_-dropping (or non-rhotic) regional U.S. accents are spoken along much of the Atlantic Coast, parts of the Gulf Coast (particularly still in Louisiana), and formerly in areas of the old plantation South because these areas were in close historical contact with England and imitated London's _r_-dropping, a feature that has gained prestige and become widespread throughout England from the eighteenth century onwards.[77] Today, this non-rhoticity, which makes a word like _car_ sound like _cah_ or _source_ like _sauce_,[78] is confined in the United States to the accents of eastern New England, New York City variably, some of the old South, and African-American Vernacular English variably nationwide (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in "bird," "work," "hurt," "learn," etc. usually retains its _r_ pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic accents).

The most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and Southern accents.[79] Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas around central Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a "country" accent,[80] and is defined by the vowel losing its gliding quality: , the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a "Southern drawl" that makes short front vowels into distinct-sounding gliding vowels.[81] The fronting of the vowels of , , , and tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the "Midland": a vast band of the country between the traditional dialect regions of the North and the South. The Western U.S. has had the least amount of time to develop unique dialect distinctions and its accents mostly falls under the General American spectrum.

Below, ten major American English accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain vowel sounds:

General American

In 2010, William Labov noted that Great Lakes, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and West Coast accents have undergone "vigorous new sound changes" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, so they "are now more different from each other than they were 50 or 100 years ago", while other accents, like of New York City and Boston, have remained stable in that same time-frame.[83] However, a General American sound system also has some debated degree of influence nationwide, for example, gradually beginning to oust the regional accent in urban areas of the South and at least some in the Inland North. Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include rhoticity, the _father–bother_ merger, _Mary–marry–merry_ merger, pre-nasal "short _a_" tensing, and other particular vowel sounds.[84] General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.

Other varieties

Although no longer region-specific,[85] African-American Vernacular English, which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including hip hop culture. Hispanic and Latino Americans have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are Chicano English, spoken in the West and Midwest, and New York Latino English, spoken in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as Yeshiva English and "Yinglish" are spoken by some American Orthodox Jews, Cajun Vernacular English by some Cajuns in southern Louisiana, and Pennsylvania Dutch English by some Pennsylvania Dutch in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. American Indian Englishes have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of Hawaii, though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a creole language known commonly as Hawaiian Pidgin, and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.

[84] Dialects are considered "rhotic" if they pronounce the _r_ sound in all historical environments, without ever "dropping" this sound. The _father–bother_ merger is the pronunciation of the unrounded vowel variant (as in _cot, lot, bother_, etc.) the same as the vowel (as in _spa, haha, Ma_), causing words like _con_ and _Kahn_ and like _sob_ and _Saab_ to sound identical, with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as . Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the "short _a_" vowel (in _cat, trap, bath_, etc.), causing to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like ) particularly when before a nasal consonant; thus, _mad_ is , but _man_ is more like .
