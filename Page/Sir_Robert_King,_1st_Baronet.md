SIR ROBERT KING, 1ST BARONET PC (I) (circa 1625 – March 1707) was an Anglo-Irish politician.

King was the son of Sir Robert King and Frances Folliott. He represented the seat of Ballyshannon in the Irish House of Commons between 1661 and 1666.[1] On 27 September 1682 he was created a BARONET, of Boyle Abbet, in the Baronetage of Ireland. He sat for Roscommon County from 1692 to 1693 and again from 1696 to 1699. In 1695 he was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. He finally sat for Boyle between 1703 and his death in 1707.[2]

He married Frances Gore, daughter of Lt-Col Henry Gore and Mary Blayney. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John King. A descendant of his second son, Henry King, was created Earl of Kingston in 1768.
