Synopsis

_Friends for Christmas_ is Farnham's first Christmas album in 46 years; when billed as "Johnny" he released the album _Christmas Is Johnny Farnham_ in 1970. It is Newton-John's fourth, the most recent being _This Christmas_ (2012) recorded with her _Grease_ co-star, John Travolta. Farnham and Newton-John promoted the album in Australia in November.[1]

Artists' press statements

Farnham said: "I have always loved working with Olivia. To record a Christmas album seemed like the right, almost inevitable thing to do. I hope everyone enjoys listening to it as much as we loved recording it together." Newton-John said: "It was such a joy singing these beautiful holiday songs with my favourite singer and good mate John Farnham. The holidays are about family and friends and having this chance to sing these classics with John was pure fun from beginning to end!"[2]

John Farnham and Olivia Newton-John have performed together in concert numerous times, and have released two ARIA number-one albums: _Highlights from The Main Event_ in 1998,[3] from The Main Event Tour, also featuring Anthony Warlow and more recently _Two Strong Hearts Live_ in 2015.[4]


Critical reception

Cameron Adams and Mikey Cahill from news.com.au gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and said: "In a sea of corporate Christmas albums, this has a welcome quality missing from most: authenticity. First, they’re actual friends and Farnsey insisted on them recording together, eye-to-eye." They added: "Everything here is turned into a duet (and) producer Chong Lim hasn’t done much except capture the voices and add choirs and orchestration to make it as lush as you’d expect."[5]

Samantha Jonscher from _The Music_ gave the album two-and-a-half out of five, writing: "If you are the music programmer for David Jones this Christmas season then this is the Yuletide album for you. The Broadway smiles one imagines plastered across their faces may not be contagious, but the "cheer" will certainly be heard over even the most frantic Christmas eve shopper's pounding, desperate heartbeat."[6]
