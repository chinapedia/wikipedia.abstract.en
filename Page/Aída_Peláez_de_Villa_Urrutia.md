AÍDA PELÁEZ MARTÍNEZ (fl. 5 February 1895 – 1923), also known by her pseudonym EUGENIO,[1] was a Cuban writer, journalist, suffragist, and feminist activist.[2] She was one of the architects of Cuba's women's suffrage campaign of the 1910s, along with Digna Collazo and Amalia Mallén.[3] To this end, she participated in various pro-feminist organizations.[4]


Life and work

She was the daughter of Rodolfo Manuel José Jesús Peláez y Hernández and Adela María Aída de la Caridad Martínez y Díaz Morales, and began to write at an early age. After her father forbade her to continue such work, she used the pseudonym Eugenio at the request of her mother.[5]

Aída was one of the pioneers of the feminist movement in Cuba.[6] She participated in the Continental Women's Union, an organization which took a leading role,[7] and served in the National Suffragist Party as its vice president[8] and representative in the First Women's Congress (1923).[9] She also founded the Panamerican Round Table and Women's House of America.[10] She was the "first woman to be counted as a member of the Governing Board of the Athenaeum of Havana, having been re-elected to it three times."[11]

In 1923, she published "Necesidad del voto para la mujer" (Necessity of the vote for women) in the magazines _El Sufragista_[12] and _El sufragio femenino_.[13] Furthermore, she was editor of the periodicals _La discusión_,[14] _La Mujer_ (together with Domitila García de Coronado and Isabel Margarita Ordetx), _de Atlántida_ (together with Clara Moreda),[15] and the literary-cultural magazine _Ideal_ which she founded in 1919.[16][17]
