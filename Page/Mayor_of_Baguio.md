The MAYOR OF BAGUIO () is the chief executive of the government of Baguio, a highly urbanized city and the only city in the province of Benguet, Philippines. The mayor leads the city's departments in executing ordinances and delivering public services and holds office at the Baguio City Hall. The mayor, like all local government executives, has a term of office of three years, but has a maximum electoral tenure of three consecutive terms.[1] He is assisted by the City Vice Mayor. In case of death, resignation or incapacity, the vice mayor becomes the mayor.

The Inaugural holder of the office is E.W. Reynolds who served from September 1, 1909 to February 5, 1910, and Sergio Bayan holds distinction as the first Filipino mayor of Baguio. Meanwhile, Luis Lardizabal is the first elected city mayor.

The incumbent mayor is Benjamin Magalong, of the Nationalist People's Coalition party.[2]

Vice Mayor of Baguio

The Vice Mayor is the second-highest official of the city The vice mayor is elected via popular vote; although most mayoral candidates have running mates, the vice mayor is elected separately from the mayor. This can result in the mayor and the vice mayor coming from different political parties.[70]

The Vice Mayor is the presiding officer of the 14-man Baguio City Council, and he can only vote in case of a tiebreaker. If the mayor dies or is either suspended or removed from office, the vice mayor assumes the functions as city mayor and serve out his remaining term until the next election.

In case that the vice mayor dies while in office or is either removed or suspended, his duties will be carried out by the No.1 councilor, which is the councilor who garnered the most votes in the immediately preceding election.

The incumbent Vice Mayor is Faustino A. Olowan as of June 30, 2019.
