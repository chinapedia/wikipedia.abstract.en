Background

In May 2016, Michael Giacchino revealed that he would score the film.[3] Director Scott Derrickson called the score "magic in the literal sense of the word" adding Giacchino "is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music."[4] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios with additional score recorded at Studio Miraval in France.[5] During the recording session, Paul McCartney heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded, which he likened to The Beatles song "I Am the Walrus".[6]

Additional music

At the beginning of the first surgery, "Shining Star" by Earth, Wind & Fire is playing. Another song in the film, Feels so Good by Chuck Mangione was not included in the film's soundtrack. Derrickson, a Bob Dylan fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the Pink Floyd song "Interstellar Overdrive" [8][9]
