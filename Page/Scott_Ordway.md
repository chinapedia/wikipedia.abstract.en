Education and background

Scott Ordway was born and raised in Santa Cruz, California. He received his B.A. from the University of Puget Sound in 2006, followed by a Master’s Degree from the University of Oregon in 2008. After studies in Europe at the Freie Universität Berlin and Accademia Chigiana (Siena), he received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013.

Music

Ordway is the composer of three symphonies,[4] two concert settings of the mass,[5] numerous works for solo and ensemble voices, and more than 20 works for string quartet and other instrumental ensembles.[6] In recent years, his work has focused on a series of large-scale, multidisciplinary compositions inspired by architecture,[7] landscape,[8] and the lives of cities.[9] His work has been called “exquisite” by The New York Times,[10] “a marvel” by The Philadelphia Inquirer,[11] and “an American response to Sibelius” by The Boston Globe.[12]

He has collaborated with ensembles throughout the United States and abroad, including the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra,[13] Tanglewood New Fromm Players,[14] Lorelei Ensemble,[15] So Percussion, SOLI Chamber Ensemble,[16] Fireworks Ensemble, Boston Musica Viva,[17] Momenta Quartet,[18] and Arneis Quartet.[19]

His work has also been presented by major music festivals and institutions including the Aspen Music Festival, June in Buffalo,[20] the Oregon Bach Festival, Hong Kong Arts Festival,[21] Beijing Modern Music Festival, Portland Chamber Music Festival,[22] Newburyport Chamber Music Festival,[23] and the Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler in Berlin.

In 2016, a recording of his chamber music was released on Naxos Records,[24] featuring members of the Hong Kong Philharmonic.
