_BASS FOR YOUR FACE_ is the second studio album by American hip hop producer and recording artist DJ Muggs. The album was released by Ultra Records on January 15, 2013 in the United States.


Background

Given Muggs’ deep roots in the rap scene, the January release of _“Bass For Your Face”_ on dance super-label Ultra Records was both a surprise and marked change in direction. True to its name, the album does offer loads of low-end, but more than anything else, it’s an exercise in sonic exploration for Muggs. The album meshes sounds from dubstep, glitch, trap and hip-hop into a coherent, innovative whole.[1]


Promotion

Muggs recorded material for the album with American and British artists and also with Finnish singer Romy Harmony. In January 2012, Muggs drops a video for _"Snap Ya Neck Back"_ featuring UK rapper Dizzee Rascal, Los Angeles-based MC Bambu and starring his Cypress Hill bandmate B-Real. The first song released from the album was _"Wicked"_, which features Public Enemy's hip hop veteran Chuck D and rap rock (həd) p.e.'s vocalist Jahred. Muggs enlisted the help of director's Andrew Kline and Eric Thompson of Pushonestop top to create the futuristic landscape for _"Soundclash Business"_ video, released on February 28, 2013.[2] Muggs brings his video for _"Safe From Harm"_ featuring UK songstress Belle Humble [3] on August 20, 2013. There's two versions of the song appeared in the album.
