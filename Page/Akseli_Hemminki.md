Research

Akseli Hemminki’s research focuses on cancer immunotherapy and especially on oncolytic adenoviruses.[7] The goal of his research group is to create a new oncolytic adenovirus based treatment for cancers with no available curative treatment at the moment.[8][9] The key finding of the group is that oncolytic viruses – besides lyse tumor cells by oncolysis – trigger immune response towards the tumor.[10] Recently, Hemminki’s group has focused on attempting to enable T-cell therapy of solid tumors with oncolytic adenoviruses.[11] To facilitate setting up clinical trials Akseli Hemminki has founded two biotechnology companies: 2008 Oncos Therapeutics (merged with Targovax ASA in 2015[12][13]) and 2013 TILT Biotherapeutics.[14][15][16] Oncos completed the first oncolytic virus trial ever performed in Northern Europe in fall 2013.[17] Over 300 patients have been treated with cancer drugs developed by Hemminki.[18][19][20][21]
