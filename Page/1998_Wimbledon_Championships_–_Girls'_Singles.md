Cara Black was the defending champion, but turned 18 years old during the season and, therefore, was ineligible to compete in Juniors.

Katarina Srebotnik defeated Kim Clijsters in the final, 7–6^((7–3)), 6–3 to win the Girls' Singles tennis title at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships.[1] It was her 1st and only Grand Slam title in Juniors.
