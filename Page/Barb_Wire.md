Character history

In Steel Harbor, a bombed-out wreck of a town, thrill-junkie Barbara Kopetski—better known as Barb Wire—is a bar owner and part-time bounty hunter (in order to pay for her bar, the Hammerhead). She is skilled in many areas, but excels in combat-related abilities. While she has a brother and several allies, she is essentially a loner, although this is something which is uncomfortable for her to think about.
