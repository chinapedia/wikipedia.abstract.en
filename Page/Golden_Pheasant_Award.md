Notes

The original Japanese list[4] does not assign strict chronological numbering, rather by category. The first category is political, and in honorific order as number 1 is the current Heisei emperor, although he received the award chronologically third in that category. The second category are Japanese Scouters, again starting with number 1 Michiharu Mishima. The third category are non-Japanese recipients, and again the list cycles back to 1, being Martin B. Williams. In addition, Akira Watanabe is out of numerical sequence. Posthumously conferred are marked with (‡).
