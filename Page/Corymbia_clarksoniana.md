Corymbia_clarskoniana_flowers.jpg Corymbia_clarksoniana_capsules_and_foliage.jpg _CORYMBIA CLARKSONIANA_, commonly known as CLARKSON'S BLOODWOOD or the GREY BLOODWOOD,[1] is a bloodwood native to Queensland[2] and northern New South Wales.[3]


Description

The tree typically grows to a height of up to and has tessellated red-brown to grey-brown persistent bark throughout. The dull grey-green adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement and a narrow lanceolate to lanceolate shape that is basally tapered. The thin discolorous leaves have a length of and a width of with obscure lateral veins.[4] The terminal compound inflorescences occur in groups of seven per umbel on pedicels with a length of . The mature buds have an obovoid to pyriform shape with a length of and a width of with a rounded to conical and beaked operculum and white flowers. The species can flower as early as January but is usually between March and August. The fruits that appear after flowering are pedicellate with an urceolate to barrel shape. They are around in length and wide with a descending disc and three or four enclosed valves. The reddish brown seeds within the fruit have a ellipsoidal shape with a terminal wing and have a length of .[5]


Taxonomy

The species was first formally described by the botanists D.J.Carr and S.G.M.Carr in 1987 as _Eucalyptus clarksoniana_. It was reclassified in 1995 as _Corymbia clarksoniana_ by Ken Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson. Other synonyms include _Eucalyptus dolichocarpa_, _Corymbia dolichocarpa_, _Corymbia maritima_ and _Corymbia ligans_ subsp. _burdekinensis_.[6]

_C. clarksoniana_ is one of a group of five closely related species that are found in Queensland. The others are _Corymbia polycarpa_, _Corymbia novoguinensis_, _Corymbia plena_ and _Corymbia ligans_.[7]

The specific epithet honours John Richard Clarkson (born 1950) who wored at the Queensland Herbarium as a technician. He graduated from the University of Queensland in 1977 and was transferred to Mareeba in far north Queensland. He is a prolific botanical collector, contributing many specimens that are new to science.[8]


Distribution

The tree is endemic to eastern parts of Queensland and far northern parts of New South Wales.[9] The medium-sized bloodwood is found on inland plains and part of grassy woodlands and forests communities growing in sand and sandy loam soils but can be found in skeletal soils on ridges and hill tops.[10]
