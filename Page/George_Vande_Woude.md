He joined the National Cancer Institute in 1972 and was a member for 28 years.

In 1983, he took the lead at NCI's Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research for 15 years. He was Director of Basic Sciences at NCI when he was recruited to lead the new VARI.[2] In 1998, he became the first director of Van Andel Research Institute and served until 2009. He is currently a Fellow at VARI.[3] He recruited several young scientists to VARI who have developed successful careers, including Bart Williams from the NCI laboratory of former National Institutes of Health director Harold Varmus, Cindy Miranti from the Harvard laboratory of Joan Brugge.[4]

In 1984, Vande Woude discovered the oncogene MET, which is mutated in many cancers, and characterized it as a receptor tyrosine kinase. MET is now the target of many cancer drugs in development. His laboratory also discovered the MOS oncogene. In total, he has been a co-author on 297 PubMed referenced publications during his career.
