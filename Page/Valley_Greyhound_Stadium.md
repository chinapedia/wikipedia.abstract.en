The VALLEY GREYHOUND STADIUM is a greyhound racing stadium in Twyn Road, Ystrad Mynach, Hengoed, Wales.


Location

The track, known as 'The Valley', is on Twyn Road (CF82 7SP) sandwiched between the Caerphilly Road and A469 and on the east bank of the Rhymney River[1] (on the north side of the Dyffryn Business Park).


Licensing

It is the only remaining greyhound racing track in Wales and is independent (not affiliated to the Greyhound Board of Great Britain) but, instead, licensed by the local authority. Colloquially known as 'flapping', independent greyhound racing features local greyhounds racing at local tracks. The Valley Greyhound Stadium is one of only five independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound tracks remaining in the United Kingdom.


History

Planning for the stadium was given during April 1975.[2] The stadium opened to greyhound racing on 20 July 1976, with the first ever winner being a greyhound called 'Boss' who won in a time of 19.20 sec over 310 yards. The circuit is 410 yards in circumference consisting of race distances of 310, 515 and 720 yards. The track also stages occasional '100 yard dash' races. The principal events held at the track are the Welsh Greyhound Derby (the richest greyhound race in Wales) and the Glamorgan Cup.[3] In 2011, the stadium underwent a significant renovation including an indoor lounge with seating, panoramic viewing, television race replay monitors and a fully licensed bar.


Present racing

Racing takes place on Thursday and Saturday evenings at 7.30pm (doors open at 6.30pm). Nowadays, greyhounds regularly break 17.00 seconds over 310 yards and 29.00 seconds over the standard distance of 515 yards. Major competitions are held regularly and licensed bookmakers attend every meeting. The venue is popular with families with free entry for children. Greyhound owners and trainers encourage children to interact with the greyhounds after they have raced.[4]
