_MILIONIA QUEENSLANDICA_ is a species of moth in the family Geometridae first described by Karl Jordan and Walter Rothschild in 1895. It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland.[1]

The wingspan is about 50Â mm. The forewings are similar in pattern to those of _Milionia meeki_ and _Milionia rawakensis_, but the basal patch is often joined to the band. The hindwings have a narrow, marginal yellow band, and a rather small patch of the same colour posteriorly on the disc. This patch is connected with the anal angle by means of a narrow yellow band.[2]

The larvae are thought to feed on Araucariaceae species.[3]
