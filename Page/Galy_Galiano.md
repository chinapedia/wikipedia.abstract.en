Biography

He formed his first musical group Los Diamantes del Cesar with friends in the neighborhood where he played bass and composed songs.[2] Later he met Cuban producer Ricardo Acosta, who gave him his stage name and recorded his first album.[3]

Galy Galiano released in 1981 the album Frío de ausencia, of the ballad genre, with which he occupied the first places of the Billboard magazine for three consecutive months. The title of the album originated from a poem written by his father Orlando Galiano.[4] In Guatemala, Galy Galiano received the "Dama de plata" award for the best selling album of the year.

In 1991 he ventured into salsa with the song "_Cómo la quiero, cuánto la extraño_.". In 1992 he appeared his work named "Solo Salsa" with which he was successful in the United States, Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia. In 1994, he won the Ronda Prize for the best-selling album in Venezuela.

In 1996 he ventured into ranchera music with the album Me bebí tu recuerdo, which obtained sales of more than 500,000 copies and achieved the first places in the lists of that musical genre. Between 1997 and 1998 he released two more productions of ranchera music: _Bebiendo para olvidar_ y _No volveré a casarme_, which led him to tour Central and South America.
