_MARS_ is a documentary and science fiction television series produced by National Geographic, which premiered on November 14, 2016, on their channel, and FX.[1][2] Prior to its official air date, it was launched in a streaming format on November 1, 2016.[3] It blends elements of real interviews with a fictional story of a group of astronauts as they land on the planet Mars.

The series is based on the 2015 book _How We'll Live on Mars_ by Stephen Petranek. The fictional narrative alternates initially between the years 2033 and 2037, using present day non-fiction interviews to explain events unfolding in the story. The series was filmed in Budapest and Morocco.[4]

A companion book to the series, called _Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet_, was published in October 2016 detailing the science behind the show.[5] A prequel episode, called _Before Mars_, was produced and released conjointly with the series. It tells the fictional story of a moment in the life of one of the astronauts, and the decisions she made to get involved in science.[6]

On January 13, 2017, it was announced that National Geographic had renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on November 12, 2018.[7][8]


Premise

In the year 2033, a crew of six astronauts launch from Florida on a journey to be the first people to set foot on Mars. During the descent into the Martian atmosphere, there is a malfunction with their spacecraft, the _Daedalus_. They land 75.3 kilometres away from their planned habitat. On Earth their progress is being monitored. In the second season, the story jumps ahead several years into the future after the _Daedalus_ astronauts have built a full-fledged colony called Olympus Town. Having established mankind as an interplanetary species, Season 2 examines the impact that humans have on the Red Planet and the consequences the planet has on us.

Intermixed with the story are real-life interview footage from the present, of the crew, and their mission control; there are interviews with various public figures, including scientists and engineers, such as Elon Musk, Andy Weir, Robert Zubrin, and Neil deGrasse Tyson,[9] about the difficulties that the crew might face on a journey to, and living on, Mars.
