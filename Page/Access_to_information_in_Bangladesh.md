ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN BANGLADESH or A2I () is a UNDP and USAID-supported Access to Information Programme ran from the Prime Minister's Office of Bangladesh.[1]


History

The programme is part of Vision 2021, a political manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League party before winning the National Elections of 2008.[2] Anir Chowdhury is the current adviser to the a2i Programme.[3] The Programme aims to provide information to the citizens per "Right to Information Act of 2009"[4] and bring about a change in the Bangladesh Civil Service to a citizen-centric service delivery system.[5]

In May 2015, a2i signed a deal with the Norway-based telecommunications company Telenor Digital to develop digital services of the government in order to make public and private services to become more accessible to the people in remote areas.[6]

In January 2016, Microsoft Bangladesh signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a2i programme with a view to providing training on computer hardware and software use to Bangladeshi women entrepreneurs in 5,273 digital centers nationwide.[7]


Recognition

The project won the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) award in 2014 and 2015.[8]
