LAKE SCRANTON is a lake in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, with a 3.5 mile running track surrounding it.[1][2] The lake is considered to be a reservoir built with a dam in the early 1900s.[3] The lake borders East Mountain and Scranton, Pennsylvania. The lake is owned by the Pennsylvania American Water Company which supplies the city with drinking water.


History

The lake formed by the dam built by William Walker Scranton in 1898 was called the "Burned Bridge Reservoir", though the public called the lake "Lake Scranton".[4]

Lake Scranton was featured in Season 3 Episode 22 of The Office titled "Beach Games." Steve Carell's character of office manager Michael Scott incorrectly referred to it as "America's 8th largest indigenous body of water."
