A FLOATING MAT () is a layer of mosses and other, especially stoloniferous, plants that grows out from the shore across the surface of a lake or pond. This type of habitat is protected and is designated in the European Habitats Directive as "LRT No. 7140 Transition and Floating Mat Bogs".

Floating mats are not always capable of bearing weight. There is a risk of drowning when walking on them.


Formation

The formation of floating mats is a process of sedimentation in water bodies. In bog ponds, floating mats of peat moss form as water levels fall and nutrients accumulate. In eutrophic waters, the formation of floating mats is caused by underwater peat that floats to the surface and is colonised by plants. The vegetative mats are held together by their root systems. Reeds or rushes growing by the lakeshore can eventually cut these mats off, which results in a floating island. If the floating mats are stable and large enough, even trees can grow on them, as at the Kleiner Arbersee. Beneath the floating mats, peat is formed, which slowly sinks downwards and gradually fills the water body.


Flora and fauna

In nutrient-poor to moderately nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats form out of peat mosses, (feathery bogmoss _Sphagnum cuspidatum_, species of the complex _Sphagnum recurvum_ s.l.) or brown mosses (_Scorpidium scorpioides_). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the bog sedge (_Carex limosa_), (_Carex rostrata_), beak sedge (_Rhynchospora_ ssp.), Rannoch-rush (_Scheuchzeria palustris_) and marsh cinquefoil (_Potentilla palustris_). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (_Phragmites australis_), bulrushes (_Typha_ ssp.), hop sedge (_Carex pseudocyperus_) and cowbane (_Circuta virosa_). Floating mats are habitats for shelly amoeba such as _Amphitrema_ sp. and lake fly larvae.
