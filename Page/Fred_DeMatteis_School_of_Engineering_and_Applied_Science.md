The FRED DEMATTEIS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE (SEAS) at Hofstra University, a private university located in Hempstead, New York, United States, was created in 2012 out of the previously existing Departments of Engineering and Computer Science.[1] It currently offers three ABET-accredited degrees in engineering (B.S. Electrical, B.E. Engineering Science with options in Biomedical or Civil, and B.S. Mechanical Engineering), along with a B.S. Industrial Engineering, a B.A. and B.S. Computer Science, a B.S. Computer Engineering, a B.S. Computer Science and Mathematics, and an M.S. Computer Science.[2] As of the fall of 2017, it also offers a B.S. Civil Engineering, a B.S. Bioengineering, and a B.S. Computer Science & Cybersecurity.


History

An Engineering Science program first emerged in the early 1960s from a previous program offering the first two years of an engineering education to be completed at either Columbia University or Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now NYU Tandon School of Engineering). By 1963, several four-year degree options were being offered within a B.S. Engineering Science, including specializations in engineering science, engineering mechanics, engineering electronics, and industrial engineering. By the early 1970s, the B.S. Industrial Engineering had become a separate degree, and evening part-time B.S. programs were available in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. The B.S. in Engineering Science became the first engineering program at Hofstra to earn accreditation in 1971, and remained the only accredited program until the mid-1980s. In 1983, the degree title changed from a B.S. to a B.E., and after being established as separate programs in the 1984-85 academic year, the B.S. Electrical Engineering and B.S. Mechanical Engineering programs received their initial accreditations in 1988. Over the last 25 years, Civil and Biomedical Options have served as the two routes to a degree in the Engineering Science program. Likewise, the Department of Computer Science has offered B.A. and B.S. degrees since the 1960s. A separate B.S. degree in Computer Engineering has been offered since 2003. M.A. and M.S. degrees have been offered by the department since the 1980s and the 1990s respectively.

In 2012, the two departments became the constituent members of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. The school was formally named the Fred DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science on October 20, 2016. In 2017, the B.S. Bioengineering, B.S. Civil Engineering and B.S. Computer Science and Cybersecurity programs were inaugurated.


Academics

The school is distinguished by its emphasis on undergraduate teaching, with over 750 undergraduates matriculating in the fall of 2017,[3] served by a full-time faculty of approximately 30, and select adjuncts who are professionals in industry.[4] Approximately 40 graduate students are in the M.S. program in Computer Science. A co-op program initiated in the spring of 2015 offers upper level students the opportunity to work full-time for six to eight months at competitive salaries for one of over 140 high-tech companies,[5] mainly in the New York metropolitan area.[6][7]

A robust summer research program, with funding for undergraduates, is available in a variety of subject areas. The Center for Innovation, a program operating in SEAS, offers solutions to technical problems brought to its attention by industries, but with the industry maintaining all intellectual property rights. Largely overseen by current SEAS faculty, it also offers opportunities for students to work on practical projects.[8]

According to the most recent _U.S. News & World Report_ data released in September 2018, Hofstra’s DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science ranks 35th out of 205 non-PhD granting engineering schools throughout the United States.[9]

Department of Engineering

The DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING offers bachelor's programs in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, engineering science, biomedical engineering, and industrial engineering,[10] the first three of which are ABET-accredited.[11] The Engineering Department has affiliations with several professional associations,[12] including ASCE,[13] ASME,[14] ASEE,[15] AIAA, IEEE,[16] and IISE.[17]

Department of Computer Science

The DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE offers programs in computer science and computer engineering within SEAS. The department offers B.S. and B.A. programs at the undergraduate level[18] and a M.S. program at the graduate level.[19] Notable alumni include Mike Seiman ’01, founder and CEO of CPXi, a digital media company he started while still attending Hofstra.[20]


Facilities

Within two buildings, Hofstra SEAS maintains the following laboratories, among others:

-   Electronics
-   Advance Communication
-   Big Data – contains a data center that hosts clusters[21][22]
-   Cell and Tissue Engineering
-   Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing
-   Aerodynamics and Transfer Phenomena
-   Ultrasound Research
-   Gaming and Graphics
-   Materials Analysis

Several of these laboratories were created or enhanced through a recently completed $12 million upgrade of the facilities.[23] The Big Data Laboratory and Robotics Laboratory were funded through $2 million in grants from New York State.[24] A recently received $25 million grant from New York State is earmarked toward the construction within the next few years of a new building to house all SEAS departments and laboratories.
