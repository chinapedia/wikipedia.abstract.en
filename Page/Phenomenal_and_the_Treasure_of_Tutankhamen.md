Production

_Phenomenal and the Treasure of Tutankhamen_ was directed by Ruggero Deodato under the name of Roger Rockfeller. Deodato later stated on his name choice that he thought ""a rich man's name...so who is a rich guy? Rockfeller!" See, I was as dumb as a rock." Deodato has a cameo in the film as the man who falls off a bicycle. The producer of the film was Nicola Mauro Parenti who also starred in the film as the main character Count Guy Norton and Fenomenal. On his acting, Deodato mentioned that he was "too stiff, a dog of an actor; I treated him like shit on the set, but then he called me again for _Zenabel_." Deodato mentioned that the producer often dealt with people for funding who requested for small roles in the film for funding.

Among the cast is Parenti's wife Lucretia Love. The film was shot in Rome and Paris. While shooting in Paris on the Champs Elys√©es, while panning across the crowd gathering to see President Charles de Gaulle, among the crowd was Rex Harrison.

Reception

Deodato spoke negatively about the film in later interviews, mentioning in 2008 that he "didn't give a shit about the film."

From retrospective reviews, Roberto Curti described it as "one of the lamest, less remarkable entries in the supercriminal/superherotrend of the late 60s" with a storyline "so confused it is difficult to tell what is going on at times." Curti noted that the best thing about the film was the score by Bruno Nicolai.
