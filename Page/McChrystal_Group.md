History

The McChrystal Group was founded in 2011 by Stanley McChrystal. After his departure from the military in 2010, General McChrystal and like-minded colleagues explored how they could capture the lessons they learned in counterterrorism and translate them into the private sector, based on the premise that businesses today are experiencing parallels to what General McChrystal and his colleagues faced in the war theater. The firm grew over the years, adding academic experts and business practitioners, expanding offerings, and taking on new clients in different industries.
