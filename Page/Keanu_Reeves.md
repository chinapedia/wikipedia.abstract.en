KEANU CHARLES REEVES ( ;[1][2] born September 2, 1964) is a Canadian actor and musician. He gained fame for his starring roles in several blockbuster films, including comedies from the _Bill and Ted_ franchise (1989–2020); action thrillers _Point Break_ (1991), _Speed_ (1994), the _John Wick_ franchise (2014–2021); psychological thriller _The Devil's Advocate_ (1997); supernatural thriller _Constantine_ (2005); and science fiction/action series _The Matrix_ (1999–2003). He has also appeared in dramatic films such as _Dangerous Liaisons_ (1988), _My Own Private Idaho_ (1991), and _Little Buddha_ (1993), as well as the romantic horror _Bram Stoker's Dracula_ (1992).

Reeves has earned critical acclaim for his acting. One _New York Times_ critic praised Reeves' versatility, saying that he "displays considerable discipline and range... he moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles."[3] However, Reeves has spent much of his later career being typecast. Saving the world is a recurring character arc in many roles he has portrayed, as manifested in characters such as Ted "Theodore" Logan, Siddhartha Buddha, Neo, Johnny Mnemonic, John Constantine, and Klaatu. The _John Wick_ franchise represented a return to critical praise and commercial success for Reeves.[4][5][6] His acting has garnered several awards, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Outside of film acting, Reeves has pursued other forms of artistry, including stage acting, music performing, and directing. Onstage, he performed as Prince Hamlet for the Manitoba Theatre Centre's production of _Hamlet_. He is a musician and played bass guitar for the bands Dogstar and Becky. He wrote the text for a picture book, _Ode to Happiness_, illustrated by Alexandra Grant. He has also produced a documentary, _Side by Side_, and directed the martial arts film _Man of Tai Chi_.


Early life

Keanu Charles Reeves was born in Beirut on September 2, 1964, as the son of Patricia (_née_ Taylor), a costume designer and performer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr.[7] His mother is English and from Essex.[8] His father, an American from Hawaii, is of Chinese-Hawaiian, English, Irish, and Portuguese descent.[9][10][11][12][13] Reeves states that his grandmother is Chinese and Hawaiian and that he grew up around Chinese art, furniture, and cuisine.[14] Regarding his English ancestry, Reeves mentioned watching comedy shows such as _The Two Ronnies_ during his childhood; his mother imparted English manners that he has maintained into adulthood.[15] Reeves' mother was working in Beirut as costume designer when she met his father.[16]

Reeves' father earned his GED while imprisoned in Hawaii for selling heroin at Hilo International Airport.[17] He abandoned his wife and family when Reeves was three years old, but Reeves knew him until he was six. They last met on the island of Kauai when Reeves was 13.[18][19] After his parents divorced in 1966, his mother became a costume designer and moved the family to Sydney,[20] and then to New York City, where she married Paul Aaron, a Broadway and Hollywood director, in 1970.[21] The couple moved to Toronto, Ontario, and divorced in 1971. When Reeves was 15, he worked as a production assistant on Aaron's films.[22] Reeves' mother then married Robert Miller, a rock music promoter, in 1976; the couple divorced in 1980. She subsequently married her fourth husband, a hairdresser named Jack Bond. The marriage ended in 1994. Grandparents and nannies babysat Reeves and his sisters, and Reeves grew up primarily in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto.[23][24]

Within five years, Reeves attended four high schools, including the Etobicoke School of the Arts, from which he was expelled. Reeves stated he was expelled because he was "just a little too rambunctious and shot [his] mouth off once too often... [he] was not generally the most well-oiled machine in the school."[25] He was a successful ice hockey goalkeeper at De La Salle College. He thought of playing hockey for the Canadian Olympic team but decided to become an actor when he was 15.[26] After leaving De La Salle College, he attended Avondale Secondary Alternative School, which allowed him to obtain an education while working as an actor. He later dropped out and did not obtain a high school diploma.[27]


Career

Early career: 1980–1986

Reeves began his acting career at the age of nine, appearing in a theatre production of _Damn Yankees_.[28] At 15, he played Mercutio in a stage production of _Romeo and Juliet_ at the Leah Posluns Theatre.[29] Reeves dropped out of high school when he was 17. He obtained a green card through his American stepfather and moved to Los Angeles three years later.[30] Reeves made his screen acting debut in an episode of _Hangin' In_. In the early 1980s, he appeared in commercials including one for Coca-Cola, short films including the NFB drama _One Step Away,_[31] and stage work such as Brad Fraser's cult hit _Wolfboy_ in Toronto. In 1984, he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV youth program _Going Great_.[32]

Reeves' first studio movie appearance was _Youngblood_ (1986), in which he played a Québécois goalie. His stepfather had convinced Erwin Stoff in advance to be Reeves' manager and agent. Stoff has remained Reeves' manager and has co-produced many of his films.[33]

Breakthrough: 1986–1994

After a few minor roles, Reeves received a sizeable role in the 1986 drama film _River's Edge_, which depicted how a murder affected a group of teens. Following this film's critical success, he spent the late 1980s appearing in a number of movies aimed at teenage audiences, including the lead roles in _Permanent Record_ and the unexpectedly successful 1989 comedy, _Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure_, along with its 1991 sequel, _Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey_. The same year, he had a breakout role in the movie _Parenthood_.

From 1991, Reeves played bass guitar in the alternative rock band Dogstar. During the early 1990s, Reeves started to break out of his teen-film period. He appeared in high-budget action films such as _Point Break,_ for which he won MTV's "Most Desirable Male" award in 1992. He was involved in various lower-budget independent films, including the well-received 1991 film, _My Own Private Idaho_ with River Phoenix. In 1992, he played Jonathan Harker in the Francis Ford Coppola-directed blockbuster _Bram Stoker's Dracula_.

Rise of prominence in film: 1994–1999

In 1994, Reeves' career reached a new high as a result of his starring role in the action film _Speed._ His casting in the film was controversial because he was primarily known for comedies and indie dramas with the exception of _Point Break_. He had never been the sole headliner on a film. The summer action film had a fairly large budget and was helmed by veteran cinematographer Jan de Bont in his directorial debut.

Reeves' career choices after _Speed_ were eclectic: despite his successes, Reeves continued to accept supporting roles and appear in experimental films. He scored a hit with a romantic lead role in _A Walk in the Clouds_. He made news by refusing to take part in _Speed 2: Cruise Control_ – despite the offered $11 million paycheque, which would have been his largest to date – in favour of touring with his band and playing the title role in a 1995 Manitoba Theatre Centre production of _Hamlet_ in Winnipeg, Manitoba.[34] Of Reeves' performance, _Sunday Times_ theatre critic Roger Lewis wrote, he "quite embodied the innocence, the splendid fury, the animal grace of the leaps and bounds, the emotional violence, that form the Prince of Denmark ... He is one of the top three Hamlets [Lewis has] seen, for a simple reason: he _is_ Hamlet."[35] However, according to Reeves, his decision to not do _Speed 2_ left him blacklisted by 20th Century Fox for a decade, until _The Day the Earth Stood Still_.[36]

Reeves' choices after _A Walk in the Clouds_ failed with critics and audiences. Big-budget films such as the sci-fi action film _Johnny Mnemonic_ and the action-thriller _Chain Reaction_ were critically panned and failed at the box office, while indie films like _Feeling Minnesota_ were also critical failures. Reeves finally started to climb out of his career low after starring in the horror-drama _The Devil's Advocate_ alongside Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. Reeves took a pay cut of $1 million for _The Devil's Advocate_ so that Pacino would be cast, and he later took a 90 percent pay cut for the less successful _The Replacements_ to guarantee the casting of Gene Hackman.[37] _The Devil's Advocate_ did well at the box office and garnered good reviews.

Hollywood stardom and _The Matrix_ trilogy: 1999–2009

The 1999 science fiction-action hit _The Matrix_, a film in which Reeves had a starring role, was a box office success and attracted positive reviews.[38] Keanu_Reeves_Star.jpg

In between the first _Matrix_ film and its sequels, Reeves received positive reviews for his portrayal of an abusive husband in _The Gift_. Aside from _The Gift_, Reeves appeared in several films that received mostly negative reviews and unimpressive box office grosses, including _The Watcher_, _Sweet November_, and _The Replacements_. However, the two _Matrix_ sequels, _The Matrix Reloaded_ and _The Matrix Revolutions_, along with _Something's Gotta Give_ and the 2005 horror-action film, _Constantine_, were box office successes and brought Reeves back into the public spotlight. Reeves performed with the band Becky for a year, but he quit in 2005, citing his lack of interest in a serious music career.[39]

In early 2005, Reeves' accomplishments in Hollywood were recognized by the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a star located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.[40]

His appearance in _A Scanner Darkly_ (2006), based on the dystopian science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick, received favourable reviews, and _The Lake House_, his romantic outing with Sandra Bullock, was a success at the box office.[41] He went on to play the lead character in two 2008 films, _Street Kings_ and _The Day the Earth Stood Still_. In February 2009, he starred in director Rebecca Miller's film _The Private Lives of Pippa Lee_, which premiered at Berlinale.[42]

Eclectic filmmaking and _John Wick_: 2009–present

In 2008, Reeves began pre-production on his directorial debut, _Man of Tai Chi_. The film is a multilingual narrative, partly inspired by the life of Reeves' friend, stuntman Tiger Chen. Filming occurred in mainland China and Hong Kong. During _Man of Tai Chi's_ five years of scripting and production, Reeves acted in several B movies with lead roles as Henry in _Henry's Crime_ (2010) and John in _Generation Um..._ (2012). During that time, Reeves also played Kai in the critically panned _47 Ronin_.[43]

In 2011, he returned to other artistic mediums of expression. Having played music earlier in his career, he forayed into literature by writing the text for a "grown-up picture book" entitled _Ode to Happiness_. The text was complemented by Alexandra Grant's illustrations.[44][45] In 2011, Reeves produced the documentary _Side by Side_ about the supplanting of photo-chemical film by digital camera technology; he interviewed several prominent directors including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan.

Reeves' first directorial film, _Man of Tai Chi_, premiered in 2013 with showings at the Beijing Film Festival[46] and Cannes Film Festival.[47] The work was awarded in Beijing and praised by John Woo, a recognized director of action genre films.

Reeves has continued acting while exploring other forms of artistry. In October 2014, he played the title role in the action thriller _John Wick_. The film, which stars Reeves as a retired hitman, opened to positive reviews and performed well at the box office.[48] He reprised the role in _John Wick: Chapter 2_ (2017)[49] and again in _John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum_ (2019). Both films were well-received.

In 2016, Reeves appeared in the horror thriller _The Neon Demon_ and the dystopian romance _The Bad Batch._ Reeves had a cameo in the action-comedy film _Keanu_, in which he voiced the eponymous kitten.

Reeves paired up with Winona Ryder in the 2018 movie _Destination Wedding_[50] about wedding guests who develop a mutual affection for each other. They had previously worked together in other movies including _Bram Stoker's Dracula_, _A Scanner Darkly_ and _The Private Lives of Pippa Lee_.

In 2019, Reeves starred in _John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum_, had a cameo in the Netflix original film _Always Be My Maybe_, and voiced a character in _Toy Story 4_.[51] Given the number of high profile roles Reeves had in one year, USA Today dubbed the time period "The Summer of Keanu Reeves".[52] In addition, 2019 saw Europe's first Keanu Reeves film festival titled KeanuCon, hosted in Glasgow, Scotland.[53] Originally scheduled on the birthday of Reeves in September 2018, the festival was postponed due to a fire at the Glasgow school of Art. The festival was held on 27 and 28 April 2019, featuring nine films over two days. The movies screened included _My Own Private Idaho_, _Speed_, _The Matrix_, _Constantine_, Reeves' directorial debut _Man of Tai Chi_, and _John Wick_.[54]

Future projects

In January 2009, it was announced that Reeves was to star in a live-action film adaptation of the anime series _Cowboy Bebop_,[55][56] initially slated for release in 2011. Due to budgeting problems, the script was sent for a rewrite. The project's status is currently unknown, and its prospects are more uncertain after Netflix announced a live-action TV series.

In April 2011, Reeves stated that a third instalment of the _Bill & Ted_ series was possible.[57] He further elaborated on the film in December 2013 during a taping of NBC's _The Today Show_, stating that he is "open to the idea" and that "it's pretty surreal, playing Bill and Ted at 50." Reeves mentions that there is "a good story", that there is "life and joy in those characters", and that "the world can always use some life and joy."[58] In May 2018, a third _Bill and Ted_ film was officially confirmed under the title _Bill & Ted Face the Music_.[59] Reeves has been linked to the maritime romance _The Modern Ocean_, directed by Shane Carruth,[60] though Carruth noted that the film is unlikely to be realized.[61]

Reeves will portray the character Johnny Silverhand in the 2020 video game _Cyberpunk 2077;_ he has completed motion capture and voice recordings for the role.[62][63]


Personal life

Family and views

Keanu_Reeves_(Berlin_Film_Festival_2009)_2.jpg Reeves is entitled to British citizenship through his English mother. He holds Canadian citizenship by naturalization and identifies as such.[64]

On December 24, 1999, Reeves' girlfriend, Jennifer Syme, gave birth eight months into her pregnancy to Ava Archer Syme-Reeves, who was stillborn. The strain put on their relationship by their grief resulted in their breakup several weeks later. On April 2, 2001, Syme was driving alone on Los Angeles' Cahuenga Boulevard when she sideswiped three parked cars, rolled over several times, and was thrown from the car. Authorities believed she died instantly. She was reportedly being treated for depression and taking two prescription drugs, which police found in her car.[65][66] Reeves, who was scheduled to begin shooting back-to-back _Matrix_ sequels during the subsequent spring, sought "peace and time" to deal with the incident, according to his friend Bret Domrose, a guitarist in Reeves' alternative rock band Dogstar.[67]

While often described as a Buddhist or atheist, including being mentioned on a "Famous Atheists" list, Reeves is non-religious and has occasionally expressed a belief in God or some other higher power, stating that he believes in God and the Devil, but "they don't have to have pitchforks and a long white beard."[68] He has clarified that he has a lot of interest in and respect for Buddhism, but has not "taken refuge in the dharma".[69] In September 2013, when asked if he was a spiritual person, Reeves replied with a laugh that he believes "in God, faith, inner faith, the self, passion, and things" and that he is "very spiritual" and "supremely bountiful"[70] Reeves has generally been reticent about his spiritual beliefs, saying that it is something "personal and private."[71] When asked by Stephen Colbert about his views on what happens after death, Reeves replied, "I know that the ones who love us will miss us."[72]

In 2010, an image of Reeves became an internet meme after photos of him, seemingly depressed while sitting on a park bench eating alone, were posted to a 4chan board. The images were soon distributed via several blogs and news sites, leading to the "Sad Keanu" meme being spread on internet forums. An unofficial holiday was created when a Facebook fan page declared June 15 as "Cheer-up Keanu Day".[73][74] On the first anniversary of "Cheer-up Keanu Day", Reeves was interviewed by _The Guardian_.[75]

Reeves has stated that he is an Oxfordian and believes the works of William Shakespeare were written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[76]

Legal incidents

In 2008, Reeves was sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by paparazzo Alison Silva. The unsuccessful [77] suit claimed that Reeves hit and injured Silva with a Porsche after concluding a family visit at a Los Angeles medical facility.[78][79] The lawsuit took a year and a half to make it to trial, during which time Silva continued to attack Reeves and demand payment. At the trial, all 12 jurors rejected the suit, needing only an hour of deliberation to reach their verdict.[80]

In 2014, two stalkers trespassed on Reeves' Hollywood Hills home. On September 12, 2014, Reeves awoke and found a stalker in his library, who told him that she was there to meet him. While Reeves calmly talked to the stalker, he called the police, who arrived and arrested her before taking her in for psychological evaluation.[81] Three days later, a second stalker made her way into his home through a gate that was left unlocked by a cleaning company. The intruder undressed and took a shower in Reeves' bathroom before swimming naked in his pool. The cleaning crew became suspicious and alerted Reeves, who was not at home. He then notified the police and the stalker was remanded.[82]

Philanthropy and business

Reeves set up a cancer charity, choosing not to attach his name to the organization; he has also supported PETA, the SickKids Foundation, and Stand Up to Cancer. In 2014, he said in an interview that his sister Kim had battled leukemia for more than a decade.[83]

Reeves has stated "Money is the last thing [he] think[s] about. [He] could live on what [he has] already made for the next few centuries."[84] Reeves reportedly gave approximately $80 million of his $114 million earnings from _The Matrix Reloaded_ and _The Matrix Revolutions_ to the special effects and makeup staff. The story has been denied by the special effects staff themselves, deeming it as an urban legend.[85] The story likely originated in a back-end deal Reeves made with the producers of _The Matrix Reloaded_, relinquishing his contractual right to a percentage of the earnings from the ticket sales. Reeves reportedly did so to allow producers the flexibility for an extensive special effects budget. The value of Reeves' forgone share of the ticket profits has been estimated at $38 million, which was added to the overall movie budget, rather than going directly to special effects.[86]

Reeves co-founded a production company called Company Films, which helped produce _Henry's Crime_, a film in which Reeves starred.[87]

An avid motorcyclist, Reeves co-founded Arch Motorcycle Company, which builds and sells custom motorcycles.[88]
