In the elections for the seventh Majlis, systematically rigged by the military and Interior ministry, handpicked representatives of Reza Shah were chosen to the parliament to ensure the exclusion of recalcitrants[1] and "unsuitable candidates who insisted on running found themselves either in jail or banished from their localities".[2]

During the campaign, all public speeches were prohibited by police.[3]

Hassan Modarres who was Tehran's most voted deputy in the previous election, was expelled without even a single vote in his favor. He objected the results, famously asking "What about the vote that I had cast for myself?".[4] Other candidates such as Mohammad Mossadegh, Hassan Taghizadeh and Hossein Ala' were not elected despite the demand for them.[5]

The royalist supporters of Reza Shah flourishing in Progress Party, were the majority of the parliament, dominating about 90% of the seats.[6]

The opposition was a minority with only two-seats held by Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi representing Yazd and Mahmoud Reza Tolou of Lahijan.[7]
