'' THIS TIME IT'S PERSONAL'' is a cover album by the English performance poet Dr. John Cooper Clarke, and the former vocalist of The Stranglers, Hugh Cornwell. It was released on 14 October 2016 It was Clarke's first album release since 1982's _Zip Style Method_.


Background

The album was conceived by Cornwell, when drunk and listening to "MacArthur Park", he wondered what the song would sound like if Clarke had sung it. Having spent dinner with Clarke weeks before, he rang him up and asked him if he was interested. Clarke was receptive to the idea, and after covering "MacArthur Park", the two decided to make an album of songs from their youth, with Clarke on vocals and Cornwell on guitars.[1][2]
