CROWN TOWERS is a hotel skyscraper located in the Southbank precinct of Melbourne, Australia. Built in 1997, the hotel is one of three hotels at the Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex, the others being: Crown Promenade (2003) and Crown Metropol (2010). Located on the banks of the Yarra River, it overlooks the city centre, Kings Domain, Port Phillip and Docklands.

Proposals for a Crown hotel to join the casino date back to as early as 1994, at a time when Crown casino was situated in a temporary location on the north bank of the Yarra River.[1][2] Designed by Daryl Jackson and Hudson Conway, the Crown Towers hotel was completed in 1997 in Southbank, alongside the new casino complex.[3] The 5–star hotel opened on 8 May 1997, albeit behind schedule.[4][5] With 482 hotel rooms, across 43 levels, Crown Towers stands at in height – making it the tallest all-hotel building in Australia.[6][7][8] The hotel is the first skyscraper (building to reach at least 150 metres in height) to be constructed in the Southbank precinct of Melbourne, a location wherein some of the tallest buildings in the city now stand.[9][10]
