ANDERSON LANDING is an unincorporated community in Coahoma County, Mississippi, United States.[1]

The settlement is located on Desoto Lake.[2] Prior to 1942, Desoto Lake was part of the contiguous Mississippi River, and Anderson Landing was a riverport on the south shore of "Sunflower Bend".[3]


History

During the 1890s, Anderson Landing was the part of the Wilkerson's Plantation, and the landing was used to ship cotton.[4]

In 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers removed Sunflower Bend from the course of the Mississippi River. The resulting oxbow lake was named "Desoto Lake".[5]
