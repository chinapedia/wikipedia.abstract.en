_STAR TREK GENERATIONS_ is a 1994 American science fiction film directed by David Carson and based on the franchise _Star Trek_. It is the seventh film in the _Star Trek_ film series, as well as the first to star the cast of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. In the film, Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS _Enterprise_-D joins forces with Captain James T. Kirk to stop a villain from destroying a planet.

Parts of the film were shot at the Valley of Fire State Park near Overton, Nevada, Paramount Studios, and Lone Pine, California. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but performed well at the box office.


Plot

In the year 2293, retired Starfleet officers James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott and Pavel Chekov attend the maiden voyage of the USS _Enterprise_-B, under the command of the unseasoned Captain John Harriman. During the shakedown cruise, _Enterprise_ is pressed into a rescue mission to save two El-Aurian ships from a strange energy ribbon, despite not being fully equipped for service. _Enterprise_ is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but the starship becomes trapped in the ribbon. Kirk volunteers to modify the ship's deflector dish, allowing _Enterprise_ to escape, but the trailing end of the ribbon strikes _Enterprise_{{'}}s hull, exposing Kirk to space and leaving him presumed dead.

78 years later in 2371, the crew of the USS _Enterprise_-D celebrate the promotion of Worf to Lieutenant Commander. Captain Jean-Luc Picard receives a message from Earth that his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. Since Picard never fathered children of his own, he is distracted by the knowledge that the family line will end with him. _Enterprise_ receives a distress call from an observatory in the Amargosa star system, where they rescue an El-Aurian named Dr. Tolian Soran, who is eager to return to complete his research. Data and Geordi La Forge discover a compound called trilithium on board the observatory. Soran appears, knocks La Forge unconscious, and launches a trilithium probe at the Amargosa star. The probe causes the star to implode, sending a shock wave toward the observatory that will destroy it and everything else in the system. Soran and La Forge are transported away by a Klingon Bird of Prey belonging to the Duras sisters, in league with Soran. Data is rescued just before the station is destroyed by the shock wave, and _Enterprise_ warps away from the system.

Guinan tells Picard more about Soran; they were among the El-Aurians rescued by the _Enterprise_-B in 2293. Guinan explains that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the "Nexus", an extra-dimensional realm that exists outside of normal space-time. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, and plans to bring the ribbon to him on the planet Veridian III by destroying its sun. As a neighboring planet in that system is host to millions, Picard orders the _Enterprise_ there at maximum warp.

Upon entering the Veridian system, _Enterprise_ makes contact with the Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran first to reason with him. La Forge is returned to _Enterprise_, but with his VISOR under surveillance by the Klingons. This causes him to inadvertently reveal _Enterprise_{{'}}s shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to fire weapons directly through them and inflict crippling damage. _Enterprise_ destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander William Riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship, which separates from the engineering section. The shock wave from the warp core's detonation sends the saucer crashing to the surface of Veridian III.

Picard fails to talk Soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. The collapse of the Veridian star alters the course of the Nexus ribbon as predicted, and sweeps Picard and Soran away while the resulting shock wave obliterates everything in the system. In the Nexus, Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealised family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an "echo" of Guinan, and after being told that he may go wherever and _whenever_ he wishes within the Nexus, Guinan sends him to meet Captain Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first wrapped up in the illusion, he likewise realizes that nothing in the Nexus is real, and therefore does not matter. Picard convinces Kirk to leave the Nexus for Veridian III to help him stop Soran.

Kirk and Picard arrive on Veridian III only minutes before Soran launched the missile. Working together, they distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort; he dies knowing he helped to make the difference. Picard buries Kirk on a mountainside, before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the _Enterprise_ wreckage. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve _Enterprise_{{'}}s survivors. With the _Enterprise_ declared un-salvageable Riker laments that he will never sit in the captain's chair of this ship, Picard muses that given the name's legacy, this won't be the last ship to carry the name _Enterprise_.

Many of the background players appeared in different roles in the television series. Tim Russ, who appears as an _Enterprise_-B bridge officer, played a terrorist in "Starship Mine" and a Klingon in "Invasive Procedures", and later joined the cast of _Star Trek: Voyager_ as the Vulcan Tuvok.[2] Various background roles were played by the main cast's stunt doubles.[3]

Initially, the entire principal cast of _The Original Series_ was featured in the film's first script, but only three members appeared in the film: William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, James Doohan as Montgomery Scott, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov.[4] Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley declined to appear as Spock and Leonard McCoy. Nimoy (who was offered the job of directing the film) felt that there were story problems with the script and that Spock's role was extraneous[5]â€”"I said to everybody concerned [...] that if you took the dozen or so lines of Spock dialog and simply changed the name of the character, nobody would notice the difference."[6] _The Next Generation_ producer Rick Berman said that "Both Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley felt they made a proper goodbye in the last movie [_Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_]".[7]

Nimoy and Kelley's lines were subsequently modified for Doohan and Koenig. In Scotty's case, it created a seeming continuity discrepancy, given Scotty's dialogue in the _TNG_ episode "Relics". In that episode, Scotty implied that he believed Kirk to be still alive, although the scene's setting was after Scotty had witnessed Kirk's apparent death in _Star Trek Generations_. The official explanation for the inconsistency is that Scotty was disoriented in "Relics" after being kept alive in a transporter loop.[8] The news that the entire main cast of _The Original Series_ was not in the film did not get passed to all of _The Next Generation_ actors. When Goldberg arrived on set on her first day, she immediately asked to see Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Uhura in _The Original Series_. When told that Nichols was not in the film, she said to Koenig, "The fans have been waiting for years to see Nichelle and me and Uhura and Guinan on screen together."[9] Patrick Stewart said that he had made an effort to ensure that the original cast were involved in the film, saying "I've been passionate about that from the first time that a _Next Generation_ movie had been mentioned; I didn't want us to sail into the future just as _The Next Generation_ cast."[10]


Production

Development

After the release of _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ in 1991, it was expected that the next _Star Trek_ feature film would feature the cast of the television series _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. Paramount Pictures executives approached _The Next Generation_ producer Rick Berman in late 1992 about creating a feature film, four months before the official announcement.[11]

Berman informed Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga that Paramount had approved a two-picture deal[12] around midway through _The Next Generation_{{'}}s sixth season.[13] Moore and Braga, who were convinced Berman had called them into his office to tell them _The Next Generation_ was cancelled, instead found Berman asking them to write one of the _Star Trek_ films.[14] Berman also worked with former _Next Generation_ producer Maurice Hurley to develop possible story ideas.[15] Executive producer Michael Piller turned down the opportunity to develop ideas, objecting to what he saw as a "competition" for the job.[16] Ultimately Moore and Braga's script was chosen; the writers spent weeks with Berman developing the story before taking a working vacation in May 1993 to write the first-draft screenplay, completed June 1.[17]

Moore described _Generations_ as a project with a number of required elements that the film "had to have".[18] Berman felt that including the original cast of the previous _Star Trek_ films felt like a "good way to pass the baton" to the next series.[19] The studio wanted the original cast to only appear in the first minutes, with Kirk only recurring at the end of the film. Other requests included a big Khan Noonien Singh-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot.[20]

In the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot would have been the entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the _Enterprise_-B, happy to be back together.[21] The _Enterprise_-D's end also appearedâ€”the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale.[22] Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." After the idea of killing off a _Next Generation_ cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that "we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' " The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.[23]

Refining the script also meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho and the Midwestern United States and the total budget was over $30 million. After negotiations, the budget was reduced to $25 million.[24] A revised version of the script from March 1994 included feedback from the producers, studio, actors and director; the writers changed a sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the _Enterprise_-B's operation after Shatner felt the scene's joke went too far. Picard's personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert's heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family in a fire to add emotional impact.[25] The draft script's opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-influenced characters talking shortly before the Romulans' attack; _Next Generation_ writer Jeri Taylor suggested that the opening should be something "fun", leading to the switch to a holodeck promotion-at-sea.[26]

Nimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature as well as reprise the role of Spock.[27] The producers chose David Carson. The British director had no feature film experience, but had directed several episodes of _Star Trek_, including the popular _Next Generation_ episode "Yesterday's Enterprise" and the _Deep Space Nine_ double-length pilot episode "Emissary".[28]

Design and costumes

_Generations_{{'}}s production designer was _Star Trek_ veteran Herman Zimmerman, who had worked on previous _Star Trek_ films, _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. Zimmerman collaborated with illustrator John Eaves for many designs.[29] Zimmerman's approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing and familiar designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director Nicholas Meyer's approach to _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, Zimmerman noted that even in the future humanity will still need life support and have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.[30]

Transitioning from a television screen to a movie meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge.[31][32] Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.[33]

The script called for an entirely new location on the _Enterprise_, stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories to give the impression the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens.[34] Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create.[35] The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.[36]

The film marked the first appearance of the _Enterprise_-B. The ship model was a modification of the _Excelsior_ vessel, designed and built by Bill George and effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_ a decade earlier.[37] Coproducer Peter Lauritson, illustrator John Eaves, and Zimmerman designed the _Enterprise_-B with additions to its hull, some of which were added so that they could depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model's surface, and to improve the look of the ship when it was filmed from angles called for in the script.[38] The ship's bridge was based on previous designs for the _Enterprise_-A and _Excelsior_ sets he had created for _The Undiscovered Country_, using pieces from each.[39] The surrounding spacedock for _Enterprise_{{'}}s maiden voyage was a modification of the model created for _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (1979),[40] refurbished and slightly modified by removing a row of lights to fit better into the anamorphic screen frame.[41]

Like Zimmerman, George also took the opportunity for the _Enterprise_-D's screen debut to touch up its exterior.[42] Because _Generations_ featured the _Enterprise_-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original model built by ILM for the television series was hauled out of storage. The ship was stripped, rewired, and its surface detailed to stand up to scrutiny of the silver screen.[43] George changed the paint job, as he recalled they had been in a rush to prep the model for television and its green-and-blue color scheme did not properly read on film. The paint scheme was shifted towards a "battleship grey", with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film _Enterprise_.[44]

While the feature film made use of new sets and props, Dwyer reused previous _Star Trek_ props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible rather than spend more money on entirely new items: a chair used to torture LaForge was created using a birthing chair, nosehair clippers and flashlights for accents; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran's missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements.[45][46] The Amargosa stellar observatory set was filled with reused props from _The Next Generation_, with others added in deliberate nods to past episodes.[47] In addition to sets used on _The Next Generation_, other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_, and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes were repurposed from the sets of _The Hunt for Red October_.[48] Other set pieces and props were original; these included paintings of Picard's ancestors and a cowboy for the locations in the Nexus.[49]

Robert Blackman, _The Next Generation_{{'}}s long serving costume designer re-designed the Starfleet uniforms which the _Enterprise_-D crew would wear in the film. Blackman designed militaristic-looking uniforms with rank sleeves inspired by _The Original Series_, high collars, and jackets reminiscent of the uniforms developed for _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_. Ultimately the redesign was abandoned, and the cast wore combinations of uniforms seen on the later episodes of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and the uniforms from the early episodes of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ and throughout _Star Trek: Voyager_; the only new addition was an Eaves-designed angular com badge that replaced the previous oval shape and was later used on _Deep Space Nine_, starting with Season 3 and throughout _Star Trek: Voyager_ and the time was so short that Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton had to borrow Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney's costumes respectively for filming.[50] Also created by Blackman was a skydiving outfit worn by Shatner that was eventually reused in the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Extreme Risk".[51]

Filming

'' stood in as a holodeck recreation of a sailing ship _Enterprise_.]] served as the alien planet Veridian III]] Berman backed Carson's choice to hire John A. Alonzo, the director of photography for _Chinatown_ and _Scarface_.[52]

Filming commenced Monday, March 28, 1994. The beginning of filming was concurrent with _The Next Generation_{{'}}s production, and the film and series were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on Paramount Studio's lot. The first scenes filmed were those in the _Enterprise_-B deflector room;[53] scenes that did not feature _The Next Generation_ regulars were filmed first. After the end of the series, there was only six months before the film was scheduled to be released in theaters.[54] Scenes of Harriman, Chekov and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.[55]

Stage 7 was where the _Enterprise_-B's bridge, deflector room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set.[56] Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the _Enterprise_-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to create a different setting. Control panels styled after those in the original _Star Trek_ series helped suggest the age of the station.[57]

Despite the budget cuts, _Generations_ shot many scenes on location. The _Enterprise_-D promotion ceremony on the holodeck was filmed on _Lady Washington_, a full-scale replica of the first American sailing ship to visit Japan. The _Washington_ was anchored at Marina del Rey and sailed out a few miles from shore over five days of shooting. Some of _Washington_{{'}}s crew appeared amongst _Enterprise_ crew members.[58]

The film's climax on Veridian III was filmed over eight days on an elevated plateau in the "Valley of Fire", north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The rise's height and sloped sides required cast and crew to climb 160 vertical feet using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The 110-degree heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, as his character wore an all-wool uniform.[59] Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were then removed digitally.[60]

Picard's house in the Nexus was a private home in Pasadena, California; almost all the furnishings were custom props or outside items. Portions of the scene were shot in May 1994, followed by new shoots five months later. The revisions included adding Picard's nephew RenÃ© to his imagined Christmas celebration with his family.[61] The house of Kirk's Nexus recollections was located in Lone Pine, California, with the cabin filled with props to represent Kirk's career, from a Klingon bat'leth to a painting of _Enterprise_.[62]

The _Enterprise_-D crash scenes were filmed mid-May 1994, and were among the last remaining shots before the existing _Next Generation_ sets were demolished to make way for _Voyager_. As a result, the crew distressed and damaged the sets for the end result of the crash more than would have been normal during the series' run.[63]

After test screenings, it was decided to re-shoot Captain Kirk's death. Originally, Kirk was shot and killed by Doctor Soran, but it was felt by the test audience that this was not a fitting death for such an iconic character. The re-shoot changed the manner of his death, so that instead, he sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran's control pad and de-cloak the trilithium warhead. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.[64]

Effects

_Generations_{{'}} special effects tasks were split between the television series' various effects vendors and ILM.[65] ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that it was easy to recruit staff who wanted to work on _Star Trek_; working on the film "gave me a chance to be a part of the whole _Trek_ thing [...] ILM is practically an entire company filled with _Trek_ geeks."[66] Effects supervisor John Knoll recalled that _Generations_{{'}} screenwriters filled the initial drafts with excitingâ€”and expensiveâ€”effects.[67] Knolls's team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. "[We had] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out," Knoll recalled.[68]

The previous _Star Trek_ films had used conventional motion control techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For _Generations_, the effects artists began using computer-generated imagery and models for certain shots.[69] No physical shooting models were ever built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he found it easier to create a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to iterate from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it.[70] Other CGI elements included the solar collapses, and the Veridian III planet.[71] Knoll also used a digital version of the _Enterprise_-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and slitscan effect for the original meant that the effect "barely holds up", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout.[72] While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built, including the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.[73]

The climactic battle between _Enterprise_ and the Klingons over Veridian III was all accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, the impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects, while the final destruction of the Bird of Prey was a straight reuse of footage from _The Undiscovered Country_.[74] The weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the photon torpedoes. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from _The Motion Picture_, Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required to replicate the original effect, produced by shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment.[75]

Carson described the Nexus energy ribbon as the true villain of the film;[76] ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural analog.[77] "When creating something from scratch, it's always important to rough out the whole thing [...] because there are so many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down," recalled effects co-supervisor Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the planetary explosion of Praxis from _The Undiscovered Country_.[78] Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils.[79] To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon.[80]

The inside of the ribbon was conceptualized as similar to a dense electrical storm, with tendrils of electricity fogging the screen.[81] Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and _Enterprise_-B should be CG models.[82] To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens.[83] The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from _The Empire Strikes Back_.[84]

For animation in the stellar cartography set, the backlit starmaps were removed, and a bluescreen was rolled into place, replaced by a computer-animated star map composited in post-production. The star maps were created by Santa Barbara Studios.[85]

The _Enterprise_-D crash sequence was filmed in a 40-by-80 ft. forest floor set extended by matte paintings,[86] built outside so ILM could use natural light. A 12-foot model _Enterprise_ saucer was constructed specifically for the shots; the model's size gave it the right sense of scale for flying dirt and debris, an illusion enhanced by shooting with a high-speed camera to give the saucer the expected slow movement of a massive object.[87] ILM shot its crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto the top of the saucer to represent the Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section.[88]

Music

Dennis McCarthy, a composer who had worked on _The Next Generation_, was given the task of composing for the feature. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy's score was "tasked with straddling the styles of both series", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the _Enterprise_-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on _The Next Generation_), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.[89]

McCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the _Enterprise_. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from _The Next Generation_{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, and Alexander Courage's _Star Trek_ theme.[90]

For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp.[91] The Courage theme plays again at the film's close.[92]

The soundtrack for the film was re-released as a two-disc, expanded collector's edition on GNP Crescendo Records in 2013 [GNPD 8080] to include previously unheard tracks.[93]


Reception

Release

_Star Trek Generations_ went on general release in North America on November 18, 1994 and grossed $23.1 million during the opening weekend, averaging $8,694 across 2,659 theatres. It was the highest-grossing film during the first week of its release in the United States, and stayed in the top ten for a further four weeks. The film went on to gross $75,671,125 in the United States and $42,400,000 internationally, making $118 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.[94] In Japan, the film grossed $1.2Â million its opening weekend, a large amount considering the franchise's usual poor performance in that market.[95]

The marketing of _Generations_ included a website, the first on the internet to officially publicize a motion picture.

The site was a success, being viewed millions of times worldwide in the weeks leading to the film's release at a time when fewer than a million Americans had internet access.[96] A novelization of the film written by J. M. Dillard spent three weeks on _The New York Times_ Best Seller list. Guyana produced stamps and souvenir sheets for the film's release.[97]

Several tie-in video games were released to coincide with the film's release. These included a PC game by developers MicroProse called _Star Trek Generations_ (albeit three years after the film's release), which featured the film's cast as voice actors. The game roughly followed the plot of the film with the majority of the game played in a first-person perspective.[98] Absolute Entertainment published _Star Trek: Generations â€“ Beyond the Nexus_ for the Game Boy and the Game Gear handheld devices.[99]

Among the tie-in merchandise released to promote the film were action figures by Playmates Toys; due to production timelines, these figures wore the Blackman-designed Starfleet uniforms that were ultimately unused in the film itself.[100]

Critical reaction

_Star Trek Generations_ earned mixed reviews from critics. As of April 2019, the film holds a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 53 reviews with the consensus: "_Generations_ stands as a mediocre changing of the guard for crews of the _Enterprise_, with a dull plot that sometimes seems like an expanded episode of the television series."[101] On Metacritic the film has score of 55 out 100, based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[102] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+.[103]

James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave _Generations_ two and a half stars out of four, saying: "Despite a reasonably original storyline, familiar characters, first rate special effects, and the hallmark meeting between Captains Kirk and Picard, there's something fundamentally dissatisfying about [the movie]. The problem is that [...] too often it seems like little more than an overbudgeted, double-length episode of the _Next Generation_ television series."[104]

Janet Maslin of _The New York Times_ said: "_Generations_ is predictably flabby and impenetrable in places, but it has enough pomp, spectacle and high-tech small talk to keep the franchise afloat."[105] Jeremy Conrad of IGN gave the film a score of 7 out of 10, saying that it "feels a little rushed and manufactured", but called it "one of the better of the odd-numbered _Trek_ films",[106] referring to a belief that even-numbered _Star Trek_ films are traditionally of higher quality.[107] Jay Carr in _The Boston Globe_ described the film as "reassuringly predictable", saying that it featured elements that would be recognisable by the fans of both series. He praised the improved special effects in a comparison with _The Next Generation_, and said that the "lack of surprises" was a benefit in this instance.[108]

In a negative review, Roger Ebert of the _Chicago Sun-Times_ asserted that _Generations_ was "undone by its narcissism" due to the film's overemphasis on franchise in-jokes and the overuse of "polysyllabic pseudoscientific gobbledygook" uttered by its characters.[109] Ebert also lamented the film's unimaginative script and complained "the starship can go boldly where no one has gone before, but the screenwriters can only do vice versa."[110]

In 2016, in a listing that included each _Star Trek_ film and TV series together, this movie was ranked 12th by the _L.A. Times_, ahead of the 1979 film _Star Trek: The Motion Picture._[111]
