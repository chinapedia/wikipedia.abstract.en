TEINEITE is a tellurite mineral with the formula Cu(TeO₃) . 2 H₂O. It has a Moh's hardness of 2.5 and it comes in many different shades of blue, ranging from cerulean blue to bluish-gray. The mineral millsite has the same chemical composition, but crystallizes in the monoclinic system, while teineite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system.[1][2][3]


Occurrence

Teineite was first identified in the Teine mine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, where the name of this mineral originates. It occurs in veins where copper- and tellurium-bearing sulfides were oxidized and is often associated with tellurite, tellurium, pyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, azurite, malachite, quartz, baryte, hessite, galena, bornite, cerussite, chlorargyrite, quetzalcoatlite, cuprite and graemite.[4][5] It has also been found in other places, including other mines in Japan, several mines in the US and mines in Mexico, Belgium, Russia and Norway.[6][7]
