_COUNTRY CLASSICS_ is a compilation album by country pop singer Juice Newton. It was released by EMI America Records on December 3, 2002.[1] The album comprises four songs taken from her "breakthrough" album _Juice_ (1981), four from her follow-up album _Quiet Lies_ (1982), two each from her pre-_Juice_ albums _Take Heart_ (1979) and _Well Kept Secret_ (1978), and the title song from _Come to Me_.[2][3][4][5][6] Two songs featured in this compilation, "It's a Heartache" and "Let's Keep It That Way" had hitherto been released only as singles, the latter being Newton's first top 40 country hit.[7]

The CD also includes the rare "country single mix" of "The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)", which replaced the string arrangement with a steel guitar. This is the only commercial CD to include this version.
