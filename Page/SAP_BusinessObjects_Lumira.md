SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS LUMIRA also known as LUMIRA is a business intelligence software developed and marketed by SAP BusinessObjects.[1] The software is used to manipulate and visualize data.[2]


History

Lumira was initially launched as SAP Visual Intelligence in 2012.[3] The first edition of the software could only use SAP's HANA platform as a data source. The second release expanded data sources to include CSV and Excel files.[4] In 2013, SAP rebranded the software under the Lumira name and began offering a version of the software as a cloud computing program.[5] In 2015, the cloud version of Lumira was absorbed into SAP's Cloud For Analytics software, while the Lumira Server and Lumira Desktop software remained separate.[6][7]

In 2016, Lumira 2.x was announced. The upcoming software is said to be able to run applications from the Design Studio 1.6 data visualization software.[8]
