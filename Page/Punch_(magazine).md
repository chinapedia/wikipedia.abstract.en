Punch § Periodicals}}

_PUNCH; OR, THE LONDON CHARIVARI_ was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841 by Henry Mayhew and wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells. Historically, it was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s, when it helped to coin the term "cartoon" in its modern sense as a humorous illustration.

After the 1940s, when its circulation peaked, it went into a long decline, closing in 1992. It was revived in 1996, but closed again in 2002.


History

_Punch_ was founded on 17 July 1841 by Henry Mayhew and wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells, on an initial investment of £25. It was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. It was subtitled _The London Charivari_ in homage to Charles Philipon's French satirical humour magazine _Le Charivari_. Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch, of Punch and Judy; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that "punch is nothing without lemon". Mayhew ceased to be joint editor in 1842 and became "suggestor in chief" until he severed his connection in 1845. The magazine initially struggled for readers, except for an 1842 "Almanack" issue which shocked its creators by selling 90,000 copies. In December 1842 due to financial difficulties the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans, both printers and publishers. Bradbury and Evans capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies and also were the publishers for Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.

Cartoon terminology

The term "cartoon" to refer to comic drawings was first used in _Punch_ in 1843, when the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and "cartoons" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term "cartoon" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or in Italian. _Punch_ humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the _Punch_ cartoons led to the term's widespread use.

Artistry

The illustrator Archibald Henning designed the cover of the magazine's first issues. The cover design varied in the early years, though Richard Doyle designed what became the magazine's masthead in 1849. Artists who published in _Punch_ during the 1840s and 50s included John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. This group became known as "The _Punch_ Brotherhood", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843.[1] _Punch_ authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called _Once A Week_ (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from _Household Words_.[2]

Liberal competition

In the 1860s and 1870s, conservative _Punch_ faced competition from upstart liberal journal _Fun_, but after about 1874, _Fun_'s fortunes faded. At Evans's café in London, the two journals had "Round tables" in competition with each other.[3] True_humility.png, originally published in 1895]]

Gaining a market and relations with other papers

After months of financial difficulty and lack of market success, _Punch_ became a staple for British drawing rooms because of its sophisticated humour and absence of offensive material, especially when viewed against the satirical press of the time. _The Times_ and the Sunday paper _News of the World_ used small pieces from _Punch_ as column fillers, giving the magazine free publicity and indirectly granting a degree of respectability, a privilege not enjoyed by any other comic publication. _Punch_ shared a friendly relationship with not only _The Times_ but journals aimed at intellectual audiences such as the _Westminster Review_, which published a fifty-three page illustrated article on _Punch's_ first two volumes. Historian Richard Altick writes that "To judge from the number of references to it in the private letters and memoirs of the 1840s..._Punch_ had become a household word within a year or two of its founding, beginning in the middle class and soon reaching the pinnacle of society, royalty itself".[4]

Increasing in readership and popularity throughout the remainder of the 1840s and 1850s, _Punch_ was the success story of a threepenny weekly paper that had become one of the most talked-about and enjoyed periodicals. _Punch_ enjoyed an audience including Elizabeth Barrett, Robert Browning, Thomas Carlyle, Edward FitzGerald, Charlotte Brontë, Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell. _Punch_ gave several phrases to the English language, including The Crystal Palace, and the "Curate's egg" (first seen in an 1895 cartoon by George du Maurier). Several British humour classics were first serialised in _Punch_, such as the _Diary of a Nobody_ and _1066 and All That_. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the artistic roster included Harry Furniss, Linley Sambourne, Francis Carruthers Gould, and Phil May.[5] Among the outstanding cartoonists of the following century were Bernard Partridge, H. M. Bateman, Bernard Hollowood who also edited the magazine from 1957 to 1968, Kenneth Mahood and Norman Thelwell.

Circulation broke the 100,000 mark around 1910, and peaked in 1947–1948 at 175,000 to 184,000. Sales declined steadily thereafter; ultimately, the magazine was forced to close in 2002 after 161 years of publication.

_Punch_ was widely emulated worldwide and was popular in the colonies. The colonial experience, especially in India, influenced Punch and its iconography. Tenniel's _Punch_ cartoons of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny led to a surge in the magazine's popularity. Colonial India was frequently caricatured in _Punch_ and was an important source of knowledge of India for British readers.[6]

Later years

_Punch_ material was collected in book formats from the late nineteenth century, which included _Pick of the Punch_ annuals with cartoons and text features, _Punch and the War_ (a 1941 collection of WWII-related cartoons), and _A Big Bowl of Punch_ – which was republished a number of times. Many Punch cartoonists of the late 20th century published collections of their own, partly based on _Punch_ contributions.

_Punch_ magazine ceased publishing in 1992.[7]

In early 1996 the businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed bought the rights to the name, and _Punch_ was relaunched later that year.[8][9] It was reported that the new version of the magazine was intended to be a spoiler aimed at _Private Eye_, which had published many items critical of Fayed. _Punch_ never became profitable in its new incarnation, and at the end of May 2002 it was announced that it would once more cease publication.[10] Press reports quoted a loss of £16 million over the six years of publication, with only 6,000 subscribers at the end.

Whereas the earlier version of _Punch_ prominently featured the clownish character Punchinello (Punch of Punch and Judy) performing antics on front covers, the resurrected _Punch_ did not use the character, but featured on its weekly covers a photograph of a boxing glove, thus informing its readers that the new magazine intended its name to mean "punch" in the sense of a punch in the eye.

_Punch_ table

In 2004 much of the archive was acquired by the British Library, including the _Punch_ table. The long oval Victorian table was brought into the offices some time around 1855, and was used for staff meetings and on other occasions. The wooden surface is scarred with the carved initials of the magazine's longtime writers, artists and editors, as well as six invited "strangers", including James Thurber and Prince Charles. Mark Twain declined the invitation, saying that the already-carved initials of William Makepeace Thackeray included his own.
