MERCYVILLE is an unincorporated community in Macon County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

Mercyville was laid out in the 1860s, and named after Mercy Williams, the wife of a local blacksmith.[2] In 1888, the majority of the population removed to nearby Elmer when the railroad was extended to that point.[3] A post office called Mercyville was established in 1867, and remained in operation until 1889.[4]
