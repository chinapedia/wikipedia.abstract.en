The OUR LADY OF NAREK CATHEDRAL [1] ( ) also called ARMENIAN CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY OF NAREK (_Catedral Armenia de Nuestra Señora de Narek_) is an Armenian Catholic cathedral church[2] that is located in the Charcas street in the city of Buenos Aires[3] the capital of Argentina. The congregation follows the Armenian rite and is in full communion with the Pope. It is one of the five Catholic cathedrals in Buenos Aires, others following the Roman rite (Metropolitan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity and the Military Cathedral), Maronite Rite (Cathedral of St. Maron), Ukrainian rite (Our Lady of Patrocinio Cathedral). It should not be confused with the Armenian Cathedral of St. Gregory the Enlightener (Armenian Apostolic Church).

The property on which the present structure was built was purchased in 1942 where a small chapel operated, the work of the new church was developed between 1971 and 1981 when it was officially consecrated.[4] The temple is the main church of the Armenian Eparchy of San Gregory of Narek in Buenos Aires (_Eparchia Sancti Gregorii Narekiani Bonaërensis Armenorum_) created in 1989 by the bull "Cum Christifideles ritus Armeni in Republica Argentina" of the then Pope John Paul II to meet the religious needs of the local Armenian Catholic community.

The church is under the pastoral responsibility of Bishop Vartán Waldir Boghossian.
