The SHETLAND GAS PLANT is a natural-gas processing plant on the Shetland Islands


History

The site is the collection point for the Laggan-Tormore project, involving two large gas fields. The Laggan gas field was discovered in 1986. The Tormore gas field was discovered in 2007. The plan for the site was approved in March 2010.

The site was formally opened by Amber Rudd on 16 May 2016.[1]


Structure

The site is connected to the Shetland Islands Regional Gas Export Pipeline (SIRGE). The site was built by Petrofac's Offshore Engineering & Operations unit; Petrofac is a recent constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[2] The site and pipelines cost around Â£800m. The gas is exported from the site via a 230km 30-inch diameter pipe south to the Frigg UK System in Aberdeenshire.

The site is next door, to the east, of the Sullom Voe Terminal.


Operation

The Laggan and Tormore gas fields are around 125km north-west of the Shetland Islands, in sea depths of 600 metres. Production from the site began on 8 February 2016. The production from the Laggan-Tormore project is expected to be around 93,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
