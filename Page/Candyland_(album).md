_CANDYLAND_ is the tenth studio album by Italian gothic metal band Theatres des Vampires, released through Scarlet Records on 14 October 2016. Initially announced on 7 July 2016,[1] it is their first studio album in 5 years since _Moonlight Waltz_, and also their first release with guitarist Giorgio Ferrante, who replaced Stephan Benfante early in 2016. It is noticeably more guitar-driven than the band's previous releases with Sonya Scarlet on vocals, and its lyrics focus less on the vampiric and occult themes the band is famous for. A music video for the track "Morgana Effect" was uploaded to the band's official YouTube channel on 29 September 2016.[2]

The album counts with guest appearances by Moonspell vocalist Fernando Ribeiro and J.T.R. Sickert frontman Tiziano Panini (a.k.a. Billy T. Cooper), Scarlet's husband.


Track listing


Critical reception

The album has received mostly positive reviews since its release. Writing for _New Noise Magazine_, Grim Lord gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing its sonority favorably to Lacuna Coil, Theatre of Tragedy, The Dreamside and "the gothic metal/rock of [his] younger days". However, he also stated that "[he] didn't find Scarlet's vocal approach to be to [his] taste in most songs" ("Pierrot Lunaire" excepted, which he thought of as "one of the disc's main standouts"), and commented on the lack of "occult-/Lilith-/Lucifer-style lyrics" as being "a kind of a drag".[3] Matt Coe of _Eternal Terror_ webzine rated the album with a 4 out of 6, and stated that "_Candyland_ has multi-level appeal and should satisfy the long-timers while hopefully attain some new followers along the way".[4]
