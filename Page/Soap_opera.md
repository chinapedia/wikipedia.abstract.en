A SOAP OPERA is an ongoing drama serial on television or radio, featuring the lives of many characters and their familial, platonic and intimate relationships.[1] The term _soap opera_ originated from radio dramas being sponsored by soap manufacturers.[2]

BBC Radio's _The Archers_, first broadcast in 1950, is the world's longest-running radio soap opera;[3] the world's longest-running television soap opera is _Coronation Street_, first broadcast on ITV in 1960.[4]

A crucial element that defines the soap opera is the open-ended serial nature of the narrative, with stories spanning several episodes. One of the defining features that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is "that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode".[5] In 2012, _Los Angeles Times_ columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas,

  Although melodramatically eventful, soap operas such as this also have a luxury of space that makes them seem more naturalistic; indeed, the economics of the form demand long scenes, and conversations that a 22-episodes-per-season weekly series might dispense with in half a dozen lines of dialogue may be drawn out, as here, for pages. You spend more time even with the minor characters; the apparent villains grow less apparently villainous.[6]

Soap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.

Evening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.

In 1976, _Time_ magazine described American daytime television as "TV's richest market", noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximize ad revenues.[7] The article explained that at that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs.[8] The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of _Days of Our Lives_,[9][10] a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.[11]


Origin of the genre

The first serial considered to be a "soap opera" was _Painted Dreams_, which debuted on October 20, 1930 on Chicago radio station WGN.[12] Early radio series such as _Painted Dreams_ were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week. Most of the listeners would be housewives. Thus, the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience.[13] The first nationally broadcast radio soap opera was _Clara, Lu, and Em_, which aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931.


Plots and storylines

The main characteristics that define soap operas are "an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations".[14] Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. "Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from _EastEnders_ to _Dallas_.[15] Due to the prominence of English-language television, most soap-operas are completely English (or in the case of a foreign soap opera, dubbed into English). However, several South African soap operas started incorporating a multi-language format, the most prominent being _7de Laan_, which incorporates Afrikaans, English, Zulu and several other Bantu languages which make up the 11 Official Languages of South Africa (the subtitles are always in English).

In many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the US, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working-class environments.[16] Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare.[17] UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting "reality" or purport to have a "realistic" style.[18] UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, _EastEnders_ focuses on the tough and grim life in the east end of London; _Coronation Street_ and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of "northern straight talking".[19] Romance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In US daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.

Australian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the "romantic quality" of criminal and/or oligarch life.

In soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.

As in comic books – another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th century – a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent.[20] On _The Bold and the Beautiful_, Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.

Stunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.


United States

Daytime serials on television

as Penny Hughes from _As the World Turns_]] The first daytime TV soap opera in the United States was _These Are My Children_ in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.

In 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of _General Hospital_, said to _The New York Times_:[21]

Many long-running US soap operas established particular environments for their stories. _The Doctors_ and _General Hospital_, in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. _As the World Turns_ dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being "the loyal housewife" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. _Guiding Light_ dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. _Search for Tomorrow_ mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. _Days of Our Lives_ initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. _The Edge of Night_ featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. _The Young and the Restless_ first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.

In contrast, _Dark Shadows_ (1966–1971) and _Port Charles_ (1997–2003) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.

The American soap opera _Guiding Light_ (originally titled _The Guiding Light_ until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter & Gamble, _Guiding Light_ was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 until 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.

Originally serials were broadcast as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, _As the World Turns_ and _The Edge of Night_, both produced by Procter & Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (_Another World_ even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four US serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only _The Bold and the Beautiful_ airs 30-minute episodes.

Soap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as _General Hospital_, _Days of our Lives_ and _The Young and the Restless_ were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. _As the World Turns_ and _The Edge of Night_ were the last to make the switch, in 1975.

_Port Charles_ used the practice of running 13-week "story arcs," in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of _Soap Opera Digest_, it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.

Though U.S. daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled. Early episodes of _Dark Shadows_ were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After _The Edge of Night_{{'}}s 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, SOAPnet, began re-airing soaps that originally aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.

Newer broadcast networks since the late 1980s, such as Fox and cable television networks, have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV's The 101 Network took over existing serial _Passions_, continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, _The Catlins_ (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and _Another Life_ (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth "major network," carried a short lived daytime soap _Tribes_ in 1990. Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure).

Due to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, _Dark Shadows_, which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).

Performers

    _See List of longest-serving soap opera actors_

Due to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on _The Edge of Night_ was played by three different actors.

Conversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap _As the World Turns_ from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records[22] as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both _General Hospital_ and _Port Charles_ from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in _All My Children_ from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on _One Life to Live_ from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.[23]

Other actors have played several characters on different shows. Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Louis Edmonds, Dan Hamilton, Don Hastings, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Maeve McGuire, James Mitchell, Christopher Pennock, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Louise Shaffer, and Diana van der Vlis, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.

Evolution of the daytime serial

For several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.

Exterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series _The Edge of Night_ and _Dark Shadows_. Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, _The Best of Everything_ and _Ryan's Hope_ were set in a real-world location, New York City.

The first exotic location shoot was made by _All My Children_, to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the _All My Children_ shoot. Soap operas _Another World_ and _Guiding Light_ both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. _Search for Tomorrow_ taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.

During the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.

One of the first and most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on _General Hospital_. Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.

With increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left-Handed Boy Statue, and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.

During the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on _All My Children_, the re-emergence of Viki Lord's multiple personality disorder on _One Life to Live_, and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on _All My Children_. Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion, homophobia, and racism.

Some shows during the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera _Dark Shadows_ was Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and _One Life to Live_ featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past.

Traditional grammar of daytime serials

Modern U.S. daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.

American daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:

-   A construct unique to U.S. daytime serials is the format where the action will cut between various conversations, returning to each at the precise moment it was left. This is the most significant distinction between U.S. daytime soap operas and other forms of U.S. television drama, which generally allow for narrative time to pass, off-screen, between the scenes depicted.[24] On occasion, a character or characters involved a conversation earlier in that act may appear in a different setting later in the same act.
-   In U.S. daytime soap operas, scenes often end with a pregnant pause and a close-up on the character. There will be no dialogue for several seconds, while the music builds before cutting to a commercial or a new scene. This kind of segue is referred to in the industry as a "tag."
-   The traditional three-point lighting set-up routinely used in filmmaking and television production is also used on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated back lighting to lift actors out of the background. This is useful in programs like soap operas, which are shot on videotape in small interior sets. The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets.
-   Domestic interiors are often furnished with stained wood wall panels and furniture, and items of brown leather furniture. This is to give a sumptuous and luxurious look suggesting the wealth of the characters. Daytime serials often foreground other sumptuous elements of set decoration; presenting a "mid-shot of characters viewed through a frame of lavish floral displays, glittering crystal decanters or gleaming antique furniture".[25]
-   Few U.S. daytime soap operas routinely feature location or exterior-shot footage (_Guiding Light_ began shooting many of its scenes outdoors in its final two seasons). Often an outdoor locale is recreated in the studio. Australian and UK daily soap operas invariably feature a certain amount of exterior shot footage in every episode. This is usually shot in the same location and often on a purpose-built set, with new exterior locations for particular events.
-   The visual quality of a soap opera is usually lower than prime time U.S. television drama series due to the lower budgets and quicker production times. This is also because soap operas are recorded on videotape using a multi-camera setup, unlike primetime productions that are usually shot on film and frequently use the single camera shooting style. Because of the lower resolution of video images, and also because of the emotional situations portrayed in soap operas, daytime serials make heavy use of close-up shots. Programs in the United States did not make the full conversion to high definition broadcasting until September 2011, when _The Bold and the Beautiful_ became the last soap to convert to the format; _One Life to Live_ was an exception to this, as it continued to be produced and broadcast in standard definition – albeit in the 16:9 aspect ratio – until the end of its run on ABC in January 2012.
-   Soap operas have idiosyncratic blocking techniques. In one common situation, a romantically involved couple starts a conversation face-to-face, then one character will turn 180° and face away from the other character while the conversation continues. This allows both characters to appear together in a single shot, and both facing the audience. This is unrealistic in real life and is not frequently seen in film or on television outside U.S. daytime serials, but it is an accepted soap opera convention, sometimes referred to as a "Two Shot West."[26]
-   Because of the escapist tone of the genre and due to the large number of cast members employed by each program (usually totaling around 30 to 35 actors for hour-long soaps, and 15 to 25 for those lasting a half-hour), daytime soap operas have traditionally listed all contract cast members (as well as recurring and guest actors) during the closing credits, instead of the opening title sequence. Until the 1990s, these series listed only a few of the principal actors at the end of the episode in certain episodes airing on Monday through Thursdays. Because of the aforementioned reasons, an extended credit sequence featuring a complete list of the show's cast members – listed alongside the characters they portray – typically airs at least once per week (usually on the Friday show; although since the 2000s, most soap operas – with _General Hospital_ as one of the few exceptions – have randomized the day the cast list is shown). _The Young and the Restless_ became the first American daytime soap to include the names of its contract actors in the opening credits in 1999 (although due to the large number of actors on contract with the show at one time, it utilizes different versions of the title sequence with a randomized list of about six actors); _The Bold and the Beautiful_ began listing its entire main cast (as well as some actors appearing on a recurring basis) from 2004 to 2017, with _General Hospital_ following suit from 2010 to 2013.[27]

Decline

Statistics and trends

Soap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera has been created since _Passions_ in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – _General Hospital_, _Days of Our Lives_, _The Young and the Restless_ and _The Bold and the Beautiful_ – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This marks the first time since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television.[28] _The Young and the Restless_, the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as _Judge Judy_.[29] Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication.[30] SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year.[31] The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017.[32]

Several of the U.S.’s most established soaps ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, _Guiding Light_, barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run.[33] _As the World Turns_ aired its final episode on September 17, 2010 after a 54-year run. _As the World Turns_ was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter & Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name.[34] _As The World Turns_ and _Guiding Light_ were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. _All My Children_, another New York-based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and _One Life to Live_, each with a four-decade-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. _All My Children_ aired its network finale in September 2011 with _One Life to Live_ following suit in January 2012.[35] Both _All My Children_ and _One Life to Live_ were briefly revived online in 2013, before being canceled again that same year.[36]

Causes

As women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for.[37] Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day.[38] The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama.[39] An early term for the reality TV genre was _docu-soap_.[40] A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.[41][42]

Daytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas,[43] making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with _Sunset Beach_ and _Port Charles_. Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes.[44] In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.[45]

The primetime serial

Serials produced for primetime slots have also found success. The first primetime soap opera was _Faraway Hill_ (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network.[46] _Faraway Hill_ ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.

The first long-running prime time soap opera was _Peyton Place_ (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).

The popularity of _Peyton Place_ prompted the CBS network to spin-off popular _As the World Turns_ character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, _Our Private World_ (originally titled "The Woman Lisa" in its planning stages). _Our Private World_ was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer Eileen Fulton) returned to _As The World Turns_ after the series ended.

The structure of _Peyton Place_, with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the primetime serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.

The successful primetime serials of the 1980s included _Dallas_, _Dynasty_, _Knots Landing_ and _Falcon Crest_. These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline – respectively, J. R. Ewing, Alexis Colby, Abby Cunningham and Angela Channing. These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences "loved to hate".

Unlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. _Dallas_, its spin-off _Knots Landing_, and _Falcon Crest_ all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. _Dynasty_ featured this format throughout its run.

The soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American primetime television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was _Hill Street Blues_. This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later _Cagney & Lacey_ overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters.[47] The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as _St. Elsewhere_ and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.

The primetime soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as _Beverly Hills, 90210_, _Melrose Place_, _Party of Five_, _The OC_, and _Dawson's Creek_, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as _Desperate Housewives_, _Grey's Anatomy_, _Brothers & Sisters_, _Ugly Betty_, _Private Practice_, and more recently _Revenge_, _Nashville_, _Scandal_, _Mistresses_, and formerly _Ringer_, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including _Heroes_ and _Friday Night Lights_. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.

On June 13, 2012, _Dallas_, a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show's most established star, Larry Hagman, died midway through the series. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, _Hollywood Heights_, which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela _Alcanzar una estrella_, suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.

In 2015, Fox debuted _Empire_, a primetime musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Oscar nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare's _King Lear_, James Goldman's _The Lion in Winter_ and the 1980s soap opera _Dynasty_. Also in 2015, E! introduced _The Royals_, a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by _Dynasty_ (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a primetime soap opera _Blood & Oil_, following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015 during the 2015-16 TV season.

Telenovelas

The telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism _Spanish soap opera_ has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.

Spanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.[48]

Online serials

Some web series are soap operas, such as _Degrassi: In Session_ or _Venice: The Series_. In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived _All My Children_ and _One Life to Live_ for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions).[49] Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each.[50] In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.[51]


United Kingdom

    _See List of longest-serving soap opera actors_

Soap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting _Front Line Family_ in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II.[52] The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, _The Archers_, which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951.[53] It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.

In the UK, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the kitchen sink drama.[54] The most popular British television programmes are _EastEnders_, _Coronation Street_, _Emmerdale_, _Hollyoaks_, _Doctors_, and the Australian produced _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_. The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television.[55] Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British Royal Family, including Elizabeth II herself. Major events in British culture are often mentioned in the storyline, such as England's participation at the World Cup, and the death of Princess Diana.[56] '' on Christmas Day 1986, watched by 30.15 million viewers. The story, in which Den Watts served his wife Angie with divorce papers, was the highest-rated soap episode in British history, and the highest-rated program in the UK during the 1980s. Only the 1966 World Cup Final and the funeral of Princess Diana rank higher in the all time ratings.[57]]] The 1986 Christmas Day episode of _EastEnders_ is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (more than half the population at the time).[58] The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of _EastEnders_ the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (32.3 million viewers) and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) which were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV.[59]

Television

An early television serial was _The Grove Family_ on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's _Emergency - Ward 10_, running from 1957 until 1967.

In the 1960s _Coronation Street_ revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in _Guinness World Records_.[60] The BBC also produced several serials: _Compact_ was about the staff of a women's magazine; _The Newcomers_ was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; _United!_ contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; _199 Park Lane_ (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as _Coronation Street_. Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.

During the 1960s, _Coronation Street_{{'}}s main rival was _Crossroads_, a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. _Crossroads_ was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. _Crossroads_ was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of _Crossroads_ was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).

A later rival to _Coronation Street_ was ITV's _Emmerdale Farm_ (later renamed _Emmerdale_), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in _Emmerdale_ being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.

_Pobol y Cwm_ (_People of the Valley_) is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. _Pobol y Cwm_ was originally broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. _Pobol y Cwm_ was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.[61]

The 1980s

Daytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced _General Hospital_, which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted _Take the High Road_, which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as _The Sullivans_ (aired on ITV from 1977), _The Young Doctors_ (from 1982), _Sons and Daughters_ (from 1983), _A Country Practice_ (from 1982), _Richmond Hill_ (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, _Neighbours_ was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and _Home and Away_ aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.

The day Channel 4 began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based _Brookside_, which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of _Brookside_ was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike _Coronation Street_ and _Emmerdale Farm_, which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in _Brookside_ were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though _Brookside_ was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.

In 1985, the BBC's _EastEnders_ debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham).

A notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera _Prisoner_, which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title _Prisoner: Cell Block H_. It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.

The 1990s

In 1992, the BBC made _Eldorado_ to daily alternate with _EastEnders_. The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered _Hollyoaks_, a soap with a youth focus. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera _Family Affairs_, which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.

_Brookside_{{'}}s premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.

_Coronation Street_ and _Brookside_ began releasing straight-to-video features. The _Coronation Street_ releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The _Brookside_ releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.

_Emmerdale Farm_ was renamed _Emmerdale_ in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and _Emmerdale_ grew in popularity.

Throughout the 1990s, _Brookside_, _Coronation Street_, _EastEnders_ and _Emmerdale_ continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.

The 2000s

Since 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime drama _Doctors_ began in March 2000, preceding _Neighbours_ on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial _High Road_ (formerly _Take The High Road_) continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched _River City_, which proved popular and effectively replaced _High Road_ when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial _Brookside_ ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving _Hollyoaks_ as Channel 4's flagship serial.

A new version of _Crossroads_ featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled _Night and Day_. This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003. _Family Affairs_, which was broadcast opposite the racier _Hollyoaks_, never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, _Family Affairs_ had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005.

In 2008, ITV premiered _The Royal Today_, a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama _The Royal_, which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002. Just days later, soap opera parody programs _Echo Beach_ premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy _Moving Wallpaper_. Both _Echo Beach_ and _The Royal Today_ ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera _Silver Street_ debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010.[62]

Format

UK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original _Crossroads_, which began as a week-daily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced.

In 1989 _Coronation Street_ began airing three times a week. In 1996 it expanded to four episodes a week.

_Brookside_ premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990 it expanded to three episodes a week.

_EastEnders_ increased its number of episode a week in 1994 and _Emmerdale_ did so in 1997.

_Family Affairs_ debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week its entire run.

In 2004, _Emmerdale_ began airing six episodes a week.

In a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of _Coronation Street_ and _Emmerdale_ were moved out of their slots. _Coronation Street_ added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. _Emmerdale_{{'}}s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with _EastEnders_. In July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, _Coronation Street_ moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. _Emmerdale_ reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings.[63] _Coronation Street_ later returned to a Wednesday slot, to air Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. _Emmerdale_ airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.

Later, _Coronation Street_ (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) produced five episodes a week.

It was announced in June 2016 that starting late 2017, Coronation Street would air six episodes a week.[64]

_Doctors_ airs five episodes a week, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. _Hollyoaks_ produces five episodes a week. The imported _Neighbours_ screens as five new episodes a week. As of 2019, _EastEnders_ produces four episode a week.

UK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. In their early years _Coronation Street_ and _Emmerdale_ used 16 mm film for footage shot on location. Since the 1980s UK soap opera have routinely featured scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on.

_Hollyoaks_ and _Family Affairs_ were taped on high-definition video, and used the filmizing process.

UK soap operas generally do not incorporate recap sequences at the beginning of each episode, which would be appropriate for the fact that when an episode ends, it picks up the story during the following episode. In 2012, _Hollyoaks_ began airing a recap sequence at the beginning of each episode.

With the exception of _Hollyoaks_, soap operas in the UK lack incidental music, although _EastEnders_ would sometimes feature music that plays over an especially dramatic ending scene, with an alternative _EastEnders_ theme known as "Julia's theme".


Australia

    _See List of longest-serving soap opera actors_

Australia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes.

Stylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences.[65] Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.[66]

Early serials

The genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, _Big Sister_, featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera _Blue Hills_, which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was _Autumn Affair_ (1958) featuring radio personality and _Blue Hills_ star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. _Autumn Affair_ failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by _The Story of Peter Grey_ (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. _The Story of Peter Grey_ ran for 164 episodes.

The first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with _Bellbird_, produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. _Bellbird_ was a moderate success but built-up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. _Motel_ (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.

The 1970s

The first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama _Number 96_, a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, _Number 96_ had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of _Number 96_ prompted the creation of _The Box_, which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered _The Box_ to be a more slickly produced and better written show than _Number 96_. _The Box_ also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after _Number 96_. For 1974 _Number 96_ was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year _The Box_ occupied the number two spot.

Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first _teen_ soap opera, _Class of '74_. With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on _Number 96_ and _The Box_, its high school setting and early evening timeslot, _Class of '74_ came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.

By 1975, both _Number 96_ and _The Box_, perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. _Class of '74_ was renamed _Class of '75_ and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap _The Unisexers_ failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap _Until Tomorrow_ ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.

A feature film version of _Bellbird_ entitled _Country Town_ was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. _Number 96_ and _The Box_ also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of _Number 96_ and _The Box_ also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.

In November 1976 _The Young Doctors_ debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of _Number 96_ and _The Box_, focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later _The Sullivans_, a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, _The Sullivans_ became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period _Number 96_ re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. _Bellbird_ experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.

_Bellbird_, _Number 96_ and _The Box_, which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. _The Young Doctors_ and _The Sullivans_ continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series _Cop Shop_ (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced _The Restless Years_ (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.

The Seven Network, achieving success with _Cop Shop_ produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce _Skyways_, a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show _The Don Lane Show_. _Skyways_, which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.

The 1980s

The Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama _Prisoner_ (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga _Sons and Daughters_ (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.

Grundy soap _The Young Doctors_ and Crawford Productions' _The Sullivans_ continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: _Taurus Rising_ (1982), _Waterloo Station_ (1983), _Starting Out_ (1983) and _Possession_ (1985), along with _Prime Time_ (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created _Neighbours_, a suburban-based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.

Produced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, _Neighbours_ achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show _Perfect Match_ on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in _Neighbours_ as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep _Neighbours_ on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas _A Country Practice_ and _Sons and Daughters_.

After the network cancelled _Neighbours_, it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. In January 2011 it moved to Eleven and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.

The success of _Neighbours_ in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as _Home and Away_ (1988–present) on Channel Seven and _Richmond Hill_ (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however _Richmond Hill_ emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by _E Street_ (1989–1993).

Nine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama _Family and Friends_ in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme _Chances_ in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of _Number 96_ and _The Box_ in an attempt to attract attention. _Chances_ achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.

Australian soaps internationally

Several Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of _The Young Doctors_, _The Sullivans_, _Sons and Daughters_ and _Neighbours_ (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's _Prisoner_ began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. _Prisoner_ also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated _Prisoner_ in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of _Sons and Daughters_. During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as _Dallas_ and _Dynasty_ had resulted in the debuts of _Taurus Rising_ and _Return to Eden_, two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.

Other shows to achieve varying levels of international success include _Richmond Hill_, _E Street_, _Paradise Beach_ (1993–1994), and _Pacific Drive_ (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's _Home and Away_, a teen soap developed as a rival to _Neighbours_, has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.

The 1990s and beyond

_Something in the Air_, a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.

Attempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ saw the creation of _Echo Point_ (1995) and _Breakers_ (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, _Neighbours_ was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode[67] – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for _Neighbours_ had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for.[68] During this period _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.

It has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes[69] and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters.[70] The casts of _Neighbours_ and _Home and Away_ are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial,[71] a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.

_Neighbours_ was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as _All My Children_ and _The Young and the Restless_, and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.

_headLand_ made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of _Home and Away_ that was to have been produced in conjunction with _Home and Away_{{'}}s UK broadcaster, Five. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon's _H2O: Just Add Water_ appeared on July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the Steven Universe episode "Love Letters".

After losing the UK television rights to _Neighbours_ to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial _Out of the Blue_, which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008[72] but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008.[73][74] The series was cancelled after its first season.[75]

_Neighbours_' continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011.[76] However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.[77]


New Zealand

Television

Pioneering series _Pukemanu_[78] aired over two years (1971–72) and was the NZBC's first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.[79] _Close to Home_ is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on TVNZ 1 from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make _The Governor_).[80] _Gloss_ is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap _Dynasty_, with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in _Shortland Street_, which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.

Radio

Radio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap _You Me Now_ in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.


Canada

Relatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included _Family Passions_, _Scarlett Hill_, _Strange Paradise_, _Metropia_, _Train 48_ and the international co-production _Foreign Affairs_. _Family Passions_ was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including _49th & Main_ and _North/South_, have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.

Notable prime time soap operas in Canada have included _Riverdale_, _House of Pride_, _Paradise Falls_, _Lance et Compte_ ("He Shoots, He Scores"), _Loving Friends and Perfect Couples_ and _The City_. The _Degrassi_ franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.

On French-language television in Quebec, the _téléroman_ has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included _Rue des Pignons_, _Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut_, _Diva_, _La famille Plouffe_, and the soap opera parody _Le Cœur a ses raisons_.


India

Unlike the season based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the late 1990s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.[81]

Many soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.[82]


Europe

Remakes of Australian serials

The Australian serial _The Restless Years_ was remade in the Netherlands as _Goede tijden, slechte tijden_ (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_ (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to "good times, bad times". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.

A later Australian serial, _Sons and Daughters_, has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are _Verbotene Liebe_ (Germany, 1995–2015); _Skilda världar_ (Sweden, 1996–2002); _Apagorevmeni agapi_ (Greece, 1998); _Cuori Rubati_ (Italy, 2002–2003) and _Zabranjena ljubav_ (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both _The Restless Years_ and _Sons and Daughters_ were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.

Norway

The Norwegian soap opera _Hotel Cæsar_ aired on TV 2 from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include _Days of Our Lives_ (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), _The Bold and the Beautiful_ (TNT (Norway) and _Home and Away_ (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.

Netherlands

Serials have included _Goede tijden, slechte tijden_ (1990–present), _Onderweg naar Morgen_ (1994–2010) and _Goudkust_ (1996–2001). In 2016 _Goede tijden, slechte tijden_ spin-off _Nieuwe Tijden_ started airing. U.S. daytime serials _As The World Turns_ and _The Bold and the Beautiful_ have aired in the Netherlands; _As the World Turns_ began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.

Germany

In the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with _Lindenstraße_, which was seen as a German counterpart to _Coronation Street_. Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_ became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_, Das Erste introduced _Marienhof_, which aired twice a week.

After successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like _GZSZ_, the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled _Verbotene Liebe_, which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of _Verbotene Liebe_, the network turned _Marienhof_ into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced _Unter uns_ in late 1994.

ZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series _Family Passions_, starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Schönherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted _Jede Menge Leben_. Even after a crossover with three soaps, _Freunde fürs Leben_, _Forsthaus Falkenau_ and _Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht_, the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera _Neighbours_, which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with _So ist das Leben – die Wagenfelds_, before failing with _Geliebte Schwestern_. RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with _Alle zusammen - jeder für sich_.

The teen soap opera _Schloss Einstein_ debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.

In 1999, after the lasting success of _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_, _Marienhof_, _Unter uns_ and _Verbotene Liebe_, ProSieben aired _Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies_, set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.

In 2006, _Alles was zählt_ became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_ and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. _Unter uns_ was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After _Unter uns_ was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. _Marienhof_ had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however _Marienhof_ was canceled in June 2011. _Verbotene Liebe_ was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after _Marienhof_ was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.

While _Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten_, _Unter uns_ and _Alles was zählt_ are currently the only daily soaps on the air after _Verbotene Liebe_ has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas _Sturm der Liebe_ and _Rote Rosen_ are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.

Belgium

''. At the back Peter Rouffaer is visible.]] In Belgium, the two major soap operas are _Thuis_ ("Home") and _Familie_ ("Family"). Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. _Familie_ debuted in late 1991, and with nearly 6,000 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is _Thuis_, which has aired on "één" since late 1995. _Thuis_ is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.3 million Flemmings in total).

During the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as _Neighbours_ and _The Bold and the Beautiful_ were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as _Days of Our Lives_, Australia's _Home and Away_ and Germany's "Sturm der Liebe". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera "Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include _The Young and the Restless_, _EastEnders_ (both on VTM), "Port Charles" (at één, then known as TV1) and "Coronation Street" (on Vitaya). "Santa Barbara" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.

The only teen soap opera on Belgian television was _Spring_ ("Jump" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.

Italy

The most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series _Un posto al sole_ ("A Place Under the Sun"), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera _Neighbours_). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as _Ricominciare_ ("Starting Over"), _Cuori rubati_ ("Stolen Hearts"), _Vivere_ ("Living"), _Sottocasa_ ("Downstairs"), _Agrodolce_ ("Bittersweet") and _Centovetrine_ ("Hundred Shop Windows").

The most popular Italian prime-time drama series, _Incantesimo_ ("Enchantment"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1.

Ireland

Television

In the early years of RTÉ, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ's first television soap was _Tolka Row_, which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both _Tolka Row_ and _The Riordans_ were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera _The Riordans_, which premiered in 1965.[83] Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for _The Riordans_ in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted _Emmerdale Farm_ (now _Emmerdale_), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, _The Riordans_ was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his "Agri-soap" trilogy _Bracken_, starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of _The Riordans_. Bracken was soon replaced by the third "Agri-soap" _Glenroe_, which ran until 2001. As RTÉ wanted a drama series for its Sunday night lineup rather than a soap opera, _On Home Ground_ (2001–2002), _The Clinic_ (2002–2009) and _RAW_ (2010–2013) replaced the agri-soaps of the previous decades.

In 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. _Fair City_, which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded _Fair City_ to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. _Fair City_ airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved _Coronation Street_ to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of _Fair City_ began airing at 7:30 p.m. each week.

TG4 produce the Irish language soap _Ros na Rún_ ("Headland of the Secrets" or "Headland of the Sweethearts"); set in the fictional village of _Ros Na Rún_, located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of _Ros Na Rún_ has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. _Ros na Rún_ is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.

Although Ireland has access to international soaps (such as _Coronation Street_, _Emmerdale_, _EastEnders_, _Home and Away_, _Hollyoaks_ and _Neighbours_), _Fair City_ continues to outperform them all, and is Ireland's most popular soap opera, with the show peaking at over 700,000 viewers.

January 2015 _Red Rock_ has broadcast on TV3. Red Rock airs twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series is base in a fishing village in Dublin. The soaps centres around the local Garda station but also includes stories from the village.

Radio

RTÉ Radio produced its first radio soap, _Kennedys of Castleross_, which ran from April 13, 1955 to 1975.[84] In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985.[85] In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, _Harbour Hotel_, which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, _Konvenience Korner_ and _Riverrun_, which were followed in 2004 by _Driftwood_.[86] RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however RTÉ Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.[87]

Greece

In Greece, there have been several soap operas.

ANT1

An early serial was _Sti skia tou hrimatos_ ("Money Shadows"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of _Lampsi_ ("the Shining"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of _Lampsi_ came the short lived _To galazio diamandi_ ("Blue Diamond") and _Simphonia siopis_ ("Omertà"). _Lampsi_ was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by _Erotas_ ("Love"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.

Greece's second longest-running soap is _Kalimera Zoi_ ("Goodmorning Life"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.

MEGA

Mega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial _I Dipsa_ ("The Thirst"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included _Paralliloi dromoi_ (1992–1994) and its successor _Haravgi_ ("Daylight", 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials _Apagorevmeni Agapi_ ("Forbidden Love"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; _Gia mia thesi ston Ilio_ ("A Spot Under the Sun"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; _Filodoxies_ ("Expectations"), which ran from 2002 to 2006; and _Vera Sto Deksi_ ("Ring on the Right Hand"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to _Lampsi_, causing that show's ratings to decline.

_Ta Mistika Tis Edem_ ("Edem Secrets"), which was created by the producers of _Vera Sto Deksi_, debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.

ERT

IENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas _I Kravgi Ton Likon_ and _Megistanes_. ERT also produced the long-running soap _O Simvoleografos_. Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas, which included _Pathos_ ("Passion"), _Erotika tis Edem_ ("Loving in Eden") and _Ta ftera tou erota_ ("The Wings of Love"). These failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.

ALPHA

Alpha produced _Kato apo tin Acropoli_ ("Under the Acropolis"), which ran for 2½ years.

Cyprus

Weekday shows

The first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV's _Odos Den Ksehno_ ("'Don't Forget' Street"), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by _To Serial_, which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998. CyBC created the third weekdaily soap, _Anemi Tou Pathous_ ("Passion Winds"), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by _I Platia_ ("The Square") from September 2004 to July 2006. _Epikindini Zoni_ ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. _Vimata Stin Ammo_ made its debut in September 2010.

Sigma TV first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap _Sto Para Pente_, which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and first held the distinction of being the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by _Se Fonto Kokkino_, which ran from September 2008 to July 2012. Other Sigma TV weekday shows include _Akti Oniron_ (which ran from 1999 to 2001), _Vourate Geitonoi_ (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekdaily series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), _Oi Takkoi_ (which ran from 2002 to 2005), _S' Agapo_ (which ran from 2001 to 2002), _Vasiliki_ (which ran from 2005 to 2006), _Vendetta_ (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), _30 kai Kati_ (which ran from 2006 to 2007) and _Mila Mou_ (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009).

ANT1 Cyprus aired the soap _I Goitia Tis Amartias_ in 2002, which was soon canceled. _Dikse Mou To Filo Sou_ followed from 2006 to 2009, along with _Gia Tin Agapi Sou_, which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by _Panselinos_, which has aired since 2009.

Weekly shows

The longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is _Istories Tou Horkou_ ("Villages Stories", which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by _Manolis Ke Katina_ ("Manolis and Katina", which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was _To Kafenio_ ("The Coffee Shop"), which premiered on CyBC on 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekdaily show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus on 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1's _Eleni I Porni_ ("Eleni, The Whore"), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC's _Stin Akri Tu Paradisou_ ("At The Heaven's Edge"), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was _Aigia Fuxia_, which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.

Finland

The only daily Finnish soap opera so far is _Salatut elämät_ (_Secret Lives_), which has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on MTV3. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in Helsinki. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012.

Other soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows _Uusi päivä_ (which has aired since 2009) and _Kotikatu_ (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs do not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.


Internet and mobile soap opera

With the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including _EastEnders: E20_, a spin-off of the established _EastEnders_. For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.

On September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, _Na Rúin_ (an Internet spin-off of _Ros na Rún_). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.


Parodies

In motion pictures, the 1982 comedy _Tootsie_ has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.

The 1991 comedy _Soapdish_ stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on fictional series _The Sun Also Sets_ who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes such as her live-in boyfriend who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the program.

Another 1991 comedy, Delirious, stars John Candy as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.

On television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:

-   _The Carol Burnett Show_ (1967–78) featured a recurring skit, "As the Stomach Turns", that spoofed the American soap opera _As the World Turns_.
-   The first season of the children's television series _The Electric Company_ featured a recurring sketch, "Love of Chair", spoofing classic soap operas. The title was based on the long-running soap opera _Love of Life_, and its announcer Ken Roberts was also the announcer on Love of Life.
-   Two of the most famous U.S. parodies were the series _Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman_ (1976–77) and _Soap_ (1977–81), the latter of which was a weekly sitcom/soap opera parody.
-   _Fresno_ was a 1986 American miniseries spoof of the primetime serials of the period.
-   The recurring "Acorn Antiques" skit on the UK's _Victoria Wood As Seen On TV_ (1985–87) was modeled on _Crossroads_ and other British soap operas of the 1970s.
-   _Let The Blood Run Free_ (1990–94) was an Australian parody of medical drama series.
-   The 1990–91 ABC drama _Twin Peaks_ was a primetime series that poked fun at the genre. Episodes during the series' first season also included a fictional soap within the stories, titled _Invitation to Love_.
-   _Shark Bay_ (1996) was an Australian parody of glamorous beachside soap operas. It featured many actors who had appeared in Australian soap operas _Sons and Daughters_, _Prisoner_, _Home and Away_ and _Neighbours_.
-   The 2000–2001 WB sitcom _Grosse Pointe_ was a self-parody of creator Darren Star's behind-the-scenes experiences producing nighttime soaps, in particular _Beverly Hills, 90210_.
-   South African comedian Casper de Vries produced the soap opera parody _Haak en Steek_ (which ran from 2003 to 2004), based on South African soaps like _Egoli: Place of Gold_.
-   The ABC dramedy _Dirty Sexy Money_ (which ran from 2007 to 2009) was in a way a soap opera parody but, in actuality, was styled as more of a satire that operated in a humorous way similar to a parody. The series was critically acclaimed, but only lasted for two seasons.
-   The now-cancelled ABC soap opera _One Life to Live_ would often poke fun at the genre as well, even featuring a soap within the soap called _Fraternity Row_, which many of _One Life to Live_{{'}}s characters had either worked on or watched. Months after ABC announced in April 2011 that it would cancel _One Life to Live_, the series featured a storyline in which _Fraternity Row_ itself was cancelled, leading the character of Roxy Balsom (Ilene Kristen) to desperately try and save the series, to no avail. A special episode that aired on December 19, 2011 featured the cast of _One Life to Live_ acting out an episode of _Fraternity Row_ in a dream of Roxy's; the episode poked fun at both _One Life to Live_ and the entire genre itself, featuring many soap opera stereotypes such as over-acting, outrageous story lines, bad casting and incestuous relationships; it also parodied some storylines featured on the real-world soap. The second-to-last episode of _One Life to Live_ showed characters watching the final episode of _Fraternity Row_ and exposing the show's last big secret: the series' main heroine and protagonist, Lorraine King Vonvaldenburg Baxter Beumont, was really a man.
-   _Second City TV_ featured _The Days of the Week_: "Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. These are...The Days of the Week."
-   The ABC comedy-drama _Desperate Housewives_ (which ran from 2004 to 2012) was a semi-satirical nighttime series that took many elements from the genre.
-   The Adult Swim animated series _Tender Touches_ which premiered in 2017 is a parody of soap operas.[88]
