History

Before its closure in the late 1990s, the depot had an allocation of 104 and 108 DMUs.[2] Stabled locomotives included Classes 08, 20, 25, 31, 37, 45 and 47.[3][4] Classes 101 and 102 DMUs could also be seen at the depot. The depot was used from 1994 to 1997 as a fuelling point until fuelling facilities were installed at Peak Forest where the stabling of the locos was transferred to.
