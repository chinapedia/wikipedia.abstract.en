ADRIÁN ZENDEJAS RODRÍGUEZ (born August 30, 1995) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a goalkeeper for Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer.


Career

Youth

Zendejas grew up playing with Nomads SC and San Diego Surf of the U.S. Soccer Development Academy,[1] and for Hilltop High School,[2] before joining the under-20s of Liga MX side Tijuana.[3]

Professional

On June 30, 2016, Zendejas signed with United Soccer League side Swope Park Rangers.[4] He went 8-0-0 in his first eight starts. In helping Rangers to the USL Cup Final, he had a 0.36 goals against average and 0.87 save percentage,[5] both ranking best in the USL among all goalkeepers with at least eight appearances.[6]

In December 2016, Zendejas signed a Major League Soccer contract with Sporting Kansas City.[7] He began the 2017 MLS season as backup to Tim Melia, before re-joining Rangers on loan from Sporting KC.[8] In 25 USL appearances, he had 10 shutouts and a goals-against-average of 0.91, again regarded as one of USL's top goalkeepers. In the USL Cup Playoffs against OKC Energy, after making two saves in regulation, one save in extra time, and four saves in the penalty shootout, Zendejas himself scored the game-winning penalty kick that sent Swope Park to the USL Cup Final again.[9]

In 2018, Zendejas split time between starting on loan at Swope Park in USL and backing up Tim Melia in MLS. On June 6, Zendejas made his Sporting KC debut in the fourth round of the U.S. Open Cup, shutting out Real Salt Lake over 90 minutes in a 2-0 victory. On June 18, he went 90 minutes again for Sporting KC in the Open Cup, in the Round of 16 against FC Dallas, notching five saves in a 3-2 victory.[10]

International

Zendejas is eligible to play for the United States due to his birth and upbringing in Chula Vista, California, and for Mexico through parentage.[11] He has expressed an interest in representing the United States.[12]
