Description

_Zieria montana_ is an open, compact shrub which grows to a height of and has erect, wiry branches with conspicuous ridges. The leaves are composed of three elliptic to egg-shaped leaflets with the central one, long and wide, the leaves with a stalk long. The leaflets are glabrous except for a few scattered hairs on the lower side along the mid-vein.[1]

The flowers are white, tinged with pink and are arranged in upper leaf axils in groups of 10 to 20. The groups are shorter than the leaves and each flower is on a stalk long. There are four egg-shaped sepal lobes about long and four petals about long. In common with other zierias, there are only four stamens. Flowering occurs from September to December.[2]
