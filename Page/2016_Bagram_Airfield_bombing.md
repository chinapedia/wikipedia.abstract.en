The 2016 BAGRAM BOMBING took place on November 12, 2016, when a suicide bomber managed to penetrate the security layer of Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan located about 45 km north of Kabul, detonating his vest near a group of Soldiers who were en route to Modern Army Combatives Training. Four U.S. citizens were killed (2 soldiers and 2 contractors, while at least 17 others were injured, including 16 Americans and 1 Polish citizen. One injured Soldier died a month later from complications due to injuries sustained in the blast raising the total killed to 5.[1][2][3]


Attack

According to Abdul Wahid Sediqi, spokesman for the governor of Parwan Province Mohammad Asim Asim, the attacker managed to infiltrate the base on foot, joining a group of workers reporting for duty early in the morning.[4] After successfully passing through at least one checkpoint, he approached a sidewalk where a group of Soldiers were preparing for Combatives Training, detonated his explosive vest around 05:38 local time.[5] Two U.S. soldiers and two U.S. private contractors were killed, in addition to the bomber. Among the 17 injured were 16 U.S. service members and one Polish soldier.[6]

The bombing was the deadliest single incident involving U.S. troops since a December 2015 suicide attack at the same base which killed six soldiers.


Aftermath

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement issued by their spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, confirming the sports ground was the intended target, and adding that the attack had been planned for four months.[7][8]

In response to the bombing, Bagram Airfield was placed under lockdown, while additional security measures were taken at all other locations in Afghanistan for Resolute Support Mission forces. The Embassy of the United States in Kabul was closed for the following day as a precautionary measure.[9]
