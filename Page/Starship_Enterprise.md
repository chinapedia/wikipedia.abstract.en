USS Enterprise}} series.]] _.]] _.]]

_ENTERPRISE_ or USS ''ENTERPRISE'' (often referred to as the "STARSHIP _ENTERPRISE_") is the name of several fictional spacecraft, some of which are the main craft and setting for various television series and films in the _Star Trek_ science fiction franchise. The most notable were Captain James T. Kirk's from the original 1960s television series, and Captain Jean-Luc Picard's from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_.


Depiction

Pre-Federation era

Two spacecraft with the name _Enterprise_ predate the United Federation of Planets in _Star Trek_{{'}}s fictional timeline. REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (XCV 330)
CLASS: _Declaration_
SERVICE: circa 2130s
CAPTAIN: Unknown

This USS _Enterprise_ (XCV 330) appears in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (1979) among a series of illustrations depicting ships named _Enterprise_. It also appears as a model in _Star Trek Into Darkness_ (2013), together with models of the _Wright Flyer_, a V-2 rocket, a Bell X-1, a Vostok-3KA capsule, a Space Shuttle orbiter, and some _Star Trek_ universe starships. The 1979 _Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology_ describes this "first interstellar liner" as a _Declaration_-class ship launched in 2123.[1] Its length is given as , and it has a capacity of 100 crew and 850 passengers.[2] The _Star Trek Maps_ by New Eye Photography Editors, also published in 1979, listed this ship as a fusion drive probe that was Earth's first attempt to explore another star system. _The Making of Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, published in 1980, describes the ship as "the very first starship U.S.S. _Enterprise_".[3] A painting of this ship hangs on the wall of Earth's 602 Club in flashbacks that appeared in the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "First Flight" (2003).

REGISTRY: _Enterprise_ (NX-01)
CLASS: NX
SERVICE: 2151–2161 (10 years)
CAPTAIN: Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula)

United Earth Starfleet's _Enterprise_ is the main setting of _Star Trek: Enterprise_ (2001–2005). _Enterprise_ was the first Earth built starship capable of reaching Warp 5. She was commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer and played an instrumental role in the founding of several proto-Federation alliances. _Enterprise_ had significant engagements with the Klingons, Suliban, Xindi and the Romulans and playing a central role in the "Temporal Cold War." It is also featured as a model in _Star Trek Into Darkness_.

Reception

In 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the fictional spacecraft design as the number seventh best version of starship _Enterprise_ of the _Star Trek_ franchise.[4] They felt that the design "had its own look" yet was still familiar.[5]

_The Original Series_ era

Three ships named USS _Enterprise_ are featured in the original _Star Trek_ television series and the first through seventh _Star Trek_ films.

REGISTRY:
CLASS: _Constitution_[6]
SERVICE: 2245–2285 (40 years)
CAPTAINS: Robert April (James Doohan [voice]), Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter, Sean Kenney, Anson Mount), James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Willard Decker (Stephen Collins), Spock (Leonard Nimoy).
The Federation's first _Enterprise_ is the main setting of the original _Star Trek_ series (1966–1969) and _The Animated Series_ (1973–74).[7] Having undergone an extensive rebuilding and refitting, _Enterprise_ then appears in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (1979) and _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ (1982), before being destroyed in _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_ (1984).[8] The bridge appears on the holodeck of the _Enterprise_-D in the _Next Generation_ episode "Relics". The ship also appears in the _Deep Space Nine_ episode "Trials and Tribble-ations", and in the closing montage of the final _Enterprise_ episode "These Are the Voyages...".

Details of the ship's appearance differed prior to the time period of the original series, including a transparent dome ceiling for the bridge that appeared in the 1965 pilot episode "The Cage", as shown in a flashback to Captain Pike's command in "The Menagerie" (1966). A significantly redesigned version of Captain Pike's _Enterprise_ appears in _Star Trek: Discovery_{{'}}s second season, set several years after the events of "The Cage".[9] The new design for the _Enterprise_, which more closely matches the aesthetic of _Discovery_, debuted in 2018 at the conclusion of the season 1 finale.[10]

Reception

In 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the fictional spacecraft design shown in this television series, the Enterprise, as the number one best version of starship _Enterprise_ of the _Star Trek_ franchise.[11] They felt that the original design was still superior to almost a dozen different later versions.[12] REGISTRY:
CLASS: _Constitution_-class refit[13][14]
SERVICE: 2286–2293 (7 years)
CAPTAINS: James T. Kirk (William Shatner)
This ship first appears at the conclusion of _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ (1986) and is the main setting in the subsequent _Star Trek_ movies which use the original crew. The ship is ordered decommissioned at the end of _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_.[15] Non-canon information concerning this ship includes paperwork included with the model kit, which indicated the ship was mothballed at the Memory Alpha ship museum, and the Shatnerverse novel _The Ashes of Eden_ (1996), which depicted _Enterprise_-A's removal from the mothball fleet before being destroyed defending the planet Chal. REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-B)
CLASS: _Excelsior_-class refit[16]
SERVICE: 2293–2329 (36 years)
CAPTAINS: John Harriman (Alan Ruck)
Launched at the start of _Star Trek Generations_ (1994).[17] James T. Kirk is declared missing, presumed killed, after the ship encounters the Nexus energy ribbon on its maiden voyage.[18] Non-canon information concerning this ship includes _Star Trek_ novels listing Demora Sulu (Jacqueline Kim) succeeding Harriman as captain; also, William George, Demora Sulu, and Thomas Johnson, Jr. are listed as the official captains in various licensed guides such as the _Haynes Enterprise Manual_.

_The Next Generation_ era

Three ships named _Enterprise_ are featured in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and four _TNG_-era films.

REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-C)
CLASS: _Ambassador_
SERVICE: 2332[19] – 2344 (12 Years)
CAPTAINS: Rachel Garrett (Tricia O'Neil)
This ship appears in the _Next Generation_ episode "Yesterday's Enterprise" (1990).[20] It was destroyed attempting to defend the Klingon outpost Narendra III from Romulan attack.[21] Survivors included Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), whose alternate timeline version from "Yesterday's _Enterprise_" travels with the ship back in time to the battle over Narendra III.[22] The actions of the _Enterprise_-C's crew became a catalyst for the alliance between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.[23]

REGISTRY:
CLASS: _Galaxy_
SERVICE: 2363–2371 (8 Years)
CAPTAINS: Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Edward Jellico (Ronny Cox)
The main setting of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1987–1994).[24] During _Star Trek Generations_, _Enterprise_ was lost in 2371 after an attack by the Duras sisters' renegade Klingon Bird-of-Prey which caused extensive damage, leading to a warp core breach. Although the saucer section was safely separated before the breach, the shock wave from the exploding engineering hull threw it out of control, and caused it to crash-land beyond recovery on Veridian III.[25] The ship also appears in the first _Deep Space Nine_ episode "Emissary" and the final _Enterprise_ episode "These Are the Voyages..."

REGISTRY:
CLASS: _Sovereign_
SERVICE: 2372 –
CAPTAIN: Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart)
The main setting for the films _Star Trek: First Contact_ (1996), _Star Trek: Insurrection_ (1998), and _Star Trek Nemesis_ (2002). As a Sovereign class vessel, it was the most advanced vessel in Starfleet, and an active participant in the Battle of Sector 001 and the Dominion War.

Future and/or Alternate timelines

Alternate future

REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-D)
CLASS: _Galaxy_ refit
SERVICE: circa 2395
CAPTAIN: Full Admiral William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes)
In "All Good Things...", the final episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, _Enterprise_-D was shown in an alternate future where it had not crashed during the events of _Star Trek Generations_, and instead had been made Admiral William T. Riker's personal flagship. The ship has a third nacelle (making it capable of at least Warp 13), cloaking ability, a spinal phaser lance, and large phaser cannons on the saucer section. In 2018, CBR notes Admiral Riker's future Enterprise 1701-D version as one of the powerful starships of the _Star Trek_ science fiction universe.[26]

REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-J)
''' Class: ''' Universe
SERVICE: 26th century
CAPTAIN(S): Dax
The "Azati Prime" episode of _Star Trek: Enterprise_ involves time travel and features a scene in which _Enterprise_-J appears. _Enterprise_-J operates in a possible timeline during the 26th century. In this timeline, _Enterprise_-J participated in the Battle of Procyon V, a climactic battle in which the Federation successfully drove the invasive trans-dimensional beings known as the Sphere Builders back into their own realm. The ship's crew included a descendant of the Xindi scientist Degra.[27]

Games

REGISTRY: USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-F)
''' Class: ''' _Odyssey_
SERVICE: 2409 – ongoing
CAPTAIN: Va'Kel Shon
One version of USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701-F) appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game _Star Trek Online_. Its design is based on the entry submitted by Adam Ihle for the 2011 "Design the next _Enterprise_" contest, a joint venture between Cryptic Studios, CBS, and Intel, which ran shortly before the game went "free to play." _Enterprise_-F made its first appearance in the mission "Boldly They Rode", at the point where USS _Enterprise_-F appears to help the player defeat the Dominion fleet surrounding Deep Space Nine.

Mirror universe

The Mirror Universe first appeared in the original series as an alternate reality where the militaristic Terran Empire exists in place of the regular universe's United Federation of Planets ("Mirror, Mirror"). A montage in the opening credits of the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" shows the Terran Empire logo in use by at least World War II, with licensed novels putting the divergence before Shakespeare, or even classic Greek literature.

REGISTRY: ISS _Enterprise_ (NX-01)
CLASS: NX
SERVICE: 2150s
CAPTAINS: Maximilian Forrest (Vaughn Armstrong), Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula)
The _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" features a Mirror Universe version of NX-01 _Enterprise_. This ship is equipped with a cloaking device, deflector shields, a tractor beam, a prototype agony booth, and different exterior markings. It is commanded by Captain Maximilian Forrest, although for a brief time his first officer, Commander Jonathan Archer, takes command following a mutiny. This _Enterprise_ is destroyed by the Tholians.

REGISTRY: ISS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701)
CLASS: _Constitution_
SERVICE: 2260s
CAPTAINS: Christopher Pike, James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy)
A Mirror Universe _Enterprise_ appears in the original _Star Trek_ episode "Mirror, Mirror".[28] The ship is equipped with an agony booth and the mirror in the captain's quarters conceals Captain Kirk's deadly Tantalus device.[29] ISS _Enterprise_ was originally the same shooting model as the regular _Enterprise_.[30] The remastered version of "Mirror, Mirror" includes a CGI version of _Enterprise_ with "ISS" markings on the hull and minor physical differences from USS _Enterprise_, such as a larger deflector dish, a taller bridge, and altered nacelle details. The ship was also shown orbiting the planet in the opposite direction (clockwise instead of counter-clockwise).[31]

Reboot (_Kelvin_ Timeline) films

The 2009 _Star Trek_ film takes place in a new reality created when the Romulan character Nero traveled through time via an artificial black hole. REGISTRY:
SERVICE: 2258–2263 (5 Years)
CAPTAINS: Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)

The main setting for the films _Star Trek_ (2009), _Star Trek Into Darkness_ (2013), and _Star Trek Beyond_ (2016). _Enterprise_ is shown during its construction phase at the Riverside Shipyard in Iowa during the first film. A brief shot of the NCC-1701 is seen as the shuttlecraft carrying Kirk and the new recruits into space departs the shipyard later on in the movie. At the end of _Star Trek Into Darkness_, _Enterprise_ started its five-year mission. The ship was later destroyed by Krall and his alien swarm attack during the events of _Star Trek Beyond_.

Measurements of this ship's length have ranged from 295 meters[32] to 910 meters.[33][34][35][36] In an article about the 2009 film's visual effects, _Cinefex_ wrote, "The reconfigured ship was a larger vessel than previous manifestations – approximately long compared to the ship of the original series",[37] and quoted Industrial Light & Magic art director Alex Jaeger discussing the design's growth in size during early production of the film: "Once we got the ship built and started putting it in environments it felt too small. The shuttle bay gave us a clear relative scale – shuttlecraft initially appeared much bigger than we had imagined – so we bumped up the Enterprise scale, which gave her a grander feel and allowed us to include more detail."[38]

A special feature on starships in the Blu-ray (BD) version of the movie gives the length as , which would be larger than the _Next Generation_ D and E versions, making it the largest USS _Enterprise_ in the franchise history (not counting the pre-Federation era _Enterprise_ (XCV 330), seen only as a model). This would result in a height of 167m, and a beam of 339m.

REGISTRY:
CLASS: _Constitution__
SERVICE: 2263–ongoing
CAPTAINS: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)
_Enterprise''-A first appears at the end of _Star Trek Beyond_ after the destruction of the original _Enterprise_ when the crew resume their five-year mission.

Sean Hargreaves stated that he was given the brief to "beef up the neck and arms" on the Ryan Church design, but went further to give the ship echoes of Matt Jefferies' original design.


Development

According to _The Star Trek Encyclopedia_, the registry number NCC-1701 was devised by Matt Jefferies, art director of the first _Star Trek_ series, inspired by an old science fiction cover that Gene Roddenberry liked, with a starship flying through space. Jefferies, who was a pilot, based NCC on 20th-century aircraft registration codes. In such 20th-century usage, an "N" first letter refers to an aircraft registered in the United States. A "C" for a second letter refers to a civil aircraft. Jefferies added a second "C" because he thought it looked better.[39]

The Franz Joseph _Blueprints_, the book _The Making of Star Trek_, and a handful of _Star Trek_ novels state that NCC is an initialism for "Naval Construction Contract".

In an interview with the BBC, Jefferies explained that NC is the designation for U.S. commercial aircraft and the Soviet Union's space program used the CCCP designation. He concluded that any major future space projects would likely be a combined international effort, thus he invented the combined designation NCC. The 1701 had two functions, it represented the first (01) ship of a 17th federation cruiser design, and that the digits were unlikely to be misread, unlike 6, 8, or 9.[40]

In Gene Roddenberry's original _Star Trek_ pitch, the starship is described as a "United Space Ship", and in two episodes of _The Original Series_ (TOS), Kirk refers to the "United Space Ship _Enterprise_".

Redesign for _Star Trek: Planet of the Titans_

's redesigned _Enterprise_ from _Star Trek: Planet of the Titans_]] In 1976, before _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, Paramount had planned a _Star Trek_ film to have been named _Star Trek: Planet of the Titans_. Early in the production, Ralph McQuarrie had been hired to redesign the _Enterprise_. The major feature of the redesign was to replace the cigar-shaped secondary hull with a larger, triangle-shaped "delta wing" section. McQuarrie's design was discarded in favor of keeping the general shape of the _Enterprise_ intact for the redesign unveiled in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_.

Three decades later, the McQuarrie design for the _Enterprise_ was adopted as the basis for the design of the USS _Discovery_ in _Star Trek: Discovery_, a 2017 series that takes place ten years earlier than the original _Star Trek_.[41]


Captain's yacht

The captain's yacht is a large auxiliary starship built into the design of several Federation starship designs including the _Galaxy_-class and _Sovereign_-class. It was docked to the underside of the saucer section. On USS _Enterprise_-E, the name of the captain's yacht is the _Cousteau_. In 2375, the crew of USS _Enterprise_-E used the _Cousteau_ to travel to the surface of the Ba'ku homeworld.

Designer Andrew Probert came up with the concept of the captain's yacht while designing the USS _Enterprise_-D. Although it was never seen in use, it is labeled on the master systems display screen in main engineering, docked at the bottom of the saucer section almost directly opposite the main bridge. Probert suggested possible ways for the yacht to be used during the first season, including not showing the yacht but mentioning it in dialogue, but his ideas were rejected. The producers almost used the yacht in the episode "Samaritan Snare", but decided to use an "executive shuttlecraft" due to budgetary constraints.[42] According to Patrick Stewart, the yacht would have been called the _Calypso_.[43] Producer Ronald D. Moore noted in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual_ that real-life naval tradition would insist on calling such a craft the captain's gig, rather than the captain's yacht.[44]

Rick Sternbach later designed similar craft for USS _Voyager_ and USS _Equinox_, known as the aeroshuttle and the waverider, respectively. As on the _Enterprise_-D, however, these vessels were only depicted on technical schematics and never seen in operation or referred to in dialog.


Reception and influence

_Time_ described each iteration of the _Enterprise_ as "a character in its own right".[45] Over many decades, the starship has influenced real-life activities of NASA and the U.S. Navy:

-   In 1976, as the result of a successful letter writing campaign by fans, NASA named the initial flight-test Space Shuttle _Enterprise_.[46][47]
-   For three days in October 1994, the real aircraft carrier hosted half-hour tours for thousands of fans attending a _Star Trek_ convention in Norfolk, Virginia, and _Star Trek_ memorabilia could be found throughout the ship.[48][49]
-   In 2014, NASA named its IXS _Enterprise_ advanced propulsion concept vehicle after the _Star Trek_ vessel.[50]

Celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has spoken highly of the influence and legacy of the original _Enterprise_ on other fictional spaceships. Drawing a parallel to comparing athletes between eras, he said of spaceship design, "What matters is not what they look like now, but what they looked to others at the time that they prevailed... There is only one spaceship that's earlier than [the original _Enterprise_], and that's the flying saucer from _The Day the Earth Stood Still_. So, what matters here is, what did [the _Enterprise_] look like at the time it came out (1966) compared with anything that had been imagined before? And when you consider that, that is the most astonishing machine that has ever graced the screen."[51] On the ship's influence upon scientists, Tyson wrote, "The _Enterprise_ was the first ever spaceship represented in storytelling that was not designed to go from one place to another; [it was] only designed to explore. It was revolutionary in terms of what we would think space would, and should, be about."[52]

NetDragon Websoft, a gaming and mobile Internet company in Fuzhou, China, based the architectural design of its headquarters building on the _Next Generation_-era _Enterprise_ (primarily the _Enterprise_-E), under an official license from CBS.[53]
