The THIMBLE JELLYFISH (_Linuche unguiculata_) is a species of cnidarian found in the warm West Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean.[1][2] It is a tiny jellyfish with a straight-sided, flat-topped bell. This jellyfish is the most common cause of seabather's eruption, a reaction caused by the injection of juvenile jellyfish nematocysts into human skin.[3]


Description

The medusa of the thimble jellyfish has straight sides with sixteen grooves, and a flat top. The coronal groove between the top and sides provides flexibility. The margin of the bell has sixteen lappets (folds), the niches between these bearing alternately rhopalia (sense organs) and short tentacles (eight of each). There is no marginal ring canal. Symbiotic zooxanthellae give the bell an overall orangish-brown colour and the translucent mesoglea has dark flecks. This jellyfish can reach a diameter of and a height of .[4][5]


Distribution and habitat

The thimble jellyfish is found in the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean, particularly around the West Indies and the Bahamas. Although it can occur in warm surface waters, it has been found at depths down to about . Its presence in any particular location is related to such factors as the presence of prey, temperature, salinity and oxygen saturation of the water.[6]


Ecology

The thimble jellyfish swims constantly by pulsating its bell, rotating as it moves. It forms swarms in warm seas near the surface of the water.[7] Aggregations have been reported covering a million square metres . The jellyfish feeds on plankton, drawing a water current past its outstretched tentacles by pulsating the bell. When edible zooplankton are encountered, they are immobilised by the cnidocytes (stinging cells) and passed by the tentacles to the mouth on the underside of the bell. Thimble jellyfish are consumed by fish, sea turtles and other predators.[8]


Seabather's eruption

Larvae of the thimble jellyfish are the most common cause of seabather's eruption in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.[9] This is an itchy rash of small red papules that develops in the areas that were covered by the bather's swimwear or hair. The condition does not occur immediately, but after the bather has showered or the skin has dried, killing the jellyfish larvae which react by discharging their stinging cells. In Florida, most cases occur between March and August. A similar condition occurs on the east coast of North America after exposure to the larvae of the sea anemone _Edwardsiella lineata_.[10][11]
