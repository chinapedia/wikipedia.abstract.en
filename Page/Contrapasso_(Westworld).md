Plot

Within Westworld operations, Dr. Ford interrogates Dolores regarding Arnold's death, as she was the last host to interact with him. Dolores tells Dr. Ford that Arnold's last words to her was to destroy the park, but which she never did. With no new information, Dr. Ford leaves, after which Dolores speaks to an unseen party that Dr. Ford is unaware of their plans and she has not revealed anything. Elsewhere, Elsie investigates the stray host's body before it is cremated and finds a satellite transmitter hidden within it. She informs Bernard, suggesting someone is trying to smuggle data out of Westworld via the hosts.

In Westworld, the Man in Black continues his search for Wyatt with hosts Lawrence and Teddy. Teddy's wounds are grave, and the Man kills Lawrence to transfuse his blood into Teddy. The two continue on to a tavern and encounter Dr. Ford, who asks the Man why he seeks the maze. The Man states he is looking for "something true" and that Arnold had "one more story to tell". Dr. Ford does not intervene, seeing this as a journey of self-discovery.

Dolores, William, and Logan travel with Slim to the town of Pariah. En route, Logan tells William how their company was able to purchase the park after Arnold's death. At Pariah, they meet El Lazo, Slim's boss and the leader of a gang with close ties to the Confederados, ex-Confederate soldiers turned outlaws. El Lazo is revealed to be the same host as Lawrence. Logan asks El Lazo to help them join the Confederados; El Lazo agrees only if they steal an army wagon containing nitroglycerin that the Confederados have asked him to procure. While William tries to steal the wagon through non-violent methods, Logan gets into a fight, which kills Slim and requires William to kill the guards. On their return, El Lazo welcomes them into the Confederados' ranks. William and Logan bicker over the robbery but in the end Logan reminds William he wouldn't be Executive Vice President at Delos Inc without Logan's help. Dolores while having troubling visions of a church and finding the center of the maze, stumbles around Pariah. She spots El Lazo and his gang replacing the stolen nitroglycerin with tequila. She warns William about El Lazo's double cross, but he is still apathetic after his argument with Logan. She breaks him out of it with a passionate kiss, telling him she cannot escape the park without him. William and Dolores flee, leaving Logan to be captured by the Confederados when the double cross is discovered. William and Dolores manage to board a train, where they find El Lazo travelling with several coffins that contain bodies embalmed with the nitroglycerin; Dolores spots the maze symbol branded on the top of the coffins. El Lazo surrenders to them, and tells them to call him "Lawrence".

Following the shootout at the saloon, the damaged Maeve host is brought for repairs to technician Felix. As Felix works to restore a bird host to life, Maeve suddenly confronts him and tells him they need to talk.

Filming

The episode was directed by Jonny Campbell.[3] Production designer Zack Grobler drew inspiration from various cultures like Latin America and Africa to create the town of Pariah.[4]

Music

Ramin_Djawadi.jpg created the episode's musical score.]] In an interview, composer Ramin Djawadi spoke about the song "Something I Can Never Have" by Nine Inch Nails, that was translated in the episode. He said, "You can kind of picture a string quartet being in the room somewhere, performing this song, in this setting, right?"[5]

The episode also features the classical piece "Clair de Lune", by French composer Claude Debussy, which Ford is playing on the player piano as Teddy and The Man in Black enter the bar.[6] As Ford leaves the bar, he snaps his fingers at the player piano and it plays a vastly sped up and slightly damaged version of Scott Joplin's "Pine Apple Rag".[7] Djawadi is quoted as saying, "That's about control, It just shows the power he has. He calls the shots for what happens."[8]{{#tag:ref|Although the referenced article says it's "The Entertainer" that's playing, that is in fact incorrect, although Djawadi himself never says it's "The Entertainer" so it could be the error of a sub editor.[9]|group="nb"}}

Critical reception

"Contrapasso" received positive reviews from critics. The episode currently has a 91% score on Rotten Tomatoes and has an average rating of 8.4 out of 10, based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus reads "_Westworld_ subtly reveals more of its multitudinous plot layers and adds some substantial twists in the vexing fifth installment, 'Contrapasso.'"[13]

Eric Goldman of IGN reviewed the episode positively, saying, "At the season's halfway point, _Westworld_ isn't holding back. Dolores and Maeve's fascinating dual awakenings both are moving quickly, with Dolores inside the park completely subverting her intended role, while Maeve is looking to get answers inside the lab. The questions being raised at this point, both about the park's history and in what manner much of what we're seeing is unfolding, are also increasing in a compelling manner — though of course that does also increase the pressure for the series to provide satisfying answers in the long run. In the meantime, this is one hell of a ride."[14] He gave it a score of 9 out of 10.[15] Scott Tobias of _The New York Times_ wrote in his review of the episode; "One of the more popular Westworld fan theories posits that the Man in Black and William are the same characters on separate timelines, but without indulging that theory too much, this episode does suggest some meaningful parallels."[16] Zack Handlen of _The A.V. Club_ wrote in his review, "There's momentum by the end, but it's unfocused. And really, that's why 'Contrapasso' concerns me. The show is clearly going somewhere, but I'm starting to wonder if the destination is going to be worth it."[17] He gave the episode a B.[18]

Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire wrote in her review, "'Contrapasso' highlights one of _Westworld_{{'}}s biggest themes — the importance of purpose in our modern lives. Ford's memory of a pet greyhound dog, who finally caught up with the prey he'd been chasing his whole life, spoke to the park's earliest explanations, only highlighted by the Man in Black’s revelations about the world beyond the park's borders, where human society is theoretically experiencing a golden age of plenty, but without real drive."[19] She gave the episode an A-.[20] James Hibberd of _Entertainment Weekly_ wrote in his review, "The writers of _Westworld_ are no longer holding our hands with this stuff and just assume we're keeping up.".[21] He gave the episode a B+.[22] Catherine Gee of _The Daily Telegraph_ wrote in her review, "The plot became ever thicker, and twistier, in the fifth instalment of HBO's newest big hitting drama."[23] David Crow of Den of Geek said in his review, "Tonight's trip into Ford and Arnold's gunslinging paradise was the most astonishing episode of _Westworld_ to date."[24] He gave the episode a perfect score.[25] Erik Kain of _Forbes_ also reviewed the episode, saying, "All told, another great episode with so much to chew over it's an honest-to-god challenge writing about. There are few shows with so many moving pieces and so much obscuring fog to peer through."[26]
