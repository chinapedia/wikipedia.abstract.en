Central_flowerbed_in_Mulberry_Garden.jpg The MULBERRY GARDEN, originally _Morušová zahrada_ in Czech language, is a cottage garden in the Czech Republic, situated in the Czech Central Uplands in the village Režný Újezd, northwest of the town Lovosice. The garden was established in 2014 by local gardeners admiring the English cottage garden style.[1] Apart from different kinds of plants such as perennial plants, annual plants, and bulbs, several uncommon fruit trees are grown, especially various mulberry varieties. Mulberry garden is located along the green tourist track to Boreč hill in the grounds of former Gentlemen's farm, house no. 2.

There is a little souvenir and refreshments shop in the garden, selling tourist stamps, wander cards, postcards and other souvenirs related to the nearby hill Borec which is a unigue geological and botanical location famous for its hydrothermal vents, micro-exhalations and specific fauna and flora.[2]
