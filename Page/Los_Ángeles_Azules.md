LOS ÁNGELES AZULES are a Mexican musical group playing the _cumbia sonidera_ genre, which is a cumbia subgenre using the accordion and synthesizers. This results in a fusion of the sounds of cumbia from the 1950-1970s with those of 1990s-style electronic music.[1]


History

The group got together in 1976 but started officially in 1983, playing the _onda grupera_ genre, formed by the siblings of the Mejía Avante family: Elías, Alfredo, José Hilario, Jorge, Cristina and Guadalupe.[2]

The group went through various periods of popularity and various styles. In 2013 they had a huge hit with _Cómo Te Voy a Olvidar_, re-recorded many hits with guest vocalists including Carla Morrison, Lila Downs, and Ximena Sariñana. In 2014 they launched a new musical genre _cumbia sinfónica_ as they performed their greatest contemporary hits with the Mexico City Symphony Orchestra. Their subsequent album _Cómo Te Voy a Olvidar Edición de Súper Lujo_ reached #5 on the Mexican regional music charts.[3]

In 2018, they played on the Coachella Stage at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, making it the first time a traditional cumbia group has played at the popular festival. [4]
