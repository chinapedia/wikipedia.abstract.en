The COBB MARATHON BOWL was a greyhound racing competition held at Catford Stadium.[1]

It was a leading competition run over the longer marathon race distance and was inaugurated in 1942 over 810 yards.[2]

The event was introduced by a Catford greyhound owner called Mr Francis Rupert Victor Cobb (a brewer by trade).[3] He died in 1966 which led to the race also being known as a memorial race.[4]

The race was discontinued in 1975 because other marathon events such as the TV Trophy surpassed it in regard to importance.[5]
