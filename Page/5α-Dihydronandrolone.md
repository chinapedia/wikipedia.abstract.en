5Α-DIHYDRONANDROLONE (also known as 5Α-DHN, DIHYDRONANDROLONE, DHN, 5Α-DIHYDRO-19-NORTESTOSTERONE, or 5Α-ESTRAN-17Β-OL-3-ONE) is a naturally occurring anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 5α-reduced derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).[1] It is a major metabolite of nandrolone and is formed from it by the actions of the enzyme 5α-reductase analogously to the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from testosterone.[2][3]

When testosterone is 5α-reduced into DHT, which is a much more potent AAS in comparison, its effects are potentiated on a local level.[4][5] The tissues in which this occurs (i.e., the tissues that express 5α-reductase) are referred to as "androgenic" tissues and include the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, among others.[6] The conversion of testosterone into DHT is an important factor in the etiology of a variety of androgen-dependent conditions, including acne, excessive facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer.[7] Unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, 5α-DHN is a much weaker agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) than is nandrolone.[8][9][10][11] For this reason, instead of local potentiation in androgenic tissues, there is a local inactivation when nandrolone is converted into 5α-DHN by 5α-reductase in these tissues.[12][13][14] This is thought to be largely or completely responsible for the exceptionally high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects seen with nandrolone.[15][16]

The combination of nandrolone with a 5α-reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride will block the conversion of nandrolone into 5α-DHN and, unlike with testosterone and various other AAS, thereby considerably increase the propensity of nandrolone for producing androgenic side effects.[17]
