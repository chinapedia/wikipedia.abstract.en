With the artist and educator, Paul Woodrow, Robertson initiated the international performance art collective, W.O.R.K.S. (We.Ourselves.Roughly.

Robertson started the audio art magazine, _Voicespondence_ in 1974 as a W.O.R.K.S. project.

With Don Mabie and Marcella Bienvenue, Robertson directed the Parachute Center for Cultural Affairs (later Arton's Publishing)[5] a Calgary artist-run centre famous for its interdisciplinary focus including the production of the magazine, _Centerfold_ (1976–80); Robert Filliou's videotape, _Porta Filliou_ (1977) and a national video art festival, _The Canadian Open_ (1978,1979).

In 1978, Robertson and Bienvenue moved Arton's Publishing to Toronto where with media artists Lisa Steele and Tom Sherman, Robertson became a founding publisher and editor of _FUSE_, the art/media/politics magazine (1980-2014)[6]

In 1978 _Voicespondence_ began publishing as an indy label where Robertson produced or co-produced first vinyl releases by The Government (1978), Clive Robertson (1981,1985), Gayap Rhythm Drummers (1982), the Dub Poets - Lillian Allen, Clifton Joseph, Devon Haughton (1983), Fifth Column (1983), and the Plasterscene Replicas (1984).
