JUAN MARTÍN IMBERT (born 31 March 1990) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Quilmes.[1][2]


Career

Imbert's youth career began with La Florida, prior to joining Boca Juniors's youth ranks.[3] He played in five of the club's six matches in the 2011 U-20 Copa Libertadores as they finished as runners-up.[4] Imbert featured on Boca's first-team bench three times during the 2010–11 season. He subsequently made his Boca Juniors senior debut in August 2012 in an Argentine Primera División match with Lanús.[5] He had to wait six months until his next senior appearance for Boca, before departing the team to join Primera B Nacional side Aldosivi on loan.[6] Three goals in thirty-eight matches followed before he returned to his parent club.[7]

In the next season, 2014, he completed a loan move to second tier side Atlético Tucumán. He went onto make forty-two league appearances and scored once across the 2014 and 2015 campaigns.[8] He left Boca Juniors in 2016 to join Guaraní Antonio Franco of Torneo Federal A.[9] He participated in eight fixtures, but didn't score, during the 2016 season. Ahead of 2016–17, Imbert completed a move to Argentine Primera División club Arsenal de Sarandí.[10][11] His Arsenal debut came on 18 September against Temperley.[12] Imbert joined newly promoted Primera División team Chacarita Juniors on 11 August 2017.[13]

He made his Chacarita debut on 10 September in a league match with Tigre.[14] Quilmes signed Imbert in July 2018.[15]
