(Kyūjitai: 合氣道) is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.[1][2] Aikido is often translated as the art of peace. [3] or as the power of love. [4]

at the 55th All Japan Aikido Demonstration held at the Nippon Budokan (May 2017)]]

Aikido's techniques include: irimi (entering), and tenkan (turning) movements (that redirect the opponent's attack momentum), various types of throws and joint locks.[5]

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term _aiki-jūjutsu_.[6]

Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.


Etymology and basic philosophy

" in its old character form ]]

The word "aikido" is formed of three kanji:

-    – _ai_ – joining, unifying, combining, fitting

-    – _ki_ – spirit, energy, mood, morale

-    – _dō_ – way, path

The term _aiki_ does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of budō. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word. is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being (combined/united), (composition), (unite/combine/join together), (union/alliance/association), (combine/unify), and (mutual agreement). There is an idea of reciprocity, (to get to know one another), (talk/discussion/negotiation), and (meet by appointment).

is often used to describe a feeling, as in ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in (electricity) and (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in (spirit/trait/temperament).

The term is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in various non-martial arts, such as Japanese calligraphy (), flower arranging () and tea ceremony ().

Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces" or "Way of unifying energy", in which the term _aiki_ refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.[7] One applies by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.


History

Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ( , 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as (_Great Teacher_).[8] The term _aikido_ was coined in the twentieth century.[9] Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the _aiki_ that Ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.[10]

Initial development

Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.[11] The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu, which Ueshiba studied directly with Takeda Sōkaku, the reviver of that art. Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū with Tozawa Tokusaburō in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under Nakai Masakatsu in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with Kiyoichi Takagi ( , 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.[12]

The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear (), short staff (), and perhaps the . However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ().[13][14]

Ueshiba moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915. His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.[15] However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Daitō-ryū. At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as "AIKI BUDŌ". It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society () was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.[16]

Religious influences

After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe.[17] One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.[18]

In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.[19]

International dissemination

Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by Minoru Mochizuki with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.[20] He was followed by Tadashi Abe in 1952, who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years. Kenji Tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.[21][22] Later that year, Koichi Tohei was sent by Aikikai Hombu to Hawaii for a full year, where he set up several dojo. This trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by Hiroshi Tada; and Germany in 1965 by Katsuaki Asai. Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by Morihei Ueshiba, Masamichi Noro arrived in France in September 1961. Seiichi Sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.

Proliferation of independent organizations

The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.[23]

The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by Minoru Mochizuki in 1931,[24] Yoshinkan Aikido, founded by Gozo Shioda in 1955,[25] and Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967.[26] The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that many felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.[27]

After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of _ki_ development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization that governs it, the Ki Society (_Ki no Kenkyūkai_).[28]

A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki and the teaching methodology of long term student Morihiro Saito. It is unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called Iwama Ryu. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups. One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in 2004 around Saito's son Hitohiro Saito.

Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own in Japan, and have an international breadth.[29]


Ki

for _ki_ until 1946, when it was changed to .]]

The study of _ki_ is an important component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both. The _kanji_ for _ki_ normally is written as . It was written as until the writing reforms after World War II, and this older form still is seen on occasion.

The character for _ki_ is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as , or . _Ki_ has many meanings, including "ambience", "mind", "mood", and "intention", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to "life energy". Gōzō Shioda's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered one of the "hard styles", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to _ki_ lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.[30] In later years, Ueshiba's application of _ki_ in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his Takemusu Aiki and many of his later students teach about _ki_ from this perspective. Koichi Tohei's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical (albeit subjective) experience of _ki_ with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and _ki_ development.[31]


Training

In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.[32] Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.[33] The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple ukes, and techniques with weapons.

Fitness

() is very important for safe practice]] Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.[34]

In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates. For example, many dojos begin each class with , which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).[35]

Roles of _uke_ and _tori_

Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (_kata_) rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (_uke_) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the _tori_, or _shite_ (depending on aikido style), also referred to as _nage_ (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.[36]

Both halves of the technique, that of _uke_ and that of _tori_, are considered essential to aikido training.[37] Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. _Tori_ learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while _uke_ learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which _tori_ places them. This "receiving" of the technique is called _ukemi_.[38] _Uke_ continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while _tori_ uses position and timing to keep _uke_ off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, _uke_ will sometimes apply to regain balance and pin or throw _tori_.

refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good _ukemi_ involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment—it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido. The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, a technique with abundant peace.

Initial attacks

Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.[39]

Many of the of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat.[40] Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (_tsuki_), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword. Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:

-   a vertical knifehand strike to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the maxillary sinus.

-   a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.

-   a punch to the torso. Specific targets include the chest, abdomen, and solar plexus. Same as , and .

-   a punch to the face. Same as .

Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.[41] The following are examples of some basic grabs:

-   one hand grabs one wrist.

-   both hands grab one wrist. Same as

-   both hands grab both wrists. Same as .

-   a shoulder grab. "Both-shoulders-grab" is . It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as .

-   grabbing the (clothing of the) chest. Same as .

Basic techniques

The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.[42]

-   a control using one hand on the elbow and one hand near the wrist which leverages _uke_ to the ground.[43] This grip applies pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist.

-   a pronating wristlock that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure. (There is an adductive wristlock or Z-lock in _ura_ version.)

-   a rotational wristlock that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.

-   a shoulder control similar to _ikkyō_, but with both hands gripping the forearm. The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone.[44]

-   visually similar to _ikkyō_, but with an inverted grip of the wrist, medial rotation of the arm and shoulder, and downward pressure on the elbow. Common in knife and other weapon take-aways.

-   the hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.

-   a supinating wristlock-throw that stretches the extensor digitorum.

-   a loosely used term for various types of mechanically unrelated techniques, although they generally do not use joint locks like other techniques.[45]

-   throws in which _tori_ moves through the space occupied by _uke_. The classic form superficially resembles a "clothesline" technique.

-   beginning with _ryōte-dori_; moving forward, _tori_ sweeps one hand low ("earth") and the other high ("heaven"), which unbalances _uke_ so that he or she easily topples over.

-   aikido's version of the hip throw. _Tori_ drops their hips lower than those of _uke_, then flips _uke_ over the resultant fulcrum.

-   or a throw that locks the arms against each other (the kanji for "10" is a cross-shape: 十).[46]

-   _Tori_ sweeps the arm back until it locks the shoulder joint, then uses forward pressure to throw.[47]

Implementations

Aikido makes use of body movement (_tai sabaki_) to blend with _uke_. For example, an "entering" (_irimi_) technique consists of movements inward towards _uke_, while a technique uses a pivoting motion.[48] Additionally, an technique takes place in front of _uke_, whereas an technique takes place to their side; a technique is applied with motion to the front of _uke_, and a version is applied with motion towards the rear of _uke_, usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (_seiza_). Techniques where both _uke_ and _tori_ are standing are called _tachi-waza_, techniques where both start off in _seiza_ are called _suwari-waza_, and techniques performed with _uke_ standing and _tori_ sitting are called _hanmi handachi_ ().[49]

Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, _ikkyō_ can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an _ura_ type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an _omote-waza_ version). Specific aikido _kata_ are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)". For instance, _katate-dori ikkyō_ refers to any _ikkyō_ technique executed when _uke_ is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as _katate-dori ikkyō omote_, referring to any forward-moving _ikkyō_ technique from that grab.

_Atemi_ () are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique. Some view _atemi_ as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, Gōzō Shioda described using _atemi_ in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.[50] Others consider _atemi_, especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration. The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.[51] Many sayings about _atemi_ are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba.[52]

Weapons

Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (_jō_) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or Jūkendō, the wooden sword (_bokken_), and the knife (_tantō_).[53] Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught. Some schools, such as the Iwama style of Morihiro Saito, usually spend substantial time practicing with both _bokken_ and _jō_, under the names of _aiki-ken_, and _aiki-jō_, respectively.

The founder developed many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional sword, spear and bayonet movements. Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).[54]

Multiple attackers and _randori_

One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called _taninzudori_, or _taninzugake_. Freestyle practice with multiple attackers called _randori_ () is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.[55] _Randori_ exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.[56] Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in _randori_ training. For instance, an _ura_ technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.[57]

In Shodokan Aikido, _randori_ differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo _randori_.[58][59]

Mental training

Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.[60] This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.[61] Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation.[62] As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.[63]


Uniforms and ranking

are folded after practice to preserve the pleats.]] Aikido practitioners (commonly called _aikidōka_ outside Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" (_kyū_), followed by a series of "degrees" (_dan_), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and black belts to distinguish _kyu_ and _dan_ grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.[64] Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a _dan_ rank unless they are 16 or older.

  rank    belt   color   type
  ------- ------ ------- -------------------------
  _kyū_          white   _mudansha_ / _yūkyūsha_
  _dan_          black   _yūdansha_

The uniform worn for practicing aikido (_aikidōgi_) is similar to the training uniform (_keikogi_) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used.[65] Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.

Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a _hakama_ (used also in Naginatajutsu, kendo, and iaido). In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (_dan_) ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a _hakama_ regardless of rank.[66]


Criticisms

The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by _uke_ (and which _tori_ must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak", "sloppy", and "little more than caricatures of an attack".[67][68] Weak attacks from _uke_ allow for a conditioned response from _tori_, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.[69] To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.[70] Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, because Aikido is the art of peace.[71]

Another criticism pertains to the shift in training focus after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by _tori_, entering (_irimi_) and initiation of techniques by _tori_, the distinction between _omote_ (front side) and _ura_ (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.[72]

Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of Aikido Journal, "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts."[73] That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional _jujutsu_ or _kenjutsu_ are diverging from what Ueshiba taught because Aikido is an spiritual martial art. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated."[74]
