SIONG LENG MUSICAL ASSOCIATION or SIONG LENG is a Nanyin musical group from Singapore.[1] Siong Leng is known for its contribution to preserve and promote Nanyin (or Nan Guan) and Liyuan Opera, the arts of Southern Min people.[2]


History

The foundation of the group went back to 1901 when Heng Yun Association was formed to meet the cultural need of the local Hokkien community, and the earliest Nanyin performances were then organised by the association in Singapore (still part of Malaya at that time).[3] Heng Yun association was founded by immigrants from Southern Fujian, China. While worked overseas to save money, some of them initiated to create entertainment to overcome their homesickness. Heng Yun association then became popular across Malaya. When Second Sino-Japanese War broke in 1937, Heng Yun participated in Fund Relief for China program initiated by Tan Kah Kee, but because Malaya is a neutral British colony, support to China was halted. Finally the group was disbanded. Some ex-member created new group called Yun Lu.[4] The group's life was momentary. Some of the Yun Lu ex-member established new group in 1941 called Siong Leng Musical Association. However, when Japan occupied Singapore in 1942, all the activities were disrupted.[5] Then, after war the group resumed. Musical performances were organized to celebrate festivities or charity events. A musician most renown for his contribution to Siong Leng during this time was Quanzhou born Teng Mah Seng (1915-1992). He composed many new Nanyin pieces and helped promoted Nanyin in Singapore.[6] In 1970â€™s he was appointed as chairman.

Through participation in various folk and traditional music festivals around the world, the group has won many awards and international recognition. In 1987, Teng Mah Seng was awarded Cultural Medallion from Singaporean government.[7] The leadership then was continued by Teng Hong Hai in 1994.

Today, beside making musical events such as annual performances in Thian Hock Keng temple and Kusu Island, Siong Leng also regularly takes part in various contemporary music festivals in Singapore and abroad.[8] The group also performed in their annual _Multi-sensory Banquet_ with different and unique theme each year.
