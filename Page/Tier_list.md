A TIER LIST is a list of anything that can be ranked. It originated from playable characters or other elements of a video game, subjectively ranked by their respective viability in high-level competitive settings. Characters listed high on a tier list of a specific game are considered to be powerful characters compared to lower-scoring characters, and are therefore more likely to be used during tournaments. Tier lists are popular in fighting games such as the _Street Fighter_ and _Super Smash Bros._ series, and MOBA titles such as _League of Legends_ and _Dota 2_, in addition to hero shooter titles such as _Overwatch_ and _Paladins_.


Methodology

When a competitive game gets an update, a question that arises is how the changes in the game will affect the tier list. Even when no balancing changes actually took place, the inclusion of new characters or new systems can affect tier lists. In fighting games, the strength of a character is always held relative to that of other characters, meaning that something that is strong in one fighting game does not necessarily have to be strong in another. The metagame may shift over time as dominant strategies get overturned using less popular characters.[1]

Tier rankings may be listed using letter gradings. The competitive community surrounding _Guilty Gear Xrd_, for instance, ranks characters as 'S', 'S-', 'A+', and 'A', where 'S tiers' are particularly powerful and 'A tiers' less so.[2] Major video game news websites such as _The Daily Dot_ and _Kotaku_ may publish their own tier lists for popular games.[3][4]

For a game like _Super Smash Bros. Melee_, which was released in 2001 and has not been updated since, but is still popular in tournament settings, characters originally overpowered remain that way, due to their inability to receive character balancing updates. Different versions of the game may have different tier lists as well. The website _Smashboards_ bases its yearly tier lists for the _Super Smash Bros._ series on polling results.[5]

In 2017, Capcom started to publish a similar listing based on actual character win-loss records, as recorded on their own servers, and this data is therefore more applicable to online gaming, or where the player skill level is lower.[6]


Impact

Maddy Myers of _Kotaku_ noted that characters that are considered low-tier have an advantage over higher-tiered characters, as players have less experience dealing with low-tier characters and often underestimate them. Myers stated that "the element of surprise can only get you so far, but it's still an undeniable asset. And one that the bottom third of every tier list enjoys." Already popular character may also rise in tier lists because high-level players establish and iterate on their combos and techniques. Myers also noted that tier lists are less useful in team-based games, because character roles and team composition introduce a complex set of variables.[7]
