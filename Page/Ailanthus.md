_AILANTHUS_ (;[1] derived from _ailanto,_ an Ambonese word probably meaning "tree of the gods" or "tree of heaven")[2] is a genus of trees belonging to the family Simaroubaceae, in the order Sapindales (formerly Rutales or Geraniales). The genus is native from east Asia south to northern Australasia.


Selected species

The number of living species is disputed, with some authorities accepting up to ten species, while others accept six or fewer. Species include:

-   _Ailanthus altissima_ (tree of heaven, syn. _A. vilmoriniana_ [3]) – northern and central mainland China, Taiwan. Invasive in North America, Europe, Britain, and Australia. Serves as central metaphor in _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_.[4][5]
-   _Ailanthus excelsa_ – India and Sri Lanka
-   _Ailanthus fordii_ – China
-   _Ailanthus integrifolia_ – New Guinea and Queensland, Australia
-   _Ailanthus triphysa_ (white siris syn. _A. malabarica_[6]) – India, South-east Asia and Australia
-   _Ailanthus vietnamensis_ – Vietnam

There is a good fossil record of _Ailanthus_ with many species names based on their geographic occurrence, but almost all of these have very similar morphology and have been grouped as a single species among the three species recognized:[7]

-   _Ailanthus tardensis_ – from a single locality in Hungary
-   _Ailanthus confucii_ – Tertiary period, Europe, Asia, and North America
-   _Ailanthus gigas_ – from a single locality in Slovenia
-   _Ailanthus pythii_ – known from the Miocene of Iceland, Styria in Austria and the Gavdos island in Greece


Ailanthus silk moth

A silk spinning moth, the ailanthus silkmoth (_Samia cynthia_), lives on _Ailanthus_ leaves, and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk, but inferior to it in fineness and gloss. This moth has been introduced to the eastern United States and is common near many towns; it is about 12 cm across, with angulated wings, and in color olive brown, with white markings.[8] Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on _Ailanthus_ include _Endoclita malabaricus_.
