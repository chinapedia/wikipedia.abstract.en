BRIGITTE ANNE-MARIE BARDOT (; born 28 September 1934), often referred to by the initials B.B.,[1] is a French animal rights activist, and former actress and singer. Famous for portraying sexually emancipated personae with hedonistic lifestyles, she was one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s. Although she withdrew from the entertainment industry in 1973, she remains a major popular culture icon.

Born and raised in Paris, Bardot was an aspiring ballerina in her early life. She started her acting career in 1952. She achieved international recognition in 1957 for her role in the controversial _And God Created Woman_, and also caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of Simone de Beauvoir's 1959 essay _The Lolita Syndrome_, which described her as a "locomotive of women's history" and built upon existentialist themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France. Bardot later starred in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film _Le Mépris_. For her role in Louis Malle's 1965 film _Viva Maria!_ she was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress.

Bardot retired from the entertainment industry in 1973. She had acted in 47 films, performed in several musicals and recorded more than 60 songs. She was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1985 but refused to accept it. After retiring, she became an animal rights activist. During the 2000s she generated controversy by criticizing immigration and Islam in France, and she has been fined five times for inciting racial hatred.


Life and career

Early life: 1934–1951

Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born on 28 September 1934 in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, to Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie Mucel (1912–1978). Bardot's father, originated from Ligny-en-Barrois, was an engineer and the proprietor of several industrial factories in Paris.[2] Her mother was the daughter of an insurance company director. She grew up in a conservative Catholic family, as had her father.[3] She suffered from amblyopia as a child, which resulted in decreased vision of her left eye. She has one younger sister, Mijanou.

Bardot's childhood was prosperous; she lived in her family's seven-bedroom apartment in the luxurious 16th arrondissement.[4] However, she recalled feeling resentful in her early years. Her father demanded she follow strict behavioural standards, including good table manners, and that she wear appropriate clothes. Her mother was extremely selective in choosing companions for her, and as a result Bardot had very few childhood friends. Bardot cited a personal traumatic incident when she and her sister broke her parents' favourite vase while they were playing in the house; her father whipped the sisters 20 times and henceforth treated them like "strangers", demanding them to address their parents by the pronoun "vous", which is used to address unfamiliar or respectable persons in the French language. The incident decisively led to Bardot resenting her parents, and to her future rebellious lifestyle.

During World War II, when Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany, Bardot spent more time at home due to increasingly strict civilian surveillance. She became engrossed in dancing to phonograph records, which her mother saw as a potential for a ballet career. Bardot was admitted at the age of seven to the private school Cours Hattemer. She went to school three days a week, which gave her ample time to take dance lessons at a local studio, under her mother's arrangements. In 1949, Bardot was accepted at the Conservatoire de Paris. For three years she attended ballet classes held by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. She also studied at the Instistut de la Tour, a private Catholic high school near her home.[5]

Hélène Gordon-Lazareff, the then-director of the magazines _Elle_ and _Le Jardin des Modes_, hired Bardot in 1949 as a "junior" fashion model. On 8 March 1950, Bardot (aged 15 at the time) appeared on the cover of _Elle_, which brought her an acting offer for the film _Les Lauriers sont coupés_ from director Marc Allégret. Her parents opposed her becoming an actress, but her grandfather was supportive, saying that "If this little girl is to become a whore, cinema will not be the cause." At the audition, Bardot met Roger Vadim, who later notified her that she did not get the role. They subsequently fell in love. Her parents fiercely opposed their relationship; her father announced to her one evening that she would continue her education in England and that he had bought her a train ticket, the journey to take place the following day. Bardot reacted by putting her head into an oven with open fire; her parents stopped her and ultimately accepted the relationship, on condition that she marry Vadim at the age of 18.

First marriage and career beginnings: 1952–1955

.]] Bardot appeared on the cover of _Elle_ again in 1952, which landed her a movie offer for the comedy _Crazy for Love_ (1952), starring Bourvil and directed by Jean Boyer. She was paid 200,000 francs for the small role portraying a cousin of the main character. On 21 December 1952, Bardot (then 18 years old) married Vadim, under the consent of her parents. The wedding was held at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Church of Passy in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.[6] Bardot had her second film role in _Manina, the Girl in the Bikini_ (1953), directed by Willy Rozier. She also had roles in the 1953 films _The Long Teeth_ and _His Father's Portrait_.

Bardot had a small role in a Hollywood-financed film being shot in Paris, _Act of Love_ (1953), starring Kirk Douglas. She received media attention when she attended the Cannes Film Festival in April 1953.[7]

Bardot had a leading role in an Italian melodrama, _Concert of Intrigue_ (1954) and in a French adventure film, _Caroline and the Rebels_ (1954). She had a good part as a flirtatious student in _School for Love_ (1955), opposite Jean Marais, for director Marc Allégret.

Bardot played her first sizeable English-language role in _Doctor at Sea_ (1955), as the love interest for Dirk Bogarde. The film was the third-most popular movie at the British box office that year.[8]

She had a small role in _The Grand Maneuver_ (1955) for director René Clair, supporting Gérard Philipe and Michelle Morgan. The part was bigger in _The Light Across the Street_ (1956) for director Georges Lacombe. She did another with Hollywood film, _Helen of Troy_, playing Helen's handmaiden.

For the 1956 Italian movie _Mio figlio Nerone_ Bardot was asked by the director to appear as a blonde. Rather than wear a wig to hide her naturally brunette hair she decided to dye her hair. She was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the hair colour.[9]

Rise to stardom: 1956–1962

.]] Bardot then appeared in four movies that made her a star. First up was a musical, _Naughty Girl_ (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl. Directed by Michel Boisrond, it was co-written by Roger Vadim and was a big hit, the 12th most popular film of the year in France.[10] It was followed by a comedy, _Plucking the Daisy_ (1956), written by Vadim with the director Marc Allegret, and another success at France. So too was the comedy _The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful_ (1956) with Louis Jourdan.

Finally there was the melodrama _And God Created Woman_ (1956), Vadim's debut as director, with Bardot starring opposite Jean-Louis Trintignant and Curt Jurgens. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success, not just in France but also around the world – it was among the ten most popular films in Britain in 1957.[11] It turned Bardot into an international star.[12] From at least 1956[13] she was being hailed as the "sex kitten".[14][15][16]

During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to the image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer Cornel Lucas made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona.

Bardot followed _And God Created Woman_ with _La Parisienne_ (1957), a comedy co-starring Charles Boyer for director Boisrond. She was reunited with Vadim in another melodrama _The Night Heaven Fell_ (1958) and played a criminal who seduced Jean Gabin in _In Case of Adversity_ (1958). The latter was the 13th most seen movie of the year in France.[17]

_The Female_ (1959) for director Julien Duvivier was popular, but _Babette Goes to War_ (1959), a comedy set in World War Two, was a huge hit, the fourth biggest movie of the year in France.[18] Also widely seen was _Come Dance with Me_ (1959) from Boisrond.

Her next film was the courtroom drama _The Truth_ (1960), from Henri-Georges Clouzot. It was a highly publicised production, which resulted in Bardot having an affair and attempting suicide. The film was Bardot's biggest ever commercial success in France, the third biggest hit of the year, and was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar.[19]

She made a comedy with Vadim, _Please, Not Now!_ (1961) and had a role in the all-star anthology, _Famous Love Affairs_ (1962).

Bardot was awarded a David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign actress for her role in _A Very Private Affair_ (_Vie privée_, 1962), directed by Louis Malle. More popular in France was _Love on a Pillow_ (1962), another for Vadim.

International films and singing career: 1962–1969

, 1964.]] In the mid-1960s Bardot made films which seemed to be more aimed at the international market. In 1963, she starred in Jean-Luc Godard's film _Le Mépris_, produced by Joseph E. Levine and starring Jack Palance. The following year she co-starred with Anthony Perkins in the comedy _Une ravissante idiote_ (1964).

Bardot finally appeared in a Hollywood film in _Dear Brigitte_ (1965), a comedy starring James Stewart as an academic whose son develops a crush on Bardot. Bardot's appearance was relatively brief and the film was not a big hit.

More successful was the Western buddy comedy _Viva Maria!_ (1965) for director Louis Malle, appearing opposite Jeanne Moreau. It was a big hit in France and around the world although it did not break through in the US as much as was hoped.[20]

After a cameo in Godard's _Masculin Féminin_ (1966), she had her first flop in a long time, _Two Weeks in September_ (1968), a French–English co-production. She had a small role in the all-star _Spirits of the Dead_ (1968), acting opposite Alain Delon, then tried a Hollywood film again: _Shalako_ (1968), a Western starring Sean Connery, which was a box office disappointment.[21]

She participated in several musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg, Bob Zagury and Sacha Distel, including "Harley Davidson"; "Je Me Donne À Qui Me Plaît"; "Bubble gum"; "Contact"; "Je Reviendrai Toujours Vers Toi"; "L'Appareil À Sous"; "La Madrague"; "On Déménage"; "Sidonie"; "Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?"; "Le Soleil De Ma Vie" (the cover of Stevie Wonder's "You Are the Sunshine of My Life"); and the notorious "Je t'aime... moi non-plus". Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he rerecorded a version with British-born model and actress Jane Birkin that became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when Universal Music made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.[22]

Final films: 1969–1973

From 1969 to 1978, Bardot was the official face of Marianne (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.[23]

_Les Femmes_ (1969) was a flop, although the screwball comedy _The Bear and the Doll_ (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: _Les Novices_ (1970), _Boulevard du Rhum_ (1971) (with Lino Ventura). _The Legend of Frenchie King_ (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with Claudia Cardinale. She made one more with Vadim, _Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman_ (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked "Underneath what people call "the Bardot myth" was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom – she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man – that amused me.[24]

"If _Don Juan_ is not my last movie it will be my next to last," said Bardot during filming.[25] She kept her word and only made one more film, _The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot_ (1973).

In 1973, Bardot announced she was retiring from acting as "a way to get out elegantly".[26]

Animal rights activism: 1973–present

In 1973, before her 39th birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with Serge Gainsbourg, she used her fame to promote animal rights.

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals.[27] She became a vegetarian[28] and raised three million francs to fund the foundation by auctioning off jewellery and personal belongings.[29]

She is a strong animal rights activist and a major opponent of the consumption of horse meat. In support of animal protection, she condemned seal hunting in Canada during a visit to that country with Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.[30] On 25 May 2011 the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society renamed its fast interceptor vessel, MV _Gojira_, as MV _Brigitte Bardot_ in appreciation of her support.[31]

She once had a neighbour's donkey castrated while looking after it, on the grounds of its "sexual harassment" of her own donkey and mare, for which she was taken to court by the donkey's owner in 1989.[32][33] Bardot wrote a 1999 letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, published in French magazine VSD, in which she accused the Chinese of "torturing bears and killing the world's last tigers and rhinos to make aphrodisiacs".

She has donated more than $140,000 over two years for a mass sterilization and adoption program for Bucharest's stray dogs, estimated to number 300,000.[34]

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II of Denmark, appealing for the sovereign to halt the killing of dolphins in the Faroe Islands. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a "macabre spectacle" that "is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ... This is not a hunt but a mass slaughter ... an outmoded tradition that has no acceptable justification in today's world".[35]

On 22 April 2011, French culture minister Frédéric Mitterrand officially included bullfighting in the country's cultural heritage. Bardot wrote him a highly critical letter of protest.[36]

From 2013 onwards the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in collaboration with Kagyupa International Monlam Trust of India has operated an annual Veterinary Care Camp. She has committed to the cause of animal welfare in Bodhgaya year after year.[37]

On 23 July 2015, Bardot condemned Australian politician Greg Hunt's plan to eradicate 2 million cats to save endangered species such as the Warru and Night Parrot.[38]


Personal life

_La Madrague_

In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of Southern France, where she had bought the house _La Madrague_ in Saint-Tropez.

Relationships

in St. Tropez, 1963]] On 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director Roger Vadim. They divorced in 1957, after less than five years of marriage; they had no children together, but remained in touch, and even collaborated on later projects. The stated reason for the divorce was Bardot's affairs with two other men. While married to Vadim, Bardot had an affair with Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was her co-star in _And God Created Woman._ Trintignant at the time was married to actress Stéphane Audran.[39][40] The two lived together for about two years, spanning the period before and after Bardot's divorce from Vadim, but they never married. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to military service and Bardot's affair with musician Gilbert Bécaud.[41]

In early 1958, her divorce from Vadim was followed in quick order by her break-up with Trintignant, and a reported nervous breakdown in Italy, according to newspaper reports. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was also noted, but was denied by her public relations manager.[42] She recovered within weeks and began an affair with actor Jacques Charrier. She became pregnant well before they were married on 18 June 1959. Bardot's only child, her son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was born on 11 January 1960. After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and had little contact with his biological mother until his adulthood.[43]

Bardot's third marriage was to German millionaire playboy Gunter Sachs, and lasted from 14 July 1966 to 1 October 1969.[44][45] In 1968, she began dating Patrick Gilles, who went on to co-star with her in _The Bear and the Doll_ (1970); but she ended their relationship in spring 1971.[46]

Over the next few years, Bardot dated in succession bartender/ski instructor Christian Kalt, club owner Luigi Rizzi, musician (later producer) Bob Zagury, singer Serge Gainsbourg, writer John Gilmore, actor Warren Beatty, and Laurent Vergez, her co-star in _Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman_.[47][48] The longest of these relationships was with sculptor Miroslav Brozek; she lived with him from 1975 to December 1979[49] and posed for some of his sculptures. After breaking up with Brozek, she was in a long-term relationship with French TV producer Allain Bougrain-duBourg.[50]

Bardot's fourth and current husband is Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the far right party National Front (now National Rally as of June 2018); they were married on 16 August 1992.[51]

Health

In 1974 Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in _Playboy_ magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday. On 28 September 1983, her 49th birthday, Bardot took an overdose of sleeping pills or tranquilizers with red wine. She had to be rushed to hospital, where her life was saved after a stomach pump was used to evacuate the pills from her body.[52] Bardot is also a breast cancer survivor.[53][54]

Politics and legal issues

Bardot expressed support for President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s.[55][56] Her husband Bernard d'Ormale is a former adviser of the National Front (now National Rally as of June 2018), the main far right party in France, known for its nationalist and conservative beliefs.[57][58][59]

In her 1999 book _Le Carré de Pluton_ ("_Pluto's Square_"), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the ritual slaughter of sheep during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, "Open Letter to My Lost France", Bardot writes that "my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims". For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 francs in June 2000. She had been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in _Le Figaro_ and again in 1998 for making similar remarks.[60][61][62] in Rome, 1995.]]

In her 2003 book, _Un cri dans le silence_ (_A Scream in the Silence_), she warned of an "Islamicization of France", and said of Muslim immigration:

  Over the last twenty years, we have given in to a subterranean, dangerous, and uncontrolled infiltration, which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will, as the years pass, attempt to impose its own.[63]

In the book, she contrasted her close gay friends with today's homosexuals, who "jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through" and said some contemporary homosexuals behave like "fairground freaks".[64] In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: "Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos. For years, they have been my support, my friends, my adopted children, my confidants."[65][66]

In her book she wrote about issues such as racial mixing, immigration, the role of women in politics, and Islam. The book also contained a section attacking what she called the mixing of genes and praised previous generations who, she said, had given their lives to push out invaders.[67]

On 10 June 2004, Bardot was convicted for a fourth time by a French court for inciting racial hatred and fined €5,000.[68] Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: "I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody. It is not in my character."[69]

In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in regard to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to Nicolas Sarkozy when he was Interior Minister of France. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France ritually slaughtering sheep by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first. She also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits". The trial[70] concluded on 3 June 2008, with a conviction and fine of €15,000, the largest of her fines to date. The prosecutor stated she was tired of charging Bardot with offences related to racial hatred.[71]

During the 2008 United States presidential election, she branded the Republican Party vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin as "stupid" and a "disgrace to women". She criticized the former governor of Alaska for her stance on global warming and gun control. She was also offended by Palin's support for Arctic oil exploration and by her lack of consideration in protecting polar bears.[72]

On 13 August 2010, Bardot lashed out at director Kyle Newman regarding his plan to make a biographical film on her life. She told him, "Wait until I'm dead before you make a movie about my life!" otherwise "sparks will fly".[73]

Bardot expressed support for National Front (now National Rally as of June 2018) leader Marine le Pen, calling her "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".[74] She endorsed Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election.[75]


Influence in pop culture

, Brazil]] In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses. Bardot popularized the bikini in her early films such as _Manina_ (1952) (released in France as _Manina, la fille sans voiles_). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in the south of France during the Cannes Film Festival.[76] She gained additional attention when she filmed _...And God Created Woman_ (1956) with Jean-Louis Trintignant (released in France as _Et Dieu Créa La Femme_). In it Bardot portrays an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success.[77] The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risqué in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United States' largest swimsuit designers, said, "It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency."[78]

She also brought into fashion the _choucroute_ ("Sauerkraut") hairstyle (a sort of beehive hair style) and gingham clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier.[79] She was the subject of an Andy Warhol painting.

The BARDOT POSE describes an iconic modeling portrait shot around 1960 where Bardot is dressed only in a pair of black pantyhose, cross-legged over her front and cross-armed over her breasts. This pose has been emulated numerous times by models and celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Elle Macpherson and Monica Bellucci.[80]

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has been credited with popularizing the city of St. Tropez and the town of Armação dos Búzios in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician Bob Zagury. The place where she stayed in Búzios is today a small hotel, Pousada do Sol, and also a French restaurant, Cigalon.[81] The town hosts a Bardot statue by Christina Motta.[82]

Bardot was idolized by the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney.[83][84] They made plans to shoot a film featuring The Beatles and Bardot, similar to _A Hard Day's Night_, but the plans were never fulfilled.[85] Lennon's first wife Cynthia Powell lightened her hair color to more closely resemble Bardot, while George Harrison made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife Pattie Boyd, as Cynthia wrote later in _A Twist of Lennon_. Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent Derek Taylor; a nervous Lennon took LSD before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, "I was on acid, and she was on her way out.")[86] According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician Bob Dylan dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in "I Shall Be Free", which appeared on his second album, _The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan_. The first-ever official exhibition spotlighting Bardot's influence and legacy opened in Boulogne-Billancourt on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday.[87] The Australian pop group Bardot was named after her.
