ASAF EPSTEIN (; born August 1, 1978) is an Israeli film director, writer and producer.


Biography

Asaf Epstein was born in Israel on August 1, 1978, to Lea and Hanan Epstein. He is the older brother of Efrat and Roni Epstein. When he was a young boy, the family relocated to Fort Worth, Texas, where Epstein attended a private Jewish school. The family then relocated back to the town of Modiin in Israel. There, he attended junior high school. In 1995, the family relocated back to the United States and settled in Dallas, Texas, where Epstein attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson.

During his early twenties, Epstein left his family in the United States and relocated back to Israel on his own to enlist in the Israeli Defense Forces, where he took on a desk job in the Air Force. In the early 2000s, Epstein enrolled to study film at Tel Aviv University.


Career

After completing his studies, Epstein produced independent corporate promotional clips making use of various computer animated elements. In 2008, he took part in the production of two Israeli films; _The Other War_, a drama set in Tel-Aviv during the second Lebanon war, and _Jaffawiye_, a documentary about the multicultural hip-hop band _System Ali_. In 2010, Epstein produced _Mother's Fading_, a short film drama about the complex relationship between a mother and her son.

In 2011, he began production on his award-winning sci-fi, thriller comedy short entitled _Schnitzel,_ which he wrote, produced and directed. _Schnitzel_ tells the tale of a young teenage boy and his encounter with an extra terrestrial being which has taken the form of a schnitzel. In a 2016 interview, Epstein remarked that _Schnitzel_ was inspired by Steven Spielberg's _E.T._, and his experience of being an "awkward and goofy kid being uncomfortable in his own skin" and a school field trip during which he and his classmates were given schnitzels for lunch.[1] In July 2014, he released _Schnitzel_ which earned him numerous awards at festivals around the world including _Best International Film_ at the South Carolina Cultural Film Festival, _Best Science Fiction Film_ at the Hyart Film Festival[2] and _Best International Coming-of-Age_ at the Manhattan Film Festival in 2015.[3] Later that year, he would go on to win _Best Producer of a Foreign Language Film_ at the Madrid International Film Festival.[4]
