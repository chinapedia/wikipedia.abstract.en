The term may refer to both scientific ideas and science fiction genres that center on giant robots or machines (MECHS) controlled by people. Mechas are typically depicted as humanoid mobile robots. The term was first used in Japanese (_meka_) after shortening the English loanword _mekanikaru_ ('mechanical'), but the meaning in Japanese is more inclusive, and "robot" (_robotto_) or "giant robot" is the narrower term.

These machines vary greatly in size and shape, but are distinguished from vehicles by their humanoid or biomorphic appearance and size—bigger than a human. Different subgenres exist, with varying connotations of realism. The concept of Super Robot and Real Robot are two such examples found in Japanese anime. The term may also refer to real world piloted humanoid or non-humanoid robotic platforms, either currently in existence or still on the drawing board (i.e. at the planning or design stage). Alternatively, in the original Japanese context of the word, "mecha" may refer to mobile machinery/vehicles (including aircraft) in general, manned or otherwise.


Characteristics

The word is an abbreviation, first used in Japanese, of the word "mechanical". In Japanese, mecha encompasses all mechanical objects, including cars, guns, computers, and other devices, and the term or "giant robot" is used to distinguish limbed vehicles from other mechanical devices. Outside of this usage, it has become associated with large humanoid machines with limbs or other biological characteristics. Mechs differ from robots in that they are piloted from a cockpit, typically located in the chest or head of the mech.[1]

While the distinction is often hazy, mecha typically does not refer to form-fitting powered armor such as Iron Man's suit. They are usually much larger than the wearer, like Iron Man's enemy the Iron Monger, or the mobile suits depicted in the Gundam series.

In most cases, mecha are depicted as fighting machines, whose appeal comes from the combination of potent weaponry with a more stylish combat technique than a mere vehicle. Often, they are the primary means of combat, with conflicts sometimes being decided through gladiatorial matches. Other works represent mecha as one component of an integrated military force, supported by and fighting alongside tanks, fighter aircraft, and infantry, functioning as a mechanical cavalry. The applications often highlight the theoretical usefulness of such a device, combining a tank's resilience and firepower with infantry's ability to cross unstable terrain and a high degree of customization. In some continuities, special scenarios are constructed to make mecha more viable than current-day status. For example, in Gundam the fictional Minovsky particle inhibits the use of radar, making long-range ballistic strikes impractical, thus favouring relatively close range warfare of Mobile Suits.

However, some stories, such as the manga/anime series _Patlabor_ and the American wargame BattleTech universe, also encompass mecha used for civilian purposes such as heavy construction work, police functions or firefighting. Mecha also see roles as transporters, recreation, advanced hazmat suits and other R and D applications.

Mecha have been used in fantasy settings, for example in the anime series _Aura Battler Dunbine_, _The Vision of Escaflowne_, _Panzer World Galient_ and _Maze_. In those cases, the mecha designs are usually based on some alternative or "lost" science-fiction technology from ancient times. In case of anime series _Zoids_, the machines resemble dinosaurs and animals, and have been shown to evolve from native metallic organisms.

A chicken walker is a fictional type of bipedal robot or mecha, distinguished by its rear-facing knee joint. This type of articulation resembles a bird's legs, hence the name.[2] However, birds actually have forward-facing knees; they are digitigrade, and what most call the "knee" is actually the ankle.[3]


Early history

The 1868 Edward S. Ellis novel _The Steam Man of the Prairies_ featured a steam-powered, back piloted, mechanical man. The 1880 Jules Verne novel _La Maison à vapeur (The Steam House)_ featured a steam-powered, piloted, mechanical elephant. One of the first appearances of such machines in modern literature was the _tripods_ of H. G. Wells' famous _The War of the Worlds_ (1897). The novel does not contain a fully detailed description of the tripods' (or "fighting-machine", as they are known in the novel) mode of locomotion, however it is hinted at: "Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand."

_Ōgon Bat_, a kamishibai that debuted in 1931 (later adapted into an anime in 1967), featured the first piloted humanoid giant robot, ,[4] but as an enemy rather than a protagonist. The first humanoid giant robot piloted by the protagonist appeared in the manga in 1948.[5] The manga and anime _Tetsujin 28-Go_, introduced in 1956, featured a robot, Tetsujin, that was controlled externally by an operator via remote control. The manga and anime _Astro Boy_, introduced in 1952, with its humanoid robot protagonist, was a key influence on the development of the giant robot genre in Japan. The first anime featuring a giant mecha being piloted by the protagonist from within a cockpit was the Super Robot show _Mazinger Z_, written by Go Nagai and introduced in 1972.[6]

Early uses of mech-like machines in the United States include Kimball Kinnison's battle suit in E. E. "Doc" Smith's _Lensman_ novel _Galactic Patrol_ (1950), the Mobile Infantry battle suits in Robert Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_ (1958), and the film _The King and the Mockingbird_ (first released in 1952).


Genres

In manga and anime

In Japan, "robot anime" (known as "mecha anime" outside Japan) is one of the oldest genres in anime.[7] Robot anime is often tied in with toy manufacturers. Large franchises such as Zoids and Gundam have hundreds of different model kits .

The size of mecha can vary according to the story and concepts involved. Some of them may not be considerably taller than a tank (_Armored Trooper Votoms_, _Megazone 23_, _Code Geass_), some may be a few stories tall (_Gundam_, _Escaflowne_, _Bismark_, _Gurren Lagann_), others can be as tall as a skyscraper (_Space Runaway Ideon_, _Genesis of Aquarion_, _Neon Genesis Evangelion_), some are big enough to contain an entire city (_Macross_), some the size of a planet (_Diebuster_), galaxies (_Getter Robo_, _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_), or even as large as universes (_Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Lagann-hen_, _Demonbane_).

The first giant robot seen was Mitsuteru Yokoyama's 1956 manga _Tetsujin 28-go_. However, it wasn't until the advent of Go Nagai's _Mazinger Z_ that the genre was established. _Mazinger Z_ innovated by adding the inclusion of futuristic weapons, and the concept of being able to pilot from a cockpit[8] (rather than via remote control, in the case of Tetsujin). According to Go Nagai:

_Mazinger Z_ featured giant robots which were "piloted by means of a small flying car and command center that docked inside the head."[9] It was also a pioneer in die-cast metal toys such as the Chogokin series in Japan and the Shogun Warriors in the U.S., that were (and still are) very popular with children and collectors.

Robot/mecha anime and manga differ vastly in storytelling and animation quality from title to title, and content ranges all the way from children's shows to ones intended for an older teen or adult audience.

Some robot mecha are capable of transformation (_Macross_ and _Zeta Gundam_) or combining to form even bigger ones (_Beast King GoLion_ and _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_). Go Nagai is also often credited with inventing this in 1974 with the television series _Getter Robo_.

Not all mecha need be completely mechanical. Some have biological components with which to interface with their pilots, and some are partially biological themselves, such as in _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, _Eureka Seven_, and _Zoids_.

Mecha based on anime have seen extreme cultural reception across the world. The personification of this popularity can be seen as 1:1 size _Mazinger Z_, Tetsujin, and Gundam statues built across the world.

In video games

'' is a 2013 space combat video game featuring mecha designs by Junji Okubo.]] , _GearHead RPG_.]] Mecha are often featured in computer and console video games. Because of their size and fictional power, mecha are quite popular subjects for games, both tabletop and electronic. They have been featured in video games since the 1980s, particularly in vehicular combat and shooter games, including Sesame Japan's side-scrolling shooter game _Vastar_ in 1983,[11] various _Gundam_ games such as _Mobile Suit Gundam: Last Shooting_ in 1984 and _Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble_ in 1986,[12] the run and gun shooters _Hover Attack_ in 1984 and _Thexder_ in 1985, and Arsys Software's 3D role-playing shooters _WiBArm_ in 1986 and _Star Cruiser_ in 1988. Historically mecha-based games have been more popular in Japan than in other countries.[13]

-   A popular classic of mecha in games is the _MechWarrior_ series of video games, which takes place in the Battletech universe. Another game, _Heavy Gear 2_ offers a complex yet semi-realistic control system for its mecha in both terrain and outer space warfare.

-   Older American Tabletop games, _Battletech_, uses hex-maps, miniatures & paper record sheets that allow players to use mecha in tactical situations and record realistic damage, while add RPG elements when desired. It is from Battletech that the term 'mech (a contraction of Battlemech) was popularized, but 'mech is not to be confused with the more general term of Mecha.
-   The games of Hideo Kojima, including the _Metal Gear_ series and _Zone of the Enders_, include mecha as part of their main premise. In the former, which takes place during the modern day and near future, prototype nuclear-capable bipedal tanks called Metal Gears are a recurring element. In the latter, real robots called LEVs exist alongside a more super robot-like mecha type known as the Orbital Frame.
-   In the tabletop game _Warhammer 40,000_, the forces use mecha of a variety of sizes and shapes.
-   The Monolith Productions game _Shogo: Mobile Armor Division_ blended Mecha game-play with that of traditional first-person shooter games.[14]

-   Blizzard Entertainment's team shooter _Overwatch_ includes D.Va, a tank hero who pilots a mecha. Stylized as MEKA (Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army), D.Va's mecha provides her primary hero abilities as well as being a driver of her backstory in the game's lore.[16]


Real mecha

There are a few real prototypes of mecha-like vehicles. Currently almost all of these are highly specialized or just for concept purpose, and as such may not see mass production.

-   Land Walker: A machine developed by Sakakibara Kikai with the intention of giving the impression of a bipedal mecha.[17][18]
-   T-52 Enryu: Translated name "Rescue Dragon", it is a 3.5 meter-tall hydraulically-operated robotic vehicle developed by Tmsuk. The vehicle has two hands, which copy the controller's movements. Its intended application is to open a path in the debris for the rescue team.
-   In 2018, Japanese engineer Masaaki Nagumo from Sakakibara Kikai completed construction of a functional bipedal mecha inspired by the _Gundam_ franchise. The device, standing 8.5 meters tall and weighing about 7 tonnes, possesses fully functional arm and leg servos.[19]

In the Western world, there are few examples of mecha, however, several machines have been constructed by both companies and private figures. Timberjack, a subsidiary of John Deere, built a practical hexapod walking harvester.[20]
