Notes


History

The county council was created on November 6, 1979 by Snohomish County voters as part of a home rule charter, which replaced the traditional three-member county commission with a five-member council and county executive.[1][2] The first two new councilmembers was elected on March 11, 1980, joining the three existing commissioners who would continue to serve until 1983, when all seats were up for re-election.[3][4]

In 2016, the county's Charter Review Commission explored expanding the council to seven members after the next redistricting.[5] The expansion, along with requirements to hold some meetings outside of Everett and include evening meetings for public hearings, were rejected by the commission.[6]


Structure

The council consists of five members representing five geographic districts of equal population. Each member serves a four-year term during a regular election held during November on odd-numbered years. No member can serve more than three total terms.[7][8]
