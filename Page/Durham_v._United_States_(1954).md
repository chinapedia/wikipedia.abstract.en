_DURHAM V. UNITED STATES_, 214 F.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954),[1] is a criminal case articulating what became known as the Durham rule for juries to find a defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity, that "an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect".[2][3] It was to enable psychiatrists to "inform the jury of the character of [the defendant's mental disease" so that a jury could be "guided by wider horizons of knowledge concerning mental life";.[4] so that juries could make determinations based on expert testimony about the disease.[5] It was patterned on _State v. Pike_.[6][7] It was adopted by only two states, for a short time, but has and continues to be influential on debate over legal insanity.[8] The decision was criticized for leaving a jury with no standard to judge impairment of reason or control, did not define mental disease, and left the jury dependent on expert testimony.[9]
