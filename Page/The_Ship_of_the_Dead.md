Plot summary

Magnus Chase receives an ocean survival lesson from Percy Jackson, a Greek demigod who is his cousin Annabeth Chase's boyfriend. The latter advises him, mentioning the possessiveness of sea gods over their weapons. Alex Fierro and Magnus travel to the Chase Mansion, where they recover notes scribbled by Randolph at different points of time. Alex feels that these notes hold the key to defeat her father(Mother). After reaching Valhalla, Magnus summons a ship gifted by his father Frey. Mallory Keen, Halfborn Gunderson, Thomas Jefferson Jr., Samirah Al Abbas and Alex accompany Magnus, while they plan to pick Blitzen and Hearthstone along the way. The crew's talk is heard by the Nine Billow Maidens, who take them to the court of Aegir, where they discover Hearth and Blitz are held prisoner and that Aegir was once humiliated by Loki himself in a flyting. Aegir's eldest daughter realizes Magnus' identity though very funnily, from his previous encounter with her mother Ran.Upon being threatened, Magnus swears by his troth to defeat Loki in a flyting contest and to avenge Aegir's humiliation, and the Sea God tells them to escape while he isnt looking and the crew is nevertheless attacked by Aegir's nine daughters. They escape with the help of Magnus' grandfather Njord who appears even though he is unwelcomebut respected. Njord instructs them and tells Magnus that the only way to defeat Loki is by drinking Kvasir's mead. The crew continue on their journey, with Blitz and Hearth travelling separately to retrieve Bolverk's whetstone.

As the crew heads to York, the backstories of the members are revealed. Mallory died disarming a bomb in Ireland; Halfborn died near Jorvik; TJ died after forcefully accepting a hopeless challenge (meaning he has to accept all challenges posed to him, whether he fails or succeeds), a trait inherited from his father Tyr. Samirah fasts during the Ramadan season. The crew arrives at Old York, where they duel with the giant Hrungnir for the location of Kvasir's Mead. They get the information that they need that the Kvasir Mead is in Jorvik or Norway. Magnus later has a word battle on board Naglfar (ship made of nails) in which he wins not by insulting Loki but making his teamwork evident and his words make Loki shrink due to his evident faults and says that even among the midst of thousands, he is alone, as even his loyal wife Sigyn disappears from his side. Magnus wins due to which Loki reduces to the size of a nut and is imprisoned in a walnut given earlier by Frigg; Mallory's mother and the queen of Asgard, when she came to meet her in the train.

Magnus and their friends travel back to Valhalla to meet their godly parents who congratulate them for defeating Loki and delaying the Ragnarok for which he is rewarded with a boon from Lord Odin. Magnus asks Odin to lend him his lawyers so that he could convert his mansion to an orphanage and home for the homeless. He later calls Annabeth and tells her his adventure and notices her, sobbing.


Characters

-   MAGNUS CHASE (BEANTOWN) - A 16-year-old son of Frey who dies in the first few chapters but becomes an einherjar. He is Annabeth Chase's cousin, but last saw her when he was very young. He has healing and regeneration powers, resistance to extreme temperatures, and other magical abilities. As a human, he was asthmatic and weak, but gains extreme strength and endurance after his death.[1]
-   SAMIRAH AL-ABBAS (SAM) - The Valkyrie who brought Magnus to Hotel Valhalla. A daughter of Loki, she emigrated from Iraq with her family and is descended from a medieval Arab traveler and historian who wrote an important account about living among the Vikings. She is stripped of her powers as a Valkyrie as a result of her choice to make Magnus an einherjar, but is reinstated by Odin himself. She is a practicing Muslim. She is a shapeshifter and carries an ax and a green hijab, which doubles as a camouflage cloak. She is engaged to Amir Fadlan, who works in a falafel shop.[2]
-   HEARTHSTONE (HEARTH) - A friend of Magnus. He is an _alf_ (elf). He is deaf-mute, but speaks Alf Sign Language and can read lips. He had an abusive childhood, with parents who disliked him because of his disabilities. In exchange for working for Mimir, he received the ability to work rune magic.[3]
-   BLITZEN (BLITZ) - Another friend of Magnus, a _svartalf_ (dwarf). He is the son of Freya. He and Hearth watched over Magnus while he was living in the streets. Blitz's father was killed by Fenris when he was a child, after an attempt to replace the Fenris Wolf's bindings. Blitz is unskilled at crafting (unusual for dwarves) but is a master fashion advisor. He, like Hearth, once worked for Mimir.[4]
-   MALLORY AUDREY KEEN (MACK) - Mallory Keen was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland to Frigg and an unnamed man. Mallory had a poor relationship with her father due to his alcoholism. On 21 July 1972, which later became known as Bloody Friday, Loki disguised himself as one of Mallory's friends and tricked her into installing a car bomb on a school bus, claiming that soldiers were onboard instead of children. Her mother, Frigg, knowing Mallory would die, appeared to her disguised as an old hag and convinced her to disarm the bomb, giving her two knives. The car bomb blew up, killing Mallory, but since she died a heroic death with a weapon in her hand, she was taken to Valhalla.[5]
-   HALFBORN GUNDERSON - A beserker extraordinaire, Gunderson left his hometown Flam to gain riches and glory and promised his mother he will be back to make their lives better. However, he never saw her again as she died in a mysterious fire. Halfborn Gunderson now fights as a Norse mercenary amongst his Enheirjar friends.<ref name="Book1","Book3"/>
-   ALEX FIERRO - Alex's family is influential, which first attracted Loki's attention, causing him to seduce Alex's father in the form of a "voluptuous red-head". Nine months later, Loki left him with a child. The family didn't take the news well, especially after Loki permanently "opened their eyes" and made them aware of the Nine Worlds and the Norse gods. Alex spent her/his life being resented for her/his Norse heritage and for her/his gender fluidity, which was thought to be Loki's fault. Only her/his grandfather accepted her/him for who she/he was, and taught her/him how to make pottery. About two years before becoming an einherji, Alex became homeless and began to wander the streets of Boston. At some point in life, he/she lived in a youth shelter on Winter Street in Boston, at roughly the same time when Magnus was there. He/She remembers hating the place.[6]
