PALMER BRADEN MCABEE (April 28, 1894, Cherokee County, Alabama - September 5, 1970, Centre, Alabama) was an American blues harmonica player. Little is known of his life.

On February 21, 1928, he recorded two tracks in Atlanta, Georgia: "Lost Boy Blues" and "McAbee's Railroad Piece". They were released on a 10" 78rpm record, Victor 41930.[1][2][3][4]

It has often been assumed from the style of his music that he was African-American.[5] However, on his 1917 draft registration card, he is described as "Caucasian". At that time, he was employed as a carpenter, and resided in Cedartown, Georgia.[6]

He is buried in Hebron United Methodist Church Cemetery, Howells Crossroads, Cherokee County.[7]

Many harmonica players have tried to imitate railway noises. McAbee has been singled out for his "imagination and fervor ... creat[ing] effects both realistic and surrealistic sometimes by blowing over the top of the harp".[8]
