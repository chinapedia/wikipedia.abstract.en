_EUCALYPTUS CYLINDROCARPA_, commonly known as the WOODLINE MALLEE,[1] is a species of mallee that is endemic in Western Australia. It has mostly smooth bark, sometimes with loose fibrous or flaky bark near the base of the trunk, linear to lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, nine or eleven and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit.Eucalyptus_cylindrocarpa_buds.jpgEucalyptus_cylindrocarpa_fruit.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus cylindrocarpa_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has fibrous-flaky box type or stringy, greyish or red-brown coloured persistent bark on the lower trunk, smooth grey over pink bark above. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same glossy green colour on both sides and linear to lance-shaped or curved. They are long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are cylindrical, long and wide with a conical or beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from November to December or from January to April and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves at rim level or enclosed in the fruit.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus cylindrocarpa_ was first formally described by the botanist William Blakely in 1934 in his book _A Key to the Eucalypts_. The type specimen was collected by John Burton Cleland in 1926, "near Woodbine, south of Coolgardie". [5] The specific epithet (_cylindrocarpa_) is derived from the Ancient Greek words _kylindros_ meaning "roller" or "roll of a book"[6] and _karpos_ meaning "fruit"[7] referring to the cylindrical shape of the fruit.[8]

_Eucalyptus cylindrocarpa_ is part of the subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ section _Dumaria_ in a sub-group of nine closely related species in the series _Ovulares_. These are the smooth barked _E. cylindrocarpa_, _E. cyclostoma_, _E. exigua_ and _E. oraria_ and the rough barked members _E. ovularis_, _E. aequioperta_, _E. brachycorys_, _E. myriadena_ and _E. baudiniana_.[9]


Distribution and habitat

Woodline mallee is found on sandplains and low dunes mainly between Kellerberrin and Zanthus where it grows in shrubland and woodland in red clayey sand or sandy soils. It is found in the south western Goldfields-Esperance and south east Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia.[10][11]
