PÅ SLAGET 12 (also known as PS12) is a Danish pop and rock band which mainly consists of singer Ann-Mette Elten and guitarist Niels Kirkegård. På Slaget 12 was formed as a band in 1984 under the name _Kvartalsband af Elten, Kirkegård, keyboardspiller Søren Møller, bassist Mogens Lodahl, og trommeslager Mats Madsen_ (English: Quarter band by Elten, Kirkegård, keyboardist Søren Møller, bassist Mogens Lodahl, and drummer Mats Madsen). The band published their debut album in 1986 in which the song _Hjem til Århus_ became a major hit.[1][2]

The debut album published in 1986 sold 61.000 copies and it was followed up by a number of other successful albums in the 1980s. The album _Ro mit hjerte_ from 1997 became a flop that only sold 1800 copies. In February 2002 _På Slaget 12_ got a commercial comeback with the album _Let's Dance_consisting of hits from the 1950s and 1960s. The album became a major success that sold 115.000 copies. In November 2002 _Let's Dance 2_ was published followed by _Let's Dance 3_ in June 2003. The group had published 3 albums in a year and a half. In 2004 the fourth and last _Let's Dance_-albums was published and the series sold a total of 350.000 copies. The success with _Let's Dance_ carried with it many concerts and performances and the band has since 2002 given c. 80 concert per year.[3]
