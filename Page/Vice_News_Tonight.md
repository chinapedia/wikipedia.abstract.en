_VICE NEWS TONIGHT_ is a nightly American news program broadcast on HBO.[1] It premiered on October 10, 2016. It is HBO's first ever daily series.[2]

The final episode will air in September 2019.[3]


Development

Josh Tyrangiel, _Vice_ executive vice-president for news content said that the idea came in an effort to try to engage viewers, and not simply to summarize the news. He said that the purpose is "actually placing stories in context and understanding them in a timely way (is) where the great value is," and that _Vice_ is focused on "trying to build a long-term relationship with viewers that's focused on how the world works."[4]

Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president for HBO, said that the show came about because HBO "[wanted] the show to be a good fit for viewers looking for a traditional experience, as well as for those millennials who prefer to get their content on a tablet or a smartphone and want a more interactive experience."[5]


History

In August 2017, _Vice News Tonight_ received attention after its coverage of the Unite the Right rally, entitled _Charlottesville: Race and Terror_, went viral after HBO's decision to put the entirety of the episode for free for all to view on YouTube. CNN's Brian Stelter declared the coverage to be _Vice News Tonight_'s "breakout moment."[6] The segment earned _Vice News Tonight_ a 2017 Peabody Award for News coverage.[7]

On June 10, 2019, HBO announced it would be cancelling Vice News Tonight and severing it’s seven year partnership with Vice Media [8]


Format

In a statement, Vice Media said that _Vice News Tonight_ is a news program with "no ads, no anchors, and no censors."[9]

A typical episode uses a mix of voiceovers, graphics and video packages to dive into national and global news, technology, the environment, economics, and pop culture. The program is devoted to the idea of not using on-air news anchors.[10]

Episodes can be modified hours before airtime to accommodate more-newsworthy segments, and the show can go live if necessary.[11]


Release and accessibility

_Vice News Tonight_ will air 48 weeks per year, and has been given a three-year commitment from the network.[12]

Each episode will also be available on Vice News' website one week after it premieres.[13] Episodes will also be available on HBO Go and HBO Now the day after they air. The show has also designed with touch-screen capabilities, so viewers watching on HBO's digital platforms can pull up related documents, graphs and charts within episodes.[14]

In Canada, the series debuted on October 10, 2016 with broadcasts on Viceland,[15] and moved to MuchMusic after Viceland shut down.[16]

In Australia, the series was broadcast on SBS Viceland.[17]


Reception

In a review of the first episode, Mike Hale of _The New York Times_ said the show was "new, but no game changer", saying "As hackneyed, shallow and formulaic as network newscasts can be, they still offer something in terms of immediacy and comprehensiveness that _Vice News Tonight_, as it is currently constituted, can’t pretend to compete with. If you like the _Vice_ sensibility, though, you might enjoy the show’s capsule version of it. Just don’t expect the news to be new."[18]

Maureen Ryan of _Variety_ said that "if nothing else, it’s good to know that two organizations with deep pockets are coming together in a major effort to help keep citizens — and especially younger Americans — informed... Between HBO and the Internet, one hopes the best of the organization’s reporters will see their work reach a much broader audience."[19]

Daniel Fienberg of _The Hollywood Reporter_ said that "In its best moments, _Vice News Tonight_ felt like a string of little amuse-bouches to whet appetites for full meals available online. In its lesser moments, it felt like _Full Frontal_ or _Last Week Tonight_ without the jokes and, honestly, with less on-air depth. I think there's probably value in _Vice News Tonight_ as almost a newsletter or digest point-of-entry into the absurd amount of content that the Vice empire generates every day. Even though those newsletters feel old-fashioned on the surface, all the cool media kids have their own and it would be just like the forward-thinking Vice to package theirs in the format of an equally old-fashioned newscast. We'll see if _Vice News Tonight_ evolves into more than that.[20]

In a more critical review, Brian Lowry of CNNMoney said "While Vice has promised a sort-of reinvention of the staid nightly news format, what it delivered merely played like _Short Attention Span Theater_... The half-hour would have benefited from fewer stories allowed a bit more room to breathe... There's no point in the pay channel doing me-too news, given its premium pedigree. Yet while the mix will surely evolve, _Vice News Tonight's_ template offers a difference, yes, but at least initially, one without much distinction."[21]
