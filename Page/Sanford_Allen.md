SANFORD ALLEN (born 1939) is an African-American classical violinist.[1] At the age of 10, he began studying violin at the Juilliard School of Music and continued at the Mannes School of Music under Vera Fonaroff.[2] He was the first African-American regular member of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts Orchestra, joining in the summer of 1959.[3] In 1962, shortly after winning the inaugural Young Concert Artists competition,[4] he became the first full-time African-American violinist with the New York Philharmonic.[5] After leaving the Philharmonic in 1977, Allen pursued a career as a soloist, teacher, and adviser on the arts. He also worked extensively recording film music.[6]

Allen has been married to Madhur Jaffrey, the Indian-born actress, food and travel writer, and television personality, since 1969.[7]
