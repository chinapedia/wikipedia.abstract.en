CHANNELVISION was an Australian subscription television channel based in Canberra that screened locally produced content. The channel launched on 1 September 2005 on TransTV,[1] replacing the TransTV Help Channel, and mainly broadcast local content, news, interviews and local sport.

Throughout its history, Channelvision only broadcast to Canberra via TransTV. However, on 5 July 2009, Channelvision began broadcasting a half hour magazine styled program on Aurora Community Channel, available nationally via subscription services Foxtel, Austar and Optus Television.[2]
