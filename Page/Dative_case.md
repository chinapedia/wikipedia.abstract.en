The DATIVE CASE (abbreviated , or sometimes when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used in some languages to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action, as in "Maria Jacobo potum dedit", Latin for "Maria gave Jacob a drink". In this example, the dative marks what would be considered the indirect object of a verb in English.

Sometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In Scottish Gaelic and Irish, the term _dative case_ is used in traditional grammars to refer to the prepositional case-marking of nouns following simple prepositions and the definite article. In Georgian, the dative case also marks the subject of the sentence with some verbs and some tenses. This is called the dative construction.

The dative was common among early Indo-European languages and has survived to the present in the Balto-Slavic branch and the Germanic branch, among others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the Uralic family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In Ancient Greek, the dative has the functions of the Proto-Indo-European locative and instrumental as well as those of the original dative.

Under the influence of English, which uses the preposition "to" for (among other uses) both indirect objects (_give to_) and directions of movement (_go to_), the term "dative" has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called lative.


Etymology

"Dative" comes from Latin _cāsus datīvus_ ("case for giving"), a translation of Greek δοτικὴ πτῶσις, _dotikē ptôsis_ ("inflection for giving"),[1] from its use with the verb _didónai_ "to give".[2] Dionysius Thrax in his Art of Grammar also refers to it as _epistaltikḗ_ "for sending (a letter)",[3] from the verb _epistéllō_ "send to", a word from the same root as epistle.


English

The Old English language, which continued in use until after the Norman Conquest of 1066, had a dative case; however, the English case system gradually fell into disuse during the Middle English period, when the accusative and dative of pronouns merged into a single oblique case that was also used with all prepositions. This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the "accusative" and "dative" labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term "objective" for oblique.[4][5]

Set expressions

The dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word "methinks", with the meaning "it seems to me". It survives in this fixed form from Old English (having undergone, however, phonetic changes with the rest of the language), in which it was constructed as "[it]" + "me" (the dative case of the personal pronoun) + "thinks" (i.e., "seems", < Old English þyncan, "to seem", a verb closely related to the verb þencan, "to think", but distinct from it in Old English; later it merged with "think" and lost this meaning).

Relic pronouns

The modern objective case pronoun whom is derived from the dative case in Old English, specifically the Old English dative pronoun "hwām" (as opposed to the modern subjective "who", which descends from Old English "hwā") – though "whom" _also_ absorbed the functions of the Old English accusative pronoun "hwone". It is also cognate to the word "_wem_" (the dative form of "_wer_") in German. The OED defines all classical uses of the word "whom" in situations where the indirect object _is not known_ – in effect, indicating the anonymity of the indirect object.

Likewise, some of the object forms of personal pronouns are remnants of Old English datives. For example, "him" goes back to the Old English dative _him_ (accusative was _hine_), and "her" goes back to the dative _hire_ (accusative was _hīe_). These pronouns are not datives in modern English; they are also used for functions previously indicated by the accusative.

Modern English

A grammatical "object" is an object _of something_, either an object _of a preposition_ or an object _of a verb_. Objects of verbs can be either _direct_ or _indirect_, while objects of prepositions are neither direct nor indirect. The indirect object of the verb is expressed between the verb and the direct object of the verb: "he gave ME a book" or "he wrote ME a poem."

An indirect object can often be _re-worded_ with a prepositional phrase using "to" or "for", but it is then no longer an indirect object. For example, "He gave a book TO ME" and "He wrote a poem FOR ME" have the same meaning the examples above, but are now _adverbial prepositional phrases_. Of course it is not unusual that two _different grammatical structures_ can describe the _same situation_; however referring to these _prepositional objects_ mistakenly as _indirect objects_ is a common error.


German

In general, the dative (German: _Dativ_) is used to mark the indirect object of a German sentence. For example:

-   _Ich schickte DEM MANN(E) das Buch._ (literally: I sent "to the man" the book.) – Masculine
-   _Ich gab DER FRAU den Stift zurück._ (literally: I gave "to the woman" the pencil back.) – Feminine
-   _Ich überreiche DEM KIND(E) ein Geschenk._ (literally: I hand "to the child" a present.) – Neuter

In English, the first sentence can be rendered as "I sent the book _to the man_" and as "I sent _the man_ the book", where the indirect object is identified in English by standing in front of the direct object. The normal word order in German is to put the dative in front of the accusative (as in the example above). However, since the German dative is marked in form, it can also be put _after_ the accusative: _Ich schickte das Buch DEM MANN(E)_. The _(E)_ after _Mann_ and _Kind_ signifies a now largely archaic -e ending for certain nouns in the dative. It survives today almost exclusively in set phrases such as _zu Hause_ (at home, _lit._ to house), _im Zuge_ (in the course of), and _am Tage_ (during the day, _lit._ at the day), as well as in occasional usage in formal prose, poetry, and song lyrics.

Some masculine nouns (and one neuter noun, _Herz_ [heart]), referred to as _weak nouns_ or _n-nouns_, take an -n or -en in the dative singular and plural. Many are masculine nouns ending in -e in the nominative (such as _Name_ [name], _Beamte_ [officer], and _Junge_ [boy]), although not all such nouns follow this rule. Many also, whether or not they fall into the former category, refer to people, animals, professions, or titles; exceptions to this include the aforementioned _Herz_ and _Name_, as well as _Buchstabe_ (letter), _Friede_ (peace), _Obelisk_ (obelisk), _Planet_ (planet), and others.

Certain German prepositions require the dative: _aus_ (from), _außer_ (out of), _bei_ (at, near), _entgegen_ (against), _gegenüber_ (opposite), _mit_ (with), _nach_ (after, to), _seit_ (since), _von_ (from), and _zu_ (at, in, to). Some other prepositions (_an_ [at], _auf_ [on], _entlang_ [along], _hinter_ [behind], _in_ [in, into], _neben_ (beside, next to), _über_ [over, across], _unter_ [under, below], _vor_ [in front of], and _zwischen_ [among, between]) may be used with dative (indicating current location), or accusative (indicating direction toward something). _Das Buch liegt auf DEM Tisch(e)_ (dative: The book is lying on the table), but _Ich lege das Buch auf DEN Tisch_ (accusative: I put the book onto the table).

In addition the four prepositions _[an]statt_ (in place of), _trotz_ (in spite of), _während_ (during), and _wegen_ (because of) which require the genitive in modern formal language, are most commonly used with the dative in colloquial German. For example, "because of the weather" is expressed as _wegen dem Wetter_ instead of the formally correct _wegen des Wetters_. Other prepositions requiring the genitive in formal language, are combined with _von_ ("of") in colloquial style, e.g. _außerhalb vom Garten_ instead of _außerhalb des Gartens_ ("outside the garden").

Note that the concept of an indirect object may be rendered by a prepositional phrase. In this case, the noun's or pronoun's case is determined by the preposition, NOT by its function in the sentence. Consider this sentence:

-   _Ich sandte das Buch zum Verleger._ 'I sent the book to the editor.'

Here, the subject, _Ich_, is in the nominative case, the direct object, _das Buch_, is in the accusative case, and _zum Verleger_ is in the dative case, since _zu_ always requires the dative (_zum_ is a contraction of _zu_ + _dem_). However:

-   _Ich habe das Buch an meinen Freund (_accusative_) weitergegeben._ 'I forwarded the book to my friend.' (_weitergeben_ = lit.: to give further).

In this sentence, _Freund_ is the indirect object, but, because it follows _an_ (direction), the accusative is required, not the dative.

All of the articles change in the dative case.

                       Masculine   Feminine   Neuter   Plural
  -------------------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Definite article     dem         der        dem      den
  Indefinite article   einem       einer      einem    Ø (the semantically closest word would be EINIGEN, dative plural of einig)
  Negative articles    keinem      keiner     keinem   keinen

Some German verbs require the dative for their direct objects. Common examples are _antworten_ (to answer), _danken_ (to thank), _gefallen_ (to please), _folgen_ (to follow), _glauben_ (to believe), _helfen_ (to help), and _raten_ (to advise). In each case, the direct object of the verb is rendered in the dative. For example:

-   Meine Freunde helfen _mir_. (My friends help me.)

These verbs cannot be used in normal passive constructions, because German allows these only for verbs with accusative objects. It is therefore ungrammatical to say: *_Ich werde geholfen._ "I am helped." Instead a special construction called "impersonal passive" must be used: _Mir wird geholfen_, literally: "To me is helped." A colloquial (non-standard) and rarely used way to form the passive voice for dative verbs is the following: _Ich kriege geholfen_, or: _Ich bekomme geholfen_, literally: "I GET helped". The use of the verb "to get" here reminds us that the dative case has something to do with giving and receiving. In German, help is not something you _perform on_ somebody, but rather something you _offer_ them.

The dative case is also used with reflexive (_sich_) verbs when specifying what part of the self the verb is being done to:

-   Ich wasche _mich_. – accusative (I wash myself.)
-   Ich wasche _mir die Hände_. – dative (I wash my hands, literally "I wash for myself the hands")

Cf. the respective _accord_ in French: "Les enfants se sont lavé_S_" (_the children have washed themselves_) vs. "Les enfants se sont lavé" [uninflected] "les mains" (_... their hands_).

German can use two datives to make sentences like: _Sei mir meinem Sohn(e) gnädig!_ "For my sake, have mercy on my son!" Literally: "Be for me to my son merciful." The first dative _mir_ ("for me") expresses the speaker's commiseration (much like the _dativus ethicus_ in Latin, see below). The second dative _meinem Sohn(e)_ ("to my son") names the actual object of the plea. Mercy is to be given _to_ the son _for_ or _on behalf of_ his mother/father.

Adjective endings also change in the dative case. There are three inflection possibilities depending on what precedes the adjective. They most commonly use _weak inflection_ when preceded by a definite article (the), _mixed inflection_ after an indefinite article (a/an), and _strong inflection_ when a quantity is indicated (many green apples).

  Adj. in dative case   Masculine   Feminine   Neuter   Plural
  --------------------- ----------- ---------- -------- --------
  Weak inflection       -en         -en        -en      -en
  Mixed inflection      -en         -en        -en      -en
  Strong inflection     -_em_       -_er_      -_em_    -en


Latin

There are several uses for the dative case (_Dativus_):

-   _Dativus finalis_ (DATIVE OF PURPOSE), e.g. _non scholae sed vitae_ – "[we learn] not for school, but for life", _auxilio vocare_ – "to call for help", _venio auxilio_ – "I'm coming for help", _accipio dono_ – "I receive [this] as a gift" or _puellae ornamento est_ – "[this] is for the girl's decoration", or "... for decoration for the girl" (as _puellae_ could be either dative or genitive)
-   _Dativus commŏdi (incommodi)_, which means action for (or against) somebody, e.g., _Graecis agros colere_ – "to till fields for Greeks"; Combination of Dativus commodi and finalis (double dative): _tibi laetitiae_ "to you for joy"
-   _Dativus possessivus_ (POSSESSIVE DATIVE) which means possession, e.g. _angelis alae sunt_ – literally "to (or for) the angels are wings", this is typically found with a copula and translated as "angels have wings".
-   _Dativus ethicus_ (ETHIC DATIVE) indicates that the person in the dative is or should be especially concerned about the action, e.g. _Quid mihi Celsus agit?_ "What is Celsus doing for me?" (expressing the speaker being especially interested in what Celsus is doing for him or her);[6] or _Cui prodest?_ "Whose interest does this serve?" (literally "To whom does this do good?")
-   _Dativus auctoris_, meaning; 'in the eyes of', e.g., 'vir bonus mihi videtur' 'he seems to me to be a good man'.
-   The dative expresses agency with the gerundive when the gerundive is used to convey obligation or necessity,[7] e.g., 'haec nobis agenda sunt,' 'these things must be done by us.'


Greek

Ancient

In addition to its main function as the _dativus_, the dative case has other functions in Classical Greek:[8] (The chart below uses the Latin names for the types of dative; the Greek name for the dative is δωτική πτῶσις, like its Latin equivalent, derived from the verb "to give"; in Ancient Greek, δίδωμι.)

-   Dativus finalis: The _dativus finalis_, or the 'dative of purpose', is when the dative is used to denote _the purpose_ of a certain action. For example:
    -   ""
        -   "I fight FOR THE KING".
    -   ""
        -   "I die FOR HONOUR".
-   Dativus commŏdi (incommodi): The _dativus commodi sive incommodi_, or the 'dative of benefit (or harm)' is the dative that expresses the advantage or disadvantage of something _for someone_. For example:
    -   _For the benefit of_: "" (Sophocles, _Ajax_ 1366).
        -   "Every man toils FOR HIMSELF".
    -   _For the harm or disadvantage of_: "" (Thucydides 2.12.4).
        -   "This day will be the beginning of great sorrows FOR THE GREEKS (i.e., for their disadvantage)".
-   Dativus possessivus: The _dativus possessivus_, or the 'dative of possession' is the dative used to denote _the possessor_ of a certain object or objects. For example:
    -   "" (Thucycdides 1.86.3).
        -   "For OTHERS HAVE a lot of money and ships and horses, but we have good allies (i.e., To others there is a lot of money...)".
-   Dativus ethicus: The _dativus ethicus_, or the 'ethic or polite dative,' is when the dative is used to signify that the person or thing spoken of is regarded with interest by someone. This dative is mostly, if not exclusively, used in pronouns. As such, it is also called the "dative of pronouns." For example:
    -   "" (Demosthenes 18.178).
        -   "Pay close attention to this, I BEG YOU (i.e., please pay..)".
    -   "" (Xenophon, _Cyropaedia_ 18.178).
        -   "Oh, mother, how handsome grandpa is (I'VE JUST REALIZED!)".
-   Dativus auctoris: The _dativus auctoris_, or the 'dative of agent,' is the dative used to denote _the doer_ of an action. Note, however, that in Classical Greek, the agent is usually in the genitive after (by, at the hands of). The agent is in the dative only with the perfect and pluperfect passive, and after the verbal adjective in . For example:
    -   "" (Isocrates 8.39)
        -   "Many cures have been discovered BY DOCTORS."
-   Dativus instrumenti: The _dativus instrumenti_, or the 'dative of instrument,' is when the dative is used to denote an instrument or means of a certain action (or, more accurately, as the instrumental case). For example:
    -   "." (Homer, _Odyssey_ 9.407)
        -   "He kills me WITH A BAIT (i.e., by means of a bait)."
-   Dativus modi: The _dativus modi_, or the 'dative of manner,' is the dative used to describe _the manner or way_ by which something happened. For example:
    -   "" (Thucydides 8.84)
        -   "having died OF (FROM) A DISEASE."
-   Dativus mensurae: The _dativus mensurae_, or the 'dative of measurement,' is the dative used to denote _the measurement of difference_. For example:
    -   "" (Plato, _Phaedo_ 101a)
        -   "taller BY A HEAD."
    -   "" (Plato, _Laws_ 729d)
        -   "BY FAR the best."

Modern

The dative case, strictly speaking, no longer exists in Modern Greek, except in fossilized expressions like δόξα τω Θεώ (from the ecclesiastical τῷ Θεῷ δόξα, "Glory to God") or εν τάξει (ἑν τάξει, lit. "in order", i.e. "all right" or "OK"). Otherwise, most of the functions of the dative have been subsumed in the accusative.


Slavic languages

In Russian, the dative case is used for indicating the indirect object of an action (that to which something is given, thrown, read, etc.). In the instance where a person is the goal of motion, dative is used instead of accusative to indicate motion toward. This is usually achieved with the preposition _κ_ + destination in dative case; _К врачу_, meaning "to the doctor."

Dative is also the necessary case taken by certain prepositions when expressing certain ideas. For instance, when the preposition _по_ is used to mean "along," its object is always in dative case, as in _По бокам_, meaning "along the sides."

Other Slavic languages apply the dative case (and the other cases) more or less the same way as does Russian; some languages may use the dative in other ways. The following examples are from Polish:

-   after certain verbs (dziękować KOMUŚ "to thank someone", pomóc KOMUŚ "to help someone", wierzyć KOMUŚ "to believe someone")
-   in certain expressions (Czy podoba CI się piosenka? "Do you like the song?", Jest MI zimno "I'm cold", Jest NAM smutno "We're feeling sad", Będzie WAM trudniej... "It will be more difficult for you guys"), Śniło JEJ się, że... "She dreamt that"
-   _dativus commodi_ to indicate action for somebody (Zbuduję tEMU człowiekOWI dom "I will build a house for this person")
-   when something is taken away or something occurs to someone (Zdechł IM pies "Their dog died"; Zabrali MU komputer "They took away his computer"; Zepsuł NAM się samochód "Our car broke down"; Coś MI się przypomniało "I just remembered something")

Some other kinds of dative use as found in the Serbo-Croatian language are: _Dativus finalis_ (TITANIKU u pomoć "to Titanic's rescue"), _Dativus commodi/incommodi_ (Operi SVOJOJ MAJCI suđe "Wash the dishes for your mother"), _Dativus possessivus_ (OVCAMA je dlaka gusta "Sheep's hair is thick"), _Dativus ethicus_ (Šta MI radi Boni? "What is Boni doing? (I am especially interested in what it is)") and Dativus auctoris (Izgleda MI okej "It seems okay to me").

Unusual in other Indo-European branches but common among Slavic languages, endings of nouns and adjectives are different based on grammatical function. Other factors are gender and number. In some cases, the ending may not be obvious, even when those three factors (function, gender, number) are considered. For example, in Polish, 'SYN' ("son") and 'OJCIEC' ("father") are both masculine singular nouns, yet appear as _syn → synOWI_ and _ojciec → ojcU_ in the dative.


Baltic languages

Both Lithuanian and Latvian have a distinct dative case in the system of nominal declensions.

Lithuanian nouns preserve Indo-European inflections in the dative case fairly well: (o-stems) vaikas -> sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; (ā-stems) ranka -> sg. rankai, pl. rankoms; (i-stems) viltis -> sg. vilčiai, pl. viltims; (u-stems) sūnus -> sg. sūnui, pl. sūnums; (consonant stems) vanduo -> sg. vandeniui, pl. vandenims.

Adjectives in the dative case receive pronominal endings (this might be the result of a more recent development): tas geras vaikas -> sg. tAM gerAM vaikui, pl. tIEMS gerIEMS vaikams.

The dative case in Latvian underwent further simplifications – the original masculine endings of _both_ nouns and adjectives have been replaced with pronominal inflections: tas vīrs -> sg. tam vīram, pl. vīriem. Also, the final "s" in all Dative forms has been dropped. The only exception is personal pronouns in the plural: mumS (to us), jumS (to you). Note that in colloquial Lithuanian the final "s" in the dative is often omitted, as well: time geriem vaikam.

In both Latvian and Lithuanian, the main function of the dative case is to render the indirect object in a sentence: (lt) aš duodu vyrui knygą; (lv) es dodu [duodu] vīram grāmatu – _I am giving a book to the man_.

The dative case can also be used with gerundives to indicate an action preceding or simultaneous with the main action in a sentence: (lt) jam įėjus, visi atsistojo – _when he walked in, everybody stood up_, lit. _to him having walked in, all stood up_; (lt) jai miegant, visi dirbo – _while she slept, everybody was working_, lit. _to her sleeping, all were working_.

In modern standard Lithuanian, Dative case is not required by prepositions, although in many dialects it is done frequently: (dial.) iki (+D) šiai dienai, (stand.) iki (+G) šios dienos – _up until this day_.

In Latvian, the dative case is taken by several prepositions in the singular and ALL prepositions in the plural (due to peculiar historical changes): sg. bez (+G) tevis _(without thee)_ ~ pl. bez (+D) jums _(without you)_; sg. pa (+A) ceļu _(along the road)_ ~ pl. pa (+D) ceļiem _(along the roads)_.


Armenian

In modern Eastern Armenian, the dative is attained by adding any article to the genitive:

_dog_ = շուն

GEN > շան _(of the dog; dog's)_ with no articles

DAT > շանԸ or շանՆ _(to the dog)_ with definite articles (-ն if preceding a vowel)

DAT > ՄԻ շան _(to a dog)_ with indefinite article

DAT > շանՍ _(to my dog)_ with 1st person possessive article

DAT > շանԴ _(to your dog)_ with 2nd person possessive article

There is a general tendency to view -ին as the standard dative suffix, but only because that is its most productive (and therefore common) form. The suffix -ին as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -ի accompanied by the definite article -ն. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -ին:

Definite DAT > Ես գիրքը տվեցի ՏՂԱՅԻՆ: _(I gave the book TO THE BOY)_

Indefinite DAT> Ես գիրքը տվեցի ՄԻ ՏՂԱՅԻ: _(I gave the book TO A BOY)_

The main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition _to_. In the use of "giving" verbs like _give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring..._ the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like _tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer..._ the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are _show, reach, look, approach..._

Eastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition _at_, as in _Meet me at nine o' clock._


Sanskrit

The dative case is known as the "fourth case" (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object.


Non-Indo-European languages

Hungarian

As with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, _DÁNIELNEK adtam ezt a könyvet_ (I gave this book TO DÁNIEL).

It has two suffixes, _-nak_ and _-nek_; the correct one is selected by vowel harmony. The personal dative pronouns follow the _-nek_ version: _nekem_, _neked_, etc.

This case is also used to express "for" in certain circumstances, such as "I bought a gift for Mother".

In possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is NOT the dative form (rather, the attributive or possessive case)[9]

Finnish

Finnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the allative case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: ''He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa KÖYHILLE (They donated all their money TO THE POOR.)

Tsez

In the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the dative also takes the functions of the lative case in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb "show" (literally: "make see") is given below:

    {| style="border: 1px solid black;"

| colspan = 4 align="center"|КИДБĀ УЖИХЪОР КIЕТIУ БИКВАРХО. |- |_kidb-ā_||_uži-qo-r_||_kʼetʼu_||_b-ikʷa-r-xo_ |- |girl:OBL-ERG||boy-POSS-DAT/LAT||cat:[III]:ABS||III-see-CAUS-PRES |- | colspan = 4 align="center"|"The girl shows the cat to the boy." |}

The dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as "to have".

    {| style="border: 1px solid black;"

| colspan = 4 align="center"|КИДБЕХЪОР КIЕТIУ ЗОВСИ. |- |_kidbe-qo-r_||_kʼetʼu_||_zow-si_ |- |girl:OBL-POSS-DAT/LAT||cat:ABS||be:PST-PST |- | colspan = 3 align="center"|"The girl had a cat." |} As in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.

Verbs of perception or emotion (like "see", "know", "love", "want") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case. Note that in this example the "pure" dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used.

    {| style="border: 1px solid black;"

| colspan = 4 align="center"|ГIАЛИР ПАТIИ ЙЕТИХ. |- |_ʻAli-r_||_Patʼi_||_y-eti-x_ |- |Ali-DAT/LAT||Fatima:[II]:ABS||II-love-PRES |- | colspan = 3 align="center"|"Ali loves Fatima." |}
