JOE (JOE.IE and JOE.CO.UK) is a news website aimed at young men in Ireland and the UK, with over 2 million unique visitors per month.[1] It is owned by Maximum Media.[2][3][4][5][6] The original website www.joe.ie was founded by Irish entrepreneur Niall McGarry.[7][8] HER.IE is a related website aimed at young women in Ireland. HERFAMILY.IE also forms part of the group.[9]


JOE.ie

The site was founded in 2010 and it was nominated for a Golden Spider Award in the _One to Watch_ category in its first year and in the _News and Entertainment_ category in 2013.[10][11][12] Showbiz website Goss.ie described it as "more influential" than traditional media in August 2016.[13] It is edited by Paddy McKenna.[14] The site's android app has had over 50,000 installs.[15] In November 2016, The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland upheld a complaint about an ad for Sprite featured on the site.[16]

SportsJOE.ie

SportsJOE.ie was launched in 2014, as an offshoot of JOE.ie, offering "in-depth analysis".[17] _Daily Telegraph_ and _Sunday Independent_ sports columnist Dion Fanning moved to the site in 2015.[18][19]


JOE.co.uk

The millennial[20] and "men, not lads" site was launched in September 2015 with Tony Barrett of _The Times_ and former footballer Ledley King among the contributors.[21][22][23][24]

BBC political researcher Joey D'Urso cited content from Joe.co.uk, such as a video superimposing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's face onto that of the rapper Stormzy while the leader appears "to rap a list of policies", as an example of viral social media content which helped Labour's standing in the 2017 general election (especially among the youth), but which was not directly funded by the party itself.[25]
