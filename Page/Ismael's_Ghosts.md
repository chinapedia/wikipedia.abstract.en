Production

In _Ismael's Ghosts_, Mathieu Amalric portrays a recurring character named Ismaël Vuillard, who appeared in Arnaud Desplechin's _Kings and Queen_.[6] The name of Marion Cotillard's character, Carlotta, derives from Alfred Hitchcock's film _Vertigo_.[7] The title of the film is an homage to Norman Mailer's novel _Harlot's Ghost_.[8] Bob Dylan's song _It Ain't Me Babe_ was used in a scene from the film.[9] The film includes quotes from Jacques Lacan's _Seminar VIII_, Rainer Maria Rilke's _Schlaflied_, and Philip Roth's _American Pastoral_.[10]


Release

Cannes_2017_4.jpg On 17 May 2017, the film premiered as the opening film at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.[11] At the Cannes, the film screened in a 114-minute version.[12] In the United States, it screened in a 135-minute "director's cut" version.[13] In France, the film was released in the shorter version at the big theaters and in the longer version at the art house theaters.[14] At the Cannes' press conference, Arnaud Desplechin stated that the former one is "more sentimental" and the later one is "more intellectual".[15] The film also screened at the Vancouver International Film Festival,[16] the New York Film Festival,[17] and the Philadelphia Film Festival.[18]


Reception

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 52% based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 5.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "_Ismael's Ghosts_ unites an excellent cast — and their valiant efforts are often enough to counter its somewhat confused and disjointed story."[19] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 65 based on 23 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[20]

Sam C. Mac of _Slant Magazine_ gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it "one of Desplechin's most emphatic expressions of his personal, ever-expanding artistic vision."[21] David Parkinson of _Empire_ gave the film 3 stars out of 5, saying, "even those without the foggiest about what they're watching will have to admit that the performances are compelling, and the prospect that the pieces will defy logic and slot into place remains enticing."[22] Boyd van Hoeij of _The Hollywood Reporter_ wrote: "The film's various storylines wouldn't hold together as well as they do if there weren't an overarching theme that ties everything together, with _Ismael's Ghosts_ finally becoming a study about how our identities are constantly being shaped by outside forces that may forever be beyond our control, however much we try — and sometimes fail — to remain centered."[23]
