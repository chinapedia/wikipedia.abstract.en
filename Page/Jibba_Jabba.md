JIBBA JABBA was a British pre-school television series which aired on the children's block Tiny Living on the channel Living TV.[1]

The series is a computer animation series consisting of 32 five-minute episodes. It centers around two friends, 'Mo' and 'Max'. In each episode one character approaches a tree-house containing a dressing up box for Mo or Max to become a part of the story told in the episode. The stories told would often be a reenactment of a famous fairy tale or rhyme. Each episode included audience participation from children, calling out or responding. The series was presented and narrated by a puppet called 'Dog', as seen on sister show _Tiny and Crew_. Dog also provided in-vision presentation for the channel's Tiny Living strand.
