_ANOTHER FALL FROM GRACE_ is the eleventh studio album by The Mission.

Wayne Hussey has described the album as a lost link between The Sisters of Mercy's _First and Last and Always_ album and The Mission's own first album, _God's Own Medicine_. He attributes this in part to his use of the 12-string guitar which he fell out of favour with after _God's Own Medicine_ was released.[1]
