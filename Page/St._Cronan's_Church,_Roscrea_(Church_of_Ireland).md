ST. CRONAN'S CHURCH is a 19th-century Church of Ireland church in Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ireland. The church was constructed in 1812 on the site of the original 12th century Romanesque church. The grounds include a graveyard and a replica high cross, enclosed by a rubble stone wall, cast iron gate and railings.[1] Roscrea_St._Cronan's_Anglican_Parish_Church_Tower_and_Portal_2010_09_03.jpg


Original church

The grounds include part of a 12th-century Romanesque church which was demolished in 1812 to make way for the construction of the current church. Only the western gable of the original church remains, including a bell-cot which was added at a later date. Stones and material from the original church were used for the new building.[2][3][4] The original church is registered as National Monument number 126.[5] Roscrea_St._Cronan's_Romanesque_Church_2010_09_03.jpg


Current church design

The modern church was designed by local architect James Sheane, whose name is inscribed on a datestone in the tower and who was buried in the churchyard upon his death in 1816.[6] A porch was later added by John Bowden. The church was restored in 1879 by Thomas Newenham Deane.[7] The original construction was funded by the Board of First Fruits with a gift of £100 and a loan of £775.[8]

It is a detached, single-cell, gable-fronted church. The pitched roof is covered with artificial slate. There are 5 bays on each side of the nave which features Gothic pointed-arch stained glass windows, with a vestry to the south east, and a porch and 4-stage bell tower to the south west. The string coursed sandstone walls and tower feature crenellation and pinnacles, as well as diagonal buttresses and pinnacles on the porch. The pointed-arch main doorway holds a timber battened double-leaf door.[9]


Preservation

The church has been renovated several times, including a large renovation in the 1960s when the slate roof was replaced, the interior was redecorated, and the graveyard was deforested.

Its most notable historical artefact is a 17th-century pre-Reformation silver chalice decorated with raised angelic figures. The chalice may have been used at a wedding as the letters _S.C. M.P._, thought to be the initials of the couple, are inscribed on the base.[10]
