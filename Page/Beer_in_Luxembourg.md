Luxembourg has a long tradition of beer brewing, dating back to at least 1300.[1] Although there used to be more than 12 local breweries in Luxembourg in the early 1950s, this number has come down to only three big breweries remaining in the early 2010s.[2] The three big breweries still active today are: Brasserie Nationale, producing _Bofferding_ and _Battin_, Brasserie de Luxembourg (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev), producing _Diekirch_ and _Mousel_, and Brasserie Simon, producing _Simon_ and _Ourdaller_ (and _Okult_).

Although there has been a resurgence of several minor breweries in Luxembourg during the early 2000s (mostly local microbreweries producing craft beer), the largest brewery still remains Brasserie Nationale whose brands _Bofferding_ and _Battin_ together make up for 58% of Luxembourg's beer consumption as of 2013.[3] The main beer in Luxembourg is lager, drunk in over 95% of the cases.


History

The first beer brewery in Luxembourg was probably established around 1300 by monks in Neumünster Abbey, in the Grund district in Luxembourg City.[4]
