The OUR LADY OF MOUNT CARMEL CHURCH[1] () It is a Catholic church located in Gatchina, near St. Petersburg in northwest Russia.[2][3]


History

The Catholic parish of Gatchina decided to build a church dedicated to the Our Lady of Mount Carmel in 1906. The project was assigned to Lev Chichko, and construction continued until 1911 with the collaboration of Leonid Kharlamov and Alexander Baryshnikov. The neo-Gothic church was consecrated by Bishop Jan Cieplak the November 13, 1911, and depended on the parish of St. Catherine in St. Petersburg. It closes in 1937 during the Communist government, and this was confirmed in 1939, to become a bakery and after the war, which was badly damaged in a garage.

The Catholic parish of Gatchina was reborn in 1992 and met in a rented room. The church returned to the parish in 1994, but the first Masses are held in 1996, and episodically, for the church is not ready to welcome the faithful there. The parish is run by a Salesian priest.
