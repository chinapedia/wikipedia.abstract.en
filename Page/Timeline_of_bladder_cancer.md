  ------------- --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  1854          Discovery       Inverted papilloma (a tumor that may occur in the bladder and other components of the urinary tract) is first described.[8]
  1877          Development     German urologist Maximilian Nitze develops the cystoscope, a device used to perform endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra.[9]
  1887          Treatment       The first cystectomy for bladder cancer is performed.[10]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Cologne, Germany
  1895          Discovery       Link between bladder cancer and environmental carcinogens is first postulated.[11]
  1902          Organization    The American Urological Association is founded.[12]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Linthicum, Maryland, United States
  1903          Treatment       Radium is first used to treat bladder tumors.[13]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       United States
  1911          Discovery       Schistosomiasis is first linked to urinary bladder cancer.[14]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Egypt
  1929          Discovery       Research notes that patients with tuberculosis have lower rates of cancer when examined at autopsy. This observation is among the first to link the possibility of bladder cancer treatment with BCG.[15]
  1945          Development     Urine cytology (a test used to diagnose urinary tract cancers) is first described.[16]
  1952          Discovery       Transitional cell carcinoma in situ of the bladder is first described.[17]
  1956          Treatment       Early bladder removal surgery is introduced. This include surgically removing the bladder (cystectomy) and surrounding tissue where cancer is most likely to spread.[18]
  1974          Discovery       Research ties sharp increase in bladder cancer deaths among British men to the rapid rise in cigarette smoking during prior decades.[19]                                                                                                                                                                                                                United Kingdom
  1978          Treatment       United States FDA approves the first chemotherapy drug cisplatin for bladder cancer.[20]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                United States
  1980–1985     Treatment       Reconstructive bladder surgery is found to improve quality of life. Surgeons begin to offer a _neobladder_ to select patients needing surgery (cystectomy) for bladder cancer. This procedure provides a functional replacement for the bladder using tissue fashioned from the small bowel that allows the passage of urine through the urethra.[21]
  1982          Discovery       Micropapillary bladder cancer (a rare and aggressive variant of urothelial carcinoma) is first described.[22]
  1985          Treatment       Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combining methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) is first described. MVAC is one of the most active chemotherapy regimens for bladder cancer.[23]
  1985–1989     Treatment       Researchers map out the nerves surrounding the bladder and prostate and develop a new surgical technique that spares key nerves involved in male sexual function, thus preserving it.[24]
  1987          Treatment       Implant treats bladder cancer without surgery. The procedure involves implanting radioactive sources into cancerous tumors within the bladder.[25]                                                                                                                                                                                                      United States
  1988          Discovery       Intravesical chemotherapy using mitomycin is found to reduce risk of bladder cancer's return.[26]
  1990          Treatment       United States FDA approved the use of live bacterium, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for superficial bladder cancer. BCG immunotherapy helps reduce the risk of bladder cancer recurrence by stimulating an immune response that targets the bacteria as well as any bladder cancer cells.[27]                                                          United States
  1997          Treatment       Introduction of combination therapy using both radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy together, is found to be a new treatment alternative for patients with advanced bladder cancer who are older or otherwise unable to undergo bladder surgery.[28]
  2000          Treatment       New chemotherapy combination regimen using gemcitabine together with cisplatin is found to be comparably effective but has relatively fewer side effects than standard MVAC therapy.[29]
  2002          Report          Approximately 356,000 new bladder cancer cases worldwide are reported.[30]
  2003          Treatment       Research demonstrates that giving chemotherapy before bladder surgery improves survival for patients whose cancer has not spread significantly beyond the bladder, compared with surgery alone.[31]
  2009          Organization    Bladder Cancer Canada is formed as a patient advocacy organization dedicated to bladder cancer issues.[32]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Canada
  2016          Discovery       Study suggests that alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment of the bladder, especially type I collagen, may contribute to bladder cancer progression.[33]                                                                                                                                                                        Houston, Texas, United States
  2016          Development     New technology helps doctors detect cancerous tumors in the bladder that are invisible to the naked eye.[34]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Murray, Utah, United States
