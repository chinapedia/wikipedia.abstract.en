The 2018 EUROPEAN KORFBALL B-CHAMPIONSHIP is held in the Netherlands from 13 to 21 October 2018. Matches are played in Drachten, Gorredijk, Heerenveen and Leeuwarden. It is the first edition where the European Korfball Championship is split into an A-Championship and a B-Championship, with the idea that a certain number of teams will relegate from the A-Championship to the B-Championship after each edition, and a certain number of teams from the B-Championship will be promoted. Whether this will be a direct promotion or relegation, or whether play-offs will need to be played, is yet to be determined. The tournament was originally scheduled to be played by eight teams, but following a late withdrawal by Turkey, only seven teams took part.

The top two finishers will qualify for the 2019 IKF World Korfball Championship.

Group stage

The eight teams are divided into two groups of four, with all teams progressing to the quarter-finals. The groups are named C and D to distinguish them from Groups A and B of teams playing in the 2018 IKF European Korfball A-Championship, held at the same time and location as the 2018 IKF European Korfball B-Championship.

Intermediate stage

Following the group stage, an intermediate round is held, featuring the group winners and the teams finishing last in the group stage of the A-Championship. The winners will continue in the A-Championship knockout stage, the losers move or remain in the B-Championship knockout stage. As 10 nations from Europe qualify for the 2019 IKF World Korfball Championship, the winners of these matches qualified for the 2019 IKF World Korfball Championship by virtue of being sure to finish in the top 8. The losing teams might still qualify.


Knockout stage

Main bracket

Consolation bracket

Due to the late cancellation of Turkey, only three teams were available to play for the last places. The three losing teams from the quarterfinals would play a round-robin system, playing each other once. France and Serbia were first matched against each other, with the loser playing Scotland to determine last place. The winners of the first two matches then met to determine the fifth and sixth place finisher. {{#invoke:RoundN|N8 |RD1 = Consolation Match |RD2 = Match to determine last place |RD3 = 5th-6th place match |flex_tree=yes |skipmatch = 2-4 |omit_blanks = yes |3rdplace = no |bold_winner = high |||16||13 |node_function{line} | ||22||21 | ||15 ||14 }}
