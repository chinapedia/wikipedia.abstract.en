MUHAMMAD ALIM is an Indonesian judge and a former justice on the Constitutional Court of Indonesia. A career judge, Alim was appointed to the Constitutional Court by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia Bagir Manan in 2008.[1] Alim earned his undergraduate degree from Hasanuddin University in his home province of South Sulawesi, and his master's degree and PhD in constitutional law from the Islamic University of Indonesia in Yogyakarta.[2]

Alim served on one of three panels set up by the Constitutional Court to investigate former presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo's complaint in the Indonesian presidential election, 2014, serving on the panel alongside fellow justices Hamdan Zoelva (the panel chairman) and Wahiduddin Adams.[3] Alim delivered the majority opinion of the court that the key claims of Subianto's claims were without merit, delivering a 4,300 page report after day-long hearings.[4] He also delivered the court's opinion that the Government of Indonesia doesn't own customary forests, which are separate from state forests, and that the rights of indigenous peoples over customary forests must be protected.[5]

Alim has also held dissenting opinions from the rest of the court. In 2009, he and two other justices held the minority opinion that cigarette advertisements shouldn't be allowed on television channels or billboards due to the harm they can cause to children.[6]
