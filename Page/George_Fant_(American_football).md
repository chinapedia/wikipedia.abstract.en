Football career

Throughout his first four years at Western Kentucky, friends and coaches urged Fant to join the Hilltopper's football team but he refused. He received letters from multiple NFL teams in spring 2015 asking if he were interested in giving professional football a chance but disregarded the letters and threw them away.[3] Fant decided to transition to football after weighing his options of either playing basketball overseas in Poland or attempting a football career. With a wife and child to care for, he chose football. Western Kentucky tight ends Tyler Higbee and Devin Scott helped him learn the tight end position and tight ends coach Ryan Wallace also worked with him. He bulked up from 250 lbs to 296 lbs for football.[4] Fant also said that he studied many tapes of another basketball-to-football convert, tight end Jimmy Graham.[5]

Fant used his fifth year of eligibility to join the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team as a tight end.[6] For the season, he appeared in two games, recording one reception for seven yards, as well as two tackles.[7]


Professional career

Fant was expected to go undrafted after playing only a single year of playing tight end at the collegiate football level. Due to his limited experience, Fant was not one of the 15 collegiate tight ends to attend the NFL Scouting Combine. On March 29, 2016, he attended Western Kentucky's pro day, along with Brandon Doughty, Tyler Higbee, Prince Charles Iworah, and 11 other prospects. Fant was listed as an offensive lineman during WKU's pro day and weighed in at 296 lbs, 26 lbs heavier than his playing weight of 270 lbs during the season.[8] He impressed the Seahawks' co-director of player personnel Trent Kirchner with his athletic ability and worked out at multiple positions including: linebacker, defensive end, defensive tackle, tight end, and offensive tackle. Although he didn't have game film, he was able to impress enough with his athletic ability and size that the Seahawks signed him solely based on a single workout. Offensive line coach Tom Cable had to make the decision between Fant and another offensive line prospect but chose Fant because he was a "long-armed athlete".[9][10]

2016

Fant signed with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent on May 6, 2016.[11]

Throughout training camp he learned the offensive tackle position quickly and did well enough to win the backup left tackle job behind Bradley Sowell to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular-season debut on October 23, 2016, and played 24 snaps after Sowell sprained his knee during the 6–6 tie with the Arizona Cardinals. He made his first career start during Week 8 against the New Orleans Saints after Sowell was still unable to play due to injury.[12][13] Fant committed two clipping penalties in his first two starts and also committed a false start.

He is the third player that Tom Cable has successfully transitioned into an offensive lineman with little or no collegiate experience at the position. The Seahawks' starting right tackle, Garry Gilliam, was undrafted with only a single year of collegiate experience as a lineman and started in seven months. The first player was J. R. Sweezy, who had no experience, playing only defensive end in college. He transitioned to guard successfully in five months. Fant is the most dramatic change, earning the starting left tackle position in less than 20 months.[14]

On November 13, 2016, he made his third career start against the New England Patriots and was credited with not committing a single assignment error in the Seahawks' 31–24 victory. He ultimately did well enough in his first four career starts that he remained the starter at left tackle once Sowell returned from his injury.[15] He played the last ten consecutive games of the season as the Seattle Seahawks' starting left tackle and finished his rookie season appearing in 14 games with ten starts.[16]

2017

In the second game of the 2017 preseason, Fant tore his ACL and was ruled out for the season.[17] He was placed on injured reserve on September 2, 2017.[18]

2018

After rookie tight end Will Dissly got injured in a week 4 matchup with the Arizona Cardinals Fant started to play an offensive tackle/tight end hybrid role. Fant has had great success in this new role helping the Seahawks achieve the number one ranked rushing offense in the league.

On December 10, 2018, in a week 13 Monday Night Football matchup against the Minnesota Vikings Fant recorded his first career reception, a 9-yard pass from quarterback Russell Wilson.[19]


Personal life

Fant is married to former Western Kentucky women's basketball player Chastity Gooch and has two children with her. His son, Jayden Fant, was born shortly before his workout with the Seahawks and his second son was born in the spring of 2017.[20][21][22]
