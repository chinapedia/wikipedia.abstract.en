"I HATE THE MUSIC" is an pop song written by George Young and Harry Vanda and recorded by Australian pop singer John Paul Young. The song was released in March 1976 as the lead single from the singer's second studio album, _J.P.Y._ (1976). It peaked at number 2 on the Kent Music Report in Australia, remaining on the chart for 20 weeks.[1] It was certified gold in Australia for shipment of 35000 units.[2][3] It reached number 1 on the South African singles chart.[4]

In 1998, the song was covered by Ratcat and John Paul Young for the _Occasional Coarse Language_ soundtrack.


Background

The song was inspired by a conversation with George Young and Harry Vanda in the Boomerang House elevator after a day in the studio. The conversation involved George's general frustration with a song that he couldn't get to sound right. The song originally had a banjo introduction but was changed to a piano.[5]
