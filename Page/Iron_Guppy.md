Tug_pushing_a_barge_-c.jpg.]] The _IRON GUPPY_ is a tugboat, built in 2016, and owned and operated by Ports Toronto.[1][2] She replaced the _William Rest_, a tugboat that served in Ports Toronto, and its predecessor agencies, since 1961. The _Iron Guppy_ has very similar operational characteristics as the _William Rest_, however, with modern electronics.[3]

The _Iron Guppy_ is a single screw tug, capable of breaking ice up to thick.[4][5][6]

Ports Toronto called upon elementary school students to help pick the vessel's name.[7]

The vessel was designed by Robert Allan Limited, ship architects, and built by Hike Metals of Wheatley, Ontario.

Fireboat _William Lyon MacKenzie_ gave the _Iron Guppy_ a ceremonial shower, to mark her commissioning, on July 23, 2016.[8]
