CLIVE BARKER (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, and visual artist. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the _Books of Blood_, which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the _Hellraiser_ and _Candyman_ series. He was also the executive producer of the film _Gods and Monsters_.

Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States as well as within his own books. He has created original characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been adapted to comics.


Early life

Barker was born in Liverpool, the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm.[1][2] He was educated at Dovedale Primary School, Quarry Bank High School and the University of Liverpool, where he studied English and Philosophy.[3]

When he was three years old, Barker witnessed the French skydiver Léo Valentin plummet to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.[4]


Writing career

Barker is an author of horror/fantasy. He began writing horror early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in _Books of Blood_ 1–6) and the Faustian novel _The Damnation Game_ (1985). Later he moved towards modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in _Weaveworld_ (1987), _The Great and Secret Show_ (1989), the world-spanning _Imajica_ (1991), and _Sacrament_ (1996).

When _Books of Blood_ were first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was quoted on the book covers: "I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker."[5] As influences on his writing, Barker lists Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Ray Bradbury, William S. Burroughs, William Blake, and Jean Cocteau, among others.[6]

He is the writer of the best-selling Abarat series, and plans on producing two more novels in the series.[7]


Personal life

In 2003, Barker received the Davidson/Valentini Award at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards.[8]

Barker has been critical of organized religion throughout his career, but in early interviews, he stated that the Bible influences his work and spirituality.[9] In a 2003 appearance on _Politically Incorrect_, Barker even stated that he was a Christian after Ann Coulter implied he was not,[10] although years later, he denied this via Facebook.[11]

Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.[12]

As of 2015, he is a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.[13]

Relationships

While appearing on the radio call-in show _Loveline_ on August 20, 1996, Barker stated that during his teens he had several relationships with older women, but came to identify himself as homosexual by 18 or 19 years old.[14] Barker has been openly gay since the early 1990s.[15] His relationship with John Gregson lasted from 1975 until 1986. It was during this period, with the support that Gregson provided, that Barker was able to write the _Books of Blood_ series and _The Damnation Game_.

He later spent thirteen years with photographer David Armstrong, described as his husband in the introduction to _Coldheart Canyon_; they separated in 2009.[16]

Barker lives in Beverly Hills with his partner, Johnny Ray Raymond Jr.


Film work

Barker has an interest in film production. He wrote the screenplays for _Underworld_ and _Rawhead Rex_ (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with _Hellraiser_ (1987), based on his novella _The Hellbound Heart_. After his film _Nightbreed_ (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct _Lord of Illusions_ (1995). The short story "The Forbidden", from Barker's _Books of Blood_, provided the basis for the 1992 film _Candyman_ and its two sequels. Barker was an executive producer of the film _Gods and Monsters_ (1998), which received major critical acclaim. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his _The Abarat Quintet_ books under Disney's management, but because of creative differences, the project was cancelled.

In 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company Midnight Picture Show with the intent of producing two horror films per year.[17]

In October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original _Hellraiser_ film.[18][19] He is developing a film based on his _Tortured Souls_ line of toys from McFarlane Toys.


Visual art

Barker is a prolific visual artist, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, _Dread_, published by Fantaco in the early '90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, _Incarnations_ (1995) and _Forms of Heaven_ (1996); and on the second printing of the original British publications of his _Books of Blood_ series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel _The Thief of Always_ and for the _Abarat_ series. His artwork has been exhibited at Bert Green Fine Art in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection _Clive Barker, Illustrator_, published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in _Visions of Heaven and Hell_, published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books.

He worked on the horror video game _Clive Barker's Undying_, providing the voice for the character Ambrose. _Undying_ was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and released in 2001. He worked on _Clive Barker's Jericho_ for Codemasters, which was released in late 2007.

Barker created Halloween costume designs for Disguise Costumes.[20][21]

Around 150 art works by Barker were used in the set of the Academy of the Unseen Arts for the Netflix TV series _Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_. [22]


Comic books

Barker published his Razorline imprint via Marvel Comics in 1993.

Barker horror adaptations and spinoffs in comics include the Marvel/Epic Comics series _Hellraiser_, _Nightbreed_, _Pinhead_, _The Harrowers_, _Book of the Damned_, and _Jihad_; Eclipse Books' series and graphic novels _Tapping The Vein_, _Dread_, _Son of Celluloid_, _Revelations_ _The Life of Death_, _Rawhead Rex_ and _The Yattering and Jack_, and Dark Horse Comics' _Primal_, among others. Barker served as a consultant and wrote issues of the _Hellraiser_ anthology comic book.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker's children's fantasy novel _The Thief of Always_, written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is publishing a 12 issue adaptation of Barker's novel _The Great and Secret Show_.

In December 2007, Chris Ryall and Clive Barker announced an upcoming collaboration of an original comic book series, _Torakator_, to be published by IDW.[23]

In October 2009, IDW published _Seduth_, co-written by Barker. The work was released with three variant covers.[24]

In 2011, Boom! Studios began publishing an original _Hellraiser_ comic book series.

In 2013, Boom! Studios announced _Next Testament_, the first original story by Barker to be published in comic book format.
