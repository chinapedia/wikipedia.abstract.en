CONCEPCIÓN LOMBARDO GIL DE PARTEARROYO, best known to the history of Mexico as CONCEPCIÓN OR CONCHA LOMBARDO MIRAMON (November 8, 1835 – March 18, 1921), was the wife of Major General Miguel Miramon, who served twice as President of Mexico between 1859 and 1860. Born Maria de la Concepcion Josefa Ramona Ignacia Severa Lombardo, she was born in Mexico city to a wealthy family headed by her father, Francisco Maria Lombardo.


Education, marriage, and political life

Despite the unruly era in which she lived, she was strictly educated in a convent school, where she was taught catechism, needlework, and bordaje. She led a normal life, attending the theater, dances, parties, and taking lessons in singing and horse riding. She was orphaned in her early youth and left with few resources. She was linked romantically to an Englishman (and had to hide in a convent as a result) and then with Miguel Miramon, whom she met on a visit to the Military College when he was a lieutenant.

As soon as Miramon reached the rank of major general he proposed marriage. Concepcion Lombardo and Miramon were married in 1858. They ultimately had six children. A year into the marriage, Miramon was elected president and Concepcion Lombardo became First Lady, which caused her much concern since she knew the fractured political and military situation facing Mexico. Nevertheless, she encouraged her husband to fight for their conservative ideals.

From this date, she saw little of Miramon, as he had to continue his military campaign, and the protocol prevented her from accompanying him to either official ceremonies or social events. Mrs. Miramon was not allowed to sit next to him in the official box and had to dance with him at parties, because they were considered protagónicas attitudes of a woman who wanted to feel the same relevance and authority that the president of Mexico. Limited in any matter, Mrs. Miramon alone could not attend public places because it was not well seen. [1]

With the arrival of Maximilian of Habsburg to Mexico, the Miramon Lombardo family went to Berlin. In 1866, when Emperor Napoleon III left the Mexican emperor, Miramon returned to the country to fight for the Second Mexican Empire, which was a lost cause and would end with the imprisonment and execution of Maximilian, Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. 502-EXECUTION_OF_MAXIMILIAN.jpg She was faithful to the memory of her husband for the rest of his days. He went to Europe, where, according to the advice of the shot Emperor requested the support of the courts of Austria and Belgium. Only Belgian aid received. He lived in Rome and died on March 18, 1921 in Toulouse, France at 85 years old.


_Memories_

With simple style, this intelligent woman gave to the history of Mexico a gem; entitled Memoirs, he began writing at age 80. Along with the set of memories and experiences of his life, laden with a deep knowledge of the circumstances of his time, exposed under the conservative perspective that left her father and her husband, the volume of its publication has a little over a thousand pages.

The Memoirs of Concepción Lombardo Miramon were published 63 after his death, thanks to the generosity of Francisco Cortina Portilla who, as explained in its preliminary Felipe Teixidor the acquired granddaughter Miramon based in the city of Palermo, where, elderly and sick, then he kept giving Spanish classes. While our distinguished friend soothed hardships, forever he rescued the testimony of one of the most tragic episodes in the history of Mexico. [2]

Academic training

As they were many children, the duties of society besides his mother were numerous, Concha could never have been educated at home. He studied at a convent school run by the Peñarrojas ladies. By cross, his parents believed the rigor employed at that school could correct it. There he received a strict upbringing that included flogging, donkey ears and a cat thrown by his bigoted head teacher, who in his own words "was a devil incarnate." The instruction was reduced to reading and catechism that forced her to learn by heart; and when the lesson was not known to the repeated cries word for word. His teachers were so ignorant they could not read or write, not even discern between San Jose and Jesus Christ. All they did well were the work of sewing and embroidery, and Concha had to learn to perfection with tears and punishments.
