_ERETMOCERA FASCIATA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Baron Walsingham in 1896. It is found in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.[1][2]

The wingspan is about 9Â mm. The forewings are bronzy greyish fuscous with a straight, transverse, pale whitish ochreous fascia before the middle, followed by a dorsal spot before the tornus and a rather larger costal spot of the same colour before the commencement of the cilia. There is some faint whitish ochreous speckling on the wing-surface. The hindwings are dark grey.[3]
