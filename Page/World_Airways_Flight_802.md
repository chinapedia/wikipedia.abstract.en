On September 8, 1973, a Douglas DC-8 operated by World Airways as WORLD AIRWAYS FLIGHT 802 crashed on high ground while on approach to Cold Bay Airport, Alaska, killing all six people on board.[1]

The official accident investigation concluded that the probable cause was the captain's non-adherence to published instrument approach procedures for the destination airport.


History of the flight

Flight 802 was a contract cargo flight for the US Military Airlift Command from Travis AFB, California, to Clark AFB, Philippines; Cold Bay was the first planned stopover. The flight crew consisted of three members, while on board were also three non-revenue passengers, including two company employees.

The aircraft operating flight 802 was a four-engine Douglas DC-8-63CF jetliner, registration which had entered service two years earlier, in 1971. Maintenance records for the aircraft did not highlight any significant problem.[2]


Final descent and crash

After an uneventful flight from Travis, the aircraft descended in cloud towards Cold Bay Airport, straying significantly off-course and into an area of poor radio navigation reception, until at 05:42 AKDT it struck Mount Dutton at an altitude of .[3]
