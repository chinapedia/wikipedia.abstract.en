CLARENCE GILBERT TAYLOR (September 8, 1898 — March 29, 1988) was an early aviation entrepreneur and co-founder of the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation in Bradford, Pennsylvania. He was the designer of the Taylor Cub, which led to the creation of the Piper Cub, one of the most popular airplanes in history.[1]


Biography

Gilbert was born on September 8, 1898 in Rochester, New York to Arthur Taylor (c. 1869 - 1951) and Clara (née Makin) Taylor (c. 1871 - ?), who had immigrated to the United States from England in 1889.[2] He was the one of six children that included Gordon A. Taylor (Jan. 15, 1902 - Apr. 24, 1928), who was killed, along with an early sales agent for his aircraft, during a demonstration flight of a prototype of the "Chummy" airplane at the Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan.

After his brother's death, Gilbert moved the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation to Bradford, Pennsylvania, where Gilbert remained until 1936.[3] During his time in Bradford the company was renamed to the Taylor Aircraft Company after investor William T. Piper bought the assets of the company in 1930.
