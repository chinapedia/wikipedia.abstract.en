FRANZ VON FLEISCHER (27 November 1801, in Lausick – 24 August 1878, in Hohenheim) was a German botanist.

As a young man, he worked as a pharmacist in Dresden and Esslingen. In 1825 he undertook a botanical study trip to the Alps, followed by an extended scientific expedition in 1826/27 that took him to Illyria, Istria, Greece, Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt. Afterwards, he studied medicine and natural sciences at the University of Tübingen, and following graduation in 1832, he worked as a teacher of natural sciences at the Hofwyl agricultural school in the canton of Bern.[1][2]

From 1834 to 1840 he taught classes in natural sciences at the cantonal school in Aarau, and afterwards, served as a professor at the Agricultural Academy in Hohenheim. He remained at Hohenheim up until his death in 1878.[3]

Some plants with the specific epithet of _fleischeri_ commemorate his name, an example being '' Crocus fleischeri''.[4]
