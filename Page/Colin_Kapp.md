Derek Ivor COLIN KAPP (3 April 1928 – 3 August 2007) was a British science fiction author; he was most often published under the byline _Colin Kapp_.

As an electronic engineer, he began his career with Mullard Electronics then specialised in electro-plating techniques, eventually becoming a freelance consultant engineer. This technical background probably enabled him to write semi-realistic science fiction stories.

He was born in Southwark, south London, 3 April 1928 [1] to John L. F. Kapp and Annie M.A. (née Towner)[2]

A contemporary of Brian Aldiss and James White, as an author, Kapp is best known for his stories about the Unorthodox Engineers.
