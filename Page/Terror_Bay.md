TERROR BAY (Inuktitut name: ᐊᒥᑦᕈᖅ _Amitruq_)[1] is an Arctic waterway in the Kitikmeot Region, Nunavut, Canada. It is located in the south western side of King William Island. The entrance to the bay is marked by Fitzjames Island on the west and Irving Islands to the east. The Bay opens to Queen Maud Gulf.

In 2016, Arctic Research Foundation researchers on board the _Martin Bergmann_ announced that they had found the wreck of HMS _Terror_, one of the ships of John Franklin's lost expedition in Terror Bay, led there by a tip from Inuk crewman Sammy Kogvik, from Gjoa Haven, who reported seeing a mast protruding from the ice in Terror Bay during a hunting trip in 2010.[2]

The bay was officially named by the Geographical Names Board of Canada in 1910.[3] The bay was one of a series of landmarks along the waters explored by _Terror_ and the route of Franklin's lost expedition named in honour of HMS _Terror_ and the expedition's other ship HMS _Erebus_,[4] making the location of the wreck in a bay of the same name a coincidence.[5]
