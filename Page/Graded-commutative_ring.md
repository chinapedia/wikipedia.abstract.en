In algebra, a GRADED-COMMUTATIVE RING (also called a SKEW-COMMUTATIVE RING) is a graded ring that is commutative in the graded sense; that is, homogeneous elements _x_, _y_ satisfy

_x__y_ = ( − 1)^(|_x_||_y_|)_y__x_,
where , denote the degrees of _x_, _y_.

A commutative (non-graded) ring, with trivial grading, is a basic example. An exterior algebra is an example of a graded-commutative ring that is not commutative in the non-graded sense.

A cup product on cohomology satisfies the skew-commutative relation; hence, a cohomology ring is graded-commutative. In fact, many examples of graded-commutative rings come from algebraic topology and homological algebra.
