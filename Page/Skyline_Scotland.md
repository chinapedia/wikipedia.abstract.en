SKYLINE SCOTLAND is a set of four annual skyrunning races which take place on consecutive days in the mountains around Kinlochleven in Lochaber. The races are the Mamores VK, the Ring of Steall Skyrace, the Ben Nevis Ultra and the Glen Coe Skyline.[1]

The inaugural Glen Coe Skyline took place in 2015 and the Mamores VK and Ring of Steall were added in 2016. The Ben Nevis Ultra first took place in 2017. The races are sponsored by Salomon.[2]

The courses include some of the most technical terrain found in running races. The Glen Coe Skyline in particular has significant sections of scrambling and it was selected to be the final race in the Skyrunner World Series Extreme in 2016, following the Tromsø Skyrace in Norway and the Kima Trophy in Italy.[3]

In October 2017 it was announced that Skyline Scotland would host the 2018 edition of the Skyrunning World Championships.[4] The Mamores VK, the Ben Nevis Ultra and the Ring of Steall were the Championship races. The Glen Coe Skyline, although not part of the World Championships, was one of the races in the 2018 Skyrunner World Series.[5]

Glen Coe Skyline

The Glen Coe Skyline route takes in the technical Curved Ridge on Buachaille Etive Mòr, then heads west over Stob Coire Sgreamhach before an out-and-back section to Stob Coire nan Lochan. It then drops down to the valley near Loch Achtriochtan before climbing steeply up to the Aonach Eagach, a rocky ridge which is traversed from west to east before the route joins the West Highland Way to the finish. In 2015, the Skyline started and finished at Glencoe Mountain Resort but for the following year, the start and finish was moved to Kinlochleven and the runners reached Curved Ridge via the West Highland Way and a descent of the Devil’s Staircase. The race is around in length with of ascent.[20]

The 2015 race was won by Joe Symonds in 7:36:21, with the first woman Emelie Forsberg finishing second overall in 7:44:19.[21]

In 2016, four runners featured prominently at the front of the race for much of the way: Tom Owens, Jonathan Albon, Marc Lauenstein and Finlay Wild. Albon and Owens lost a few minutes in low cloud locating the checkpoint on Stob Coire Sgreamhach but were still leading together with Lauenstein at the start of the long climb up to the Aonach Eagach. By the top of the climb, Albon had pulled ahead and he held the lead on the crossing of the exposed ridge and the descent to the finish, winning in a time of 6:33:52. Owens finished second around three minutes later.[22] Jasmin Paris won the women’s race in a time of 8:15:56.[23]

The 2017 edition was won by Kilian Jornet in a course record of 6:25:39, with Jonathan Albon second in 6:31 and Alexis Sévennec third in 6:40. The first woman was Emelie Forsberg in 7:53:30. Megan Kimmel was second in 8:14, with Ragna Debats third in 8:22.[24]

Kilian Jornet was the men's winner in 3:37, after having won the Ring of Steall race the previous day. There was a close finish in the women's Glen Coe Skyline, with Hillary Gerardi winning in 4:17:48, seven seconds ahead of Jasmin Paris.[25]
