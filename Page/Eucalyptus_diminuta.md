_EUCALYPTUS DIMINUTA_, commonly known as the SPRING MALLEE,[1] is species of mallee that is endemic to south-west of Western Australia. It has smooth, silvery to greyish bark, sometimes with rough flaky bark near the base, lance-shaped adult leaves, pendulous, elongated flower buds arranged in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus diminuta_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth silvery to greyish bark, sometimes with a short stocking of rough flaky bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, bluish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The buds are arrange in goups of seven on a thin, pendulous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are elongated with a rounded tip, long and wide with a conical to horn-shpaed operculum. Flowering occurs between July and November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical to cup-shaped or bell-shaped capsule long wide with the valves near rim level.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus diminuta_ was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 2002 in the journal _Nuytsia_. The type specimen was collected by Brooker near Glenfield on the road to Yuna.[5] The specific epithet (_diminuta_) is a Latin word meaning "diminished",[6] referring to the size of the plants, its buds and fruit compared to the related _E. stowardii_.[7][8]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Glandulosae_. It is closely related to _E. stowardii_.[9]


Distribution and habitat

The spring mallee is found on sandplains and near swamps along the west coast in the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it grows over laterite in sandy clay or sandy soils.[10]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus diminuta_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[11]
