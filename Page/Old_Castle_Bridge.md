Old_Castle_Bridge,_Warwick.jpg The OLD CASTLE BRIDGE in Warwick, England was a late medieval bridge. The multi-arch stone bridge was built across the River Avon a short distance south-east of the centre of Warwick town and immediately upstream of the Warwick Castle weir. It is not clear exactly when the bridge was built, but by 1373 half the width of the bridge was said to be in ruins. A new bridge was built upstream of the old one in the 18th century and in 1795 the old bridge was largely swept away by flood waters.[1]

The ruined remains of the old bridge include three complete arches standing in the middle of the river.[2] The bridge remains are protected by Historic England as a Grade II* Listed Building.[3]
