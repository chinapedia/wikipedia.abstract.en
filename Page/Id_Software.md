ID SOFTWARE LLC () is an American video game developer based in Dallas, Texas. The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company Softdisk, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack).[1] Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved.[2]

id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the PC (running MS-DOS and Windows), including work done for the _Wolfenstein_, _Doom_, and _Quake_ franchises. id's work was particularly important in 3D computer graphics technology and in game engines that are used throughout the video game industry.

The company was involved in the creation of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. _Wolfenstein 3D_ is often considered to be the first true FPS, _Doom_ is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general, and _Quake_ was id's first true 3D FPS.

On June 24, 2009, ZeniMax Media acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in Frankfurt, Germany.[3]


History

The founders of id Software met in the offices of Softdisk developing multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing, including _Dangerous Dave_. In September 1990, John Carmack developed an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics on the PC. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and Tom Hall stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 NES game _Super Mario Bros. 3_, inserting stock graphics of John Romero's Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the demo, entitled "Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential. The team that would later form id Software immediately began moonlighting, going so far as to "borrow" company computers that were not being used over the weekends and at nights while they designed their own remake of _Super Mario Bros. 3_.

Despite their work, Nintendo turned them down, saying they had no interest in expanding to the PC market, and that Mario games were to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles. Around this time, Scott Miller of Apogee Software learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero's Softdisk games, _Dangerous Dave_, and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address.[4][5] When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller, including _Commander Keen_ in December 1990, which became a very successful shareware game. After their first royalty check Romero, Carmack, and Adrian Carmack (no relation) decided to start their own company.[6] After hiring Hall, the group finished the _Commander Keen_ series, then hired Jay Wilbur and Kevin Cloud and began working on _Wolfenstein 3D_.

The shareware distribution method was initially employed by id Software through Apogee Software to sell their products, such as the _Commander Keen_, _Wolfenstein_ and _Doom_ games.[7] They would release the first part of their trilogy as shareware, then sell the other two installments by mail order. Only later (about the time of the release of _Doom II_) did id Software release their games via more traditional shrink-wrapped boxes in stores (through other game publishers).

After _Wolfenstein 3D_{{'}}s great success, id began working on _Doom_. After Hall left the company it hired Sandy Petersen and Dave Taylor before the release of _Doom_ in December 1993.

On June 24, 2009, it was announced that id Software had been acquired by ZeniMax Media (owner of Bethesda Softworks). The deal would eventually affect publishing deals id Software had before the acquisition, namely _Rage_, which was being published through Electronic Arts.[8] ZeniMax received in July a $105 million investment from StrongMail Systems for the id acquisition, it's unknown if that was the exact price of the deal.[9][10] id Software moved from the "cube-shaped" Mesquite office to a location in Richardson, Texas during the spring of 2011.[11]

On June 26, 2013, id Software president Todd Hollenshead quit after 17 years of service.[12]

On November 22, 2013, it was announced id Software co-founder and Technical Director John Carmack had fully resigned from the company to work full-time at Oculus VR which he joined as CTO in August 2013.[13][14] He was the last of the original founders to leave the company.

Company name

The company writes its name with a lowercase _id_, which is pronounced as in "did" or "kid", and, according to the book _Masters of Doom_, the group identified itself as "Ideas from the Deep" in the early days of Softdisk but that, in the end, the name 'id' came from the phrase "in demand".[15] Disliking "in demand" as "lame", someone suggested a connection with Sigmund Freud's psychological concept of id, which the others accepted.[16] Evidence of the reference can be found as early as _Wolfenstein 3D_ with the statement "that's id, as in the id, ego, and superego in the psyche" appearing in the game's documentation. Prior to an update to the website, id's History page made a direct reference to Freud.[17]

Game development

Technology

John_Carmack_GDC_2010.jpg]] Starting with their first shareware game series, _Commander Keen_, id Software has licensed the core source code for the game, or what is more commonly known as the engine. Brainstormed by John Romero, id Software held a weekend session titled "The id Summer Seminar" in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including Scott Miller, George Broussard, Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and Todd Replogle. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as "Wac-Man" to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the _Keen_ engine, but also how it worked internally.

id Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including _Commander Keen_, _Wolfenstein 3D_, _ShadowCaster_,[22] _Doom_, _Quake_, _Quake II_, and _Quake III_, as well as the technology used in making _Doom 3_. After being used first for id Software's in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to _Eurogamer.net_, "id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized". During the mid to late 1990s, "the launch of each successive round of technology it's been expected to occupy a headlining position", with the _Quake III_ engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However id Tech 4 had far fewer licensees than the Unreal Engine from Epic Games, due to the long development time that went into _Doom 3_ which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.

Despite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with Wolfenstein 3D, he felt bothered when third-party companies started "pestering" him to licence the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be "holding the hands" of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.[23]

In conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing source code, John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the GNU General Public License. Historically, the source code for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. _Wolfenstein 3D_, _DOOM_ and _Quake_ engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include DarkPlaces which adds stencil shadow volumes into the original _Quake_ engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Another such project is ioquake3, which maintains a goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for _Hovertank 3D_ and _Catacomb 3D_, was released in June 2014 by Flat Rock Software.[24]

The GPL release of the _Quake III_ engine's source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.

On August 4, 2011, John Carmack revealed during his QuakeCon 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the _Doom 3_ engine (id Tech 4) during the year.[25]

id Software publicly stated they would not support the Wii console (possibly due to technical limitations),[26] although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s).[27] They did the same thing with the Wii U but for Nintendo Switch, they collaborated with Panic Button to release 2016's Doom and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.

Since id Software revealed their engine id Tech 5, they call their engines "id Tech", followed by a version number.[28] Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the _Doom_ engine as id Tech 1.

Linux gaming

Timothee-Besset.jpg id Software was an early pioneer in the Linux gaming market,[29] and id Software's Linux games have been some of the most popular of the platform. Many id Software games won the Readers' and Editors' Choice awards of Linux Journal.[30][31][32][33] Some id Software titles ported to Linux are _Doom_ (the first id Software game to be ported), _Quake_, _Quake II_, _Quake III Arena_, _Return to Castle Wolfenstein_, _Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory_, _Doom 3_, _Quake 4_, and _Enemy Territory: Quake Wars_. Since id Software and some of its licensees released the source code for some of their previous games, several games which were not ported (such as _Wolfenstein 3D_, _Spear of Destiny_, _Heretic_, _Hexen_, _Hexen II_, and _Strife_) can run on Linux and other operating systems natively through the use of source ports. _Quake Live_ also launched with Linux support, although this, alongside OS X support, was later removed when changed to a standalone title.[34]

The tradition of porting to Linux was first started by Dave D. Taylor, with David Kirsch doing some later porting. Since _Quake III Arena_, Linux porting had been handled by Timothee Besset. The majority of all id Tech 4 games, including those made by other developers, have a Linux client available, the only current exceptions being _Wolfenstein_ and _Brink_. Similarly, almost all of the games utilizing the Quake II engine have Linux ports, the only exceptions being those created by Ion Storm. Despite fears by the Linux gaming community that id Tech 5 would not be ported to that platform,[35] Timothee Besset in his blog has stated "I'll be damned if we don't find the time to get Linux builds done".[36] Besset has stated that id Software's primary justification for releasing Linux builds is better code quality, along with a technical interest for the platform. However, on January 26, 2012, Besset announced that he had left id.[37]

John Carmack has expressed his stance with regard to Linux builds in the past.[38] In December 2000 Todd Hollenshead expressed support for Linux: "All said, we will continue to be a leading supporter of the Linux platform because we believe it is a technically sound OS and is the OS of choice for many server ops."[39] However, on April 25, 2012, Carmack revealed that "there are no plans for a native Linux client" of id's most recent game, _Rage_.[40] In February 2013, Carmack argued for improving emulation as the "proper technical direction for gaming on Linux", though this was also due to ZeniMax's refusal to support "unofficial binaries", given all prior ports (except for _Quake III Arena_, via Loki Software, and earlier versions of _Quake Live_) having only ever been unofficial.[41] Carmack didn't mention official games _Quake: The Offering_ and _Quake II: Colossus_ ported by id Software to Linux and published by Macmillan Computer Publishing USA.[42]


Games

_Commander Keen_

The _Commander Keen_ series, a platform game introducing one of the first smooth side-scrolling game engines for MS-DOS, brought id Software into the gaming mainstream. The game was very successful and spawned a whole series of titles. It was also the series of id Software that designer Tom Hall was most affiliated with. The first _Commander Keen_ trilogy was released on December 14, 1990.

_Wolfenstein_

The company's breakout product was released on May 5, 1992: _Wolfenstein 3D_, a first-person shooter (FPS) with smooth 3D graphics that were unprecedented in computer games, and with violent gameplay that many gamers found engaging. After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created _Doom_, _Doom II: Hell on Earth_, _Quake_, _Quake II_, _Quake III Arena_, _Quake 4_, and _Doom 3_. Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. _Wolfenstein 3D_ spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called _Spear of Destiny_, and the second, _Return to Castle Wolfenstein_, using the id Tech 3 engine. A third _Wolfenstein_ sequel, simply titled _Wolfenstein_, was released by Raven Software, using the id Tech 4 engine. Another sequel, named _Wolfenstein: The New Order_; was developed by MachineGames using the id Tech 5 engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of _Wolfenstein: The Old Blood_ a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled _Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus_ in 2017.

_Doom_

Eighteen months after their release of _Wolfenstein 3D_, on December 10, 1993, id Software released _Doom_ which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. _Doom_ featured a sci-fi/horror setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even video game consoles. _Doom_ became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of criticism decrying the dangers of violence in video games. _Doom_ was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar _Doom II: Hell on Earth_. id Software made its mark in video game history with the shareware release of _Doom_, and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of _Doom 3_. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there will be a _Doom 4_. It began development on May 7, 2008.[43] _Doom_, the fourth installation and a reboot of the Doom series, was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on November 10, 2017. In June 2018, the sequel to the 2016 reboot, _Doom Eternal_ was officially announced at E3 2018 with a teaser trailer, followed by a gameplay reveal at QuakeCon in August 2018.[44][45]

_Quake_

On June 22, 1996, the release of _Quake_ marked the second milestone in id Software history. _Quake_ combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the _Quake_ engine, with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band's logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of Michael Abrash. Furthermore, _Quake_'s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on _QuakeWorld_), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.

In 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for the pioneering work _Quake_ represented in user modifiable games.[46] id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern shooter video games.[47]

The _Quake_ series continued with _Quake II_ in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for Strogg attacks on Earth. Most of the subsequent entries in the _Quake_ franchise follow this storyline. _Quake III Arena_ (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the "Arena Eternal", a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in _Doom_ ("Doomguy"), _Quake_ (Ranger, Wrack), and _Quake II_ (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). _Quake IV_ (2005) picks up where _Quake II_ left off – finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off _Enemy Territory: Quake Wars_ acts as a prequel to _Quake II_, when the Strogg first invade Earth. _Quake IV_ and _Enemy Territory: Quake Wars_ were made by outside developers and not id.

There have also been other spin-offs such as Quake Mobile in 2005 and _Quake Live_, an internet browser based modification of _Quake III_. A game called _Quake Arena DS_ was planned and canceled for the Nintendo DS. John Carmack stated, at QuakeCon 2007, that the _id Tech 5_ engine would be used for a new _Quake_ game.

_Rage_

Todd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine. Hollenshead also mentioned that the title would be completely developed in-house, marking the first game since 2004's _Doom 3_ to be done so.[48] At 2007's WWDC, John Carmack showed the new engine called id Tech 5.[49] Later that year, at QuakeCon 2007, the title of the new game was revealed as _Rage_.[50]

On July 14, 2008, id Software announced at the 2008 E3 event that they would be publishing _Rage_ through Electronic Arts, and not id's longtime publisher Activision.[51] However, since then ZeniMax has also announced that they are publishing _Rage_ through Bethesda Softworks.[52]

On August 12, 2010, during Quakecon 2010, id Software announced _Rage_ US ship date of September 13, 2011, and a European ship date of September 15, 2011.[53] During the keynote, id Software also demonstrated a _Rage_ spin-off title running on the iPhone.[54] This technology demo later became _Rage HD_.

On May 14, 2018, Bethesda Softworks announced _Rage 2_, a co-development between id Software and Avalanche Studios.

Other games

Keen3Gameplay.png Doom_ingame_1.png'']] During its early days, id Software produced much more varied games; these include the early 3D first-person shooter experiments that led to _Wolfenstein 3D_ and _Doom_ – _Hovertank 3D_ and _Catacomb 3D_. There was also the _Rescue Rover_ series, which had two games – _Rescue Rover_ and _Rescue Rover 2_. Also there was John Romero's _Dangerous Dave_ series, which included such notables as the tech demo (_In Copyright Infringement_) which led to the _Commander Keen_ engine, and the decently popular _Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion_. _In the Haunted Mansion_ was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game _Shadow Knights_, which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for Softdisk, where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as _ShadowCaster_, (early-id Tech 1), _Heretic_, _Hexen: Beyond Heretic_ (id Tech 1), _Hexen II_ (_Quake_ engine), and _Orcs and Elves_ (_Doom RPG_ engine).


Other media

id Software has also published novels based on the Doom series _Doom_ novels. After a brief hiatus from publishing, id resumed and re-launched the novel series in 2008 with Matthew J. Costello's (a story consultant for _Doom 3_ and now _Rage_) new _Doom 3_ novels: _Worlds on Fire_ and _Maelstrom_.

id Software became involved in film development when they oversaw the film adaption of their _Doom_ franchise in 2005. In August 2007, Todd Hollenshead stated at QuakeCon 2007 that a _Return to Castle Wolfenstein_ movie is in development which re-teams the _Silent Hill_ writer/producer team, Roger Avary as writer and director and Samuel Hadida as producer.


Controversy

id Software was the target of controversy over two of their most popular games, _Doom_ and the earlier _Wolfenstein 3D_:

_Doom_

_Doom_ was notorious for its high levels of gore[55] and occultism along with satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. Yahoo! Games listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.[56]

The game again sparked controversy throughout a period of school shootings in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said that the killing would be "like playing _Doom_", and "it'll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, World War II, Vietnam, _Duke Nukem_ and _Doom_ all mixed together", and that his shotgun was "straight out of the game".[57] A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a _Doom_ level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design _Doom_ levels, none of them were based on Columbine High School.[58]

While _Doom_ and other violent video games have been blamed for nationally covered school shootings, 2008 research featured by Greater Good Science Center[59] shows that the two are not closely related. Harvard medical school researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers—like the vast majority of young teenage boys—did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between game play and school shootings. In fact, only one eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.[60]

_Wolfenstein 3D_

As for _Wolfenstein 3D_, due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the swastika and the anthem of the Nazi Party, _Horst-Wessel-Lied_, as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht München on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in _Wolfenstein_, the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the Atari Jaguar version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994.

Due to concerns from Nintendo of America, the Super NES version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in _The Official DOOM Player Guide_ about the reaction to _Wolfenstein_, claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version.


People

In 2003, the book _Masters of Doom_ chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id's success.

John Carmack

Carmack's skill at 3D programming is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id's lead programmer. On August 7, 2013, he joined Oculus VR, a company developing virtual reality headsets, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.[61]

John Romero

John Romero, who was forced to resign after the release of _Quake_, later formed the ill-fated company Ion Storm. There, he became infamous through the development of _Daikatana_, which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release.

Both Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.

Tom Hall

Tom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of _Doom_ development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of _Doom_ and then went to work for Apogee, developing _Rise of the Triad_ with the "Developers of Incredible Power". When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the _Prey_ development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at Ion Storm. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to _Commander Keen_, he would immediately develop another Keen title.

Sandy Petersen

Sandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original _Doom_ title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of _Doom II_. As a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for _Quake_, and he created _Inferno_, the third "episode" of the first DOOM. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of _Quake II_ and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.

American McGee

American McGee was a level designer for _Doom II_, _The Ultimate Doom_, _Quake_, and _Quake II_. He was asked to resign after the release of _Quake II_, then moved to Electronic Arts where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game _American McGee's Alice_. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee now heads independent game development house Spicy Horse in Shanghai, where he works on various projects.
