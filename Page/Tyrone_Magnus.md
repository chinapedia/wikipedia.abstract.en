TYRONE CRAWLEY (born June 14, 1977) is an American actor, voice actor, and YouTuber, known by the stage name TYRONE MAGNUS.


Career

Tyrone Magnus (real name Tyrone Crawley), had a career in sales for eight years before starting his acting career and YouTube channel. His YouTube channel originally started out as a wrestling talk show, where he talks about his love for wrestlers but then evolved into a reaction-based channel after fans sent him _Man of Steel_ trailers to review, which then evolved into reacting to and reviewing trailers and later videos of all kinds such as Try Not To Laugh and Vine Compilations. In May 2018, the channel surpassed the milestone of 1.3 million subscribers.[1][2][3]

In November 2014, his reaction to the _Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens_[4] teaser gained a lot of attention after being shared on Reddit, with the video getting upwards of one million views. Magnus said as to why his videos were so successful:

  "I was one of those kids that was always told, 'You should be on TV.' I'm not afraid to be myself on camera. I think that is what appeals to audience all around the world. The fact that someone can really just go beyond their values, be their inner child, leap mountains without any obstructions or any inhibitions or whatever. If you are ever told by a teacher, parent or someone you looked up to who tells you to stop, ignore them and believe in yourself. Sometimes you won't get you want but that shouldn't stop you. Motivation is what makes me what I do. It's not about power. It's about faith. If you have faith in what you are doing like Goku from _Dragon Ball_, you can achieve anything."[5]

In 2015, he got his first acting role, as General Tamanegi in the series _Dragon Ball Absalon_.[6]
