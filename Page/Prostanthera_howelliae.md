_PROSTANTHERA HOWELLIAE_ is a flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and is endemic to New South Wales and Queensland. It is a small shrub with narrow stems, aromatic, hairy leaves and violet-coloured, tube-shaped flowers.


Description

_Prostanthera howelliae_ is an erect or spreading, virgate shrub which grows to a height and spread of with its branches densely covered with short hairs. The leaves have a fragrant odour when crushed, and are narrow egg-shaped, long, wide with their edges turned under. The leaves have a very short stalk, sometimes a maroon tinge and are covered with short, cone-shaped hairs.[1][2]

The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils with two bracteoles at their base, the bracteoles leaf-like, linear in shape, about long and remaining on the plant after flowering. The tube formed by the sepals is long, with the tubular part about long. The petal tube is long, pink to purple-mauve and spotted inside the tube. As with many other prostantheras, the petal tube has two "lips" with the upper one having two lobes and the lower one three lobes. Flowering occurs in spring.[3][4]Prostanthera_howelliae_leaves_and_flowers_(1).jpg


Taxonomy and naming

The species was first formally described in 1929 by William Blakely and the description was published in _Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales_.[5][6] The specific epithet (_howelliae_) honours "Mrs. T.J. Howell, who, for a number of years, has taken a keen interest in the native flora".[7][8]


Distribution and habitat

This prostanthera grows in woodland and shrubland, often in gravelly or sandy soil, in the eastern half of New South Wales and in Queensland.[9]
