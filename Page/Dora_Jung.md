Dora-Jung-1956.jpg DORA ELISABET JUNG (16 October 1906 â€“ 19 December 1980) was textile artist, craftswoman, and industrial designer from Finland. Her career lasted five decades. She designed products and works of art made out of linen which can be found in homes, churches, and public buildings.[1] She was known for her expertise in designing woven damask fabrics with abstract motifs.[2]

Jung graduated in school of Art and design in 1932. She founded her own weaving atelier where she worked for more than 50 years. She developed her own loom, but usually others did the weaving while Jung concentrated in design and improving the weaving technique.[3] Jung was considered by her contemporaries as the reformer of damask and her weaving as the renaissance of the damask art. Her method of damask weaving has been called the Dora Jung technique.[4]

1951 she was awarded a Grand Prix at the Milan Textile Triennial Exposition for her damask called _Duvor_ (Doves). After that she got many contracts for public buildings. Architects and representatives of the Finnish Lutheran church appreciated her work for all of her career.[5] She designed for the textile factory Tampella from 1936 to 1972.[6] In 1957 she got the task of re-designing the damask production of Tampella. She designed several tablecloths with matching napkins and small clothes. Most of them were in white or light pastel colours, but in 1960s and 1970s even brighter colours were used.[7]
