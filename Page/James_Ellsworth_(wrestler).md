Professional wrestling career

Independent circuit (2002–2016)

Throughout most of his career, Morris has performed on the independent circuit under the ring name "Pretty" Jimmy Dream, often as part of a tag team with Adam Ugly as The Pretty Ugly.[6] The duo has won several regional championships throughout the Northeastern United States, including American Combat Wrestling, Big Time Wrestling and First State Championship Wrestling.[7] Pretty Ugly debuted in 302 Pro Wrestling at their first show.[8]

In 2006, Morris made his Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) debut at CZW Tournament of Death V teaming with Drew Gulak on a losing end to BLKOUT (Ruckus and Robbie Mireno).[9] Morris returned to CZW again in 2009, losing to Jon Dahmer in a battle royal.[10]

On April 24, 2009 at Covey Promotions All Or Nothing 3, Morris defeated Draven, Thomas Rodriguez and Crazii Shea in a four-way ladder match to become the Covey Promotions Cruiserweight Champion.[11] On June 27 at Hot and Bothered, Morris dropped the championship to Crazii Shea.[12] Morris also runs a professional wrestling promotion known as Adrenaline Championship Wrestling (ACW), which was founded in September 2009.[13]

On June 4, 2016, Pretty Ugly won a tournament to be crowned the inaugural 302 Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions by defeating The Dub Boys and Riot City's Most Wanted in the tournament finals.[14]

WWE

Early appearances (2014–2016)

Prior to his initial WWE run, Morris appeared a couple of times as one of Adam Rose's "Rosebuds" whenever the company was in the Baltimore area.[15] As James Ellsworth, he had his first WWE singles match on the July 25, 2016 episode of _Raw_ as an enhancement talent, being quickly defeated by Braun Strowman.[16] Ellsworth gained some praise and subsequently developed a cult following due to his meek appearance and enthusiastic pre-match promo in which he declared that "any man with two hands has a fighting chance" before being easily defeated by Strowman.[17]

Storyline with AJ Styles and Dean Ambrose (2016–2017)

Ellsworth resurfaced in the main event of the September 13 episode of _SmackDown Live_ as the mystery tag team partner for WWE World Champion AJ Styles against Dean Ambrose and John Cena, only to be attacked by Intercontinental Champion The Miz (his replacement in the actual match) as he walked down to the ring.[18] On the October 11 episode of _SmackDown Live_, Ellsworth was chosen by Styles as his opponent in a non-title match, but SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan made Ambrose the special guest referee for the match.[19] Ambrose favored Ellsworth during the match due to his rivalry with Styles, culminating in Ambrose attacking Styles and allowing Ellsworth to win.[20] Ellsworth was granted a WWE World Championship match the following week on the October 18 episode of _SmackDown Live_, with Ambrose serving as the timekeeper and ring announcer (Ellsworth won the match by disqualification, but not the title).[21] Ellsworth continued to offer assistance to Ambrose in his rivalry with Styles, but this backfired on the October 25 episode of _SmackDown Live_, when Ellsworth accidentally cost Ambrose the match after executing _No Chin Music_ on Styles, disqualifying Ambrose.[22] On the November 1 episode of _SmackDown Live_, Ellsworth interfered in the rematch, distracting Styles and allowing Ambrose to win an opportunity for the title.[23] SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also named Ellsworth the SmackDown mascot for the 2016 Survivor Series match on the November 8 episode of _SmackDown Live_.[24][25]

This led Ellsworth interfering on December 4 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs during the Tables, Ladders and Chairs between Styles and Ambrose to help the latter, but he ended up turning heel by helping Styles instead by pushing Ambrose off the ladder and sent him through two tables. [31] Ellsworth explained that since he had already beaten Styles three times, he helped Styles because he wanted to defeat him again, this time for the WWE World Championship, a match SmackDown's commissioner Shane McMahon granted him for the following episode of _SmackDown Live_.[32] Ellsworth tried to make it up with Ambrose by helping him defeat The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship on the December 6 episode of _SmackDown Live_, but his effort backfired and eventually cost Ambrose the match.[33] Ellsworth's title opportunity was twice postponed, first due to Styles being legitimately injured;[34] and the second time due to Ellsworth suffering from a kayfabe cold.[35] The match eventually happened on the December 20 episode of _SmackDown_, during which Styles easily defeated Ellsworth in under a minute to end their storyline.[36]

Managing Carmella (2017–2018)

After his storyline with Styles and Ambrose ended, Ellsworth allied himself with Carmella.[37] On the January 3, 2017 episode of _SmackDown_, Ellsworth started accompanying Carmella to the ring for her matches, helping her win.[38] Ellsworth entered the 2017 Royal Rumble match at number 11, but he was eliminated by Braun Strowman after only 15 seconds.[39] Throughout the months of January and February, Ellsworth appeared in various backstage segments with Carmella, often helping Carmella win by distracting her opponents.[40] Ellsworth made his WrestleMania debut on April 2 at WrestleMania 33, managing Carmella in the six-pack challenge for the Smackdown Women's Championship which was won by Naomi.[41] On April 25, Carmella and Ellsworth formed an alliance with Natalya and the returning Tamina.[42] On the May 16 episode of _SmackDown Live_, Carmella scored a victory over Naomi in a non-title match via distraction from Ellsworth.[43] Dubbed The Welcoming Committee, the team of Carmella, Natalya and Tamina managed by Ellsworth defeated Flair, Lynch and Naomi in a six-woman tag team match on May 21 at Backlash.[44] On June 18 at Money In the Bank, Ellsworth helped Carmella win the first ever Women's Money in the Bank ladder match by pushing Becky Lynch off the ladder and dropping the briefcase to Carmella.[45]

On June 17, 2018 at Money in the Bank, Ellsworth made his return to WWE, by helping Carmella retain the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship against Asuka, reestablishing himself as a heel and reigniting his on-screen relationship with Carmella from 2017 on a night to night contract.[51][52] At Extreme Rules, Ellsworth was suspended above the ring in a shark cage during Asuka's rematch with Carmella.[53] Ellsworth tried to escape the cage after breaking the lock, only to become entangled and stuck, distracting Asuka and allowing Carmella to defeat her.[54] On the July 24 episode of _SmackDown Live_, Ellsworth interrupted a SummerSlam WWE Championship contract signing between AJ Styles and Samoa Joe, during which Ellsworth got fired after he insulted General Manager Paige.[55][56][57][58] He later appeared at SmackDown 1000, on a video uploaded to WWE's website and YouTube account, where he claimed he should have been a part of the show.[59]

Return to independent circuit (2018–present)

On January 21, 2018, Ellsworth made an appearance for Destiny World Wrestling, where he won the first-ever Santino Cobra Cup, interfering in a match between Austin Aries and Pete Dunne and using his Cobra Cup win to challenge Dunne to a match which he lost via pinfall.[60] On February 11, Ellsworth appeared for Championship Wrestling From Hollywood, where he challenged Nick Aldis for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but he was defeated.[61] On February 20, Ellsworth proclaimed himself the World Intergender Champion, creating his own championship.[62] The first defense of the World Intergender Championship came on February 22 at BAR Wrestling, where he defeated Joey Ryan.[63] Ellsworth teamed with Gillberg and captured the ACW Tag Team Championship a second time on April 1.[64]

On September 2, 2018, Ellsworth teamed with Frank The Clown losing to former WCW World Heavyweight Champion David Arquette and RJ City in a tag team match at _Warrior Wrestling 2_.[65]
