Background

Work on _Samo_ began in 2015. It features Nina's successful, characteristic musical expression. The album's release was intended to be much earlier, but the Eurovision Song Contest project prolonged the process. With this album, Nina presented herself as a songwriter and composer with the songs "Lay you down" and "Lullaby". Nina wrote ''Lullaby'' when she was 18 years old, dedicating the song to her late grand grandmother. The song ''Što te nema'' features the Croatian pianist Matija Dedić. _Ata ey foshehu sham_ is written in Hebrew, _Negdje_ is the Croatian version of the same song.
