The 1944 WELLINGTON CITY MAYORAL ELECTION was part of the New Zealand local elections held that same year. In 1944, election were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method.

The incumbent Mayor, Thomas Hislop did not stand for another term. Instead, Will Appleton stood as the candidate for the Citizens' Association. Trade unionist James Roberts who was the President of the Labour Party was his Party's candidate.


Background

The Citizens' Association only narrowly staved off a selection dispute between current mayor Thomas Hislop and councillor Will Appleton. Appleton said he would stand for mayor as an independent should he not be granted the Citizens' nomination. Declining arbitration, Appleton got his wish when Hislop (albeit reluctantly) agreed to stand aside in the interests of unity.
