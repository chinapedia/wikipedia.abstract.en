THE GANTOCKS is a small group of rocks, lying off Dunoon in the upper Firth of Clyde, West of Scotland.

A navigation beacon was constructed on the rocks circa 1886. The beacon is 44 feet in height.[1][2]

The MV _Akka_ was lost, after running onto the Gantocks on 9 April 1956.[3] The PS _Waverley_ ran aground on the rocks on 15 July 1977, with 715 passengers on board.[4][5]

The Gantocks Beacon was repainted and maintenance was carried out during 2018. [6]
