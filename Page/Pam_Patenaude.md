PAMELA HUGHES PATENAUDE (born January 20, 1961) was the United States Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from September 2017 to January 2019.[1]

Prior to her position at HUD, she served as president of the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America's Families and as director of housing policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.[2] She served as Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary for Community, Planning and Development during the George W. Bush Administration. She was proposed as a candidate for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Trump administration,[3] but was ultimately nominated for the role of Deputy Secretary under eventual Secretary Ben Carson.[4] This nomination was confirmed by an 80â€“17 vote of the U.S. Senate on September 14, 2017.[5][6] She resigned at the end of 2018 after a series of disagreements with Carson and the Trump White House, including addressing racial segregation and the Trump Administration's effort to withhold congressionally appropriated money to Puerto Rico for Hurricane Maria relief.[7]
