Manuel Alejandro Medrano LÃ³pez (October 29, 1987,Cartagena, Colombia), known as MANUEL MEDRANO, is a Colombian pop singer[1] and a winner of two Latin Grammy Awards.


Start

His singing and songwriting are a way of saying thanks for supporting his family. The story of Manuel Medrano begins when he failed a school year and, as "punishment," he received a guitar. From the age of 16 he began writing songs, which motivated him to start a career as a solo artist.[2]

For several years he played in bars in Bogota while composing his songs, which, years later, made him popular at the national level.


Recognition

In August 2014 he released "Afuera del planeta," his first independent single. Playback of the song increased gradually on national radio to the point of becoming one of the hits of the year. Thanks to this song, he was nominated twice to the Shock music awards: in the Best New Artist and Best Shock Presents categories.

In early 2015 he signed with multinational label Warner Music and, months later, released his second promotional single "Bajo el agua," which accumulated more than 75,000,000 views on YouTube and was well received in Colombia and Mexico.

In the year 2016 he won two Latin Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Songwriting Album.

Manuel Medrano composes romantic music that he calls pop-cast, because it doesn't come from a specific genre, but from various influences of Latin American singer-songwriters.[3]
