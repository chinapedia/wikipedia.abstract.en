AL-HURRA or AL HURRA (etymologically: 'Free Woman') was an Arabic title historically often given to, or used to referred to, women who exercised power or had a position of power or high status.

In a harem, the title al-hurra was often used to refer to a legal wife of aristocratic birth, to distinguish her status from that of the concubine bought at the slave market, who was referred to as _jarya_,[1] and used to describe a Muslim aristocratic woman who was "free" in the sense that she was not a slave;[2] it is related to the style _Sayyida_ (Mistress or lady), the feminine word of _sayyid_ (Master or Lord).[3] However, while the title Al-hurra was given to women as an alternative to the titles _malika_ (Queen), _Sultana_ (female sultan) and _Sitt_, (Lady), there was no exact male equivalent to the title of al-hurra.[4]

The title Al-hurra was often granted to women who wielded political power, but did not necessarily mean they were sovereigns: Alam al-Malika and Sayyida al Hurra, for example, bore this title. Both had political offices; not as sovereigns, but as political adviser and governor respectively.[5]
