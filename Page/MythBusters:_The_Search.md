_MYTHBUSTERS: THE SEARCH_ is a reality competition series that aired on Science. The series aimed to determine the hosts of a reboot of the Discovery Channel series _MythBusters_.


History

The original run of _MythBusters_ concluded in 2016, after its original hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman confirmed in October 2015 that the then-upcoming season would be their 14th and final season.[1] In late March 2016, it was revealed by _Variety_ that Discovery Channel's sister network Science was planning a spin-off reality series, tentatively titled _Search for the Next MythBusters_, which would determine hosts for a revival of the series.[2]

In September 2016, it was announced that _Nerdist_ science editor Kyle Hill would host the series.[3]

The revival, featuring the winners of _The Search_, premiered on Science in November 2017.[4]


Show format

The series started with 10 contestants; in each episode, contestants compete in one team task (two or three teams competing) and one individual task. In each task, as in the original _MythBusters_ series, the contestants are instructed to scientifically test the validity of a claim (with some tasks based on or expanding from myths covered by previous episodes of _MythBusters_). At the end of each episode, an MVP is declared, who is granted immunity from elimination. In most episodes, the worst-performing contestant was eliminated.

-   Tracy Fanara
