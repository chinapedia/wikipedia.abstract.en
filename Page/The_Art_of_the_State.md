_THE ART OF THE STATE: CULTURE, RHETORIC, AND PUBLIC MANAGEMENT_ is a book written by Christopher Hood, first published by Oxford University Press in 1998 with a revised edition published in 2000. In November 1998 it was awarded the W. J. M. Mackenzie award of the Political Studies Association.[1]

Writing in _Public Administration_ Richard J. Stillman II described the book as "a timely and important book, by one of Europeâ€™s most respected administrative scholars".[2] In a review in the _International Public Management Journal_ Eugene Bardach wrote that "For intellectual scope and ambition, _The Art of the State_ is almost without peer in the recent public management literature".[3]
