Personal life

He had a radio broadcast where he would record his sermons in his study and they would be sent to radio stations across the country.[9] Whenever VandenHeuvel's family would visit his grandparents, he made a beeline to his grandfather's study and played with the recording equipment. This is where he credits the beginning of his VO career, playing with his grandpa's recording rig.[10]
