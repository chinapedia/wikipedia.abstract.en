The ALFRED HANSON HOUSE, also known as the HANSON/MCCARTHY HOUSE, is a historic building located in Oelwein, Iowa, United States. Hanson was an Oelwein native who was engaged in farming before he moved back to town and became a banker. He had this house built in 1904. The two-story, frame Colonial Revival was designed by Harry E. Netcott of the Independence, Iowa architectural firm of Netcott & Donnan. Its distinctive features include a two-thirds recessed sun porch that was enclosed in 1957, a Palladian window, and an open Portico on the main facade.[1] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[2]
