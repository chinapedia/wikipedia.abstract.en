The school was founded by the Free Church proponent Otto Treider in 1882[2][3] at Kristian Augusts gate 21,[4] and in its time it was Norway's largest and leading business school, offering courses in accounting, economics, and marketing. Treider College has premises at Nedre Vollgate 8 in Oslo and regional offices in Bergen and Trondheim.[5]

The company Treider Fagskoler AS, which operates the school, is owned by the investment company Anthon B Nilsen AS, one of Scandinavia's largest private companies involved in education.[6]
