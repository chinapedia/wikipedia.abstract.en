The PARISHISHTAPARVAN () also known as the STHAVIRAVALICHARITRA () is a 12th-century Sanskrit mahakavya by Hemachandra which details the histories of the earliest Jain teachers. The poem comprises 3,460 verse couplets divided into 13 cantos of unequal length and is also notable for providing information on the political history of ancient India.

The _Trishashtishalakapurushacharitra_ (; _The Lives of the Sixty-three Illustrious People_), an epic Sanskrit poem on the key figures in Jainism, was composed by Hemachandra at the request of the Chaulukya king, Kumarapala. The Sthaviravalicharitra (_The Lives of the Jain Elders_) is considered a self-contained sequel to this work and is consequently referred to as the Parishishtaparvan or _The Appendix_.

The period largely covered in the poem corresponds to and follows the growth of the kingdom of Magadha and the establishment of the Maurya Empire. According to Hemachandra, the sequence of rulers in the times of the Jains discussed was: Shrenika, Kunika, Udayin, the nine Nandas, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka, and Samprati. Hemachandra also speaks of Samprati being instrumental in the spread of Jainism further south.

The Parishishtaparvan was Hemachandra's last major work.
