JEFFREY RALPH "JEFF" HOLMSTEAD is an American energy lobbyist and lawyer. He is a partner with Houston-based Bracewell LLP[1] and a former deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the George W. Bush administration.[2][3][4][5][6][7] [8] Bracewell LLP is formerly Bracewell & Giuliani, the international law firm of Rudy Giuliani.


Career

While he was an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, Jeff Holmstead sang bass in the choir.[9] He earned degrees in economics and English and decided to study law at Yale. He began his legal career in 1987 after graduation from Yale Law School.

He was appointed and served as deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the George W. Bush administration.[10][11]

He joined Houston-based Bracewell LLP[12] as a lawyer and energy lobbyist and became partner in the firm.

Upon reports that Holmstead might have been appointed to a high-level position in the Environmental Protection Agency or the Trump Cabinet, the _Washington Post_ reported that Holmstead had filed a new, revised lobbying disclosure indicating he had dropped all of his longtime lobbying clients, including Duke Energy, DTE Energy, and Ameren, which he had represented since 2007 in his role with Bracewell.[13][14]


Personal life

Jeff Holmstead is one of five children born to Ralph Kay Holmstead and Melly (Mary Louise Gillison) Holmstead, who were married in the Salt Lake Temple in 1959. Three years later, in 1962, they moved to Boulder, Colorado, where they spent 51 years until his death in 2014, and the entire family practiced their Mormon faith, as his family and children continue to do today. He and his father served first as missionaries, then as congregants and Bishops in the Mormon Church. His father had been a missionary in Tegucigalpa, Honduras and Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, where he learned to speak Spanish fluently. His father graduated from BYU at the top of his class, after working his way through college managing a farm, shearing sheep, and finishing cement. He was a businessman, real estate broker, and investor in Boulder, Colorado.

Jeff Holmstead is a lifelong Mormon and remains active and serves as a bishop in his church. He speaks fluent Spanish. He also is a long-time soccer fan. He and his wife, Lisa[15] (Elizabeth T. Holmstead), are both from Colorado and together have four grown children.[16] Since 2013, they had lived in Gaithersburg, Maryland. [17][18][19] Before 2013, they had lived in Washington, D.C. for two years. They enjoy hiking and the outdoors with their family.
