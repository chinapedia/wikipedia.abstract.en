GUSTAVE FLAUBERT (; 12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist. Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country. He is known especially for his debut novel _Madame Bovary_ (1857), his _Correspondence_, and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert.


Life

Early life and education

Flaubert was born on 12 December 1821, in Rouen, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, in northern France. He was the second son of Anne Justine Caroline (née Fleuriot; 1793–1872) and Achille-Cléophas Flaubert (1784–1846), director and senior surgeon of the major hospital in Rouen.[1] He began writing at an early age, as early as eight according to some sources.[2]

He was educated at the _Lycée Pierre-Corneille_ in Rouen,[3] and did not leave until 1840, when he went to Paris to study law. In Paris, he was an indifferent student and found the city distasteful. He made a few acquaintances, including Victor Hugo. Toward the end of 1840, he travelled in the Pyrenees and Corsica.[4] In 1846, after an attack of epilepsy, he left Paris and abandoned the study of law.

Personal life

From 1846 to 1854, Flaubert had a relationship with the poet Louise Colet; his letters to her have survived.[5] After leaving Paris, he returned to Croisset, near the Seine, close to Rouen, and lived there for the rest of his life. He did however make occasional visits to Paris and England, where he apparently had a mistress.

Politically, Flaubert described himself as a "romantic and liberal old dunce" (_vieille ganache romantique et libérale_),[6] an "enraged liberal" (_libéral enragé_), a hater of all despotism, and someone who celebrated every protest of the individual against power and monopolies.[7][8]

With his lifelong friend Maxime Du Camp, he travelled in Brittany in 1846.[9] In 1849–50 he went on a long journey to the Middle East, visiting Greece and Egypt. In Beirut he contracted syphilis. He spent five weeks in Istanbul in 1850. He visited Carthage in 1858 to conduct research for his novel _Salammbô_.

Flaubert never married and never had children. His reason for not having children is revealed in a letter he sent to Coulet, dated December 11, 1852. In it he revealed that he was opposed to childbirth, saying he would "transmit to no one the aggravations and the disgrace of existence."

Flaubert was very open about his sexual activities with prostitutes in his writings on his travels. He suspected that a chancre on his penis was from a Maronite or a Turkish girl.[10] He also engaged in intercourse with male prostitutes in Beirut and Egypt; in one of his letters, he describes a "pockmarked young rascal wearing a white turban".[11][12]

According to his biographer Émile Faguet, his affair with Louise Colet was his only serious romantic relationship.[13]

Flaubert was a tireless worker and often complained in his letters to friends about the strenuous nature of his work. He was close to his niece, Caroline Commanville, and had a close friendship and correspondence with George Sand. He occasionally visited Parisian acquaintances, including Émile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Ivan Turgenev, and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt.

The 1870s were a difficult time for Flaubert. Prussian soldiers occupied his house during the War of 1870, and his mother died in 1872. After her death, he fell into financial difficulty due to business failures on the part of his niece's husband. Flaubert suffered from venereal diseases most of his life. His health declined and he died at Croisset of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1880 at the age of 58. He was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Rouen. A monument to him by Henri Chapu was unveiled at the museum of Rouen.[14]

As a devoted Spinozist, Flaubert was significantly influenced by Spinoza's thought.

-   Flaubert: "...Yes, you must read Spinoza. Those who accuse him of atheism are asses. Goethe said, 'When I am upset or troubled I reread the _Ethics_.' Perhaps like Goethe you will find calm in the reading of this great book. Ten years ago I lost the friend I had loved more than any other, Alfred Le Poittevin. Fatally ill, he spent his last nights reading Spinoza." (in his letter to Marie-Sophie Leroyer de Chantepie, 1857) [original in French]
-   Flaubert: "...If only I do not make a failure also of _Saint-Antoine_. I am going to start working on it again in a week, when I have finished with Kant and Hegel. These two great men are helping to stupefy me, and when I leave them I fall with eagerness upon my old and thrice great Spinoza. What genius, how fine a work the _Ethics_ is! (...) I knew Spinoza's _Ethics_, but not the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_. The book astounds me; I am dazzled, and transported with admiration. My God, what a man! what an intellect! what learning and what a mind!" (in his letters to George Sand, 1870–72) [original in French]
-   Jacques Derrida: "The most terrifying affirmations, like that of Clement of Alexandria who declares that "Matter is eternal," are drawn from a treasury of the philosophical propositions that most tantalized Flaubert, above all those of Spinoza, for whom his admiration was unlimited, the Spinoza of the _Ethics_ and particularly of the _Tractatus Theologico-politicus_. (...) In a moment, I will venture a hypothesis on the privileged place of Spinoza in Flaubert's library or philosophical dictionary, as well as in his company of philosophers, for his first impulse is always one of admiration for Spinoza the man ("My God, what a man! what an intellect! what learning and what a mind!" "What a genius!")." (_Psyche: Inventions of the Other_, Stanford University Press, 2007) [original in French][15][16][17][18][19] He was also a pantheist.[20]

Writing career

]] His first finished work was _November_, a novella, which was completed in 1842.

In September 1849, Flaubert completed the first version of a novel, _The Temptation of Saint Anthony._ He read the novel aloud to Louis Bouilhet and Maxime Du Camp over the course of four days, not allowing them to interrupt or give any opinions. At the end of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, suggesting instead that he focus on day-to-day life rather than fantastic subjects.

In 1850, after returning from Egypt, Flaubert began work on _Madame Bovary_. The novel, which took five years to write, was serialized in the _Revue de Paris_ in 1856. The government brought an action against the publisher and author on the charge of immorality,[21] which was heard during the following year, but both were acquitted. When _Madame Bovary_ appeared in book form, it met with a warm reception.

In 1858, Flaubert travelled to Carthage to gather material for his next novel, _Salammbô_. The novel was completed in 1862 after four years of work.

Drawing on his youth, Flaubert next wrote _L'Éducation sentimentale_ (_Sentimental Education_), an effort that took seven years. This was his last complete novel, published in the year 1869.

He wrote an unsuccessful drama, _Le Candidat,_ and published a reworked version of _The Temptation of Saint Anthony_, portions of which had been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, _Les Deux Cloportes (The Two Woodlice)_, which later became _Bouvard et Pécuchet_, breaking the obsessive project only to write the _Three Tales_ in 1877. This book comprises three stories: _Un Cœur simple_ (_A Simple Heart_), _La Légende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier_ (_The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller_), and _Hérodias_ (_Herodias_). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished _Bouvard et Pécuchet_, which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity.[22] He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.

At the time of his death, he may have been working on a further historical novel, based on the Battle of Thermopylae.[23]


Perfectionist style

Flaubert famously avoided the inexact, the abstract and the vaguely inapt expression, and scrupulously eschewed the cliché.[24] In a letter to George Sand he said that he spends his time "trying to write harmonious sentences, avoiding assonances."[25][26]

Flaubert believed in and pursued the principle of finding "_le mot juste_" ("the right word"), which he considered as the key means to achieve quality in literary art.[27] He worked in sullen solitude, sometimes occupying a week in the completion of one page, never satisfied with what he had composed.[28] In Flaubert's correspondence he intimates this, explaining correct prose did not flow out of him and that his style was achieved through work and revision.[29]

This painstaking style of writing is also evident when one compares Flaubert's output over a lifetime to that of his peers (for example Balzac or Zola). Flaubert published much less prolifically than was the norm for his time and never got near the pace of a novel a year, as his peers often achieved during their peaks of activity. Walter Pater famously called Flaubert the "martyr of style."[30][31][32][33]


Legacy

In the assessment of critic James Wood:[34]

As a writer, other than a pure stylist, Flaubert was nearly equal parts romantic and realist.[35] Hence, members of various schools, especially realists and formalists, have traced their origins to his work. The exactitude with which he adapts his expressions to his purpose can be seen in all parts of his work, especially in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree to which Flaubert's fame has extended since his death presents "an interesting chapter of literary history in itself".[36] He is also credited with spreading the popularity of the color Tuscany Cypress, a color often mentioned in his chef-d'œuvre _Madame Bovary_.

]]

Flaubert's lean and precise writing style has had a large influence on 20th-century writers such as Franz Kafka and J. M. Coetzee. As Vladimir Nabokov discussed in his famous lecture series:[37]

  The greatest literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from the language of law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.

The publication of _Madame Bovary_ in 1856 was followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Émile Zola.[38] Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.

His _Œuvres Complètes_ (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays _Le Candidat_ and _Le Château des cœurs_. Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873–85. Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.[39]

He has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including philosophers and sociologists such as Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Paul Sartre whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in _The Family Idiot_ was published in 1971. Georges Perec named _Sentimental Education_ as one of his favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from _Perpetual Orgy_, which is solely devoted to Flaubert's art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa's _Letters to a Young Novelist_ (published 2003). In public lecture on May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, Marshall McLuhan claimed that "I derived all my knowledge of media from people like Flaubert and Rimbaud and Baudelaire."[40]
