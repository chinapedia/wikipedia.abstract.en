Critical reception

_Goodbye Terrible Youth_ received favourable reviews upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 77, based on 9 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[1]

Praising the album's improved production values, in comparison to its home-recorded predecessor, _American Wrestlers_, and the participation of the full band, Allmusic's Marcy Donelson wrote: [_Goodbye Terrible Youth_] also exhibits a sleeker sound than the notably rough-hewn debut, with McClure having invested in "a laptop and some decent microphones." Thankfully, these changes don't erode the outfit's free-spirited charisma. If anything, the effect here is more similar to moving from a live recording to the studio than into something that's watered down or compromised."[2]

In a positive review for Pitchfork, Brian Burlage wrote, "The album is a significant improvement for a band that’s still coming into its own, still, in other words, in its youth."[3]
