is a Japanese light novel series written by Hajime Kanzaka and illustrated by Rui Araizumi. The novels had been serialized in _Dragon Magazine_, and were later adapted into several manga titles, anime television series, anime films, OVA series, role-playing video games, and other media. _Slayers_ follows the adventures of teenage sorceress Lina Inverse and her companions as they journey through their world.[1][2] Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits. The anime series is considered to be one of the most popular of the 1990s.[3]


Setting and characters

In the _Slayers_ universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its "true form",[4] which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (_shinzoku_, lit. "godly race") and monsters (_mazoku_, lit. "demon race"), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.

In the world where the _Slayers_ takes place, Flare Dragon Ceiphied and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo are, respectively, the supreme god and monster. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceiphied was able to split Shabranigdo's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdo himself would be destroyed. However, Ceiphied was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in _Slayers_, one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the against one of the parts of Ceiphied, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdo won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdo's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only mazoku could pass.[5]

There are four types of magic within the _Slayers_ universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the mazoku and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Raywing, Fireball, or Elmekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the shinzoku, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible before the death of the mazoku Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, mazoku can only be harmed by spiritual (astral) shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another mazoku with greater might than the target.

Above all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.

Anime television series

The self-titled first season of the anime is a derivative of the light novel's first three volumes. _Slayers NEXT_ was adapted from the events of volumes 4-8. _Slayers TRY_ is an original story. However, a fourth season, _Slayers AGAIN_, was rumored following the success of _TRY_, but early scheduling conflicts caused interest in the project to dissipate.[22]

A fourth anime series, _Slayers Revolution_, premiered in Japan on July 2, 2008.[23] Megumi Hayashibara, the voice actress for main character Lina Inverse, performed both the opening and ending theme songs.[24] The new plot is told across two 13-episode arcs and follows an original storyline that has subplots based on events in the novels, with series director Takashi Watanabe and production studio J.C.Staff reprising their duties from the three original TV series.[25] A fifth _Slayers_ series titled _Slayers Evolution-R_ is the second 13-episode arc of _Slayers Revolution_ and was aired on AT-X starting on January 12, 2009 in Japan.[26]

USA adaptations

Central Park Media licensed and distributed the anime in North America under the Software Sculptors label on VHS and Laserdisc between 1996 and 1998, collected in eight volumes.[27] It was a commercial success for Central Park, which led them to license _Slayers NEXT_ and _Slayers TRY_; _NEXT_ was first shipped from April 1999 in a similar format. A box set of the first four volumes was released in July 1999, and a box set of the second four volumes in October.[28] _Slayers TRY_ was released later in 2000. The first three seasons were subsequently re-released on DVD (in season box sets). Months before Central Park's license for the anime properties expired, FUNimation Entertainment was able to obtain the license and it aired as part of the new owner's programming block on CoLours TV, as well as the FUNimation Channel.[29] The first bilingual DVD box set after FUNimation's rescue of the license was released on August 27, 2007 retaining the Software Sculptors-produced English dub.[30] A boxset of _Slayers_, _NEXT_ and _TRY_ was released by Funimation on August 4, 2009.[31]

Fox Kids won the rights to broadcast _Slayers_ but eventually did not air the anime since it would be too heavy to edit it for content. The first North American television broadcast of _The Slayers_ was February 17, 2002 on the International Channel.[32] In 2009, MVM Films began releasing the series in the United Kingdom on a monthly basis. The first series was released on four DVDs between January 5, and April 6, 2009. The first volume of _Slayers NEXT_ was released on May 11, 2009.[33] Episodes have also been made available on the streaming video sites Hulu, YouTube, Crackle, Anime News Network, Netflix, and Funimation's website.[34]

NYAV Post was able to reunite most of the original Central Park Media main character cast for the new season. However, Michael Sinterniklaas replaced David Moo as Xellos.[36] Other notable characters, such as Sylphiel, Prince Phil, and Naga the Serpent were also recast with new voice actors. In December 2009, Funimation announced that the first _Slayers Revolution_ boxset would be released on March 16, 2010.[37] Funimation released the first four English-dubbed episodes of _Slayers Revolution_ to YouTube on January 19, 2010.[38] They have also uploaded the first two English-dubbed episodes of _Evolution-R_ to YouTube and released _Evolution-R_ on DVD in June 2010.

Games

Traditional games

The series was adapted into an add-on for the Japanese role-playing game _MAGIUS_ (_Slayers MAGIUS RPG_).[47] In 2003, Guardians of Order published a licensed role-playing game _The Slayers d20_ using the d20 System,[48] as well as three guidebooks including pages of game statistics in their _"Big Eyes, Small Mouth"_ game system for the TV series' major characters, spells and weapons.[49] A collectible card game _Slayers Fight_ (スレイヤーズふぁいと) was developed by ORG and published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1999-2001.

Video games

A series of five _Slayers_ role-playing video games were released exclusively in Japan between 1994 and 1998 for different platforms. There are two different 16-bit games released in 1994 and titled simply _Slayers_ (including one for the Super Famicom), followed by three 32-bit console games: 1997's _Slayers Royal_, and 1998's _Slayers Royal 2_ and _Slayers Wonderful_. In addition, some _Slayers_ characters are featured in 2012's _Heroes Phantasia_[50] and in the doujin game _Magical Battle Arena_.


Reception

The first volume of the Slayers series was published in January 1990. So far it has 50 volumes in total (original series: 15 volumes, Special series: 30 volumes, the Smash series: five volumes), and its total print reached over 18 million copies, as of July 2015.[51] As of 2018, it has sold 20million copies.[52]

Of the various media which make up the _Slayers_ franchise, the anime has by far reached the largest audience and is considered to be one of the most popular series of the 1990s.[53] As it is a parody of the high fantasy genre, the series's driving force lies in comic scenarios alluding to other specific anime, or more general genre tropes and clichés. Due to the series' comedic nature, less development is given to plot and characters, which some consider predictable. Nevertheless, the series' focus on humor and entertainment and "old school" anime feel make it a nostalgic classic to many.[54]

In _Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know_, Gilles Poitras wrote: "More humorous and less serious looking than the characters in the _Lodoss War_ series, the stars of _Slayers_ provide action and laughs."[55] In _The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917_, Helen McCarthy similarly called it "the antidote to the deadly serious _Record of Lodoss War_, with a cynical cast modeled on argumentative role-players. (...) Ridiculing its own shortcomings, _Slayers_ has successfully kept a strong following that watches for what some might call biting satire, and others bad workmen blaming their tools."[56]

Joseph Luster of _Otaku USA_ called it "the very definition of an all-encompassing media franchise. (...) _Slayers_ certainly has that in its memorable lineup, and they'll likely cast some sort of spell on you, regardless of age."[57] Paul Thomas Chapman from the same magazine opined it is a "franchise whose remarkable longevity and popularity is matched only by its remarkable averageness," especially regarding the various aspects of the TV series, but still appealing to him and making him return to it when he looks for a light entertainment.[58]
