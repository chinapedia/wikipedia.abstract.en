Early life and education

Treworgy was born on February 6, 1954. She received her Bachelor of Science from Principia College in 1975.[1] She went to the University of Illinois and received her Masters in 1983 and her PhD in 1985. Her dissertation was titled "Stratigraphy and depositional settings of the Chesterian (Mississippian) Fraileys/Big Clifty and Haney Formations in the Illinois Basin”.[2]


Career

Treworgy made significant contributions towards the creation of a highly detailed network of structural cross sections of the Paleozoic succession in the Illinois Basin.[3]

In 2000, Treworgy became a teacher at Principia College. In 2002, a mammoth tooth was accidentally unearthed on campus and she led a team to excavate the area. She cofounded the Countryside School of Champaign, where she served as president of the board from 1992-1995.[4]

Treworgy was the chair of the Department of Geology at Principia College and a member of the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS).[5] Her research primarily focused on the Illinois Basin particularly the stratigraphy, depositional environments, and tectonic history.[6]
