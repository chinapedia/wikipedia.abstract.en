ALSAT-1B is an Algerian satellite operated by the Agence Spatiale Algerienne for agricultural and disaster monitoring.[1][2] The contract for the mission was signed in July 2014. The satellite is based on the SSTL-100 bus. The satellite weighs and carries an earth imaging payload with panchromatic imager and multispectral cameras.[3][4]


Construction

The satellite had high participation from ASAL, with eighteen engineers that worked on assembly, integration, and test. Additionally, at the University of Surrey, 18 students used the satellite as a part of their graduate degree research.[5]


Launch

The satellite was launched on 26 September 2016 into a altitude polar orbit by ISRO using the PSLV-C35 rocket.[6] It was launched with several other satellites. The primary payload was SCATSAT 1, which was launched into a Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit. This was the first time PSLV launched satellites into different orbits. Algeria had three satellites that it will operate launch in that group, which were AlSat-1B, AlSat 2B, and AlSat-Nano. AlSat-2B also had imaging capabilities, but they are higher resolution than AlSat-1B. Of the eight satellites launched by PSLV, five of them were foreign. The remaining satellites were BlackSky Pathfinder 1, Pratham, PISat, and CanX 7.[7][8]

Alsat-1B uses three body mounted solar panels for power generation, and a 15 Amp-hour Li-Ion battery for power storage. It uses warm gas, butane powered resistojets for propulsion.[9] The attitude control system uses sun sensors and magnetometers.[10]
