_COENOBITA SPINOSUS_ is one of the sixteen species of terrestrial hermit crabs.


Range and habitat

_C. spinosus_ can be found on Polynesian islands, Melanesia, Micronesia, the Marianne Islands and the northern coast of Australia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, and Henderson Island in the Pitcairn Islands where it has been observed to use plastic debris for protection.[1][2]

_C. spinosus_ notably lives in forests and wetlands, but can also be found on beaches and in lagoons.[3]


Anatomy

They possess long hairy spines on their legs; although some other species have these spines, none are as long as _C. spinosus_.
