The STERADIAN (symbol: SR) or SQUARE RADIAN[1][2] is the SI unit of solid angle. It is used in three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, which quantifies planar angles. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, gives a _length_ on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an _area_ on the surface. The name is derived from the Greek στερεός _stereos_ 'solid' + radian.

The steradian, like the radian, is a dimensionless unit, the area subtended and the square of its distance from the center: both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension length squared (i.e. , dimensionless). It is useful, however, to distinguish between dimensionless quantities of a different nature, so the symbol "sr" is used to indicate a solid angle. For example, radiant intensity can be measured in watts per steradian (W⋅sr^(−1)). The steradian was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the steradian is now considered an SI derived unit.


Definition

A steradian can be defined as the solid angle subtended at the center of a unit sphere by a unit area on its surface. For a general sphere of radius _r_, any portion of its surface with area subtends one steradian at its center.[3]

The solid angle is related to the area it cuts out of a sphere:

$$\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}\ \mathrm{sr} \, = \frac{2\pi h}{r}\ \mathrm{sr}$$

    where

        is the surface area of the spherical cap, 2πrh,

        is the radius of the sphere, and

        sr is the unit, steradian.

Because the surface area _A_ of a sphere is 4_r_², the definition implies that a sphere subtends 4 steradians (≈ 12.56637 sr) at its center. By the same argument, the maximum solid angle that can be subtended at any point is 4 sr.


Other properties

Steradian_cone_and_cap.svg If , it corresponds to the area of a spherical cap () (where _h_ stands for the "height" of the cap) and the relationship holds. Therefore, in this case, one steradian corresponds to the plane (i.e. radian) angle of the cross-section of a simple cone subtending the plane angle 2_θ_, with _θ_ given by:

$$\begin{align}
\theta & = \arccos \left( \frac{r-h}{r} \right)\\
       & = \arccos \left( 1 - \frac{h}{r} \right)\\
       & = \arccos \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2\pi} \right) \approx 0.572 \,\text{ rad,} \text{ or } 32.77^\circ.
\end{align}$$

This angle corresponds to the plane aperture angle of 2_θ_ ≈ 1.144 rad or 65.54°.

A steradian is also equal to the spherical area of a polygon having an angle excess of 1 radian, to of a complete sphere, or to ≈ 3282.80635 square degrees.

The solid angle of a cone whose cross-section subtends the angle 2_θ_ is:

_Ω_ = 2_π_(1−cos_θ_) _s__r_
.


SI multiples

Millisteradians (msr) and microsteradians (μsr) are occasionally used to describe light and particle beams.[4][5] Other multiples are rarely used.

Solid angles over 4 steradians—the solid angle of a full Euclidean sphere—are rarely encountered.
