ATHELAS is a serif typeface designed by Veronika Burian and Jose Scaglione and intended for use in body text.[1] Released by their company TypeTogether in 2008, Burian and Scaglione described Athelas as inspired by British fine book printing.[2][3][4]

Athelas is included as a system font in Apple's macOS operating system and as a default font in its iBooks e-books application.[5][6] It won joint first prize for best Latin-alphabet body text face at the Granshan International Type Design Competition in 2008.[7] It is named after a healing herb in Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_.[8] Cyrillic characters were later added to the font family, designed by Tom Grace, and monotonic Greek characters designed by Irene Vlachou.[9][10]
