It has an erect, hairy leaf and up to three flowers which are a combination of red, green, white and yellow. It is found in the high rainfall forests and coastal heath of the far south-west corner of Western Australia and is the only caladenia to grow in karri forest.


Description

_Caladenia brownii_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. There are up to three flowers which are a combination of red, green, white and yellow on a stem high. The flowers are long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely and have narrow, red, scent-producing glands on their ends. The labellum is greenish-yellow with a red tip and its sides have long, narrow teeth or "calli". There are four or more rows of red calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs between October and early December and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.[1][2][3]
