NIKLAUS EMIL WIRTH (born 15 February 1934) is a Swiss computer scientist. He has designed several programming languages, including Pascal, and pioneered several classic topics in software engineering. In 1984 he won the Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science,[1][2] for developing a sequence of innovative computer languages.[3]


Biography

Wirth was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, in 1934. In 1959 he earned a degree in Electronics Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH Zürich). In 1960 he earned an M.Sc. from Université Laval, Canada. Then in 1963 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by the computer designer pioneer Harry Huskey.

From 1963 to 1967 he served as assistant professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and again at the University of Zurich. Then in 1968 he became Professor of Informatics at ETH Zürich, taking two one-year sabbaticals at Xerox PARC in California (1976–1977 and 1984–1985). Wirth retired in 1999.

In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum "for seminal work in programming languages and algorithms, including Euler, Algol-W, Pascal, Modula, and Oberon."[4]


Programming languages

Niklaus_Wirth_large.jpg Wirth was the chief designer of the programming languages Euler, Algol W, Pascal,[5] Modula, Modula-2, Oberon, Oberon-2, and Oberon-07. He was also a major part of the design and implementation team for the Lilith and Oberon operating systems, and for the Lola digital hardware design and simulation system. He received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Turing Award for the development of these languages in 1984 and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM.


Publications

His book, written jointly with Kathleen Jensen, _The Pascal User Manual and Report_, served as the basis of many language implementation efforts in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and across Europe.

His article _Program Development by Stepwise Refinement_, about the teaching of programming, is considered to be a classic text in software engineering.[6] In 1975 he wrote the book _Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs_, which gained wide recognition.[7] Major revisions of this book with the new title _Algorithms + Data Structures_ were published in 1985 and 2004. The examples in the first edition were written in Pascal. These were replaced in the later editions with examples written in Modula-2 and Oberon respectively.

His textbook, _Systematic Programming: An Introduction_, was considered a good source for students who wanted to do more than just coding. Regarded as a challenging text to work through, it was sought as imperative reading for those interested in numerical mathematics.[8]

In 1992 he published (together with Jürg Gutknecht) the full documentation of the Oberon OS.[9]. A second book (together with Martin Reiser) was intended as a programmer's guide.[10]


Wirth's law

In 1995, he popularized the adage now known as Wirth's law, which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster. In his 1995 paper _A Plea for Lean Software_ he attributes it to Martin Reiser.[11]
