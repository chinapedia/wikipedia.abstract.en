ELLIOT STOCK (1838 - 1 March 1911) was an English publisher and bibliophile who collected first editions.[1] The publishing company that bore his name was in business from 1859 to 1939.[2]

His father was wealthy but died when Eliot was in his infancy. After education at Amersham Grammar School, Elliot Stock first worked for the firm of Piper, Stephenson, and Spence and then in 1857 became an apprentice to Mr. B. L. Green, a book-seller at 62, Paternoster Row. In 1859 Stock acquired the business. B. L. Green was the brother of Dr. Green of the Religious Tract Society. In its early years, the firm of Elliot Stock was primarily engaged in publishing religious works. In 1866 Stock married Fanny Bellin, the daughter of Samuel Bellin, an artist and engraver. Stock became an amateur painter and poet and acquired many artistic and literary friends and acquaintances. He was also a bird-watcher and athlete (winning a silver cup in rowing).[3][4] In 1877 Stock published facsimile first editions of _The Pilgrim's Progress_, _The Compleat Angler_ and George Herbert's _The Temple_. Every effort was made to recreate the actual type, paper, and binding of the original works in these facsimiles.[5] Stock's firm published many other notable facsimile first editions, such as those for _Robinson Crusoe_, _Rasselas_ and _The Vicar of Wakefield_.[6] _The Antiquary_ was published by the Elliot Stock company from December 1879 to 1915. The monthly _Book-Prices Current_ was started in 1887 by the firm of Elliot Stock and became a standard reference for book dealers and collectors.[7]

Elliot Stock and Fanny R. Bellin were the parents of four sons and a daughter. Their son Ernest Elliot Stock (1869â€“1957) was the author of _The Ring of Ug, and Other Weird Tales_[8] and publications on climbing in the Alps.[9]
