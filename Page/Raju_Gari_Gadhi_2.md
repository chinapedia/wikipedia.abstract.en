Plot

The film begins with three youngsters Ashwin (Ashwin Babu), Kishore (Vennela Kishore), and Praveen (Praveen), who are friends from college days, deciding to lead a life by investing in a resort business. As they start the business, everything goes smoothly until they begin to witness paranormal activities in the resort, making their lives tougher. Immediately, they contact a nearby Church Father (Naresh), but it fails miserably, and their fear of that ghost increases. The Father suggests them to approach a world-renowned mentalist named Rudra (Nagarjuna Akkineni) who has parlor tricks, mental tenacity to make clever guesses, special powers of contacting with the spirits, and also assists the Police Department as a human lie detector with his cold reading techniques. Rudra decides to solve out the mystery in the resort. Beyond a shadow of the doubt, he finds out that it is a soul of a girl Amrutha (Samantha Akkineni), who is seeking answers for her death. Rudra ensures Amrutha that he will definitely help her. So, she starts revealing her past. Amrutha was a bright and intelligent student who has grown up with values and norms given by her father Parandhamaiah (Rao Ramesh). Once, she goes out on a college excursion when someone secretly films her while bathing in the same resort which is purchased by three youngsters and uploaded it in the internet, which led to her fatherâ€™s death. After that, Amrutha also committed suicide due to the pain caused by the society. Now, Rudra starts his investigation to catch the real culprit. At last, he cracks the mystery it is Kiran (Abhinaya), the daughter of Chandra Shekar (Devan), who is the Vice Chancellor of the Institution. The reason behind Kiran's deed is jealousy, about Amrutha's popularity and her love interest Nandu's (Nandu) fondness towards Amrutha. After knowing the truth, Amrutha tries to kill Kiran, but Rudra obstructs her way by remembering the morals taught by her father and make her soul rest in peace. Finally, the movie ends with the three youngsters running their resort successfully with a caution that cell phones are not allowed and Rudra moving towards a new mission.
