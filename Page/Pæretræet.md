PÆRETRÆET, literally THE PEAR TREE is a listed property at Nybrogade 4 in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark.


History

Nybrogade_1840.jpg The building dates from the reconstruction of the area following the devastating Copenhagen Fire of 1728. It was built in 1729-1730 by the master builders Andreas Sørensen and Lars Erichsen (born before 1700 - died after 1734) for a laborer at the Royal Orphanage (_Vejerhuset_) Hans Blasen. The building received its name after a large pear tree which stood three storeys tall in front of it.[1]

Blasen had been licensed as a beer seller (_øltapper_) in 1709, which business he ran from the cellar of his new building. He died in i 1737. His son, Niels Hansen Blasen, took over operations but sold the property in about 1745.

The royal pawn shop, Assistenshuset, located next door, took over the building in 1793. For many years it then served as residence for its director.


Architecture

The third storey was added in the 1840s. It replaced a two-storey wall dormer. A two-storey side wing extends from the rear side of the building.[2]
