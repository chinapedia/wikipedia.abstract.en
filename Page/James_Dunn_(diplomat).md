JAMES STANLEY DUNN (born 6 January 1928) is a former Australian public servant and diplomat. He was Australia's consul in Portuguese Timor from 1962 to 1964.

In 1977 Dunn's report on war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Indonesian troops in East Timor was released, prompting international attention.[1] He alleged that American weapons had been used in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975.[2] He also argued that Australia's policy related to East Timor was inadequate.[3]

His book _Timor: A People Betrayed_ (published 1983) was a tribute to the tragedy of the Timorese. The book was launched by Gordon McIntosh at the Lakeside Hotel in Canberra.[4] In a review published in _Woroni_, Dunn was praised for his sincere tone.[5] J.A.C. Mackie, writing for _The Canberra Times_ wrote that the book was "disappointingly unconvincing".[6]

In the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, Dunn was made a Member of the Order of Australia for "service to humanity as an advocate for the rights of the East Timorese."[7]
