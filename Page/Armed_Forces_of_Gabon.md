The ARMED FORCES OF GABON (French: Forces armées gabonaises) is the national professional military of the Republic of Gabon, divided into the Army, Air Force, Navy, and a National Gendarmerie, consisting of about 5,000 personnel. Gabonese forces are oriented to the defense of the country and have not been trained for an offensive role. The armed forces includes a well-trained, well-equipped 1,800-member guard that provides security for the President of Gabon.


Organizational Structure

Army

The GABONESE ARMY (_Armée de terre gabonaise_) is the land component of the armed forces, specializing in infantry and mechanized reconnaissance. It was created on December 6, 1960 by decree of president Leon Mba from non-commissioned officers who served in the French colonial army, mainly the 2nd company of the 21st BIMA. Following independence, Gabon signed defense agreements with France, mainly on technical assistance and training. Until June 1964, the title of Chief of Staff of the Gabonese Armed Forces was held by a senior French Army officer. In 1962 a detachment of the Auxiliary Women of the Gabonese Armed Forces (AFFAG), commanded by Lieutenant Ba Oumar at the military camp of Owendo, was created. President Mba promoted the initiative following a visit to Tel Aviv, Israel, where he met female staff in its Defense Forces.

National Gendarmerie

The NATIONAL GENDARMERIE OF GABON (_Gendarmerie nationale gabonaise_) is the national police force of Gabon responsible for law enforcement in the country. It was formed on March 10, 1960 when Gabon, formerly French Equatorial Africa, gained its independence from France. It originated from Libreville Gendarmerie Detachment 1929, which was commanded by Governor General of French Equatorial Africa, Félix Eboue. The main tasks of the gendarmerie are to defend the country's borders, ensure public safety, and to enforce actions taken by judicial and government authorities. The National Gendarmerie is under the direct command of the President of Gabon.[2][3][4]

The following is a list heads of the National Gendarmerie since 1964:

-   Lieutenant-Colonel Piette (1964 - 1967)
-   Lieutenant-Colonel Maitrier (1967 - 1969)
-   General Nkoma Georges (1969 - 1979)
-   General Nzong André (1979 - 1990)
-   General Mamiaka Raphael (1990 - 1994)

-   General Olery Honoré (2002 - 2008)
-   General Sougou Abel (2008 - 2012)
-   General Ekou Jean (since 2012)

The Gendarmerie is also in charge of the Republican Guard (_Garde républicaine, GR_).[5]
