CARIN GOLDBERG (born June 12, 1953) is an American graphic designer, publication designer and brand consultant.


Early life and education

Carin Goldberg was born in New York City on June 12, 1953 and grew up in Long Island and New Jersey. She graduated from the Cooper Union in 1975 with a BFA in painting. While studying there, she completed work with Marilyn Hoffner, the school's director of alumni relations. She worked on logotypes until she was finally promoted to junior designer. [1][2][3]


Career

Encouraged by school's director of alumni relations, Marilyn Hoffner, Goldberg worked up a set of logos to present to alumni Lou Dorfsman at CBS. She was hired on as a junior designer in 1977. She moved on to CBS Records in 1979 with former classmate Gene Greif, and worked with Paula Scher, Henrietta Condak and John Berg.[4]

In 1982, Goldberg started her own firm, Carin Goldberg Design. There, she worked on Madonna's debut album and the 1986 edition of James Joyce's _Ulysses_. Her work on the _Ulysses_ cover, placed her in the midst of the 1980s fight over appropriation. Philip Meggs praised her in his 1989 essay "The Women Who Saved New York!" for using historical styles in contemporary design; while Tibor Kalman vilified her for practicing "jive modernism" in his 1991 _Print_ essay "Good History/Bad History." Over the years, her work has appeared in and on the covers of the _New York Times Book Review_, the _New York Times Magazine_, _New York Magazine_, _The Atlantic Monthly_, and _Wired_.[5]

In 1983, Goldberg began teaching graphic design at the School of Visual Arts. In 2006, she served as president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts New York Chapter until 2008.[6] In 2008, she was honored by the Art Directors Club for her work in education.[7] In 2009, AIGA awarded her the prestigious AIGA Medal for his contributions to the field of graphic design.[8] Carin won the Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon Polsky Rome Prize for Design in 2014.[9]
