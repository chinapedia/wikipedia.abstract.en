DUKKHA (; Pāli; Sanskrit: _duḥkha_) is an important Buddhist concept, commonly translated as "suffering", "pain", "unsatisfactoriness" or "stress".[1][2][3][4] It refers to the fundamental unsatisfactoriness and painfulness of mundane life. It is the first of the Four Noble Truths and it is one of the three marks of existence. The term is also found in scriptures of Hinduism, such as the Upanishads, in discussions of moksha (spiritual liberation).[5][6]


Etymology and meaning

_Dukkha_ (Pali; Sanskrit _duḥkha_) is a term found in ancient Indian literature, meaning anything that is "uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness".[7] It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of life that innately includes the "unpleasant", "suffering," "pain," "sorrow", "distress", "grief" or "misery."[8] The term _Dukkha_ does not have a one word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences.[9][10] It is opposed to the word _sukha_, meaning "happiness," "comfort" or "ease."

The word is commonly explained as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,

Joseph Goldstein, American vipassana teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:

However, according to Monier Monier-Williams, the actual roots of the Pali term _dukkha_ appear to be Sanskrit दुस्- (_dus-_, "bad") + स्था (_stha_, "to stand"). Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various Prakrits led to a shift from _dus-sthā_ to _duḥkha_ to _dukkha_.


Buddhism

Contemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of _dukkha_. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term _dukkha_ as "suffering." Later translators have emphasized that "suffering" is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc. Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term "unsatisfactoriness" to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha. Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term _dukkha_, and many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.

Within the Buddhist sutras, dukkha is divided in three categories:

-   _Dukkha-dukkha_, the dukkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of birth, aging, illness, dying; distress from what is not desirable.
-   _Viparinama-dukkha_, the dukkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.
-   _Sankhara-dukkha_, the dukkha of conditioned experience. This includes "a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance."[11] On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.

Various sutras sum up how life in this "mundane world" is regarded to be _dukkha_, starting with _samsara_, the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:

1.  Birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, illness is dukkha, death is dukkha;
2.  Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha;
3.  Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha;
4.  Not getting what is wanted is dukkha.
5.  In conclusion, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.

_Dukkha_ is one of the three marks of existence, namely _dukkha_ ("suffering"), _anatta_ (not-self), _anicca_ ("impermanence").

The Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of _dukkha_, the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the Four Noble Truths.


Hinduism

In Hindu literature, the earliest Upani{{IAST — the {{IAST and the {{IAST — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|See, e.g., Patrick Olivelle (1996), _Upaniads_ (Oxford: Oxford University Press), , p. xxxvi: "The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the {{IAST and the are the two earliest [[Upanishads|Upani In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word _dukha_ (दुःख) appears in the sense of "suffering, sorrow, distress", and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of Atman (soul/self).[12][13][14]

The verse 4.4.14 of the states:

+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| English                                                      | Sanskrit |
+==============================================================+==========+
| While we are still here, we have come to know it [_{{IAST_]. | [16]     |
| If you've not known it, great is your destruction.           |          |
| Those who have known it — they become immortal.              |          |
| As for the rest — only suffering awaits them.[15]            |          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+

The verse 7.26.2 of the states:

+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| English                                    | Sanskrit |
+============================================+==========+
| When a man rightly sees [his soul],[17]    | [19]     |
| he sees no death, no sickness or distress. |          |
| When a man rightly sees,                   |          |
| he sees all, he wins all, completely.[18]  |          |
+--------------------------------------------+----------+

The concept of sorrow and suffering, and self-knowledge as a means to overcome it, appears extensively with other terms in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads.[20] The term _Duhkha_ also appears in many other middle and later post-Buddhist Upanishads such as the verse 6.20 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad,[21] as well as in the Bhagavada Gita, all in the context of moksha.[22] The term also appears in the foundational Sutras of the six schools of Hindu philosophy, such as the opening lines of _Samkhya karika_ of the Samkhya school.[23][24]


Comparison of Buddhism and Hinduism

Both Hinduism and Buddhism emphasize that one overcomes _dukha_ through the development of understanding. However, the two religions widely differ in the nature of that understanding. Hinduism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of Atman (self, soul) and Brahman, while Buddhism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of Anatta (Anatman, non-self, non-soul) as each discusses the means to liberation from _Dukkha_.[25][26]
