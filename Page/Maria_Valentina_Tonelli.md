Biography

Wife of the architect and urban planner Michele Valori, Valentina Tonelli graduated from Sapienza University in Rome with a degree in Pharmacy in 1963. With her choice of degree, she followed in the footsteps and traditions of her family, but in doing so she did not abandon her passion for writing, which she pursued through her research into testimonies and diaries.

A descendant of the ancient Buffa di Perrero family, she edited various volumes of family memoirs.

She expressed a similar commitment in her conservation of the artistic and intellectual work of Michele Valori, which she was able to collect and pass on to the rich archive acquired in 2007 by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities for the collection of MAXXI Architecture. However, the story of the reassembling of Michele Valori's private archive actually began as early as 1980, as Tonelli realised the importance of acknowledging his indisputable skills with a complete collection. With perseverance and determination, she was able to recover all her husband's papers, both professional and academic, from across his studios and their home.

In this way, she succeeded in reconstructing a body of documentary information of great value to the Italian architectural scene, and which was extremely significant in terms of the memories it encompassed and the affection it showed.

In 1995, the archive of Michele Valori's projects and writings was declared of historical interest by the Archival Superintendency of Lazio, who described it as "a precious resource for the history of architecture and urbanism in Italy".

It was thanks to the generous donation of Maria Valentina Tonelli and her daughters Giovanna, Paola and Francesca that MAXXI Architecture received the entire archive in 2007, catalogued and digitised in line with the archival standards of the Museum in order to facilitate consultation and promote historical research.

Always committed to supporting and promoting cultural initiatives, putting it at the forefront of the sector alongside the great cultural and artistic institutions, in 2011 the museum founded the Michele Valori Association, which it will lead with tenacity and firmness, sensitivity and passion, until 2016.

Maria Valentina Tonelli died from an incurable illness on 9 February 2016, leaving her daughter Paola to continue her work on the conservation of Michele Valori's memory, thought and works.

As per her wishes, she is buried next to her husband in the family tomb in Monterotondo cemetery in Rome.
