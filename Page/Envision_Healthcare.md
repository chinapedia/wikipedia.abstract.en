ENVISION HEALTHCARE is an American healthcare company and national hospital based physician group.

In December 2016 Envison and AMSURG merged, and shortly thereafter the company's stock replaced Legg Mason in the S&P 500 index.[1][2] AMSURG had unsuccessfully sought to acquire TeamHealth in 2015.[3][4] The two company's businesses appeared to fit well together to provide more of hospitals' needs; AmSurg had strength in providing anesthesiologists, radiologists, and neonatologists, and had many ambulatory care centers, while Envision was strong in emergency doctors and hospital ambulance services.[5]

However, in 2017 the company began to seek ways to improve its profitability, as it was losing money and was under scrutiny due to healthcare consumers being shocked by catastrophically high medical bills from Envision's out-of-network healthcare providers.[6][7][8] For 2017, the company reported a net loss of $232.5 million on revenue of $7.8 billion.[9]

Early in 2018 Envision sold its ambulance unit, American Medical Response, for $2.4 billion to KKR, which combined it with a similar company it already owned.[10]

A Bloomberg analysis published in 2018 said that the combined company had executed the integration of the two businesses poorly, and had also been hit with uncertainty over the fate of the Affordable Care Act under the Trump administration, as well as natural disasters.[11]

In June 2018 KKR and Envision announced that KKR was acquiring the rest of Envision for $9.9 billion, including the assumption or repayment of debt.[12]
