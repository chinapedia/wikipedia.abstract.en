EDMUND GROAG (2 February 1873, in Prerau – 19 August 1945, in Vienna) was an Austrian classical scholar, who specialized in Roman history.

From 1892 he studied history and philology at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1895 with the dissertation on Tacitus, _Zur Kritik von Tacitus’ Quellen in den Historien_. By way of a study grant he visited Rome in 1898/99, then in 1901 began work at the Vienna National Library, an institution that he would be associated with for most of his career. In 1918 he obtained his habilitation at the university, where in 1925 he was named an associate professor of Roman history. In 1933 he became a member of the German Archaeological Institute.[1][2]

He was born into a Jewish family and converted to Catholicism in 1901. Despite this, he was removed from his position at the university for racial reasons following the Anschluss. During the Nazi takeover of Austria, he lived in a precarious state in Vienna. He died from an illness a few months after liberation of the city.[3][4]

With Arthur Stein (1871–1950), he published an unfinished second edition of the _Prosopographia Imperii Romani_ (3 volumes, 1933–43).[5] He was also the author of many articles in the _Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft_.[6]
