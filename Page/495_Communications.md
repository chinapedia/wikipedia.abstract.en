Travel Savvy

Founded as a print magazine by Adam Rodriguez and Jake Porter in September 2003, _Travel Savvy_ magazine had a circulation of 135,000 when Grey Goose founder Sidney Frank bought the title for $5 million in 2005.[3] When Frank died in January 10, 2006, the magazines folded a month later due to cash flow problems from Frank's charitable foundation.[4] Craig Pavia, who was the group publisher of _Travel Savvy_ under Frank, bought the assets from the Frank family in February 2006 and continued as a digital-only publication, founding 495 Communications to manage the native content in the process.[5] In the summer of 2015, TravelSavvy.TV was created as a digital video network and editorial website, featuring editorial travel content, online magazines, and video series that stream online and via Roku and AppleTV devices.[6]
