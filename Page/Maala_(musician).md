Evan Sinton, better known by his stage name MAALA (also stylised as MAALA) is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. He is best known for his songs "Touch" and "Kind of Love", and for coming third on the second series of _New Zealand's Got Talent_ in 2012.[1] In 2016, he won Best Male Solo Artist at the New Zealand Music Awards.[2]


_New Zealand's Got Talent_

In 2012, under his birth name, Evan Sinton auditioned for series two of _New Zealand's Got Talent_ with The Beatles' "Blackbird". Sinton qualified for the semi-final, with judge Jason Kerrison praising his voice, saying "it's distinctive, it's unique".

In the semi-final, Sinton performed Screamin' Jay Hawkins's song "I Put a Spell on You". Sinton placed in the top three in the semi-final, and made it to the final on the judges' vote. In the final, Sinton performed the Cher song "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". He finished third from the public vote.[3]


Solo career

In 2013, following his appearance on New Zealand's Got Talent, Sinton was signed to Sony Music New Zealand. He supported _The X Factor_ Australia winner Reece Mastin on his 2013 New Zealand tour.[4] Sinton went on to release the EP _Phosphenes_, from which came the singles "Tables and Chairs" and "Prisoner's Cinema".[5]


MAALA

In 2015, Sinton adopted the stage name MAALA. He used the name to separate himself from his _New Zealand's Got Talent_ identity and to reflect the new direction of his music. He chose the name MAALA because it "looked cool on paper".[6]

MAALA initially released the singles "Touch" and "In the AIr", followed by a self-titled EP. In July 2015, "Touch" was long-listed for the 2015 Silver Scroll award, credited to Sinton and the song's co-writers Jaden Parkes and Josh Fountain.[7]

In 2016, the single "Kind of Love" was released, followed by MAALA's debut album, _Composure_. Later in 2016, MAALA was nominated for four New Zealand Music Awards, and won Best Male Solo Artist.[8]
