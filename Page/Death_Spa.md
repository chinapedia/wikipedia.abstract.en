Production

According to director Michael Fischa, "the health craze had blossomed in LA. [Health clubs] came up like mushrooms. So quickly that they went out of business. So we thought, basically, we turn it around and we have a ghost in our health club. That could be a fun scenario".[5]


Home media

The film was released directly to VHS in the United States in 1990, and was released on a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack in 2014.[6]


In popular culture

On October 30, 2015, _Death Spa_ was featured on an episode of the popular podcast _How Did This Get Made?_, featuring Horatio Sanz as the guest.[7] They ridiculed several aspects of the film, such as the 80's workout gear, the paranormal-transgender villains, and whether or not serving sushi in a place of exercise is sanitary.

Actress Karyn Parsons made her screen debut in _Death Spa_, and was subsequently brought in to audition for The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air after an NBC executive saw the movie on late-nite cable.[8]
