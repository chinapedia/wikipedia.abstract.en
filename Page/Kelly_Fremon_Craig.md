Career

2000s

Fremon Craig started out writing sketch comedy and spoken word poetry in college, then landed an internship in the film division of Immortal Entertainment, where she read her first film script and began to pursue screenwriting. She developed several screenplays during the 2000s, including a modern high school retelling of _Cyrano de Bergerac_ and a comedic remake of the 2004 French drama _Intimate Strangers_ for Paramount Pictures. One of her scripts, _Ticket to Ride,_ caught the attention of _Ghostbusters_ director Ivan Reitman. He bought the script under his The Montecito Picture Company as a directing vehicle for Reitman. According to Reitman, the script was rewritten at least 15 times. The film was released, under the new title _Post Grad_. The film was instead directed by Vicky Jenson and was released in 2009 as a critical and commercial failure.

2010s

In 2011, Fremon Craig completed another script titled _Besties_ and sent the script over to James L. Brooks. Brooks bought the script and was announced that Fremon Craig would direct the film and Brooks would serve as a producer and mentor for her in directing her first film.[1] No updates have popped up for the feature until August 2015, when Hailee Steinfeld was announced to star in the film. Casting continued until October that same year, with filming commencing that same month. The film was released by STX Entertainment in Fall 2016 under its new title _The Edge of Seventeen_ to critical praise and a modest financial hit. Following _The Edge of Seventeen_{{'}}s release, Fremon Craig has been hired to develop several Hollywood projects; this includes film adaptations of the memoir _Wild Game: My Mother, Her Lover, and Me_ for Chernin Entertainment and 20th Century Fox, an adaptation of the young adult novel _Are You There God?
