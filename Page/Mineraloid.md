A MINERALOID is a naturally-occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. For example, obsidian is an amorphous glass and not a crystal. Jet is derived from decaying wood under extreme pressure. Opal is another mineraloid because of its non-crystalline nature. Pearl, considered by some to be a mineral because of the presence of calcium carbonate crystals within its structure, would be better considered a mineraloid because the crystals are bonded by an organic material, and there is no definite proportion of the components.


Examples

-   Amber, non-crystalline structure, organic
-   Chlorophaeite[1]
-   Deweylite, a mixture of serpentine and talc or stevensite[2]
-   Ebonite, vulcanized natural or synthetic rubber (organic); lacks a crystalline structure
-   Jet, non-crystalline nature, organic (very compact coal)
-   Lechatelierite, nearly pure silica glass
-   Limonite, a mixture of oxides and hydroxides of iron
-   Mercury, liquid (IMA/CNMNC valid mineral name)
-   Obsidian, volcanic glass – non-crystalline structure, a silica rich glass
-   Opal, non-crystalline hydrated silica silicon dioxide (IMA/CNMNC valid mineral name)
-   Palagonite[3]
-   Pearl, organically produced carbonate
-   Petroleum, liquid, organic
-   Pyrobitumen, amorphous fossilized petroleum (noncrystalline, organic)
-   Sideromelane[4], volcanic glass – non-crystalline, an iron rich, silica poor glass
-   Shungite, black, lustrous, more than 98 weight per cent of carbon
-   Tektites, meteoritic silica rich glass
