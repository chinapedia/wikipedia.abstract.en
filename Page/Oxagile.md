History

Oxagile was founded in July, 2005,[1] by Dmitry Karpovich and Sergey Marchuk as a subdivision of BelHard Group. Registered in the US, the company owns an R&D center in Minsk, Belarus, and a sales office in London, UK.

The company originally focused on the video streaming domain, which eventually resulted in contracts signed with such companies as JumpTV and KIT Digital.

Later on, the company expanded its operation into other domains and gained significant experience in Finance, AdTech, eLearning and other growing areas.

In 2012, after several years of growth and expansion, Oxagile became the founder and organizer of IT Spring,[2][3][4] one of the largest international IT events in Belarus. The company still remains a title sponsor of the annual conference and takes an active part in its organization.

In 2013, Oxagile sponsored WebRTC Expo, an international conference dedicated to the WebRTC technology.[5]

In 2015, the company became a partner of MobileOptimized, one of the largest events in Eastern Europe for service, game and mobile app developers, as well as IT entrepreneurs and startups.[6][7]
