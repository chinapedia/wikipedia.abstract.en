The MEN'S TIME TRIAL H2 road cycling event at the 2016 SUMMER PARALYMPICS took place on 14 September at Flamengo Park, Pontal. Eight riders from seven nations competed.[1]

H or HANDCYCLE classifications are for cyclists using handcycles rather than standard bicycles, because of lower limb dysfunction or amputation.

The H2 CATEGORY is specifically for athletes with tetraplegia C7/C8 and severe athetosis/ataxia/dystonia, and tetraplegics with impairments corresponding to a complete cervical lesion at C7/C8 or above. This classification is marked by complete loss of trunk stability and lower limb function, and spinal cord injury. The H2 time trial features athletes with the most severe impairments in the H class.

Former Paralympic swimmer, and eight time World champion, Italy's Luca Mazzone took the gold medal, 6 seconds ahead of rival William Groulx of the United States, the first of three medals Mazzone would win (the others coming in the H2 road race and the Mixed team relay).
