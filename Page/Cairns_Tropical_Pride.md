CAIRNS TROPICAL PRIDE is an annual LGBT pride parade and festival in Cairns, Australia, and the largest LGBT event in Tropical North Queensland.[1] The first event was held in 2006, and was originally held in conjunction with the Cairns Festival before changing its name for 2015 and 2016 to "Tropical Mardi Gras" and its timing to October.[2][3] The event reverted to Cairns Tropical Pride for 2017.[4]

The festival features a variety of activities, including boat cruises, pool parties, art exhibitions and a Fair Day with a renowned Dog Show, community forums, drag and fashion shows, art exhibition and community recognition awards.[5] In 2016, the Fair Day also introduced an annual same-sex wedding expo.[6]
