The _burgstall_ of WOLKENSTEIN CASTLE is the site of a late medieval aristocratic castle in the village of Wolkenstein, in the borough of Ebermannstadt in the county of Forchheim in the German state of Bavaria. The _burgstall_ is in private hands and may not be visited.


Location

The _burgstall_ of the spur castle lies in the southwestern part of the parish of Wolkenstein at a height of 455 metres on a southwest-facing hill spur of the Thosberg. It is about 4.8 kilometres east of the church in Pretzfeld.

South of the old castle of Wolkenstein lies the _burgstall_ of Eberhardstein in the valley of the Altenthalbach, to the southeast is the _burgstall_ of Wichsenstein and to the west is that of Dietrichstein above the village of Lützelsdorf.


History

Neither the date of construction nor the builder of the castle are known. It was first mentioned in the records in 1470.

The castle, which was probably an allod, was occupied by the free knights of the House of Aufseß in the early 15th century. Conrad IX of Aufseß was held prisoner at the Altenburg during a feud with the Bishop of Bamberg, George I of Schaumberg (1459–1475), and, in 1470, had to grant the bishop right of access or _Öffnungsrecht_ to Wolkenstein Castle.

In the period that followed several members of the House of Aufseß used the title "von Wolkenstein".

Whether the castle was destroyed during the Peasants' War, as a 1624 document suggests, is doubtful. In the otherwise very detailed lists of destroyed castles, it is not mentioned. This could mean, however, that the castle had already been destroyed or had fallen into ruins by that time.


Description

Of the medieval site only a few wall remains on one of the rock formations have survived.
