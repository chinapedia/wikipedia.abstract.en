_SWINGING KICKS_ is a 1957 album by the jazz arranger Buddy Bregman.[1] The album was released as _I Love Listening to Buddy Bregman_ by HMV in the United Kingdom.[2]


Reception

Scott Yanow reviewed the album for AllMusic and wrote that it was "Because many of the selections are brief (seven are under two minutes) and due to the intriguing titles, this seems a bit like a soundtrack to a film that was never made. However, few of the tracks seem truncated and there are some excellent solos along the way, particularly from Ben Webster, Conte Candoli, Herb Geller, Bud Shank, and Paul Smith. ...Bregman uses some of the top West Coast jazz players and various musicians who were on Verve at the time, with Stan Getz making a guest appearance on "Honey Chile". Recommended".[3]
