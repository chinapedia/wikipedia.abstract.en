Premise

The film consists of three separate stories that occur contemporaneously within a one-square mile area in London. In each story, the main character must deal with the consequences of his previous actions, as each man struggles to overcome obstacles in the path to a better life. One of the characters is Max, a former rugby captain for Team England and celebrity who struggles to keep his marriage together with his estranged wife, Emily. The film also follows a small time drug dealer named Kingsley, who through a chance encounter with an aging actor Terence, finds inspiration to escape his life of petty crime and his disapproving mother. Lastly, George is a gentle cab driver looking for the chance to adopt a child and build a family with his long suffering wife, Kathy. How each man deals with his personal challenges reveals how circumstance, accidental encounters and conscious decisions determine our fate.
