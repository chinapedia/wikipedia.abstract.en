Plot

Gary Blooms marries Samantha who has a son, Lucas, a quiet 5-year-old boy. Gary struggles to create a connection with Lucas, but Lucas ignores him. Gary receives a telephone call from his wedding videographer, Karl, warning him that something very unusual is in the footage. Gary is uninterested. Later that day, Gary stops by one of his properties for sale, an old nunnery, where Father J.D. Gospel, the leader of a Doomsday cult, buys it on the spot. Gary has to leave when he is summoned to Lucas’ school where the principal informs Gary that Lucas spoke out of turn in class and told his science teacher to “go to hell”, after which she killed herself. A psychiatrist stresses that Lucas see a counselor and Gary, the apparent main source of Lucas’ erratic behavior, should do the same.

Samantha is upset by the news and feels that everyone, including Gary, is unfairly blaming Lucas. Gary assures her that he loves them both. At therapy, Gary tries to relate to other stepfathers, including his friend Al. When Gary confides in them that he thinks his stepson might be a little evil, they all sympathize with him. The next day, at Lucas’ birthday party, a clown lights himself on fire. Gary is led to believe Lucas is responsible, so he goes to see Karl and find out what really happened at the wedding. Karl shows Gary the video, which shows a possessed-looking Lucas untouched by a tornado. Karl tells Gary that all of Samantha's previous boyfriends are dead except for one — Gabriel. Karl gives Gary Gabriel's address.

When Gary inquires about Lucas' biological father, Samantha reluctantly admits that years earlier, she was part of a cult and took part in a ritual during which Lucas was conceived. Gary convinces Al to help him find Gabriel. They find Gabriel in the basement of a church where he is self-flagellating. Gabriel reveals that Lucas is the Antichrist and tells them to travel to Bethlehem to find Gozamel the demon hunter. Gary and Al view a television news report on rioting due to the Apocalypse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and they realize it is where they need to go. They travel to find Gozamel, who informs them they have to kill the child with the Knife of Destiny or the end of the world will ensue. Gozamel is killed in a car accident while driving with them, but not before he gives Gary the Knife of Destiny and says it is up to him now to kill Lucas on hallowed ground.

Gary arrives home to find Samantha with Miss Shaylock, a woman from Child Protective Services. They encourage Gary put Lucas to bed, but this goes horribly wrong, ending in Lucas burying Gary in a sandbox. Samantha digs him up, taking Lucas’ side for being a confused kid, and Gary screams that Lucas is the Antichrist. Samantha is devastated, and Gary later apologizes. He takes Lucas on a trip to Waterland, a park blessed by the Pope, as a treat. Lucas and Gary actually start to bond as father and son. Gary fills Lucas’ floaties with sand and sends him to his death, but sees the word "Love" in the sky and takes it as a sign. Gary saves Lucas and then takes him for ice cream. Both of them apologize for trying to kill the other.

Suddenly, an amber alert for Lucas pops up on Gary’s phone. Police arrive to take Gary, and Miss Shaylock, revealed to be a disciple of Father Gospel, takes Lucas. Father Gospel also kidnaps Samantha. Gary escapes from the police to save her and Lucas, but not without help from the other stepdads. They travel to the old nunnery where Father Gospel and his disciples prepare to kill Lucas and bring about the end of the world. When Lucas opens a tunnel to Hell and starts to fall into it, Gary saves him. Once freed, Samantha knocks Father Gospel into the tunnel. Weeks later, Gary and Lucas race the Okatok Soap Box Derby. Lucas and Gary appear to finally be happy as father and son.
