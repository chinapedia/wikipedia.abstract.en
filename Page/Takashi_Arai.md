TAKASHI ARAI (born June 5, 1978) is a Japanese photographer/visual artist who is well known for his unique practice in contemporary daguerreotype.

Beginning in 2010, when he first became interested in nuclear issues, Arai has used the daguerreotype technique to create individual records—micro-monuments—of his encounters with surviving crew members, and the salvaged hull, of the fallout-contaminated Daigo Fukuryū Maru fishing boat, which was devastated by American nuclear testing in the Bikini Atoll. This project led him to photograph the deeply interconnected subjects of Fukushima, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. After 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami he often visited Fukushima and depicted the aftermath of triple disaster.


Collections and exhibits

Arai’s work has appeared in numerous exhibitions, at Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,[1] San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),[2] Mori Art Museum,[3] and National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, among other international venues.

His works are held in the collections of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA),[4] Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,[5][6] Peabody Essex Museum, Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, and Musée Guimet,[7] among others.
