PARK SOO-HONG (born October 27, 1970), is a South Korean comedian and presenter.[1]


Career

In 1991, Park won bronze in the National College Comedy Contest, making his official debut in the South Korean entertainment industry.[2][3] In the early 1990s, Park was a part of a group of comedians who called themselves _Team Potato_ (), composed of Kim Gook-jin, Kim Soo-yong and Kim Yong-man, who all debuted in the same year on KBS.[4][5][6] It had been reported that Kim Yong-man had been admitted to hospital due to their busy schedule, and therefore Kim Gook-jin attempted to reason with television program producers to lighten their workload.[7] However, this request was not received well by producers, who then decided it was necessary to permanently ban _Team Potato_ from making appearances on television.[8] As a result, in January 1993, the four comedians planned to leave South Korea for the United States of America, taking a break from the South Korean entertainment industry, although ultimately, only Kim Yong-man and Kim Gook-jin went to the United States of America, while Park began his compulsory army duty and Kim Soo-yong went to Canada.[9][10][11]

In 2004, Park hosted the 2004 MBC Entertainment Awards, along with Kim Won-hee.[12] In 2005, he hosted the 41st Baeksang Arts Awards, with announcer Lee Hye-seung.[13] In 2017, Park hosted the 2017 KBS Drama Awards, along with Lee Yoo-ri and Namkoong Min.[14] In 2018, he hosted the 2018 Miss Korea pageant, alongside Yura (Girl's Day).[15][16][17]


Personal life

Park is a darts fan, having attended and participated in the Phoenix Summer Festival's dart competition, held and sponsored by the Korea Darts Association.[18][19][20][21]

In 2018, ahead of the South Korean local elections and the South Korean by-elections, Park took part in the _613 Vote and Laugh_ () campaign, amongst other comedians such as Kang Ho-dong and Shin Dong-yup,[22][23] encouraging the South Korean public to use their vote in the elections.[24][25]
