Critical response

It received generally negative reviews from critics. Oggs Cruz of Rappler gave a negative review, commenting on the film's plot as "unsurprisingly threadbare", and adds that "[it] fails to be the powerful thing it could and should have been [...] it desensitizes the public to the horrors of whatever is happening in society."[30] Reviewer Jansen Musico of CNN Philippines was displeased with the film, commenting that "[T]his two-hour vaudeville is entertaining in small, healthy doses. Anything more feels like a waste of neurons." [...] [M]any of the film's jokes are one-offs that are overstuffed into a thin, flimsy script, bloating it with news and pop culture references that add nothing to the main story arc."[31]

On the other hand, a reviewer from _Philippine Daily Inquirer_'s _Bandera_ praised the film, giving a score of 9 out of 10, writing that the film "_is so light it perfectly fits for Pinoys who only want to be entertained this Christmas,_" and "_delivers its purpose to make audiences laugh hard that many of them need despite with what's currently happening in the country._"[32]
