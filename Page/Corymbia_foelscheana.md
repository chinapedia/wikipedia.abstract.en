_CORYMBIA FOELSCHEANA_, commonly known as the FAN-LEAVED BLOODWOOD,[1] SMOOTH-BARKED BLOODWOOD or the BROAD-LEAVED BLOODWOOD, is a bloodwood native to the Northern Territory[2] and Western Australia.[3]


Description

The tree typically grows to in height and has large fruit with long thick pedicels.[4] The bark is persistent on the trunk and larger branches, it is a dull grey in colour and tessellated or shortly fibrous and sheds in small polygonal flakes. It has disjunct, lanceolate to broad lanceolate or ovate to suborbiculate leaves that are basally rounded. They are dull, grey-green, thick, concolorous long and wide.[5]

It blooms between October and May[6] and produces a terminal compound conflorescence with umbellasters, with 3 to 7 white or cream flowers with terete penduncles. Later it will produce ovoid to urceolate fruit that are long with a diameter.[7]


Range

The range of the tree extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia east through the top end of the Northern Territory. It is found on low open woodland and grows well in loam and laterite soils.[8]

In a woodland setting associated species include _Erythrophleum chlorostachys_, _Xanthostemon paradoxus_, _Eucalyptus setosa_, _Eucalyptus confertiflora_ and _Eucalyptus latifolia_ in the overstorey and _Grevillea decurrens_, _Gardenia megasperma_ and _Calytrix exstipulata_ in the sparsely vegetated understorey.[9]


History

_Corymbia foelscheana_ was first described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1882 as EUCALYPTUS FOELSCHEANA. It was described from specimens collected near Darwin.[10] Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus _Corymbia_ in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from _Eucalyptus_.[11]
