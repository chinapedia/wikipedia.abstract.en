Joseph Campau

Color_portrait_of_Joseph_Campau.tif The street is named for Joseph Campau (February 2, 1769 â€“ July 23, 1863) [2] who was among Detroit, Michigan's leading citizens and wealthiest landowners at the dawn of the 19th century.[3] He made millions in the real estate industry and served in several public offices for the city. Campau held multiple public office positions in Detroit. He was City Trustee in 1802, City Treasurer, City Inspector of water barrels and City Assessor, appraiser, and over-seer of the poor.[4] In 1802, he was an original trustee of Detroit and its incorporation.[5]


Jos. Campau Historic District

The Jos. Campau Historic District is a commercial historic district located along Joseph Campau Street in Hamtramck. The district runs from roughly Holbrook and Lehman Streets on the south to Pulaski and Casmere Streets on the north. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[6]

In 1901, a portion of Hamtramck township centered around Jos. Campau Street was incorporated as a village.[7] People, many of them Polish, flooded into the area when a Dodge Brothers Motor Car Company plant called Dodge Main was completed in 1914 at the southeast corner of the village.[8]

Most of the stores along Joseph Campau Street opened in the 1920s.[9] The surrounding neighborhoods were densely packed single-family homes,[10] and this section of street quickly became the second busiest shopping district in southeast Michigan, after only downtown Detroit.[11]
