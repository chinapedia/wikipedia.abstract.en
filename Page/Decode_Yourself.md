_DECODE YOURSELF_ is an album by Ronald Shannon Jackson and The Decoding Society recorded in 1985 for the Island label.[1]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Stephen Cook stated "The range of styles found on drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decode Yourself is amazing, but what really impresses is the way Jackson unifies the disparate strains with his unique arrangements and varied rhythmic support".[2] Jeff Eldredge said "Despite the return of the violin, the addition of the trombone, some interesting stylistic forays into country, bebop, and space funk, and the promise of a Bill Laswell production, the third Island release, _Decode Yourself_, is marred by a thin sound, gimmicky electronic drum and synthesizer timbres, and (surprisingly) a plodding, four-square rhythmic monotony".[3]
