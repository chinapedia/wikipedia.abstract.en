The INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES TRAVEL AGENT NETWORK (IATAN) is an industry association in the USA designed to represent the interests of its member companies (airlines) and the U.S. travel distribution network (travel agencies).[1] It is an independent department of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).[2]

In addition, it (along with the IATA) is the body responsible for the standard international codes for airlines, airports, hotels, cities and car rental firms (for example, the three-character codes that designate London Heathrow Airport as LHR). These codes provide a method to link international travel network with international suppliers.[3]
