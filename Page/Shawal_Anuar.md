'''Shawal Anuar ''' (born 29 April 1991) is a Singaporean professional footballer who plays as a forward for S.League club Geylang International and the Singapore national team.


Club career

Geylang International

Anuar began his professional football career with Geylang International in the S.league in 2014, having previously only played with NFL side Keppel Monaco FC in the NFL.[1] Despite being signed for the team's reserve Prime League side, Anuar managed to appear for the senior team, clocking in 69 minutes of football for the senior side.[2]

He was handed an extension to his contract and had a solid full debut season for the Eagles in 2015, scoring 4 goals in 22 appearances, helping his team finish 8th in the league.[3]

Anuar built on his debut season and helped his team win the 2016 Singapore League Cup Plate, Geylang's first trophy since 2009, while earning a call-up to the national team.[4][5][6] His performances in 2016 prompted his head coach Hasrin Jailani to identify him as one of the players to watch for in the 2017 S.League season.[7]

Anuar started the 2017 season on a good note. Following Geylang International and Matsumoto Yamaga signing of a MOU in November 2016, Anuar, together with fellow winger Gabriel Quak, were selected to go on a one-week trial with the J2 side.[8] Both players were not offered a contract, with the Japanese side saying that the pair was good enough to play in the J3 League with potential to feature in the top-tier J.League if they fulfill their potential.[9] Anuar started in the season open against Hougang United and scored his first goal of the season in the following match, helping his team to 3 points over Balestier Khalsa.[10][11] He got his second of the season in a 2-0 win over the Garena Young Lions in Geylang's 5th game of the season.[12]

As of the end of the 2018 Singapore Premier League season, Anuar has notched 22 goals in 77 appearances for the Eagles.[13]
