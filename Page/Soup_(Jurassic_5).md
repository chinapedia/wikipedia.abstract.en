SOUP[1] is a founding member of Jurassic 5. His real name is Zaakir Muhammad. He released his debut EP, Still In Fullee Love, through Nalja Music, on Friday, February 24,[2] 2017. The album was produced by current Grammy nominee Nicholas Eaholtz, a.k.a. Nick Green (The Internet (band)).[3]

"It's a glimpse into the music that shaped Zaakir and combines his smooth flow and sharp lyrics with a touch of R&B and soul—stuff he'd grown up with as a kid."[4] - OC WEEKLY

Most of the songs featured on the five-song EP were created when Jurassic 5 returned from a 7-year hiatus to play Coachella in 2013.[5] During that hiatus, Zaakir worked in retail, trying to survive while barely making ends meet. He also had time to reflect. When Coachella happened, it was sink or swim for Soup of J5.[6] Fullee Love was created out of necessity in order to continue his path in music.

In late 2013, Zaakir performed a few solo dates, hitting London, Barcelona, and Portugal to test the waters. Though they weren't headlining slots for Fullee Love, the experience was enlightening and the feedback was good. A year prior, he wasn't sure if he'd ever have the opportunity to perform again. The solo shows gave him the confidence that he was doing the right thing.

Considered one of the greatest new-school MCs, Soup found fame as part of the iconic, gold-selling hip-hop group Jurassic 5.[7] A 20-year music industry veteran, Zaakir was an instrumental figure at Immortal Records, Interscope, and Loud Records, where he orchestrated a record deal for hip-hop icons Mobb Deep. He has received gold records for his work on Wu-Tang’s debut album, Enter The Wu: 36 Chambers, and Mobb Deep’s sophomore album, The Infamous. Soup was also responsible for Jurassic 5’s first demo deal with Relativity Records. His infectious personality and bold presence onstage often land him voiceover and on-screen roles, including Nickelodeon’s “All That,” “Blast,” with Eddie Griffin, and FOX’s “Fastlane,” starring Bill Bellamy.
