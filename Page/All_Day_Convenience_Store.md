ALL DAY CONVENIENCE STORE is a convenience store division of All Value Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of MBV Group of Companies owned by a Filipino entrepreneur and a former Philippine senator, Manny Villar.[1] All Day Convenience Store was the former Finds Convenience Store Inc., an experimental business of Villar which was established in 2008 with an initial of 40 branches in Metro Manila.[2][3]


History

2008 when the former senator Manny Villar ventured in the convenience store business and started Finds Convenience Store Inc. as his "experimental business".[4][5] Finds grew to 40 branches along Metro Manila and served as a convenience store outlet for his housing business, Camella Homes and at his mall chain, StarMall.

Seeing the potential of Finds, Villar took serious and re-branded it as All Day Convenience Store in 2014.[6]

In his interview to Entrepreneur Philippines, he said that Finds was one of his small and experimental companies, All Day is the serious attempt.[7]

Taking up the challenge against his giant competitors like 7-Eleven and MiniStop, he expanded the branches of All Day to 100 along with the conversion of 40 existing branches of Finds Convenience Store Inc. to All Day Convenience Store.[8][9] He is optimistic to expand the All Day Convenience Store brand as a "True Filipino convenience store".[10] At that time, new convenience store brands are coming into the Philippines when Puregold Price Club Inc. has tapped Lawson to open its branches in the Philippines, while SM unveils their venture with Indonesian convenience store, Alfamart and Ayala Land just introduced FamilyMart to the Philippines.[11] The predominant convenience stores in the country, 7-Eleven which is managed by Victor Paterno and Ministop which is managed by John Gokongwei has just sprouted to Mindanao areas.[12][13]

In All Day's recent expansion, it sprouted to more branches in Luzon, concentrating to condominiums, business towers and residential areas.

It reached to 13 stores following the opening of All Home in Antipolo last July 2016.[15] It soon grew as a supermarket, branded as All Day Supermart. The supermarket initially opened branches at Starmall Prima Taguig, Starmall EDSA Shaw, and Starmall Santa Rosa, Laguna.[16] In 2016, All Day Supermarket is expanding their branches in Bataan and Las Pinas with a total of 20,000 square meter of floor space.[17]

From the experiment on forming Finds Convenience Store Inc., it expanded to a huge "All Day" mega franchise, forming the parent company, All Value Holdings Inc.

However, despite the expansion of All Day brands, All Day Convenience Store reduces their number stores from 100 to 80+ as of 2016, but this is in result to the conversion of some All Day Convenience Store to All Day Mart and All Day Supermarket like their branches in Las Pinas and Starmall Prima Taguig.[18] However, Villiar is still up for expansion ofAll Day Convenience Store with the growth and expansion to his land developments across the country.
