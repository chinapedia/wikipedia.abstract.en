_THE TWO BULLIES_ is a 1997 children's picture book by Junko Morimoto. It is based on a Japanese folktale, _Ni-Ou and Dokkoi_ and is about two bullies (strong men), one Japanese, the other Chinese who are going to fight one another but through some humorous events do not, much to their relief.


Reception

When reviewing _The Two Bullies_, _Publishers Weekly_ wrote "Imbued with a Japanese sensibility, Morimoto's artwork is a model of balance, her spare, uncluttered backdrops and clean sweep of brushwork creating a strong visual presence in this subtly humorous picture book" and concluded "their (the bullies') story is not just entertaining but also a lively commentary on the true nature of bullies."[1] A child reviewer found it "an enjoyable book".[2]

In 2012 Reading Australia included _The Two Bullies_ on its First 200 list.[3]
