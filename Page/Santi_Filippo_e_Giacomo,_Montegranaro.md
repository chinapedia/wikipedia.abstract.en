SANTI FILIPPO E GIACOMO is a Baroque-style Roman Catholic church in Montegranaro, province of Fermo, in the region of Marche, Italy.


History

A 10th century Romanesque church once stood at the site built adjacent to a Silvestrine monastery. The church was rebuilt in 1539; since 1220, the monastery had been assigned to the Benedictine order of the Abbey of Farfa. The present church was erected in 1760. It houses a _Madonna with Saints Phillip and James_ by Federico Barocci.

Below the church is a former 10th century church, now converted into the _crypt of Sant'Ugo_, named for a local silvestrine monk. Some suspect the structure may derive from a late-Roman Empire building.

The church has a single nave, and has detached frescoes (1299) depicting a _Nativity with St John the Baptist_, an _Adoration of the Shepherds_, _Martyrdom of Saint Barbara_, a _Baptism of Christ_, a _Pieta_, and a _Vergine dolente_.[1]
