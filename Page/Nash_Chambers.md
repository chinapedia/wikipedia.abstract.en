Biography

Nash Chambers is the first child of country musicians, Bill and Diane Chambers.[1] Soon after his younger sister, Kasey, was born in 1976 the family travelled around the Nullarbor Plain, where their parents hunted foxes and rabbits for pelts during seven or eight months a year, spanning nine years.[2][3] For summer holidays they returned to Southend, South Australia.[4] From 1986 Bill and Diane began performing as a country music duo and added first Kasey and then Chambers to their act, which became the Dead Ringer Band.[5][6][7]

Chambers was recorded on two albums released by his father, _Sea Eagle_ (1987) and _Kindred Spirit_ (1991). In 1992 the family's group, Dead Ringer Band, became a full-time concern and they toured both rural and city venues.[8] Chambers provided vocals, drums, acoustic guitar, harmonica and didgeridoo for the band.[9] They released four albums, _Red Desert Sky_ (1993), _Home Fires_ (1995), _Living in the Circle_ (1997) and _Hopeville_ (1998), before disbanding.[10] By that time his parents had separated.[11] Chambers assisted Kasey's solo work starting with her first album, _The Captain_ (May 1999), recorded late in 1998. He provided backing vocals, bass guitar and acoustic guitar as well as being her talent manager, record producer and audio engineer.[12][13]

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 he was nominated for Producer of the Year for Kasey's album, _Carnival_ (August 2006).[14] He has won Golden Guitars for Producer of the Year and for Engineer of the Year at the Country Music Awards of Australia ceremonies.[15][16] As from April 2018, Chambers has continued to work with Kasey – except on her tenth album, _Bittersweet_ (August 2014) – up to, _Campfire_ (April 2018).[17][18] During 2002 Chambers produced the debut solo album for Shane Nicholson (ex-Pretty Violet Stain), _It's a Movie_, including the track, "Designed to Fade", which is a duet with Kasey.[19] Kasey and Nicholson were married in late 2005. Chambers produced albums by both artists as individuals and as a duo.[20]

Since November 2008 Chambers has worked at his own Foggy Mountain Studios, Laguna, in the Hunter Valley.[21][22] He also runs a recording label and talent management company, Essence Music Group, with his wife Veronica .[23][24]
