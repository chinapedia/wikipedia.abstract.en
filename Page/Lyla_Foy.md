2012: _Magazine_

Foy released her debut single _Magazine_ in September 2012 under her band's name, _Wall_.[1] Michael Cragg of the Guardian said of Foy, "You get the sense that even a whisper could overpower her soft coo of a voice."


2013: _Shoestring_ & _Easy_

In March 2013, Foy released her debut EP _Shoestring_, named after the title track of the same name.[2] The EP also included the tracks _Left to Wonder_, _Place Too Low_ and _All Alone_. Later in 2013 Foy released a double a-side called _Easy/Head Down_ via the label Subpop.

In 2013, Foy dropped her stage name _Wall_ for her real name, Lyla Foy. She explained, "At first I wanted something abstract to put some distance between me and the identity of the music, but as things grew I wanted to put my name to the songs not the other way round."[3]


2014: _Mirrors The Sky_

On 18 March 2014, Foy released her debut album, _Mirrors The Sky_, again with the label Subpop.[4] The album contained ten songs, including _Honeymoon_, _I Only_ and _No Secrets_.[5]

One of the songs, "Impossible", serves as the end credits music for the season one episode "Say Anything" of _BoJack Horseman_.
