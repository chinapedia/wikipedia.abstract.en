ERGIS MERSINI (born 30 September 1988) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a left-back.[1][2][3]


Club career

In July 2013, Mersini joined Albanian First Division side Dinamo Tirana on a one-year contract.[4]

On 23 January 2017, Mersini left Luftëtari Gjirokastër by terminating his contract by mutual consent.[5] He departure was made _de facto_ in the first days of January, where he was not called up in team's winter training camp on Antalya, Turkey, after being told by the coach Mladen Milinković that he was not in his plans for the second part of the season.[6][7]

Three days later, however, Mersini joined Flamurtari Vlorë for the second part of 2016–17 season.[8] He made his debut with the club on 28 January 2017 against Skënderbeu Korçë as Flamurtari slumped into a 1–0 away defeat.[9] Mersini quickly established himself in the starting lineup and went on to play another 16 matches, all of them as starter, until the end of the season, as Flamutari barely avoided relegation by winning in the last match against Korabi Peshkopi.[10]

On 28 June 2017, Mersini signed a new contract extension with Flamurtari until June 2018.[11]
