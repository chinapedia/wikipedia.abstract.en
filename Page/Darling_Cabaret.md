History

The founder of Darling Cabaret was travelling around the world for years, and observed both well-known and small local cabarets. On his return to the Czech Republic in 2000 he opened Darling Cabaret in the centre of Prague. In 2010 Darling Cabaret was listed in the Top Ten cabaret clubs in the world by an American magazine.[1]

In 2015 it won a "Sexist Piggy" award for its adverts placed in men's restrooms in bars or restaurants around Prague.
