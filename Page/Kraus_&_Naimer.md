History

Weikersdorf_stf_kraus_&_naimer.jpg The company was founded in Vienna in 1907 in Wattgasse 53 within the 16th district Ottakring. The company's history began in the era of emerging electricity. Lorenz Naimer, founder and financier of the company as well as his partner Franz Kraus, who was responsible for the technical development and implementation, researched in the field of electrical special machines. On 28 September 1909, the company was officially renamed Kraus & Naimer. In 1912, the company relocated to Schumanngasse 35 in the 18th district Währing, which was extended in the years 1947–1961. Between 1968 and 1970 an additional production facility was built close to Vienna in Weikersdorf in Lower Austria. This was supplemented by an assembly plant from 1989 – 1990 and expanded to almost double the size in 2013. In 1947, Hubert Laurenz Naimer took over the management of the company from his father Lorenz Naimer, which he developed into a global corporation through innovations and global business drive until his death in 2004. In 1981, his son Joachim Laurenz Naimer joined the management of the company, who leads currently the family enterprise since 2004.


Products

The foundation stone of the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced knife switches, the forerunners of today's disconnectors, which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches towards the end of the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and roller switches. At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a cam switch in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization.[2]

Another milestone in the company's history was the development of the world smallest cam switch (model CA4N),[3] which has been available since 1994.

At the beginning of the 50s, Kraus & Naimer was one of the first industrial companies to use thermoplastics, especially polyamides, in the switchgear technology. The entire value-added chain from research and development to sales is handled by the company itself with specially founded logistics and dispatch centers as well as worldwide dispatch cooperation partners.  As one of the world's leading manufacturers of rotary cam switches which uses a small amount of gold and tin, Kraus & Naimer took necessary steps to avoid the use of materials from illegal and unethical sources in their products and purchase their raw materials from companies that are listed on the CFSI Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative CFSI. [4]
