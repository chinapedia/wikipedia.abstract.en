'' by Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] In Finnish mythology, the _SAMPO_ or SAMMAS was a magical artifact of indeterminate type constructed by Ilmarinen that brought riches and good fortune to its holder. When the Sampo was stolen, it is said that Ilmarinen's homeland fell upon hard times and he sent an expedition to retrieve it, but in the ensuing battle it was smashed and lost at sea.


In the Kalevala

]]

The Sampo is a pivotal element of the plot of the Finnish epic poem _Kalevala_, compiled in 1835 (and expanded in 1849) by Elias Lönnrot based on earlier Finnish oral tradition.

In the expanded second version of the poem, the Sampo is forged by Ilmarinen, a legendary smith, as a task set by the Mistress of Pohjola in return for her daughter's hand.

    _"Ilmarinen, worthy brother,_
    _Thou the only skilful blacksmith,_
    _Go and see her wondrous beauty,_
    _See her gold and silver garments,_
    _See her robed in finest raiment,_
    _See her sitting on the rainbow,_
    _Walking on the clouds of purple._
    _Forge for her the magic Sampo,_
    _Forge the lid in many colors,_
    _Thy reward shall be the virgin,_
    _Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;_
    _Go and bring the lovely maiden_
    _To thy home in Kalevala."_[1]

Ilmarinen works for several days at a mighty forge until finally the Sampo is created:

    _On one side the flour is grinding,_
    _On another salt is making,_
    _On a third is money forging,_
    _And the lid is many-colored._
    _Well the Sampo grinds when finished,_
    _To and fro the lid in rocking,_
    _Grinds one measure at the day-break,_
    _Grinds a measure fit for eating,_
    _Grinds a second for the market,_
    _Grinds a third one for the store-house._[2]

Later, Louhi the sorceress steals the Sampo, provoking Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen to enter her stronghold in secret and retrieve it. Louhi, in reply, pursues them and combats Väinämöinen. In the struggle, Louhi is vanquished but the Sampo is destroyed.


Interpretation

The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine coin die, a decorated Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. In the _Kalevala_, compiler Lönnrot interpreted it to be a quern or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air. The world pillar hypothesis was originally developed by historian of religions Uno Harva and the linguist Eemil Nestor Setälä in the early 20th century.

According to the archaeologist Elena Kuz'mina the Sampo mill myth originates from the Indo-European _skambhá_ (support, pillar, column), and was borrowed into Finno-Ugric.[3] In the _Atharvaveda_ the 'skambhá' is a creature that supports the universe, analogous to the World Tree - the Sampo has been claimed to be the Finnish equivalent of the world tree.[4][5]


Similar devices

The World Mill is a hypothesized mytheme shared by the mythologies of certain Indo-European-speaking peoples, involving the analogy of the cosmos or the firmament (Finnish: _Taivaankansi_) and a rotating millstone.

In the Aarne–Thompson classification systems of Folk-Tales, tale type 565 refers to a magic mill that continuously produces food or salt.[6] Examples include _Why the Sea is Salt_ (Norway, based on the poem _Grottasöngr_), _Sweet porridge_ (Germanic), and _The Water Mother_ (Chinese). Such devices have been included into modern tales such as _Strega Nona_ (1975, children's book). Variants on the theme with a cautionary tale and pupil-master relationship include _The Master and his Pupil_ (English), and Goethe's 1797 poem _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_.

The Cornucopia of Greek mythology also produces endless goods, and some versions of the Grail myth emphasize how the Grail creates food and goods.

Japanese folktale _Shiofuki usu_ speaks of a grindstone that could be used to create anything. Like Sampo, it too was lost to the sea, endlessly grinding salt.

The Mahabharatha speaks about the Akshaya Patra, a vessel or bowl capable of creating food. It stopped providing at the end of the day when the lady of the house had her last meal. Similarly in Irish myth the Cauldron of the Dagda (_coire ansic_ or "un-dry cauldron") was a magical vessel that satisfied any number of people.
