BARRINGTON RENFORD PATTERSON (born 25 August 1965) is an English former kickboxer mixed martial artist. At 18 stones, he competed in the super heavyweight division and once fought for a world International Kickboxing Federation Kickboxing Championship. He is often referred to as one of Britain's "hardest men" and former football hooligan of the known firm Birmingham Zulus.[1][2][3]


Biography

At an early age as a child Barrington was blinded in one eye through an accident, which later earned him the name "One eye Baz". In the early years of his life while growing up in the tough streets of Handsworth, Birmingham, Barrington adopted a criminal lifestyle with an addiction to violence;[4] this was during the early 1980s when relationships between ethnic communities in the inner cities and the police force were tense. The decision of Barrington and other members of the black community to make a stand resulted in the 1980s Handsworth riots.[5]

In 2006 Barrington was featured in the television documentary _The Real Football Factories_, broadcast on Bravo. In 2008 a full episode of _Danny Dyer's Deadliest men_ series was based on Barrington's life around Coventry, hosted by British actor Danny Dyer,in which he described Barrington as one of the most intimidating individuals he had ever met.[6] The filming was built up towards his retirement MMA bout against Bob Schrijber and later broadcast on Bravo, Sky and Virgin Media channels.[7]

Since retiring, Barrington has continued training himself and coaching others, including German MMA fighter Nordin Asrih and members of the Team Pride Gym of Germany, as well as current England Test Cricketer, Ian Bell.[8] Barrington is currently based in the West Midlands, where he also heads the toughest doors of Coventry's clubland and has a security business with staff working for him in Coventry and surrounding areas.[9]

Barrington's autobiography _One-eyed Baz_, was published in 2010 by Pennant Books.The book has attracted positive reviews on Amazon.[10][11]

Kickboxing

During his active years as a professional kickboxer Barrington achieved many awards for fighting all across the globe, including Japan and the USA. Patterson fought Dennis Alexio for the VACANT International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) World title in 1997, but lost by KO. Within his career of over 60 fights, notable opponents Barrington has fought against include former heavyweight WBC boxing world champion Vitali Klitchko and Dennis Alexio.[12]

Mixed martial arts

In October 1999, Barrington made his debut in mixed martial arts (MMA) at an It's Showtime event against Sander Mackilljan, which Barrington won within the first round.

In 2005 at the Strikeforce Cage Warriors Fighting Championship event at Coventry's SkyDome Arena Barrington fought Marc Emmanuel and was defeated in the first round. The result outraged the crowd, which was rumoured to include his fellow Zulu warrior members,[13] and resulted in a riot that forced the police to end the event. A total of 3000 spectators were evacuated from the SkyDome Arena.[14]

After a total of seven fights Barrington announced that he would retire, although he would do one last MMA bout, which was to take place in Rotterdam, Holland, at the "KOE - Tough Is Not Enough" event on 5 October 2008 against Dutch and former pride fighter Bob Schrijber. Barrington won the fight after a judges' decision result, winning the W.I.P.U. "King of the Ring" veterans title.[15][16]
