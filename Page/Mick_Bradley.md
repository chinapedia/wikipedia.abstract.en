MICK BRADLEY (1947 â€“ 8 February 1972) was a British drummer and vocalist, known for being a member of the blues-rock band Steamhammer.[1][2] He played on three Steamhammer albums.

In 1969, Bradley played drums on the _Methuselah_ album by the late 1960s band Methuselah.[3] He then joined Steamhammer, taking over from Michael Rushton, and played drums on the _Mk II_ (1969), _Mountains_ (1970), and _Speech_ (1972) albums.[4] He also played percussion and conga.

Bradley died on 8 February 1972, aged 25.[5] He died from undiagnosed leukemia shortly before the mixing of the _Speech_ album was completed. The album is dedicated to him on the inside album cover and the band dissolved the following year, making _Speech_ the final Steamhammer album.[6] A memorial concert took place at the Marquee Club in London on 14 March 1972, with appearances by the bands Atomic Rooster, Beggars Opera, If, and Gringo.[7]
