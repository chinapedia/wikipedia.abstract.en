Under-representation

When elected in 2012 Councillor Ahmed raised concerns that the Butetown ward, with only one councillor for a diverse area, was under-represented on Cardiff Council.[5] The issue was raised again in 2016 by the Atlantic Wharf Residentsâ€™ Association, who demanded that Atlantic Wharf be made into a ward of its own with its approximately 1500 houses and flats. Butetown ward had a population similar to the Cardiff wards of Llanrumney and Cyncoed, which each elected three councillors.[6]
