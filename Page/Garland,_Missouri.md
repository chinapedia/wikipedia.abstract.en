GARLAND (also known as HARVEY) is an unincorporated community in Henry County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The community is on an abandoned railroad line in an old coal mining area, approximately six miles northwest of Clinton, just east of Missouri Route O.[2]


History

Garland was platted ca. 1890 when the railroad was extended to that point.[3] A post office called Garland was established in 1886, and remained in operation until 1927.[4] The community was named after Garland Covington, the son of the original owner of the town site.[5]
