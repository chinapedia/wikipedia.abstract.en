Biography

Born in Split, Quaiatti studied music at the conservatory in Trieste, making her operatic debut in that city as Frasquita in _Carmen_ in 1907. Two years later she sang the title role in _Madama Butterfly_ in Ascoli Piceno, and soon thereafter performed in _La bohème_ at the Teatro Sociale in Bergamo. In 1912 she won plaudits for her performance of Amilcare Ponchielli's _Lina_ in Cremona. During her career she would go on to sing in such works as _Otello_ and _Falstaff_ of Giuseppe Verdi; _Lohengrin_ and _Der fliegende Holländer_ of Richard Wagner; _La Wally_ and _Loreley_ of Alfredo Catalani; _Lodoletta_, _Cavalleria rusticana_ and _L'amico Fritz_ of Pietro Mascagni; _Andrea Chénier_ and _Fedora_ of Umberto Giordano,[4] _Mefistofele_ of Arrigo Boito; and _Manon_ of Jules Massenet.[5] She would eventually perform in most of the major Italian houses.[6] In 1913 she created the role of Mimi in the premiere of _Mimi Pinson_, the revised version of Ruggiero Leoncavallo's _La bohème_, in Palermo.[7]

Quaiatti made her Metropolitan Opera debut, under the name "Ida Cajatti", as Musetta in a performance of Puccini's _La bohème_ on November 19, 1915; conductor Gaetano Bavagnoli bowed with the company on the same evening. Other performers in the cast included Frances Alda, Enrico Caruso, and Antonio Scotti. One reviewer described her voice as "light", and spoke unfavorably of her performance.[8] She went on to sing fifteen performances with the Metropolitan over the course of the season. Most were as Musetta, but several were as Nedda in _Pagliacci_.[9] A review called her performance in the latter role "hardly satisfactory, as her voice was unsteady and her lapses from the pitch very frequent."[10] Other reviews of her season were more favorable.[11] These performances were her only ones with the company.[12]

During World War I Quaiatti sang mainly in Italy, appearing in Turin, Genoa, Rome, Florence, and Naples, where she performed Tosca opposite the Cavaradossi of Beniamino Gigli at the Teatro San Carlo.[13] In 1917, in Rome, she created the title role in the world premiere of Renzo Bianchi's _Gismonda_, appearing alongside Edoardo Garbin and Domenico Viglione Borghese.[14] She went on to sing at Covent Garden in London, where she debuted in 1920 as Puccini's Manon Lescaut,[15] and at theaters in Budapest, Mexico, Peru,[16] and Chile.[17] Puccini, having heard her in a performance of _La bohème_, requested that she sing Giorgetta in the premiere of the revised _Il tabarro_ at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence in 1919;[18] she essayed the same role at Covent Garden in 1920. She finished her career with performances of Minnie in _La fanciulla del West_, her last assumption of the role coming at the Khedivial Opera House in Cairo in 1932. Quaiatti died in Venice.[19] A biography of the soprano by her daughter was published in 1968.[20][21]
