250px A FIRE IN A BROTHEL (_Pożar w Burdelu_, PwB) - is a Polish political and literary cabaret commenting on contemporary social and political events. It was established in Warsaw in September 2012. It is also involved in animation of the cultural life in Warsaw's _Praga shore of the Vistula_ and gives performances for children.


History

It was established in September 2012 by playwright Michał Walczak and historian Maciej Łubieński. They debuted on stage of the _Klub Komediowy Chłodna_ (_Comedy Club on the Cool Street_). In that time its audience was rather limited as the Cool Street Comedy Club was small. In 2015, the cabaret applied to the Polish Patent Office that the name PwB is registered as a trademark, but the name was considered too controversial. The band released an album of songs from the show _Saturday Night Uprising_ in 2014. In 2016 it moved to Warsaw Praga district. The cabaret characters represent a spectrum of political attitudes in Poland. Team members conduct independent programs and stand-ups: _Catholic Stand-up_, _Iron Vaginas_ , _Brothel TV_ , _Therapist of the City_. In 2016, the cabaret artists joined the _Święto Placu Hallera_ (_Haller's Square Festival_) with performances of the _I Festiwal Magii i Ściemy_ (_Premier Festival of Magic and Bullshit_). It is one of the most popular Polish contemporary satirical cabarets.


Mise-en-scène

There are about 10-15 actors and musicians during each performance of _A Fire in a Brothel_. Like other cabarets of its genre such as Saturday Night Live the PwB presents scenes (songs, stand-up) commenting on contemporary life and like other Polish cabarets (e.g. Kabaret Olgi Lipińskiej) they are related to social events in Warsaw and political scene in Poland. The cabaret characters include an announcer, The Brothel Father (Burdeltata), there is Madame (Burdelmama), Pastor of Hipsters (Duszpasterz Hispsterów), Doctor Fak who deals with erotic energy of Warsaw, neurotic varsovienne Paula of Wilanów, nationalists - Rainbow Arsonist (Podpalacz tęczy) and Etno, Culture (Kultura), The City Mayor HGW, and Girls of Charlotte (Dziewczyny z Charlotte). The audience follows their lives, transformations and conflicts through monologues, songs and skits. There are often ironic allusions to political and cultural events presented with absurd humor, vulgarity mixed with lyricism. On occasion PwB borders on burlesque with performances of a stripper Betty-Q or _Nasty Illusionist_ Menello.
