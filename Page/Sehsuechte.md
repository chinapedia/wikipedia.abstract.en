_Sehsuechte_ (German: _SEHSÜCHTE_; neologism generated of the words _Sehnsucht_ (eng: _longing_) and _sehen_ (eng: _to view, to see_)) is an international student film festival with an over 60 years lasting tradition. It takes place annually in spring in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany.


History

From 1972 on, the so-called FDJ Student Film Days of the _University for Film and Television Konrad Wolf_ (known as HFF) were held on the DEFA-campus in Potsdam-Babelsberg. However, in the course of Germany's reunification the FDJ Student Film Days were ended temporarily. After this short interruption, students of the study program _Audiovisual Media Sciences_ revived the film fest in 1995 under the name _Sehsüchte_. Today the students of the master program _Media Sciences_ are in charge of the festival's organization and are supported by the bachelor students of the program _Digital Media Culture_.


Festival

Annually, about 120 short and feature films in the categories fiction, documentary, genre, animation as well as music videos and youth films are screened. The program always comprises films from Europe and the whole world. In 2016, the program included projects from 28 countries, such as Russia, Israel, India and China.[1] A jury, consisting of prominent filmmakers and film experts, ultimately rewards the best oeuvres.

The organizers’ aim is to provide a platform to young international filmmakers and to enhance the exchange of ideas among themselves, with media and film professionals as well as with the broader audience. Especially the latter emphasizes that _Sehsüchte_ always seeks to be a public event. Annually, about 8.000 film-enthusiasts, qualified visitors and journalists attend the several days lasting festival,[2] which takes place in next to the famous Studio Babelsberg, Europe's oldest and biggest film studio.[3]


Competition

The international competition is divided into the sections _Feature Film_, Short Film, _Documentary Film_, _Genre Film_, _Music Video_, _Spotlight Production_, _Future: Kids_ and _Future: Teens_. Live action and animation are treated equally.

The jury principally does not evaluate the films according to predefined criteria. However, esthetics, narration and originality loom large. One exception is the section _Spotlight Production_. Here the management and financial planning of the film's production are evaluated.

While in all competition sections an expert jury (in the case of _Future: Kids_ and _Future:Teens_ a children and youth jury) elects the winner, the music video award 2017 will be bestowed as an audience award.

_Schreibsüchte_ is, in contrast to the remaining competition categories, a solely germanophone competition. Here the work of authors and project developers in the categories _Screenplay_ and _Pitch_ is appreciated and in both cases the most promising project awarded. Writing skills, dramatic composition and ingenuity are pivotal while feasibility remains secondary.

In the past, additionally those awards were bestowed:

-   Award Against Exclusion (2003 - 2005,[4][5][6] 2008 - 2010[7][8][9])
-   Innovation Award (2003 - 2005[10][11][12])
-   Editing Award (2003 - 2005,[13][14][15] 2008 - 2015[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23])
-   Cinematography Award (2005,[24] 2008 - 2010,[25][26][27] 2012,[28] 2013[29])
-   German Junior Award (2005,[30] 2008,[31] 2009[32])
-   Actor's Award (2008,[33] 2010 - 2012,[34][35][36] 2014,[37] 2015[38])
-   Focus-Dialog Award (2008 - 2010,[39][40][41] 2012,[42] 2013[43])
-   Start-Up Award (2010[44])
-   Sound Award (2015[45])


Focus

Every year, the _Sehsüchte Focus_ announces a geographical or socio-cultural topic that takes the center stage of the festival and thus invites to discover it in new and different manners. 2003 was overshadowed by 9/11 related topics. With a view to the Chinese Cinema 2005 the Focus series was established in the festival program. Under the Motto “Sehsüchte in Gold Fever” the student festival 2006 devoted itself to Russian Cinema. 2009 then, the view was directed to the Indian subcontinent, 2010 South Africa was in the focus, 2011 the Turkey. In 2012, for the first time, Sehsüchte Focus did not pivot on a specific region anymore but with “Sustainability” on a concept. In the year of 2013, the students put “Excess” in the center and during the Sehsüchte Festival 2014 everything turned to “Transit”. With the focus theme “Echo” in 2014 Sehsüchte bethought itself in its function as an audience festival and enhanced the exchange between filmmakers and their public. 2016 the motto „S.P.A.C.E.“ was elected and fitting to this the new competition category “Genre Film” was established. The overall topic of 2017's festival program will be called “surfaces”.


Retrospective

When the HFF celebrated its 50-year existence in 2004, the _Retrospective_ was established as a look back on the student films which were produced during this half a century. In 2009 the _Retrospective_ succeeded in establishing itself through a monographic show of Andreas Dresen in the light of the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 2010 this historical screening series was devoted to Hans-Christian Schmid’s oeuvre. 2011 Sehsüchte showed several films of Wim Wenders, among others his work Pina in 3D, while in 2012 the _Retrospective_ was attended to two filmmakers who could not be more different: the German director, writer and producer Doris Dörrie and the German splatter specialist, author and film critic Jörg Buttgereit. In 2013 the _Retrospective_ was rethought and complemented with a playful _Futurospective_. Here, for the first time it was not anymore the monographic show of one single artist which was in the focus. Instead, everything turned on the question how filmmakers in the past and the present developed and enhanced innovative forms of film-making.

During the years 2015 and 2016, the Retrospective disappeared in the festival’s program before now in 2017 it will be revived. The motivation for this was the Media Science’s students’ wish to strengthen the integration of their fellow students in the festival's organization. So in 2017, the _Retrospective_ for the first time will be curated autonomously by students of the Master program _Film Culture Heritage_.


Jurors

The winner's films in the several competition categories are elected by expert juries respectively. Each year, those juries are recomposed with experienced filmmakers and experts of the media industry.
