KHINCHIN'S THEOREM ON THE FACTORIZATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS says that every probability distribution _P_ admits (in the convolution semi-group of probability distributions) a factorization

_P_ = _P_₁ ⊗ _P_₂

where _P_₁ is a probability distribution without any indecomposable factor and _P_₂ is a distribution that is either degenerate or is representable as the convolution of a finite or countable set of indecomposable distributions. The factorization is not unique, in general.

The theorem was proved by A. Ya. Khinchin[1] for distributions on the line, and later it became clear[2] that it is valid for distributions on considerably more general groups. A broad class (see[3][4][5]) of topological semi-groups is known, including the convolution semi-group of distributions on the line, in which factorization theorems analogous to Khinchin's theorem are valid.
