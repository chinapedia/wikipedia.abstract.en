This designation system was introduced in 1922 and, although there have been changes and additions to it over time, the system as a whole is still in use to present day.


Basic Principles

The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps squadron designation comprises a combination of letters and numerals, each having a precise meaning. From left to right, the designation includes the following three components:[1]

-   First letter signifies the type of equipment used by the squadron, where
    -   V stands for fixed-wing aircraft (originally â€“ heaVier-than-air)
    -   Z is for lighter-than-Air craft, and
    -   H is for rotorcraft (Helicopters)
-   Subsequent letters (one or several), known as "class letters", indicate the primary mission of the squadron.
-   Finally, a numeral, preceded by a dash, is the unique number of the squadron within its class.

Thus, for example, VP-1 is the designator for Patrol Squadron One, where the "V" stands for Heavier-than-Air and the class letter "P" stands for Patrol, while ZP-1 is the designator for Airship Patrol Squadron One, with the "Z" indicating Lighter-than-Air.

Two or more class letters may follow the "V". In such designators the following letters usually narrow down the class specified by the preceding one: for example, VAH-1 stands for Heavy Attack Squadron One. There are exceptions to this rule, however. In a designation like VAW-123, the "AW" is to be treated as an unbreakable combination that signifies Airborne Early Warning and has nothing to do with "A" for Attack.

What follows is a list of designations that have been used or are in use by actual squadrons of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.[2]

| VA         | Attack Squadron                                            | This designation first came into use in 1945, with carrier-based bomber (VB) and torpedo bomber (VT) squadrons being re-classified as attack squadrons. It was discontinued with the retirement of the Grumman A-6 Intruder in 1997.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VA(AW)     | All Weather Attack Squadron                                | The Navy employed this designator for squadrons equipped with all-weather variants of the Douglas AD Skyraider. It was discontinued with the demise of the wide-body Skyraiders from the Navy inventory, and squadrons equipped with newer all-weather attack aircraft such as Grumman A-6 Intruder received "plain" VA designators.                                                                                            |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAH        | Heavy Attack Squadron                                      | This designator was first given in the 1950s to former composite (VC) squadrons flying the North American AJ Savage. VAH squadrons existed until the early 1970s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VA(HM)     | Heavy Attack (Mining) Squadron                             | The Navy employed this designator in the 1950s for a very small number of Lockheed P2V Neptune units specifically tasked with minelaying duties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAK        | Tactical Aerial Refueling Squadron                         | This designator was only used for a very short time by a small number of reserve units flying the Douglas KA-3B Skywarrior tanker variant. The majority of squadrons flying the KA-3B tankers did so while still being designated Heavy Attack Squadrons, and squadrons flying other types of tanker-capable aircraft such as the Grumman KA-6D Intruder did so without any change in designation.                              |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAL        | Light Attack Squadron                                      | Only one squadron has ever carried this designation, VAL-4 flying the North American OV-10 Bronco aircraft between 1969 and 1972.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| VAP        | Heavy Photographic Squadron                                | This designator was instituted in the early 1950s for photo-reconnaissance squadrons equipped with heavy carrier-capable aircraft such as the North American AJ-2P Savage. It was discontinued with the demise of the last photo reconnaissance Douglas RA-3B Skywarriors in the early 1970s.                                                                                                                                   |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAQ        | Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron                       | This designator was instituted upon the introduction of the Douglas EKA-3B Skywarrior variant in the late 1960s. Before that, dedicated electronic warfare assets have been part of composite (VC) or early warning (VAW) squadrons.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAQ        | Electronic Attack Squadron                                 | In early 1998 the VAQ designation was changed from "Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron" to "Electronic Attack Squadron".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VAW        | Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron                    | This designator was first given in the late 1950s to former composite (VC) squadrons flying the Douglas AD-5W Skyraider. Since then all airborne early warning units were designated as VAW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| VB         | Bombing Squadron                                           | Carrier-based bomber squadrons, designated as VB, first appeared in the early 1920s. After the end of the World War II all remaining VB units were re-designated as attack squadrons (VA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| VBF        | Fighter-Bomber Squadron                                    | Although most World War II era carrier-based fighter units have routinely performed ground attack missions, some squadrons have been specifically designated as VBF during the course of war. VBF designation was discontinued after the war, and until the introduction of the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18 Hornet the Navy squadrons flying tactical fighters have carried out ground attack duties while being designated VF.    |

| VC         | Composite Squadron                                         | There have been several waves of composite squadrons in the U.S. Navy. From 1942 until 1945 the VC designation was assigned to squadrons that comprised fighter and bomber aircraft and flew from escort carriers. All such units were disestablished with the post-war mothballing of escort carriers.                                                                                                                         |

| VCS        | Cruiser Scouting Squadron                                  | Squadrons of this type were formed in the late 1930s to provide scout floatplanes for the Navy's cruisers. This designation was discontinued upon the end of World War II.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| VD         | Photographic Squadron                                      | Photographic squadrons have probably undergone more re-designations than any other single type of squadron in the Navy. The VD designation was in use during the World War II years, to be replaced with VJ after the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| VF         | Fighter Squadron                                           | This is one of the oldest aircraft squadron designators in the Navy, in use since the early 1920s and until 2006 when it was discontinued with the retirement of the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| VF(AW)     | All Weather Fighter Squadron                               | The Navy used this designator for a short period of time between the mid 1950s and the early 1960s. With all new tactical fighters being radar-equipped and thus all-weather capable (at least in theory), this designator was deemed to be redundant and was discontinued.                                                                                                                                                     |

| VFC        | Fighter Squadron, Composite                                | Introduced in the late 1980s when several former composite (VC) squadrons were thus re-designated to reflect their adversary fighter training role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| VF(N)      | Night Fighter Squadron                                     | VF(N) designator was instituted during the World War II years for squadrons composed of radar-equipped fighters. In the mid-1950s this designation was discontinued in favor of the VF(AW) variant to reflect the true all-weather role of newer radar-equipped aircraft.                                                                                                                                                       |

| VFP        | Light Photographic Squadron                                | The VFP designator was assigned to squadrons equipped with photo reconnaissance variants of carrier-capable tactical fighter aircraft. First introduced in the late 1940s, it was discontinued with the demise of the Vought RF-8G Crusader in the 1980s.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| RVAW       | Readiness Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron          | For a short period of time this designation was assigned to carrier airborne early warning (VAW) units acting as Fleet Replacement Squadrons. Curiously, other types of fleet replacement squadrons (such as VA, VAQ, VFA, VS, etc.) did not get the "R" added to their designations.                                                                                                                                           |

Between 1927 and 1937 suffix letters (or assignment letters) were in use to indicate Fleet or Force assignments of a particular squadron.

Thus, for example, VF-1B stood for Fighter Squadron One, attached to Battle Fleet.

The full list of pre-war suffix letters is as follows:[4]

  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SUFFIX LETTER   NOTES
  A               Squadron attached to Asiatic Fleet
  B               Squadron attached to Battle Fleet
  D               Squadron assigned to a Naval District; the "D" in this case is followed by district number (e.g. VN-1D8 is for Training Squadron One, Naval District Eight)
  F               Squadron attached to Base Force
  R               Reserve Squadron
  S               Squadron attached to Scouting Fleet
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A brief resurgence of suffix letters in the Navy squadron designators was seen between 1946 and 1948.

The following suffix letters were in use during that period:[5]

  --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  SUFFIX LETTER   NOTES
  A               Squadron attached to Attack Carrier Air Group
  B               Squadron attached to Battle Carrier Air Group
  B               For use by Observation Squadrons attached to Battleship Force
  C               For use by Observation Squadron attached to Cruiser Force
  E               Squadron attached to Escort Carrier Air Group
  L               Squadron attached to Light Carrier Air Group
  --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

In 1948 the use of suffix letters in squadron designators was discontinued.

  DESIGNATOR   FULL NAME                                     NOTES
  HA(L)        Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light)            Only three squadrons have ever carried this designation, HA(L)-3 flying the Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter between 1967 and 1972, and HA(L)-4 and HA(L)-5 which flew the HH-1K Huey beginning in the late 1970s until they transitioned to the HH-60H Seahawk and were redesignated HCS squadrons.
  HC           Helicopter Combat Support Squadron            This designation was in use between the 1960s and the 2000s. HC squadrons were tasked with a wide variety of duties such as rescue (including combat search and rescue), carrier onboard delivery, liaison, light transport, Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) and range service.
  HCS          Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Special    This designation was in use between 1988 and 2006. HA(L)-4 and HA(L)-5 were redesignated HCS-4 and HCS-5 when they transitioned to the HH-60H Seahawk.
  HCT          Helicopter Combat Support Training Squadron   A one of a kind designation that was in use between 1974 and 1977 by HCT-16. The mission of this squadron was to provide helicopter search and rescue and plane guard service for the training aircraft carrier USS Lexington and overall SAR coverage for the Pensacola Naval air training complex.
  HM           Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron      Instituted in the 1970s, this designation was assigned to the specialized minesweeping units. Historically, HM squadrons are flying the heaviest helicopter types in the Navy inventory and are thus tasked with logistics and carrier onboard delivery duties as well.
  HS           Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron            HS designation for the rotary wing ASW squadrons was instituted in the early 1950s. It was discontinued with the retirement of the aircraft carrier based SH-60F Seahawk and the transition of those squadrons to the mulit-mission MH-60S Seahawk.
  HSC          Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron                This designation was instituted in the 2000s to emphasize multi-role capabilities of the former carrier based ASW HS squadrons and VERTREP HC squadrons as they transitioned from the SH-60F Seahawk and the H-46 Sea Knight respectively to the MH-60S Seahawk .
  HSL          Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light      HSL designation was instituted in the early 1970s upon the introduction of the ASW variant of the Kaman Seasprite helicopter into the Navy inventory. It was discontinued in the 2000s when the HSL squadrons flying the SH-60B Seahawk transitioned to the MH-60R Seahawk and were redesignated HSM.
  HSM          Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron           This designation was instituted in the 2000s upon the introduction of the Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk multi-purpose helicopter into the fleet service.
  HT           Helicopter Training Squadron                  This designation has been in use for dedicated training squadrons since the 1950s and is still in use today.
  HU           Helicopter Utility Squadron                   This is one of the oldest rotary wing squadron designators in the Navy, in use since 1948 and into the 1960s. Helicopter utility squadrons were typically tasked with such duties as rescue, plane guard, liaison and light transport.
  HX           Air Test and Evaluation Squadron              Squadrons bearing this designation are responsible for the operational testing and evaluation of new helicopter types, weapons, tactics and techniques.

U.S. Marine Corps - List of Fixed Wing Squadron Designations

Squadron designations between 1920 and 1937:

  ------------ ----------------------
  DESIGNATOR   FULL NAME
  VF           Fighter Squadron
  VJ           Utility Squadron
  VO           Observation Squadron
  VP           Patrol Squadron
  VS           Scouting Squadron
  ------------ ----------------------

During that period of time a squadron of the Marine Corps could be distinguished from a Navy squadron by a suffix letter "M".[7]

Thus, VF-2M stood for Marine Fighter Squadron Two, VO-8M stood for Marine Observation Squadron Eight, and so forth.

In 1937 the suffix letters in squadron designators were discontinued, and the letter "M" signifying the Marine Corps was moved into a fixed place after the "V". Designations of all existing Marine squadrons were changed accordingly: e.g., VF-2M became VMF-2.

Squadron designations after 1937:

  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DESIGNATOR   FULL NAME                                              NOTES
  VMA          Marine Attack Squadron                                 VMA designation was introduced after the World War II for use by Marine Corps squadrons dedicated to ground attack mission. Today VMA squadrons fly the AV-8B Harrier.
  VMA(AW)      Marine All-Weather Attack Squadron                     This designator was instituted with the introduction of the Grumman A-6 Intruder all-weather attack bomber into the Marine Corps Aviation in 1966 and was discontinued in 1993 with its retirement.
  VMAQ         Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron            In the mid-1970s, the Marine Corps composite community was reorganized and split into tactical electronic warfare (VMAQ) and photographic reconnaissance (VMFP) squadrons. Today VMAQ squadrons operate Grumman EA-6B Prowler highly specialized electronic warfare aircraft.
  VMAQT        Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Training Squadron   VMAQT squadrons are tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMAQ squadrons.
  VMAT         Marine Attack Training Squadron                        VMAT squadrons are tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMA squadrons.
  VMB          Marine Bombing Squadron                                Marine bombing squadrons, in existence during the World War II years, were first equipped with the Douglas SBD Dauntless and tasked with bombing missions in support of the Marine Corps units. Starting from 1943, a number of new VMB squadrons were formed to fill the need for a long range, land based bomber that could be used against enemy shipping and submarines. These VMB squadrons operated the North American PBJ-1 Mitchell.
  VMC          Marine Composite Squadron                              Marine composite squadrons, appearing in the early 1950s, consolidated specialized night attack, electronic warfare and airborne early warning aircraft and were tasked with supporting other Marine aviation units.
  VMCJ         Marine Composite Squadron                              Marine composite squadrons changed their designation from VMC to VMCJ in the late 1950s when photographic reconnaissance assets of VMJ squadrons were integrated into existing composite squadrons. VMCJ units continued to perform electronic warfare and photographic reconnaissance tasks until the 1970s, when these two types of missions were again separated into different types of squadrons, VMAQ and VMFP respectively.
  VMD          Marine Photographic Squadron                           The VMD designation was in use by photographic reconnaissance squadrons of the Marine Corps during the World War II years, to be replaced with VMJ after the war.
  VMF          Marine Fighter Squadron                                This is one of the oldest squadron designator in the Marine Corps, in use until the 1970s when it was discontinued with the retirement of the Vought F-8 Crusader.
  VMFA         Marine Fighter Attack Squadron                         VMFA designation gradually came into use in the mid-1960s with the widespread introduction of the McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter-bomber into squadron service. Today VMFA squadrons fly the single-seat variants of the F/A-18 Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II multirole fighters.
  VMFA(AW)     Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron             This squadron designation was instituted upon the introduction of the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18D Hornet into the Marine Corps inventory.
  VMFAT        Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron                VMFAT squadrons are tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMFA and VMFA(AW) squadrons.
  VMF(AW)      Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron             This designation was introduced in the mid-1950s to replace the earlier night fighter variant, VMF(N). While those squadrons that received the McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II in the early 1960s have quickly acquired the new Fighter Attack (VMFA) designation, the units equipped with the Vought F-8 Crusader continued to use the VMF(AW) variant well into the 1970s until the retirement of the Crusader from the Marines inventory.
  VMF(N)       Marine Night Fighter Squadron                          VMF(N) designator was instituted during the World War II years for squadrons composed of radar-equipped fighters. In the mid-1950s this designation was discontinued in favor of the VMF(AW) variant to reflect the true all-weather role of newer radar-equipped aircraft.
  VMFP         Marine Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron                In the mid-1970s, the Marine Corps composite community was reorganized and split into tactical electronic warfare (VMAQ) and tactical reconnaissance (VMFP) squadrons. The single resulting reconnaissance squadron, VMFP-3, operated the McDonnell-Douglas RF-4B Phantom II dedicated photo-reconnaissance variant until its demise in 1990.
  VMFT         Marine Fighter Training Squadron                       In the past, VMFT squadrons were tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMF squadrons. Today, the single existing squadron of such type, VMFT-401, provides instruction to active and reserve squadrons through dissimilar adversary combat tactics.
  VMFT(AW)     Marine All-Weather Fighter Training Squadron           VMFT(AW) squadrons were tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMF(AW) squadrons.
  VMGR         Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron              With the introduction of the KC-130F aerial refueling variant of the Lockheed Hercules in the early 1960s, several former VMR squadrons were re-designated VMGR, and their primary mission became aerial refueling. Besides that, VMGR squadrons are tasked with providing assault transport of troops, equipment, and supplies.
  VMGRT        Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Training Squadron     VMGRT squadrons are tasked with training pilots and crews on the aircraft employed by VMGR squadrons.
  VMJ          Marine Utility Squadron                                Between the 1937 and 1945 the VMJ designation was assigned to Marine Corps squadrons tasked with support duties such as target towing, liaison and logistics
  VMJ          Marine Photographic Squadron                           Marine photographic reconnaissance squadrons were assigned this designation for a brief period between 1945 and the early 1950s when the photo reconnaissance assets were integrated into composite (VMCJ) squadrons.
  VMIT         Marine Instrument Training Squadron                    This was a short-lived designation used in the 1950s by a small number of squadrons specially tasked with instrument flight training for the Marine Corps pilots.
  VML          Marine Glider Squadron                                 In existence between 1942 and 1943, glider squadrons were supposed to be a part of the Marine Corps glider infantry force. The program was terminated with the general disillusionment in offensive glider operations.
  VMO          Marine Observation Squadron                            Although initially conceived for the purpose of observation and artillery spotting, VMO squadrons performed a wide variety of tasks, including fighter, close air support, liaison, rescue and medevac missions. The designation was in use until the 1990s when it was discontinued with the retirement of the North American OV-10 Bronco. Despite being formally assigned to the fixed wing category, VMO squadrons routinely operated helicopters throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
  VMP          Marine Photographic Squadron                           The VMP designation was in use by photographic reconnaissance squadrons of the Marine Corps during the World War II years, to be replaced with VMJ after the war.
  VMR          Marine Transport Squadron                              The mission of VMR squadrons is to support the Marine Corps operations with transporting personnel and cargo, medical evacuation and aerial resupply.
  VMS          Marine Scouting Squadron                               Since their inception, Marine Corps scouting squadrons normally flew the same types of light scout bomber aircraft as did their Navy VS counterparts and were tasked with scouting and bombing duties. During the World War II years the VMS designation gradually gave way to VMSB, with both disappearing after the war end.
  VMSB         Marine Scout Bombing Squadron                          Marine scout bombing squadrons, in existence during the World War II, were tasked with bombing, close air support and scouting missions. They operated the Vought SB2U Vindicator, Douglas SBD Dauntless and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver.
  VMT          Marine Training Squadron                               VMT designation was in use for the Marine Corps training squadrons until the 1960s when the Corps introduced the practice of giving specialized designations to training squadrons depending on the mission type they were training for, such as VMAT, VMFT, VMFT(AW) and so forth.
  VMTB         Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron                        Marine torpedo bombing squadrons, in existence during the World War II, performed bombing and close air support missions. They operated the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber aircraft.
  VMU          Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron                This squadron designation was instituted in 1996, a considerable time after the widespread introduction of tactical unmanned aerial vehicles into the Marine Corps inventory has begun. The primary mission of VMU squadrons is aerial surveillance and reconnaissance in support of the Marine Corps ground troops.
  VMX          Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron        VMX-1, the only squadron in existence bearing the VMX designation, is responsible for the operational testing and evaluation of new aircraft types, weapons, tactics and techniques for the Marine Corps. It operates fixed wing, rotary wing and tiltrotor assets, depending on the current programs.
