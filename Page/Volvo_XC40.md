The VOLVO XC40 is a compact luxury crossover SUV[1] manufactured by Volvo Cars. It was revealed on 21 September 2017. Orders started in September of 2017, and manufacturing began in November 2017.

The XC40 was named _Car of the Year_ by the magazine _What Car?_ in January 2018, and it was given the European Car of the Year Award at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show.[2][3] The XC40 was also awarded _Carsales Car of the Year_ in 2018[4] and Irish Car of the Year in 2019.[5] The company plans to increase their production across 2018 to 2019 to meet global demand.[6]


Concept 40.1

A concept car called CONCEPT 40.1 was originally designed by Thomas Ingenlath and unveiled in 2016. This prototype in engineering was a historic event in Volvo car history as it was the first five-door compact SUV released by Volvo^([1]).

Ingenlath’s 40.1 concept car was the overarching inspiration for the 40 Series models. The new concept vehicle represented a shift in thinking for Volvo’s approach to vehicles.[7] By focusing on compact crossover models, this concept vehicle illustrates the potential for the Volvo XC40 and potential other compact vehicles.[8]

The change in design championed the development of luxury compact SUV’s and sedans within the Volvo range. With innovative practices like using the compact modular architecture platform, Volvo ensured that their latest additions have been specifically tailored to smaller vehicles.

The compact modular architecture platform allows for aesthetics of the exterior and interior to be altered while maintaining a sense of quality amongst all variants of cars. This process started with the XC40 and the XC90 and will continue to be used across select models of Volvo.[9]


XC40

The XC40 is the first Volvo to utilise the new CMA platform, to be shared by future compact Volvos, Geely, and models of Lynk & Co, and is celebrated for its take on the luxury compact SUV. The optimisation of space within the interior of the car is regarded as a pivotal feature of the XC40 due to its increase in boot space.[10]

The XC40 is powered through the front wheels and AWD by Volvo's new 1.5 litre three cylinder and existing 2.0 litre four cylinder engines, in both diesel and petrol variants. As of 2019 a FWD plug in hybrid named "T5 Twin Engine" is also available, combining a 180PS petrol version of the 1.5 litre with a 74PS electric motor.

Starting in 2020, an all electric variant will be available in select markets, presumably using the same powertrains and batteries as its sister model Polestar 2, which in turn is based on the concept car, the 40.2.[11]

With advancements in technology, aspects like the Intellisafe feature have been installed within the Volvo XC40. This technology is designed with the intention of preventing run off road accidents. By using the car's advanced sensory system, the technology can detect potentially fatal scenarios such as run off road protection.

Safety belts are also capable of being automatically adjusted throughout these moments of impact while energy absorbing seat frames and seats are in place to prevent spine injuries. This technology was created based on real life data, and various crash test track methods such as: ditch, airborne and rough terrains.[12]

The XC40 debuted for the Canadian market at the 2018 Montreal Auto Show.[13] The Volvo XC40 officially won the European Car of the Year in 2018.[14]
