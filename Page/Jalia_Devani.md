JALIA DEVANI (Hindi जलिया देवानी) is a former Hindu Rajput non-salute princely state on Saurashtra peninsula, in Gujarat, western India.


History

The princely state, in Halar prant, was ruled by Jadeja Rajputs. It comprised 10 villages, covering 36 square miles (93 km²), with a population of 2,444 in 1901 (2,688 in 1921), yielding 16,230 Rupees state revenue (1903-4, mostly from land; later 17.000), paying 1,525 Rupees tribute to the Gaekwar Baroda State. During the British Raj, it was a Fifth Class state,[1] in the charge of the colonial Eastern Kathiawar Agency. The Jurisdictional competence of the Taluka were limited in civil cases to 5,000 Rupees, in criminal matters to two years of rigorous imprisonment and fines up to 2,000 Rupees.

It ceased to exist on 15 February 1948 by accession to Saurashtra State (later merged into Bombay State, now part of Gujarat).
