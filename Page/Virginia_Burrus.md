Professor Burrus specializes in the literary and cultural history of Christianity, and has a wide range of interests including gender, sexuality, orthodoxy and heresy, martyrdom, asceticism, hagiography and histories of theology within Late Antiquity.[15] Burrus engages with a variety of theoretical discourses within her work, including feminism and post-colonialism, applying and critiquing the approaches of 20th century philosophers and theorists such as Baudrillard, Cixous, Foucault and Irigaray.[16] Her 2004 publication _The Sex Lives of the Saints_ has been translated into French, Italian and Czech.[17]
