The _HALIFAX EXAMINER_ is an online newspaper based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was founded in 2014 by Tim Bousquet, former news editor of _The Coast_ alternative weekly paper. Bousquet, known for covering local politics and undertaking long-term investigations and media analysis, describes the outlet as an "independent, adversarial news site devoted to holding the powerful accountable".[1]

The website is supported by subscribers. Most of the daily stories are free, while more in-depth stories and investigative pieces are behind a paywall.[2] A standard subscription costs $10 per month. The website is ad-free, with Bousquet having expressed an aversion to advertising.[3]

The outlet also produces a podcast called "Examineradio".
