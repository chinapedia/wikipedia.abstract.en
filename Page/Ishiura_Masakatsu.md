(born January 10, 1990 in Tottori Prefecture, Japan), is a professional sumo wrestler. He debuted in sumo wrestling on January 2013 and made his _makuuchi_ debut in November 2016. His highest rank has been _maegashira_ 8, and he has one special prize for Fighting Spirit. He wrestles for Miyagino stable.


Background

Ishiura was born in Tottori, the principal city of Tottori Prefecture, which is the most sparsely-populated prefecture in Japan. He studied at Nihon University. He nearly gave up sumo and even moved to Australia for a brief period, but decided to return to Japan and try professional sumo after being inspired by the success of some of his friends from his amateur days.[1] As of 2019 he still wrestles under his real name and is yet to adopt a formal _shikona_ or ring-name. Ishiura is of unusually small stature for a sumo wrestler: when he made his _makuuchi_ debut he was officially lighter than any other competitor in the division. At he is still the lightest man in the top division as of July 2018.[2] (Although not the lightest _sekitori,_ as he is listed as 1 kg heavier than Terutsuyoshi of the _jūryō_ division.[3])

He has also been known for his contributions on social media, posting video clips on Twitter of his fellow wrestlers playing arcade games[4] and competing in sprint races.[5]

He is sponsored by McLaren Automotive, and on his 27th birthday he arrived at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in a sports car that they provided for him.[6]


Career

Ishiura joined the Miyagino stable and entered professional sumo in 2013 at the relatively advanced age of 23. He made an immediate impact, winning the _jonokuchi_ division in March and the _jonidan_ division in May with unblemished 7-0 records and earning a third straight promotion with six wins at _sandanme_ in July. As he worked his way up the ranks he served as a _tsukebito_ or personal attendant to _yokozuna_ Hakuhō. He spent the next nine tournaments in the third _makushita_ division before earning another promotion with a 6–1 record in January 2015. In the second division (_jūryō_) he proved himself a consistent performer, recording seven winning records (_kachi-koshi_) in ten tournaments and clinching yet another promotion with nine wins in September 2016.

Ishiura made his _makuuchi_ debut in November, 2016 debuting at East _Maegashira_ 15. After losing on the first day of the tournament to Chiyotairyu Ishiura won the next ten days straight putting him on the leader board for a while. However, on day 12 Ishiura suffered his second loss to Ikioi and then continued to lose for the rest of the tournament finishing off with a 10–5 record which was enough to win him his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. In his debut tournament he was able to get ten straight victories, double digit wins, and his first special prize. His ten wins equaled the performance of Shōdai in January 2016 and was otherwise the best by a top-division debutante since Ichinojo's thirteen wins in September 2014. In the January 2017 tournament Ishiura at _Maegashira_ 9 (his highest rank to date) was only able to secure a 6–9 record. The March 2017 tournament saw him at _maegashira_ 11, and he had mixed results. On the final day his record was 7–7, however he was unable to get the win against Takarafuji and end the tournament with a losing record of 7–8. He won only three bouts at _maegashira_ 10 in the September 2017 tournament and was demoted back to the _jūryō_ division, but an 8–7 record at the rank of West _Jūryō_ 1 in November was sufficient to return him to _makuuchi_. He was demoted to _jūryō_ again after the September 2018 tournament, but returned to the top division in March 2019.


Fighting style

Ishiura favours a right hand inside, left hand outside grip on his opponent's _mawashi_ or belt. His favourite _kimarite_ or winning technique is _shitatenage_, the underarm throw.


Personal life

Ishiura announced in May 2017 that he had married a nursery school teacher in April after a four year relationship. The wedding ceremony was held in October 2017 with his stablemate Hakuhō among the 500 guests.[7] Their first child was born in May 2018.[8]
