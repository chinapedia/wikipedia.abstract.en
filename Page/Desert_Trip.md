DESERT TRIP was a six-day music festival that took place on October 7–9 and 14–16, 2016, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, United States. The performers were the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Roger Waters, and The Who.[1][2] The festival was dubbed "Oldchella" by _Stereogum_ a few weeks before it was officially announced, referencing both the age of the performers and the fact that the concert was arranged by Goldenvoice, the company that also promotes the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[3]


History

Desert Trip was founded by Coachella co-founder, producer, and Goldenvoice chief, Paul Tollett.[4]

It was produced by Goldenvoice, the company that runs Coachella and is owned by AEG.[5] According to _The New York Times_ the average attendee spent $1,000 on the weekend event.[6]


Notable performances

Bob Dylan opened the weekend with his song "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35".[7]

The Rolling Stones covered The Beatles' "Come Together"

Paul McCartney opened his October 15 set with "A Hard Day's Night". In the same show, he surprised his audience with a performance of his song "FourFiveSeconds" with special guest Rihanna. He also invited Neil Young on the stage to perform "Why Don't We Do It In The Road?" for the first time ever and "A Day In The Life" with him. They then continued on to perform a cover of John Lennon's "Give Peace A Chance".

Bob Dylan's October 14 performance came the day after he was announced as the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature winner.

Roger Waters notably used his performance to make negative comments about 2016 Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump and cite his support of Palestine in its conflict with Israel.[8]
