Newman rose to national prominence in 2012, when he started playing varsity basketball for Downey Christian School while in fifth grade, and his highlight videos gained popularity on YouTube. He sparked polarized opinions in the media, with some outlets touting him as a child prodigy and others criticizing the way he was marketed.


Early life

At age three, Newman began showing interest in basketball and his father Jamie soon had him play with regulation-size balls and in recreational leagues with older boys. His father trained him rigorously from a young age, with Newman reportedly making 100 free throws, 200 floaters, and 200 jump shots each day at practice.[1]


High school career

In the fall of 2012, after initially attending public schools, Newman transferred to Downey Christian School, a small private school in Orlando, Florida, after his father began coaching basketball and teaching history at the school.[2][3] As a fifth grader, he began playing basketball for the middle school team. But after seeing immediate success, scoring as many as 91 points in a game, he was promoted to the varsity team.[4] His team competed outside the jurisdiction of the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA).[5][6] An 11-year-old point guard, Newman stood and weighed 70 pounds.[7] Despite wearing the smallest available uniform, he had to tighten the shoulders of his jersey with a hair tie and roll the waistband of his shorts to prevent them from falling off.[8] Through his first three starts, he averaged 12.4 points, 11 assists, and 4.3 steals per game.[9] He led Downey Christian to a 21–6 record while leading the state of Florida in assists.[10]

In sixth grade, Newman averaged 17 points per game. On December 19, 2012, Newman featured in an article on high school sports website MaxPreps, titled, "Fifth grader starting for Florida varsity team." A highlight video of Newman posted to YouTube by recruiting website ScoutsFocus went viral, receiving over 3.5 million views.[11] He soon began making national headlines, including in _Sports Illustrated_ and _The New York Times_, for being a fifth grader playing varsity basketball.[12][13][14] Newman made television appearances on _Steve Harvey_, _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_, _Good Morning America_, and other programs.[15][16] He was also invited to perform at half-time during an Orlando Magic NBA game.[17]

In December 2013, Newman was tabbed "The Best Sixth Grade Basketball Player You've Ever Seen" by _The Huffington Post_. By that time, he was averaging 13.6 points and 10.5 assists per game.[18] In 2014, he was labeled by the _Tampa Bay Times_ as "the most marketed 12-year-old basketball player in the world".[19] The efforts to market Newman's career were criticized by some media outlets, who compared him to a child star.[20][21][22] As a seventh grader in 2015, Newman became the youngest player to record 1,000 career varsity points.[23] He finished the 2014–15 season averaging 19.8 points, 10.2 assists, and 3.2 steals per game.[24] On October 4, 2016, Newman scored 52 points in a highly publicized match-up with top 2020 class recruit Kyree Walker at the MiddleSchoolHoopsTV camp.[25] His highlight video from the game received over 10 million videos on YouTube.[26] By 2018, when he was a sophomore in high school, Newman had recorded 3,873 total points, surpassing the Florida prep record set by Teddy Dupay in 1998.[27]
