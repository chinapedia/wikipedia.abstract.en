ROMANIA participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 after having been forced to take a one-year break in 2016 when they got disqualified.[1][2] The country was represented with the song "Yodel It!" written by Mihai Alexandru and Alexandra Niculae. The song is performed by Ilinca and Alex Florea. The nation's broadcaster, Televiziunea Română (TVR), organised the _Selecția Națională 2017_, a preselection show, in order to select the Romanian entry for the 2017 contest held in Kiev, Ukraine. "Yodel It!" performed by Ilinca and Alex Florea emerged as the winner after gaining the most votes from the televoting.


Background

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Romania had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest seventeen times since its first entry in 1994.[3] Its highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been third place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 2005 with the song "Let Me Try" performed by Luminița Anghel and Sistem and in 2010 with the song "Playing with Fire" performed by Paula Seling and Ovi. To this point, Romania has qualified to the final on every occasion that they participated since the introduction of semi-finals to the format of the contest in 2004. In 2015, "De la capăt" by band Voltaj placed 15th in the final.[4] In 2016, their entry, "Moment of Silence" by Ovidiu Anton, was forcibly withdrawn from competition shortly before the contest due to repeated non-payment of debts by Televiziunea Română (TVR) to the EBU, though it remained on the official album.


Before Eurovision

_Selecția Națională 2017_

Selecția Națională 2017 was the national selection organised by TVR in order to select Romania's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. The competition consisted of two shows: a semi-final featuring fifteen songs and a final featuring ten songs to be held on 26 February 2017 and 5 March 2017, respectively.

Competing entries

TVR opened a submission period for artists and composers to submit their entries between 20 December 2016 and 22 January 2017. A total of 84 entries were received, all of which would get to participate in the televised audition stage. These auditions were held on the 27th, 28th and 29 January and broadcast on a number of Romanian TV channels between February 5 and 11. From these songs, 15 songs qualified to the semi-final held on February 26, where a jury determined which 10 songs would qualify for the final held on March the 5th. The winner was then determined by 100% televoting.[5] On 26 January 2017, TVR announced that out of the 84 entries that had been submitted, only 72 would participate in the first stage of the national selection.[6] Later, the entry "I Know" was withdrawn from the competition by its singer Lora. The 15 competing entries were revealed on 12 February 2017.[7]

Promotion

Ilinca and Alex Florea made several appearances across Europe to specifically promote "Yodel It!" as the Romanian Eurovision entry. On 2 April, they performed during the _London Eurovision Party_, which was held at the Café de Paris venue in London, United Kingdom and hosted by Nicki French. Between 3 and 6 April, they took part in promotional activities in Tel Aviv, Israel where he performed during the _Israel Calling_ event held at the Ha'teatron venue.[15][16] On 8 April, they performed during the _Eurovision in Concert_ event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Björnsdóttir.[17] On 15 April, they performed during the _Eurovision Spain Pre-Party_, which was held at the Sala La Riviera venue in Madrid, Spain.[18]


At Eurovision

According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[19] On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Romania was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 11 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.[20]

Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Originally, Romania was set to perform in position 6, following the entry from Malta and before the entry from the Netherlands.[21] However, following Russia's withdrawal from the contest on 13 April and subsequent removal from the running order of the second semi-final, Romania's performing position shifted to 5.[22]

Semi-final

The singers' concept for their stage show was revealed during their first rehearsal.[23] It commences with a number of large toy soldiers drumming in the background, whereon further colorful imagery is displayed during the rest of the performance, including "colourful butterflies, blue clouds, white roses, blue musical notes and images flying all over the place" along with the letters YODEL IT in different tones; the singers are performing in a yellow circle. At the end of the performance, Florea appears on a glittery cannon originally planned to shoot out colorful objects—which according to the singer would have represented an "explosion of love and happiness"[24]—following which a second cannon is introduced and is also displayed in the background.[25] Florea's brother provided backing vocals.
