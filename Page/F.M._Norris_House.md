The F.M. NORRIS HOUSE, also known as the PATTON HOUSE and the GERARD PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, was a historic building located in Mason City, Iowa, United States. Fred Magee Norris (1864-1938) served two terms as the mayor of the city. He was married to Elizabeth (Atkinson) Norris (1866-1933). They had Chris Rye build this Prairie School house for them. While Rye built some of Walter Burley Griffin's designs,[1] it is possible that he designed this house himself.[2] It featured a horizontal emphasis, wide eaves, broad hip roof, and stucco walls. The building was altered by Jerome J. Gerard (1913-2010) for his photography studio. In addition to his photographic work, he wrote for the magazine _Popular Photography_ for 20 years.[3] The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[4] It has subsequently been torn down.
