Career

Rodríguez's first taste of senior football came in October 2010 as he was selected on the bench by Defensa y Justicia for a match against Tiro Federal in Primera B Nacional, he didn't make an appearance for the club until after his loan move to Primera C Metropolitana side Berazategui.[3] He scored three goals in twenty-five games for Berazategui before making his Defensa y Justicia debut on 13 October 2012 in a defeat to Instituto.[4] He went onto make twenty-four league appearances in 2012–13 for Defensa y Justicia before leaving the club and Argentine football to join Ascenso MX side Dorados de Sinaloa in 2013.[5]

Two goals in sixteen appearances followed, during which time Rodríguez spent time with Dorados' senior affiliate Liga MX team Tijuana on loan.[6][7] He made just one appearance for Tijuana in a 6–0 home win over Honduran side Victoria in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League.[8][9] In 2014, he completed a loan move to Argentine Primera División side Godoy Cruz.[10][11] Sixteen games and three goals followed for him at Godoy. After his time in Mendoza, Rodríguez rejoined Defensa y Justicia on loan and subsequently scored six times in thirty-two matches in two seasons in Argentina's top tier for the Florencio Varela team.[12]

2016 saw Rodríguez make temporary moves to Unión Santa Fe and Arsenal de Sarandí.[13][14][15] A year later, in August 2017, Rodríguez joined Primera B Nacional side Almagro.[16][17] However, he soon returned to Dorados after contractual disagreements.[18][19][20] In January 2018, Rodríguez signed for Paraguayan Primera División team Deportivo Capiatá.[21][22] He scored on his debut for the club, netting the opening goal in a win over Deportivo Santaní on 25 February.[23] He departed the end of the 2018 season, scoring four times across twenty-five fixtures.[24] In January 2019, Rodríguez went to Azerbaijan to sign with top-flight Zira.[25]
