The ALBERT COTTER BRIDGE, also known as the _Tibby Cotter bridge_, is a pedestrian bridge across Anzac Parade, Sydney. It was built to primarily to cater for crowds exiting the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium.


History

Construction on the Albert Cotter Bridge commenced in 2014. It was opened in time for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. It was named after Albert "Tibby" Cotter, an Australian Test cricket player killed in World War I. It is a shared pedestrian and cycle pathway. The bridge features concrete helical approach ramps and a superstructure formed using two curved steel box beams.[1][2]

The bridge's construction was criticised by the Auditor-General of New South Wales finding that the tight construction timeline significantly added 25Â million to its cost.[3][4][5] Additional criticism was raised by the Heritage Council of New South Wales due to the relocation of a monument on Anzac Parade and cycling lobby groups as the walkway does not connect with existing cycleways.[6]
