History

In 2015, BetBright expanded on their sports betting by incorporating a range of virtual games from Betradar.

On 30 January 2016, prominent racehorse owner and businessman Rich Ricci was unveiled as the new Executive Chairman of the company.[5]

In November 2016, BetBright's focus on internal product development resulted in them winning the "Best In-House Product" award at the 2016 EGR operator awards,[6] this was followed up soon after by winning the "Best Football Betting Product" award at the annual SBC industry awards a month later.[7]

In February 2018, BetBright announced growth plans[9][10] as it aims to be a “disrupter” in the gambling sector,[11][12] with ambitions to add almost 130,000 new customers in 2018[13] and forecast doubling in revenues from €14m in 2017 to €29m in 2018.[14]

In June 2018, BetBright was recognised for its creativity and innovation in online gambling following the development of their ‘recommendations engine’ – a first for the gambling sector. - winning the "Innovation in sports betting" award at the 2018 EGR Marketing & Innovation Awards 2018.[15]
