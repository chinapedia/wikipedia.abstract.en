[1] Chronicles are inconsistent with their own reporting. (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 54) says King Thihathu of Ava replaced Gov. Minye Kyawswa II of Prome with Min Maha in late 783 ME ( March 1422). But later the Summary of the Rulers of Prome section (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 215) says Min Maha was appointed in 787 ME. It is another case of Burmese numerals ၃ (3) and ၇ (7) being mis-copied.
