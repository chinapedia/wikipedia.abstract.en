_THE COMB OF THE WIND_ (, ) is a collection of three sculptures by Eduardo Chillida arranged as an architectural work by the Basque architect Luis Peña Ganchegui. For both, this is one of their most important and well known works.[1]

_The Comb of the Wind_ is located at the western end of La Concha Bay, at the end of Ondarreta beach, in the municipality of San Sebastián, in the province of Guipúzcoa, in the Basque Country of Spain. It is made up of three of Chillida’s monumental steel sculptures, weighing 10 tons each, embedded in natural rocks rising from the Cantabrian Sea.

The work was completed in 1976. In addition to the sculptures, a viewing area was created on the nearby coast that includes wave-driven outlets for air and water. Peine_vientos_2.jpg
