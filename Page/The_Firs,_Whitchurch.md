History

The house was built in 1897 for Charles Gray, an officer who fought with the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa.[1] By the 1930s the house was owned by Major Arthur Abrahams from whom it was requisitioned by the War Office in 1939.[2] During the Second World War the house was used by MD1 for the development and testing of various weapons[3] including time delay fuses, depth charges and PIAT guns.[4] The house, which was known locally as "Winston Churchill's Toyshop", accommodated some 250 people at this time.[5] Meanwhile Abrahams was knighted for his services to the British Red Cross in June 1942.[6]

In around 1953 the house became the Central Research Laboratories for Richard Thomas and Baldwins, iron and steel producers.[7] This use continued until 1967 when Richard Thomas and Baldwins was nationalised as part of British Steel.[8] The house has since been converted into offices[9] and is now owned by Christopher Mann, Chairman of Plenham Publishing.[10]
