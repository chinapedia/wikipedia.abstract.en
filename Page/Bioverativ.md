BIOVERATIV INC. is an American multinational biotechnology that specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of haemophilia.[1] Bioverativ competes with Baxalta (acquired by Shire Plc in 2016[2]), Pfizer and Novo Nordisk.[3] The company traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV until Sanofi completed its acquisition on March 8, 2018.


History

In May 2016 Biogen announced that it would spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a separate public company.[4] In August, Biogen announced they would call the spun off company _Bioverativ_ to show heritage with Biogen,[5] and would be spun off in early 2017.[6] On December 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bioverativ's registration statement, with the official separation date of the two companies being pegged at February 2017.[7] In February, Biogen investors received a special dividend of one share of Bioverativ stock for every two shares of Biogen stock held as of January 17.[8] Bioverativ began trading on January 12, 2017.[9]

In May 2017, the company announced it would acquire True North Therapeutics for $825 million, strengthening Bioverativ's pipeline with the acquisition of TNT009 â€“ a treatment for cold agglutinin disease.[10]

In January 2018, Sanofi announced that it would acquire the business, for $11.6 billion.[11][12]
