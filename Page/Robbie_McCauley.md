ROBBIE MCCAULEY is an African-American playwright, director, and performer. She is best known for her plays _Sugar_ and _Sally's Rape_.


Personal life

Robbie McCauley was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1942. She spent most of her younger years splitting time between Washington, D.C. and Columbus, Georgia. She earned her B.A. from Howard University and her M.A. from New York University. It was in New York where she became interested in both experimental and African-American theatre. In 1979 she was introduced to Ed Montgomery, a musician. Together, they formed a group called Sedition Ensemble, a group focusing on political jazz works which married melody with improvised words. The duo were briefly married but split. They still maintain a professional relationship in which Montgomery occasionally writes music for McCauley's plays. She continues to work, perform, and teach.


Career

McCauley is not only a playwright, but also an actor, writer, and director. Her involvement in theater began during the late 1960s, when she worked as an apprentice at the Negro Ensemble Company in New York City. Since the 1970s she has been a working playwright, director, and actor in many New York-based projects, both on and off Broadway, in the US and abroad. Her first, and most successful work, _Sally's Rape_, won an OBIE Award in 1991 for best new American play and a Award in 1990. Her other major works include _Sugar_, _Mississippi Freedom_, _Quabbin Dance_, and _Indian Blood_. As an actress, she is known for her performance in Ntozake Shange's _for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf_ on Broadway.

McCauley's work deals with themes of race and racism in the USA. She is eager to confront the hard issues of racism, and her work often facilitates dialogues on race between races in the community.

Outside of the theater, she has taught at City College of New York, Hunter College, Mount Holyoke College, University of Massachusetts, and Emerson College.

Notable works

_Sugar_

_Sugar_ is an auto-biographical piece about McCauley's life as a diabetic. The story is heartfelt, personal and vivid in detail as McCauley tells and shows the audience some of the difficulties and complexities of living with diabetes as a black woman working in the theater and elsewhere. She makes a powerful parallel between sugar and slavery: both have chained her. The premiere performance of the piece was put on by ArtsEmerson, an organization at Emerson College, directed by Maureen Shea.

_Sally's Rape_

_Sally's Rape_ is a performance art piece in which McCauley stands on a bench. A white woman enters and tells the audience that the bench is an auction box. The white woman encourages the audience to bid on McCauley´s body. The piece deals with Afro-American women who were object of white abuse, as well as with neo-colonialism and commodity fetishism, as it demonstrate an audience who participates by its complicity in the event.

_Indian Blood_

_Indian Blood_, like _Sally's Rape_, weaves McCauley's family history into the piece. The first performance was in 1987. The play is inspired by McCauley's grandfather. He was a part of the 10th Cavalry Regiment (United States) in the Spanish–American War. They were known as the buffalo soldiers, as they also fought Native Americans.

_Mississippi Freedom_

_Mississippi Freedom_ is the first in a trilogy of theater works that McCauley created in the 1990s that highlight race relations in the US during the '60s and '70s. In collaboration with Arts Company as well as local artists, the pieces are mixed media, incorporating elements of music, audience participation, and more. _Mississippi Freedom_ is centered on the fight for the right to vote. It toured around the state of Mississippi in 1992, and was presented in New York in 1993, and Texas in 1996.

_Turf: A Conversational Concert in Black and White_

Mississippi Freedom is followed by _Turf: A Conversational Concert in Black and White_, which is centered around the Boston school busing controversy. It was performed in four different neighborhood locations around Boston in 1993.

_The Other Weapon_

The last piece in the trilogy is titled _The Other Weapon_, and tells the stories of the Black Panther Party, community empowerment, and law enforcement in Los Angeles. It was shown at four locations in LA in 1994.

_Quabbin Dance_

_Quabbin Dance_ is based upon actual events that took place in Western Massachusetts in the late 1930s when four towns were flooded in order to provide a reservoir, the Quabbin, to provide Boston's water supply. It was performed at Mount Holyoke College.


Critical reception

Robbie McCauley's work has been well received by most critics. _Sally's Rape_ and _Sugar_ especially have receive high reviews from _African American Review_, _Stage Review_, and _Bomb_. Don Aucoin of the _Stage Review_ describes McCauley as "a skilled performer and raconteur who knows the subtle difference between speaking with—rather than to or at—her audience."[1]
