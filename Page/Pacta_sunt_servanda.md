_PACTA SUNT SERVANDA_ (Latin for "agreements must be kept"[1]), a brocard, is a basic principle of civil law, canon law, and international law.

In its most common sense, the principle refers to private contracts, stressing that contained clauses are law between the parties, and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact. The maxim first appears in the writings of the canonist Cardinal Hostiensis, written in the 13th century but published in the 16th.[2]


Civil law

In civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice – including the assumption of _good faith_ – is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties. However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that _pacta sunt servanda_ includes the principle of good faith.


International law

With reference to international agreements, "every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith."[3] This entitles states to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty cannot invoke provisions of its municipal (domestic) law as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that _pacta sunt servanda_ includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.

The only limit to _pacta sunt servanda_ are the peremptory norms of general international law, called _jus cogens_ (compelling law). The legal principle _clausula rebus sic stantibus_, part of customary international law, also allows for treaty obligations to be unfulfilled due to a compelling change in circumstances.
