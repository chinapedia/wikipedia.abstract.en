Controversy

General Rock was involved in the Leland B.H. Bohannon controversy. In October 2017 this controversy garnered national attention after bronze star recipient Col Bohannon was stripped of command by General Rock after Col Bohannon did not send a certificate of appreciation to the same-sex spouse of a subordinate upon that subordinates retirement.[2] In November 2017 six United States senators sent a letter to the Air Force secretary in support of Bohannon and 94 United States Senators did not.
