POWDER MILL SPRING is a spring in eastern Oregon County in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.[1] The spring lies on the west bank of the Eleven Point River approximately four miles north of the U.S. Route 160 crossing at Riverton.[2]

A variant name was "Powder Mill Bottom".[3] Powder Mill Spring was so named on account of a powder mill the valley once contained.[4]
