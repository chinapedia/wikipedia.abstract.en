The BARASAT KILLINGS OF 1970 refer to the murder of 11 young men on the night of November 19, 1970 in Barasat, a suburb of Kolkata in West Bengal, India.


Incident

The men had been rounded up from a secret meeting at the Maidan in Kolkata by the West Bengal police force. Autopsy reports later showed that the bullets were fired from service revolvers, directly implicating the police in the murders. The Barasat killings were part of a ferocious government crackdown on suspected Naxalite rebels, taking place in the context of widespread political violence that plagued West Bengal province at the time under Presidents Rule. The incident was swiftly followed by the murder of another four or five activists in Beliaghat, Kolkata. Most reports later blamed a secret 'death squad operated by the Police Special Branch, implicating a DCP Bibhuti Bhusan Chakraborty, ACP James Henderson, ACP Runu Guha Niyogi, Inspector (Mounted) Richard Munro, Inspector Somendranath Bose, Sergeant William Hodgson, Sergeant Dipak Banerjee, SI Tarun Dutta, Ar. ASI Amalendu Ghosh, Naib Risaldar Shambhu Singh Shahi, Ar. ASI Rameshwar Pandey, Head Constable Bindeyeshwari Singh, Head Constable Bipin Roy Burman, Head Constable Banke Ram Dubey, Head Constable Amiya Ghosh, Constable Bishambher Nath Tiwari, Constable Enamul Haq Molla, Constable Subrata Konar, Constable Ram Babu Singh, Constable Shew Persad Pandey, Constable Soumitra Ghosh, Constable Binoy Murmu, Constable Tarapada Gorai, Constable Nazrul Islam, Constable Sukumar Biswas, Constable Subhash Mukherjee, and Constable Mofijur Rahman as part of a Special Branch encounter cell. There were also reports of an Inspector of the Central Intelligence Bureau and a Deputy Commandant of the CRPF being involved with the encounter cell[1][2][3]
