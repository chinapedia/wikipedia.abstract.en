is a Japanese film and literary critic, as well as a professor at Rikkyo University.[1]

After graduation from the University of Tokyo, he worked for the Asahi Newspaper company before leaving in 1972 to become a critic.[2] He was one critic who helped to discover the talents of Haruki Murakami.[3] He won the Suntory Prize for his book _Taishū Genei_ in 1991, the Yomiuri Literature Award for _Kafū and Tokyo_ in 1997, and the Itō Sei Literature Award for _Hakushu Bōkei_ in 2012.[4]

Around 1970 he became close to a student radical when covering him as a journalist. When that student attacked an officer of the Japanese Self-Defence Force in Asaka, Saitama, killing him, Kawamoto was arrested for spoliation of evidence. He was convicted and given a sentence of probation. He was fired from the Asahi Newspaper company. Thereafter, he became a freelance writer.[5] Nobuhiro Yamashita's film, _My Back Page_, is based on Kawamoto's essay about this affair.[6]
