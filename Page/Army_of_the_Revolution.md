The ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION (; _Jaysh al-Thawra_) is a Syrian rebel alliance affiliated with the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army. It is composed of 5 FSA factions which mainly operated in the Daraa Governorate in southwestern Syria. One of its commanders stated that the group is a "temporary operations room" due to the separation between western and eastern Daraa, and that the "door is open" for other groups to join the alliance.[15]
