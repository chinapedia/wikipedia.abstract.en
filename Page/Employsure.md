History

Employsure was founded in 2010 by English-born barrister Edward Mallett following the change in Australian employment legislation due to the introduction of the Fair Work Act 2009.[14] It is now the largest in its sector with over 20,000 clients in Australia and 800 employees[15][16] being one of the fastest growing companies in the country, and the largest Australian based HR organisation.[17][18]

In April 2012, Peninsula Business Services Limited invested £1.7 million (AUD $2.94 million) in the company, acquiring a majority stake.[19][20]

In April 2015, the company moved to their current offices at 180 Thomas Street in Haymarket, Sydney.[21]

In April 2019, Employsure launched Employsure Protect, a discretionary mutual product available exclusively to its clients, as a replacement to its traditional insurance service.[22][23]


Current operations

In 2016, the company expanded its operations in Australia and in New Zealand by opening offices in Perth, Western Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Employsure employs over 800 staff and has more than 20,000 clients across Australia and New Zealand as of 2018,[24] and is also credited as the largest employer in its sector.[25][26]


Employsure Law

The company provides legal representation through its Employsure Law brand which is a full-service employment law firm that provides employers with end-to-end support in a variety of employment law matters, including workplace disputes, complaints and unfair dismissal claims.[27][28] Previously the service was delivered by the Employsure Claims Team and through a partnership arrangement with Sparke Helmore. The company also provides EmploysurePLUS, which arranges additional services such as training for employees and managers, onsite meeting support, grievance investigations and summary reports, and other compliance reviews.[29]


Pro Bono Program

Employsure's pro bono program focuses on providing free long-term support for non-profit organisations and charities in managing their staff and creation of safe workplaces.[30] Through this program, Employsure contributes hours of their time to provide free legal services, specialised advice and assistance to such organizations. The company's recent pro bono work includes the Sydney Dogs and Cats Home in 2017-2018.[31]


Workplace research and advocacy

In 2015, the company’s survey of 461 small businesses found that over one third of Australian employers believe that offering staff flexible work arrangements was a key staff retention tactic.[32]

In August 2017, Employsure with the help of Galaxy Research conducted _Workplace Safety Index_ surveying 400 Australian small businesses owners and managers to track Australian small business’ understanding and confidence in planning, managing and implementing their workplace health and safety obligations.[33][34]

In August 2018, the Employsure _State of Work Report_ was conducted by Roy Morgan Research on behalf of Employsure surveying more than 600 employees.[35][36] It found that only one in three employers were confident that they were compliant with the Fair Work Act, and 86% of small businesses didn’t understand their obligations.[37] Data also showed that less than 60% of business owners knew their responsibilities should an employee get injured[38] and 81% did not understand their workplace safety obligations.[39]

Employsure has been vocal in its concern about Australia’s rising minimum wage at the expense of small business growth.[40] The company was also critical of a Federal Court ruling that increased pay for first-year apprentices in Queensland despite discrepancies in the Modern Award and State Award.[41] In April 2018 Employsure commented on Australia’s marriage leave debate, pointing out its potential benefits to employees and employers.[42]

During the 2019 Australian Federal Election Employsure was critical of plans from the Australian Labor Party to introduce a tribunal to adjudicate on alleged cases of wage theft, claiming that regulation and compliance burdens were a contributing factor to employers paying their staff incorrectly.[43] Employsure supported an announcement from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to review the Australian workplace relations system.[44]


Awards

In October 2015, Employsure was awarded Australia's fastest growing company at the Deloitte Growth Company of the Year awards.[45][46] Following the "Business Services Growth Company of the Year” award in 2016[47] and 2017.[48]

In August 2016 It was named the 21st best place to work in Australia among companies with 100 or more employees by Great Place to Work and ranked thirteenth in BRW’s 50 most innovative companies list.[49][50]

In September 2017, Employsure was nominated for three awards in the Australian HR Awards: Best Reward & Recognition Program, Employer of Choice (101 - 999 employees) and Australian HR Team of the Year (under 1000 employees).[51] The company won the 2017 award for Best Reward and Recognition Program for 2017.[52]

In February 2018, Employsure was named 8th on the Financial Times FT 1000: High-Growth Companies Asia-Pacific list.[53]In July 2018, the company was named 2018 Aon Best Employers in Australia and New Zealand at the Aon (company) best employer annual award, for its high employee engagement scores and outstanding people practices.[54][55] In September 2018, Employsure was named HR team of the Year at the 2018 Australian HR Awards.[56]

In April 2019 Employsure became a bronze winner in the HRD Employer of Choice Awards, and recognised as a top-performing company for Diversity and Inclusion, and Recruitment and Onboarding.[57]


Criticisms

Complaints to the Fair Work Ombudsman

On July 2017, the Fair Work Ombudsman released a statement regarding complaints from members of the public claiming to be misled by the web address "www.fairworkhelp.com.au" owned an operated by Employsure Pty Ltd. The Fair Work Ombudsman stated that it is not affiliated with any commercial providers of advisory or workplace relations and that it provides tools, advice and services to employers, employees and members of the public free of charge.[58][59]

NSW Supreme court ruling on Employsures inability to enforce contracts

In June 2018 the NSW Supreme Court ruled that IR provider Employsure cannot enforce a contract that locked an employer into a five-year deal for its services[60][61][62]. Employsure sued its customer, Italian food importer and supplier Zintix, after it attempted to quit the contract after eight months, owing $18,463.00.

Fair Work Commission and Unfair Dismissal

On 11 December 2015 the Fair Work Commissioner Michelle Bissett issued an unfair dismissal decision in which the commission determined Ms S (name withheld) had been unfairly dismissed from her employment at Employsure.[63][64] The FWC at Employsure's request did agree to prohibit the publication of the decision with respect to compensation awarded Ms S. However, Employsure's attempt to keep other aspects of agreed remuneration including commission structures, sales targets, cancellation rates etc. was not granted. The FWC stated that "The Commissions role is not to shield any business from competition."

ACCC start proceedings against Employsure for misleading advertising and unconscionable conduct

On 21 December 2018 Civil proceedings were instituted against Employsure Pty Ltd for allegedly misleading small business consumers that it was, or was affiliated with, a government agency when that was not the case.[65] It is also alleged that Employsure represented to consumers that it provided a helpline for free workplace relations advice, when the primary function of that helpline was to secure marketing leads to sell its services.

The ACCC alleges that Employsure engaged in the misleading conduct, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, through its use of Google Ads campaigns and on its websites between January 2016 and November 2018. Employsure's websites also prominently advertised call centre phone numbers for a ‘Helpline’ that provides free advice.

“The ACCC alleges that Employsure targeted small businesses who were seeking the free workplace relations helpline operated by the Government. Its primary objective was to sign these businesses up to long-term contracts with on-going fees,” ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said.

“In some cases, the advice sought by these businesses was available free of charge from the Fair Work Ombudsman.”

“Business must not claim they provide free, government affiliated services in order to lure customers into buying their services,” Ms Court said.

The ACCC also alleges that Employsure engaged in unconscionable conduct towards four small businesses between August 2015 and June 2018.
