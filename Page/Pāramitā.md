_PĀRAMITĀ_ (Sanskrit, Pali) or _PĀRAMĪ_ (Pāli) is "perfection" or "completeness". While, technically, _pāramī_ and _pāramitā_ are both Pāli terms, Pali literature makes far greater reference to _pāramī_.

Theravāda Buddhism

Theravada teachings on the _pāramīs_ can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries.

Canonical sources

In the Pāli Canon, the _Buddhavaṃsa_ of the _Khuddaka Nikāya_ lists the ten perfections (_dasa pāramiyo_) as:

1.  _Dāna pāramī_ : generosity, giving of oneself
2.  _Sīla pāramī_ : virtue, morality, proper conduct
3.  _Nekkhamma pāramī_ : renunciation
4.  _Paññā pāramī_ : transcendental wisdom, insight, discernment
5.  _Viriya pāramī_ : energy, diligence, vigour, effort
6.  _Khanti pāramī_ : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
7.  _Sacca pāramī_ : truthfulness, honesty
8.  _Adhiṭṭhāna pāramī_ : determination, resolution
9.  _Mettā pāramī_ : goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
10. _Upekkhā pāramī_ : equanimity, serenity

Two of the above virtues, mettā and _upekkhā_, also are brahmavihāras.

Historicity

The Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (_Jataka tales_, _Apadāna_, _Buddhavaṃsa_, _Cariyāpiṭaka_) and post-canonical commentaries written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings.[1][2] The oldest parts of the _Sutta Piṭaka_ (for example, _Majjhima Nikāya_, _Digha Nikāya_, _Saṃyutta Nikāya_ and the _Aṅguttara Nikāya_) do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).[3]

Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion.[4][5] However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest.[6] Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Mahāyāna Buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the śramaṇa.

Traditional practice

Bodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four _nikāyas_), those seeking the extinction of suffering (_nibbana_) pursued the noble eightfold path. As time went on, a backstory was provided for the multi-life development of the Buddha; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva (Pāli: _bodhisatta_). Over subsequent centuries, the _pāramīs_ were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship. Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:

    It should be noted that in established Theravāda tradition the pāramīs are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance, whether as Buddhas, paccekabuddhas, or disciples. What distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the pāramīs must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursued. But the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance, which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating path.[7]


Mahāyāna Buddhism

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Prajñapāramitā sūtras, the _Lotus Sutra_ and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:

1.  _Dāna pāramitā_: generosity, giving of oneself (in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, 布施波羅蜜; in Tibetan, སྦྱིན་པ _sbyin-pa_)
2.  _Śīla pāramitā_: virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (持戒波羅蜜; ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས _tshul-khrims_)
3.  _{{IAST pāramitā_: patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (忍辱波羅蜜; བཟོད་པ _bzod-pa_)
4.  _Vīrya pāramitā_: energy, diligence, vigor, effort (精進波羅蜜; བརྩོན་འགྲུས _brtson-’grus_)
5.  _Dhyāna pāramitā_: one-pointed concentration, contemplation (禪定波羅蜜, བསམ་གཏན _bsam-gtan_)
6.  _Prajñā pāramitā_: wisdom, insight (般若波羅蜜; ཤེས་རབ _shes-rab_)

Note that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator Dhammapala, who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.[8]

In the _Ten Stages Sutra_, four more pāramitās are listed:

    7. _Upāya pāramitā_: skillful means (方便波羅蜜）
    8. _Praṇidhāna pāramitā_: vow, resolution, aspiration, determination (願波羅蜜）
    9. _Bala pāramitā_: spiritual power (力波羅蜜）
    10. _Jñāna pāramitā_: knowledge (智波羅蜜）


Tibetan Buddhism

According to the perspective of Tibetan Buddhism, Mahāyāna practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: _pāramitāyāna_) or the path of tantra (Sanskrit: _tantrayāna_), which is the Vajrayāna.

Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche renders "pāramitā" into English as "transcendent action" and then frames and qualifies it:

The pure illusory body is said to be endowed with the six perfections (Sanskrit: _ṣatpāramitā_).[9][10]

The first four perfections are skillful means practice while the last two are wisdom practice. These contain all the methods and skills required for eliminating delusion and fulfilling other's needs. Also, leading from happy to happier states.[11]
