CAPE UKURUNRU (Russian: _Mys Ukurunru_) is a cape in the western Sea of Okhotsk. It has sheer cliffs that are grayish-brown in color. It forms the western point to the entrance of Ulban Bay.[1]


History

American whaleships cruised for bowhead whales off the cape between 1855 and 1885.[2] They called it MERCURY or WASHINGTON HEAD, the former name after the ship _Mercury_ (340 tons), of New Bedford, which visited the area during her voyage of 1852-1855, and the latter name after the ship _Washington_ (340 tons), of Sag Harbor, which was stove by ice and run ashore near the cape in 1855.[3][4]
