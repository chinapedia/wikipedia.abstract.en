_HYDNELLUM DIANTHIFOLIUM_ is a species of tooth fungus found in the Mediterranean basin. Described as new to science in 2016, this rare species appears to form ectomycorrhizal associations with _Pinus brutia_ and often grows entirely concealed under its thick litter.[1]

The tiny fruitbodies, measuring 1.5–3.5 cm tall by 0.5–2.5 (–3.5) cm across, produce a deeply funnel-shaped cap, often undulating or splitting radially to acquire a flower- or coral-like shape. It is so far only known from Apulia in southern Italy and the island of Cyprus.[2]
