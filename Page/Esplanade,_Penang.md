The ESPLANADE is a waterfront location in the heart of George Town, Penang, Malaysia. It covers the field adjacent to Fort Cornwallis, known locally as the _Padang_, and the seaside promenade along the edge of the field.

The Esplanade was the site of a significant event in Penang's history; it was here where Captain Francis Light, the founder of George Town, first landed on 17 July 1786. Upon claiming possession of Penang Island (then _PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND_), for the British Empire, the Esplanade became the first area to be cleared by Light, while Fort Cornwallis was constructed immediately east of the clearing.

The cleared field was then used as a military parade ground, prior to its recreational and sports use beginning in the mid-19th century. The planned layout of the _Padang_ is similar to that of the Padang in Singapore and Merdeka Square in Kuala Lumpur.

In addition, every first Saturday of the month, the 'Esplanade in Action' cultural performances are held at the Esplanade, featuring the various cultures of Penang.[5][6] A night market also opens at the Esplanade every Friday, Saturday and Sunday between 5pm and midnight.[7] Another landmark within the Esplanade is the Cenotaph, which was originally built in honour of Allied personnel who lost their lives during World War I. The Remembrance Day commemorations are held annually at the Cenotaph to honour not just the Allied personnel of World War I, but also those who were killed during World War II, the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian Confrontation.[8][9]


History

GEORGETOWN_PENANG_ISLAND_MALAYSIA_JAN_2012_(6815563818).jpg, built to commemorate the Allied personnel who lost their lives during World War I.]] The Esplanade is the site on Penang Island where Captain Francis Light, a trader for the British East India Company, first landed on 17 July 1786. Having obtained the island for the British Empire, Light then ordered his ships to fire silver coins into the then forested area to entice immigrants to clear as much land as possible. Fort Cornwallis was also constructed next to the cleared field.

The field, now known as the _Padang_, was the place where _sepoys_ from India, who were deployed to Penang by the British East India Company, disembarked from their transport vessels.[10]

The _Padang_ has been used for recreational purposes since the mid-19th century. A bandstand, donated by Cheah Tek Soon, a local businessman, was erected at the Esplanade, providing a stage for music bands to entertain the public. The _Padang_ was also utilised as a cricket ground; a two-storey pavilion, designed by Wilson & Neubronner, was built in 1908 by the then Penang Cricket Club. Its rival, the Penang Recreational Club, had also erected a similar structure at the Esplanade for its supporters.[11]

However, these structures were destroyed during World War II, when Allied bombers targeted the Esplanade, which was at the time used by the Imperial Japanese Army.[12][13] The Cenotaph, which had been constructed to honour the Allied personnel of World War I, was also reduced to ruins. After the war, the Cenotaph was rebuilt and reopened in 1948.
