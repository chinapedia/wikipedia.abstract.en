KATHRYN (KITTY) KISH SKLAR (born December 1939) is an American historian, author, and professor. Her work focuses on the history of women's participation in social movements, voluntary organizations, and American public culture.


Life and career

Sklar was born on December 26, 1939 in Columbus, Ohio.[1][2] She received a Bachelor of Arts (1965) degree from Harvard College and Radcliffe College, graduating Magna Cum Laude in history and literature. She received a Master of Arts (1967) and Ph.D. (1969) from University of Michigan in U.S. and comparative history.[3]

After completing her Ph.D, Sklar worked as a lecturer and assistant professor at University of Michigan (1969-1974) before becoming an Associate Professor (1974-1981) and Professor (1981-1988) of History at the University of California Los Angeles.[4] She served as Distinguished Professor of History at the Binghamton University from 1988-2012 and became a Distinguished Professor Emerita at Binghamton University in 2012.[5][6]

At UCLA, Sklar created the "Workshop on Teaching U.S. Women's History."

In 1997, Sklar received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to begin the Women in Social Movements in the United States 1600-2000 project as a senior seminar at Binghamton University.[7] The project rapidly expanded to become one of the premier resources online for the study of U.S. women's history. The site includes over one hundred document projects, and Sklar continues to release biannual editions of new document projects and full-text sources for the study of women's history with historian Thomas Dublin.[8]

From 2005-2006 Sklar was the Harmsworth Professor of U.S. History at Oxford University.[9]

Sklar currently resides in Berkeley, California with her partner Thomas Dublin.
