Club career

Graxa was born in Contagem, Minas Gerais, and represented Atlético Mineiro, São José-SP and Náutico as a youth.[1] Known as GRACIANO with the latter, he made his senior debut on 7 March 2012, coming on as a second half substitute for Rodrigo Tiuí in a 2–0 Campeonato Pernambucano home win against Porto.[2]

In January 2013 Graxa moved to Bragantino, but after being rarely used, moved on loan to União Barbarense ahead of the year's Copa Paulista. He returned to his parent club on 3 October,[3] making his Série B debut six days later by coming on in the 19th minute of a 3–5 away loss against Ceará.[4]

On 26 October 2013, Graxa appeared in a 0–3 loss at Avaí, and was suspended for 180 days after a heavy challenge on Héracles.[5] Upon returning, he was sparingly used, and released in 2015.

After leaving the _Massa Bruta_, Graxa represented Caldas Esporte Clube and CRAC[6] before moving abroad on 18 July 2016, after signing for Marbella FC.[7] He left the club on 22 December 2016.[8]
