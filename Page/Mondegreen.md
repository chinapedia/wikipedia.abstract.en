A MONDEGREEN is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony, in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to clearly hear a lyric, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense.[1][2] American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in 1954, writing that as a girl she had misheard the lyric "...and laid him on the green" in a Scottish ballad as, "...and Lady Mondegreen".[3]

"Mondegreen" was included in the 2000 edition of the _Random House Webster's College Dictionary_, and in the _Oxford English Dictionary_ in 2002. Merriam-Webster's _Collegiate Dictionary_ added the word in 2008.[4][5] Examples in other languages include those cited by Fyodor Dostoyevsky,[6] in the Hebrew song "Háva Nagíla",[7] and in Bollywood films.[8]

Closely related categories are Hobson-Jobson, where a word from a foreign language is homophonically translated into one's own language, e.g. _cockroach_ from Spanish _cucaracha_,[9][10] and _soramimi_, a Japanese term for homophonic translation of song lyrics.[11]

An unintentionally incorrect use of similar-sounding words or phrases, resulting in a changed meaning, is a malapropism. If there is a connection in meaning, it may be called an eggcorn. If a person stubbornly continues to mispronounce a word or phrase after being corrected, that person has committed a mumpsimus.[12]


Etymology

In a 1954 essay in _Harper's Magazine_, Wright described how, as a young girl, she misheard the last line of the first stanza from the seventeenth-century ballad "The Bonnie Earl o' Moray". She wrote: The correct fourth line is, "And _laid him on the green"._ Wright explained the need for a new term:


Psychology

People are more likely to notice what they expect than things not part of their everyday experiences; this is known as confirmation bias. Similarly, one may mistake an unfamiliar stimulus for a familiar and more plausible version. For example, to consider a well-known mondegreen in the song "Purple Haze", one would be more likely to hear Jimi Hendrix singing that he is about to _kiss this guy_ than that he is about to _kiss the sky_.[13] Similarly, if a lyric uses words or phrases that the listener is unfamiliar with, they may be misheard as using more familiar terms.

The creation of mondegreens may be driven in part by cognitive dissonance, as the listener finds it psychologically uncomfortable to listen to a song and not make out the words. Steven Connor suggests that mondegreens are the result of the brain's constant attempts to make sense of the world by making assumptions to fill in the gaps when it cannot clearly determine what it is hearing. Connor sees mondegreens as the "wrenchings of nonsense into sense". This dissonance will be most acute when the lyrics are in a language the listener is fluent in. [14]

On the other hand, Steven Pinker has observed that mondegreen mishearings tend to be _less_ plausible than the original lyrics, and that once a listener has "locked in" to a particular misheard interpretation of a song's lyrics, it can remain unquestioned, even when that plausibility becomes strained. Pinker gives the example of a student "stubbornly" mishearing the chorus to "Venus" ("I'm your Venus") as "I'm your penis," and being surprised that the song was allowed on the radio.[15] The phenomenon may, in some cases, be triggered by people hearing "what they want to hear", as in the case of the song "Louie Louie": parents heard obscenities in the Kingsmen recording where none existed.[16]

James Gleick claims that the mondegreen is a distinctly modern phenomenon. Without the improved communication and language standardization brought about by radio, he believes there would have been no way to recognize and discuss this shared experience.[17] Just as mondegreens transform songs based on experience, a folk song learned by repetition often is transformed over time when sung by people in a region where some of the song's references have become obscure. A classic example is "The Golden Vanity",[18] which contains the line "As she sailed upon the lowland sea". British immigrants carried the song to Appalachia, where singers, not knowing what the term _lowland sea_ refers to, transformed it over generations from "lowland" to "lonesome".[19]


Examples

In songs

The top three mondegreens submitted regularly to mondegreen expert Jon Carroll are:[20]

1.  _Gladly, the cross-eyed bear_[21] (from the line in the hymn "Keep Thou My Way" by Fanny Crosby and Theodore E. Perkins, "Kept by Thy tender care, gladly the cross I'll bear").[22] Carroll and many others quote it as "Gladly the cross _I'd_ bear".
2.  _There's a bathroom on the right_ (the line at the end of each verse of "Bad Moon Rising" by Creedence Clearwater Revival: "There's a bad moon on the rise").
3.  _'Scuse me while I kiss this guy_ (from a lyric in the song "Purple Haze" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience: "'Scuse me while I kiss the sky").

Both Creedence's John Fogerty and Hendrix eventually acknowledged these mishearings by deliberately singing the "mondegreen" versions of their songs in concert.[23][24][25]

The national anthem of the United States is highly susceptible (especially for young grade-school students) to the creation of mondegreens, two in the first line. Francis Scott Key's "Star-Spangled Banner" begins with the line: "O say can you see, by the dawn's early light."[26] This has been accidentally and deliberately misinterpreted as "Jose, can you see", another example of the Hobson-Jobson effect, countless times.[27][28] The second half of the line has been misheard as well, as "by the donzerly light"[29] or other variants. This has led to many people believing that "donzerly" is an authentic word.[30]

"Blinded by the Light", a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, contains what has been called "probably the most misheard lyric of all time".[31] The phrase is "revved up like a deuce", which is altered from Springsteen's original "cut loose like a deuce," both lyrics referring to the hot rodders slang _deuce_ (short for deuce coupé) for a 1932 Ford coupé. The Manfred Mann version is frequently misheard as "wrapped up like a douche".[32][33] Springsteen has joked about the phenomenon, claiming that it was not until Manfred Mann rewrote the song to be about a "feminine hygiene product" that the song became popular.[34][35]

A 2010 survey in Britain found that the most commonly misheard lyric was "Call me when you try to wake her" in R.E.M.'s "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite," which was misheard as "Calling Jamaica" or "Calling Cheryl Baker" (in the United Kingdom). Other misheard lyrics reported in the survey included "See that girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen,"[36] from the ABBA song "Dancing Queen" ("See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen").

Rap and hip hop lyrics may be particularly susceptible to being misheard because they do not necessarily follow standard pronunciations. The delivery of rap lyrics relies heavily upon an often regional pronunciation or non-traditional accenting of words and their phonemes to adhere to the artist's stylizations and the lyrics's written structure. This issue is exemplified in controversies over alleged transcription errors in Yale University Press's 2010 _Anthology of Rap._[37] For example, in the 2015 song "Post To Be" by Omarion ft. Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, Aiko's lyric "I might have that nigga sailing his soul for me" was widely misheard as "selling his soul" but it was really a play on the title of Aiko's mixtape _Sailing Soul(s)_.[38]

Standardized and recorded mondegreens

Sometimes, the modified version of a lyric becomes standard, as is the case with "The Twelve Days of Christmas". The original has "four colly birds"[39] (_colly_ means _black_; cf. _A Midsummer Night's Dream_: "Brief as the lightning in the collied night."[40]); sometime around the turn of the twentieth century, these became _calling_ birds, which is the lyric used in the 1909 Frederic Austin version.

A number of misheard lyrics have been recorded, turning a mondegreen into a real title. The song "Sea Lion Woman", recorded in 1939 by Christine and Katherine Shipp, was performed by Nina Simone under the title, "See Line Woman". According to the liner notes from the compilation _A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings_, the correct title of this playground song might also be "See [the] Lyin' Woman" or "C-Line Woman".[41] Jack Lawrence's misinterpretation of the French phrase "pauvre Jean" ("poor John") as the identically pronounced "pauvres gens" ("poor people") led to the translation of _La Goualante du pauvre Jean_ ("The Ballad of Poor John") as "The Poor People of Paris", a hit song in 1956.[42]

In literature

_A Monk Swimming_ by author Malachy McCourt is so titled because of a childhood mishearing of a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. "Amongst women" became "a monk swimmin'".[43]

The title and plot of the short sci-fi story "Come You Nigh: Kay Shuns" ("Com-mu-ni-ca-tions") by Lawrence A. Perkins, in _Analog Science Fiction and Fact_ magazine (April 1970), deals with securing interplanetary radio communications by encoding them with mondegreens.

In Beverly Cleary's children's book, _Ramona the Pest_, Ramona mishears "by the dawn's early light" as "by the dawnzer lee light" and concludes that a "dawnzer" must be a kind of lamp.[44]

_Olive, the Other Reindeer_ is a 1997 children's book by Vivian Walsh, which borrows its title from a mondegreen of the line, "all of the other reindeer" in the song "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer". The book was adapted into an animated Christmas special in 1999.

In film

A monologue of mondegreens appears in the 1971 film _Carnal Knowledge_. The camera focuses on actress Candice Bergen laughing as she recounts various phrases that fooled her as a child, including "Round John Virgin" (instead of '"Round yon virgin...") and "Gladly, the cross-eyed bear".

The enigmatic title of the 2013 film _Ain't Them Bodies Saints_ is a misheard lyric from a folk song; director David Lowery decided to use it because it evoked the "classical, regional" feel of 1970s rural Texas.[45]

In television

"Mondegreens" was the name of a segment on the Australian music quiz show _Spicks and Specks_ (ABC TV).[46]

Mondegreens have been used in many television advertising campaigns, including:

-   An advertisement for the 2012 Volkswagen Passat touting the car's audio system shows a number of people singing incorrect versions of the line "Burning out his fuse up here alone" from the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song "Rocket Man", until a woman listening to the song in a Passat realizes the correct words.[47]
-   A 2002 advertisement for T-Mobile shows spokeswoman Catherine Zeta-Jones helping to correct a man who has misunderstood the chorus of Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar On Me" as "pour some shook up ramen".[48]
-   A series of advertisements for Maxell audio cassette tapes, produced by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury,[49] shown in 1989 and 1990, featured misheard versions of "Israelites" (e.g., "Me ears are alight")[50] by Desmond Dekker and "Into the Valley" by The Skids[51] as heard by users of other brands of tape.
-   A 1987 series of advertisements for Kellogg's _Nut 'n Honey Crunch_ featured a joke in which one person asks "What's for breakfast?" and is told "Nut 'N' Honey," which is misheard as "Nothing, honey."[52]

Other examples

The traditional game Chinese whispers ("Telephone" in the United States) involves mishearing a whispered sentence to produce successive mondegreens that gradually distort the original sentence as it is repeated by successive listeners.

Among schoolchildren in the U.S., daily rote recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance has long provided opportunities for the genesis of mondegreens.[53][54][55]

The travel guide book series Lonely Planet is named after the misheard phrase "lovely planet" sung by Joe Cocker in Matthew Moore's song _Space Captain_.[56]

Non-English languages

Dutch

In Dutch, mondegreens are popularly referred to as _Mama appelsap_ ("Mommy applejuice"), from the Michael Jackson song _Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'_ which features the lyrics _Mama-se mama-sa ma-ma-coo-sa_, and was once misheard as _Mama say mama sa mam[a]appelsap_. The Dutch radio station 3FM had a show _Superrradio_ (originally _Timur Open Radio_) run by Timur Perlin and Ramon with an item in which listeners were encouraged to send in mondegreens under the name "Mama appelsap". The segment was popular for years.[57]

French

The title of the film _La Vie en rose_ depicting the life of Édith Piaf can be mistaken for "L'Avion rose" (The pink airplane).[58][59]

The French word "lapalissade", designating a gross truism or platitude, is derived from the name of Jacques II de Chabannes, Seigneur de La Palice, because of a misread mondegreen in a mourning song written just after his heroic death. Reading an "f" as a long "s" (ſ), "_s'il n'était pas mort, il ferait encore envie_" ("if he were not dead, he would still arouse envy") becomes "_il serait encore en vie_" ("he would still be alive"). This truism remains as the first and most well-known "lapalissade" in French.

The title of the 1983 French novel _Le Thé au harem d'Archi Ahmed_ ("Tea in the Harem of Archi Ahmed") by Mehdi Charef (and the 1985 movie of the same name) is based on the main character mishearing _le théorème d'Archimède_ ("the theorem of Archimedes") in his mathematics class.

A classic example in French is similar to the "Lady Mondegreen" anecdote: in his 1962 collection of children's quotes _La Foire aux cancres_, the humorist Jean-Charles[60] refers to a misunderstood lyric of "La Marseillaise" (the French national anthem): "Entendez-vous ... mugir ces féroces soldats" (Do you hear those savage soldiers roar?) is heard as "...Séféro, ce soldat" (that soldier Séféro).

German

Mondegreens are a well-known phenomenon in German, especially where non-German songs are concerned. They are sometimes called, after a well-known example, _Agathe Bauer_-songs (_I got the power_, a song by Snap!, transferred to a German female name).[61][62] Journalist Axel Hacke published a series of books about them, beginning with _Der weiße Neger Wumbaba_ ("The White Negro Wumbaba", after the line _der weiße Nebel wunderbar_ from Der Mond ist aufgegangen).[63]

It is at least an urban legend that children, when painting nativity scenes, occasionally include next to the Child, Mary, Joseph, the shepherds and so forth yet another, laughing creature: This is the _Owi_, who must be depicted laughing. The reason is to be found in the line _Gottes Sohn! O WIE lacht / Lieb' aus Deinem göttlichen Mund_ (God's Son! Oh, how does love laugh out of Thy divine mouth!) from Silent Night. The subject is _Lieb'_, but it is a poetic contraction of "die Liebe", leaving away the final -e and the definite article (in German, though not in English, mandatory in such a context), so the phrase is not easily understood and it might well be a statement about a person named Owi laughing "in a loveable manner" (the adverb _lieb_), although the rest of the sentence still makes no sense.[64][65] _Owi lacht_ is the title of at least one book about Christmas and Christmas songs.[66]

Hebrew

Ghil'ad Zuckermann cites the Hebrew example _mukhrakhím liyót saméakh_ ("we must be happy", with a grammar mistake) instead of (the high-register) _úru 'akhím belév saméakh_ ("wake up, brothers, with a happy heart"), from the well-known song "Háva Nagíla" ("Let's be happy").[67] The Israeli site dedicated to Hebrew mondegreens has coined the term "avatiach" (Hebrew for watermelon) for "mondegreen", named for a common mishearing of Shlomo Artzi's award-winning 1970 song "Ahavtia" ("I loved her", using a form uncommon in spoken Hebrew).[68]

Polish

A paper in phonology cites memoirs of poet Antoni Słonimski, who confessed that in the recited poem _Konrad Wallenrod_ he used to hear "zwierz Alpuhary" ("a beast of Alpujarras") rather than "z wież Alpuhary" ("from the towers of Alpujarras").[69]

Portuguese

The most well-known mondegreen in Brazil is in the song "Noite do Prazer" (Night of Pleasure) by Claudio Zoli: the line "Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, tocando B. B. King sem parar" (At dawn the phonograph playing a blues, playing B. B. King nonstop), is often misheard as "Na madrugada a vitrola rolando um blues, trocando de biquini sem parar" (at dawn the phonograph playing a blues, [people are] exchanging bikini nonstop).

Russian

Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, in 1875, cited a line from Fyodor Glinka's song "Troika" (1825) "колокольчик, дар Валдая" ("the bell, gift of Valday") claiming that it is usually understood as "колокольчик, дарвалдая" ("the bell _darvaldaying_"—supposedly an onomatopoeia of ringing).[70]


Reverse mondegreen

A reverse mondegreen is the intentional production, in speech or writing, of words or phrases that seem to be gibberish but disguise meaning. A prominent example is _Mairzy Doats_, a 1943 novelty song by Milton Drake, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston.[71] The lyrics are a reverse mondegreen, made up of oronyms,[72] so pronounced (and written) as to challenge the listener (or reader) to interpret them:



        Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
        A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?

The clue to the meaning is contained in the bridge:



        If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,
        Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

This makes it clear that the last line is "A kid'll eat ivy, too; wouldn't you?"

Other examples include:

-   Iron Butterfly's 1968 hit, "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida", a reverse mondegreen of the phrase "In the Garden of Eden", which, according to liner notes, was going to be the song's title.
-   Sly and the Family Stone's 1970 hit, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", in which the part after thank you is an obvious reverse mondegreen for "for lettin' me be myself again."
-   In the 1945 comedy-mystery film _Murder, He Says_, an unknowing character repeats a singsong rhyming reverse mondegreen that contains a clue to finding keys that will lead to some lost money: "Honors fleezis, income beezis, onches nobbis, innob keezis" ("On horse fleas is, in comb bees is, on chest knob is, in knob keys is").
-   In his Anguish Languish (English language), Howard L. Chace uses standard English words in non-standard order to create reverse mondegreens that refer to familiar things and stories; it includes the widely known story "Ladle Rat Rotten Hut" (Little Red Riding Hood).
-   Many songs by Animal Collective feature reverse mondegreens in their titles, including "Mouth Wooed Her" ("Mouth Water"), "Seal Eyeing" ("Sea Lion"), and "Brother Sport" ("Brother Support").
-   The title of SOPHIE's 2018 album _Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides_ is a reverse mondegreen of the sentence "I love every person's insides".[73]


Deliberate mondegreen

Two authors have written books of supposed foreign-language poetry that are actually mondegreens of nursery rhymes in English. Luis van Rooten's pseudo-French _Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames_ includes critical, historical, and interpretive apparatus, as does John Hulme's _Mörder Guss Reims_, attributed to a fictitious German poet. Both titles sound like the phrase "Mother Goose Rhymes". Both works can also be considered soramimi, which produces different meanings when interpreted in another language. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart produced a similar effect in his canon "Difficile Lectu" (written c. 1786-87, when he was 30 or 31), which, though ostensibly in Latin, is actually an opportunity for scatological humor in both German and Italian.[74]

Some performers and writers have used deliberate mondegreens to create double entendres. The phrase "if you see Kay" (F-U-C-K) has been employed many times, notably as a line from James Joyce's 1922 novel _Ulysses_[75] and in many songs, including by blues pianist Memphis Slim in 1963, R. Stevie Moore in 1977, April Wine on its 1982 album _Power Play_, the Poster Children via their _Daisy Chain Reaction_ in 1991, Turbonegro in 2005, Aerosmith in "Devil's Got a New Disguise" in 2006, and The Script in their 2008 song "If You See Kay". Britney Spears did the same thing with the song "If U Seek Amy". A similar effect was created in Hindi in the 2011 Bollywood movie _Delhi Belly_ in the song "Bhaag D.K. Bose". While "D. K. Bose" appears to be a person's name, it is sung repeatedly in the chorus to form the deliberate mondegreen _"bhosadi ke"_ (Hindi: भोसडी के), a Hindi expletive.

"Mondegreen" is a song by Yeasayer on their 2010 album, _Odd Blood_. The lyrics are intentionally obscure (for instance, "Everybody sugar in my bed" and "Perhaps the pollen in the air turns us into a stapler") and spoken hastily to encourage the mondegreen effect.[76]
