_GIGANTOPITHECUS BLACKI_ is an extinct species of prehistoric apes that existed from perhaps nine million years to as recently as one hundred thousand years ago, at the same period as _Homo erectus_ would have been dispersed.[1]


Taxonomy

_Gigantopithecus blacki_ was named in honour of the friend and colleague of von Koenigswald, Davidson Black,[2] and is known only through fossil teeth and mandibles found in cave sites in South China and Vietnam. These are appreciably larger than those of living gorillas, but the exact size and structure of the rest of the body can only be estimated in the absence of additional findings. Dating methods have shown that _G. blacki_ existed for at least a million years, going extinct about 100,000 years ago after having been contemporary with anatomically modern humans (_Homo sapiens_) for tens of thousands of years, and co-existing with _H. erectus_, who preceded the appearance of _H. sapiens_.[3] In 2014, for the first time, fossil teeth and mandible of _G. blacki_ were found in Indonesia.[4][5]

Evolution

In the past, _Gigantopithecus blacki_ was thought to be closely related to early hominins, particularly _Australopithecus_, on the basis of molar evidence; this is now regarded a result of convergent evolution.[6] _Gigantopithecus_ is now placed in the subfamily Ponginae along with the orangutan.[7]


Description

Gigantopithecus.jpeg _G. blacki_'s method of locomotion is uncertain, as no pelvic or leg bones have been found. The dominant view is that this species walked on hands and feet like modern gorillas and chimpanzees; however, a minority opinion favors bipedal locomotion. This was most notably championed by the late Grover Krantz, but this assumption is based only on the very few jawbone remains found, all of which are U-shaped and widen towards the rear. This allows room for the windpipe to be within the jaw, allowing the skull to sit squarely on a fully erect spine as in modern humans, rather than roughly in front of it, as in the other great apes.

Based on the fossil evidence, adult male _G. blacki_ are believed to have stood about tall and weighed as much as ,[8][9][10][11] making the species three to four times as heavy as modern gorillas and seven to eight times as heavy as the orangutan, its closest living relative. Large males may have had an armspan of over . The species was highly sexually dimorphic, with adult females roughly half the weight of males.[12] Because of wide interspecies differences in the relationship between tooth and body size, some argue that it is more likely that adult male _G. blacki_ were much smaller, at roughly in height and in weight.[13][14][15][16]


Diet

In addition to bamboo, _G. blacki_ consumed other vegetable foods, as suggested by the analysis of the phytoliths adhering to its teeth. An examination of the microscopic scratches and gritty plant remains embedded in _Gigantopithecus_ teeth suggests that they fed on seeds and fruit, as well as bamboo.[17]
