SUDHA ROY (1914–1987) was an Indian communist trade unionist and politician. She was a prominent leader of the Bengal Labour Party, the Bolshevik Party of India and later joined the Communist Party of India.[1] She was one of the most prominent female leaders of the Bengali left.[2]


Youth

Roy was born in 1914 into a Kayastha landlord family in Faridpur.[3] She joined labour movement in the 1930s, having been introduced to labour politics by her brother Sisir Roy during her student days.[4][5][6][7] Alongside her brother, she became a key leader of the Bengal Labour Party when it was founded in 1933.[8]


Labour organiser

She worked as mathematics teacher at Kamala Girls School in south Calcutta between 1932 and 1958.[9][10][11] At the time she was a well-known labour leader.[12] Roy, nicknamed _Bahinji_ ('Honoured sister') by dock workers, would pass the Kidderpore dock daily in the afternoon for union tasks.[13][14][15]


Women's movement

Roy joined the women's movement in 1943, being active in the All India Women's Conference.[16][17] Roy served as vice chair of the National Federation of Indian Women between 1954 and 1982.[18][19][20]


Electoral politics

Sudha Roy was the sole candidate of the BPI in the 1951–1952 parliamentary election.[21] She stood in Barrackpore constituency and obtained 25,792 votes (16.2% of vote in the constituency).[22]

She was jailed in 1954.[23]

Roy contested the Fort constituency in the 1957 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.[24] She finished in fourth place, with 9.75% of the votes.[25]


In UTUC

In 1958 Sudha Roy's union, the Dock Mazdoor Union, underwent a split. Sisir Roy, Sudha Roy and Buthnath De were pitted against Bishwanath Dubey.[26] Whilst Roy's group constituted the majority faction, the split significantly weakened the union.[27]

Sisir Roy died in 1960, and Sudha Roy succeeded him in the post as general secretary of the United Trade Union Congress.[28][29][30][31]


Joining CPI

At the 1965 BPI party conference Sudha Roy called for a merger between BPI and CPI.[32] The conference rejected a merger and Sudha Roy and her followers left BPI to join CPI.[33] After shifting to CPI, she joined the All India Trade Union Congress.[34]

Roy chaired the State Social Welfare Board between 1969 and 1973.[35][36] Roy founded the Mahila Sanskritik Saimmelan ('Women's Cultural Conference').[37]

Roy died in 1987.[38]
