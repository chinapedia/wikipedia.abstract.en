MARK DEYELL (born March 26, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the National Hockey League (NHL).


Playing career

Deyell played major junior hockey with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League. While playing with the Saskatoon Blades, Deyell was selected with the 126th overall pick in the 1994 NHL entry draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs. In his final season with the Saskatoon Blades, Deyell got 159 points in only 69 games played, which was more points than current Colorado Avalanche player Jarome Iginla.[1] He earned the Bob Clarke Trophy that season for being the top scorer. After his last season with the Saskatoon Blades, Deyell played with the St. John's Maple Leafs for three seasons.[2]

In April 1999, Deyell took a stick to his left eye during an AHL playoff game, when a player on the opposing team was following through on a shot, ending his career.[3]
