History

A post office called Galloway was established in 1883, and remained in operation until 1943.[4] The community has the name of a Union Army officer.[5]

From 1945 and into the 1950s, the combined U.S. 60 - U.S. 65 highways passed through Galloway at the southeast entrance to Springfield.[6]
