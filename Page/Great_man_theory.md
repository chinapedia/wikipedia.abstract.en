David_-_Napoleon_crossing_the_Alps_-_Malmaison2.jpg, an exemplary great man, who determined the "Napoleonic" era of history]] The GREAT MAN THEORY is a 19th-century idea according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or heroes; highly influential and unique individuals who, due to their natural attributes, such as superior intellect, heroic courage, or divine inspiration, have a decisive historical effect. The theory is primarily attributed to the Scottish philosopher and essayist Thomas Carlyle who gave a series of lectures on heroism in 1840, later published as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History, in which he states:


Overview

Carlyle stated that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration.[1][2] In his book _On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History_, Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions, works, ideas, and characters of "heroes", giving detailed analysis of six types: The hero as divinity (such as Odin), prophet (such as Jesus), poet (such as Shakespeare), priest (such as Martin Luther), man of letters (such as Rousseau), and king (such as Napoleon). Carlyle also argued that the study of great men was "profitable" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's own true nature.[3]

As Sidney Hook notes, a common misinterpretation of the theory is that "_all factors in history, save great men,_ were inconsequential."[4], whereas Carlyle is instead claiming that great men are the decisive factor, owing to their unique genius. Hook then goes on to emphasise this uniqueness to illustrate the point: "Genius is not the result of compounding talent. How many battalions are the equivalent of a Napoleon? How many minor poets will give us a Shakespeare? How many run of the mine scientists will do the work of an Einstein?"[5]

American scholar Frederick Adams Woods supported the great man theory in his work _The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History_.[6] Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.

This theory is usually contrasted with "history from below", which emphasizes the life of the masses in addition to the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the _Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition_ (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman "Migrations Period" of European History is compiled under the biography of Attila the Hun. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as Léon Bloy, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Spengler and Max Weber,[7][8][9] but it fell out of favor after World War II.

In _Untimely Meditations_, Nietzsche writes that "the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens".[10]

In _Fear and Trembling_, Kierkegaard writes that "to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the pedestrian—that only these knights of faith can do—this is the one and only prodigy."[11]

Hegel, proceeding from providentialist theory, argued that "what is real is reasonable" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel wrote: "Such are great historical men—whose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit."[12] Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.

Herbert Spencer's Criticism

One of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man theory was Herbert Spencer, who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was an unscientific position.[13] He believed that the men Carlyle called "great men" were merely products of their social environment:

William James' Defence

William_James_b1842c.jpg was a 19th century philosopher and psychologist.]]

William James, in his 1880 lecture "Great Men, Great Thoughts, and the Environment",[14] published in the Atlantic Monthly, powerfully defended Carlyle and refuted Spencer, dismantling his "impudent", "vague", and "dogmatic" argument, by reversing his thesis:

James' defence of the great man theory can be summarised as follows: The unique physiological nature of the individual is the deciding factor in making the great man, who, in turn, is the deciding factor in changing his environment in a unique way, without which the new environment would not have come to be, wherein the extent and nature of this change is also dependent on the reception of the environment to this new stimulus. To begin his argument, he first humorously claims that these inherent physiological forces have as much to do with "social, political, geographical [and] anthropological conditions" as the "conditions of the crater of Vesuvius has to do with the flickering of this gas by which I write". He then illustrates this on the cellular level of genius creation:

It is the brains of these great men that introduce an original influence into the environment. They offer original ideas, discoveries, inventions, perspectives, formed from premises which "would not, in the mind of another individual, have engendered just that conclusion ... It flashes out of one brain, and no other, because the instability of that brain is such as to tip and upset itself in just that particular direction." This physiological originality is described in detail as follows:

James subsequently argues that these spontaneous variations of genius, i.e. the great men, which are causally independent of the environment, then influence that environment since it either preserves or destroys these new variations, which is to say it _selects_ them. If the great man is preserved then the environment is changed by his influence in "an entirely original and peculiar way. He acts as a ferment, and changes its constitution, just as the advent of a new zoological species changes the faunal and floral equilibrium of the region in which it appears." Each ferment, each great man, exerts a new influence on the environment which previously showed no sign of it and which is either adopted by it or not. If so, it in turn causes new geniuses, and so on and so forth:

If you remove these geniuses "or alter their idiosyncrasies", then what "increasing uniformities will the environment show? We defy Mr. Spencer or any one else to reply." For James, then, there are two distinct factors that cause social evolution:

1.  The individual, who is unique in his "physiological and infra-social forces, but bearing all the power of initiative and origination in his hands" and
2.  The social environment of the individual, "with its power of adopting or rejecting both him and his gifts".

He thus concludes: "Both factors are essential to change. The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community." Spencer's view, conversely, which ignores the impulse and

Other responses

Tolstoy's _War and Peace_ features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only _history's slaves_ realizing the decree of Providence.[15]

Among modern critics of the theory, Sidney Hook is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book _The Hero in History_ is devoted to the role of the hero and in history and influence of the outstanding persons.[16]

In the introduction to a new edition of _On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History_, David R. Sorensen notes the modern decline in support for Carlyle's theory in particular but also for "heroic distinction" in general.[17] He cites Robert Faulkner as an exception, a proponent of Aristotelian magnanimity who in his book _The Case for Greatness: Honorable Ambition and Its Critics_, criticises the political bias in discussions on greatness and heroism, stating: "the new liberalism’s antipathy to superior statesmen and to human excellence is peculiarly zealous, parochial, and antiphilosophic."[18]
