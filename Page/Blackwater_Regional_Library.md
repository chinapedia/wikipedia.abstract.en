History

Southampton citizens Walter Cecil Rawls and his friend Junious W. Pulley planned what would become the Walter Cecil Rawls Library and Museum, which is the first of what would become the currently nine branch Blackwater Regional Library.[4] The Walter Cecil Rawls Library and Museum opened for public use on June 13, 1958. Rawls implemented a bookmobile service in 1959 on the second week in April during National Library Week. The bookmobile routes eventually led to the opening of the branches in the other counties.
