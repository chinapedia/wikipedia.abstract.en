The ALL STAR CIRCUIT OF CHAMPIONS (abbreviated ASCoC) is an American motorsports sanctioning body of winged sprint car racing founded in 1970. The series sanctions 410ci sprint car races in Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. On average the series runs 50 races per year, starting February and ending in October each year.[1] The ASCoC was purchased by Tony Stewart in the winter of 2015.


History

The ASCoC was founded by Bud Miller in 1970 after a failed venture by himself, Chris Economaki, and Wellman Lehman, to build a new race track near Youngstown, OH. Through the meetings about building the track the idea was conceived to create a touring sprint car series in the area. The idea of the All Star Circuit of Champions was then born in 1970 and began operating that year. The series would cease operations after just 3 years in 1973, when the 1973 oil crisis began Miller knew the series couldn't continue to run with the price of oil rising.[2]

The series would reform in 1979 under the guidance of a new owner, Bert Emick. Emick, had been successfully running the MOSS sanctioning body in the Ohio area but lost the naming rights in a legal battle. Thus the All Star name was brought back in 1980 with Emick as President. Emick would run the series until 2002 when Guy Webb took over.[3]

Joey Saldana set a series record with 18 wins in 1995 piloting the Art Wendt 77w.

Guy Webb took over as owner in 2002, running the series for 12 years. In January 2015, Webb sold the series to Tony Stewart.[4]

Stewart took sole ownership of the ASCoC in 2015 in order to bring about peace in the Ohio sprint car scene. Early in 2015 a second competing series former, the Renegade Sprints, after disagreements with Webb. This caused Stewart to step in bringing both sides back in under the All Star banner.[5]

In January 2016 it was announced that the series gained Arctic Cat as the series title sponsor, utilizing the banner "The Arctic Cat All Star Circuit of Champions" and the social media tagline "#ArcticCatAllStars".[6]

2017 was a very competitive year, as the series had 29 different winners. Chad Kemenah, piloting the Hunter Racing 10H, would control the 2017 season and back up the 2016 championship with his 6th championship in 2017, tying Dale Blaney for most titles in series history!

2018 was another thrilling year with 19 different winners for the series. Aaron Reutzel from Clute, TX took on the series full-time and was crowned champion virtue of his strong 9 win season. Carson Macedo, Chad Kemenah, Paul McMahan, and Dave Blaney rounded out the Top 5 in points.
