MOLDOVA participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017. The artist and song that would represent Moldova in the 2017 contest was selected through the national final, _O melodie pentru Europa 2017_, organised by the Moldovan broadcaster TeleRadio-Moldova (TRM), on 25 February 2017.

Moldova was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2017. Performing during the show in position 12, "Hey, Mamma!" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 13 May.


Background

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Moldova had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twelve times since its first entry in 2005.[1] The nation's best placing in the contest was sixth, which it achieved in 2005 with the song "Bunica bate toba" performed by Zdob și Zdub. Other than their debut entry, to this point, Moldova's only other top ten placing at the contest was achieved in 2007 where "Fight" performed by Natalia Barbu placed tenth. In the 2016 contest, "Falling Stars" performed by Lidia Isac failed to qualify Moldova to compete in the final.

For the 2017 Contest, the Moldovan national broadcaster, TeleRadio-Moldova (TRM), will broadcast the event within Moldova and organise the selection process for the nation's entry. TRM confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest on 25 October 2016.[2] Moldova has selected their entry via a national selection show since 2008, a procedure that was continued for their 2017 participation.[3]


Before Eurovision

_O melodie pentru Europa 2017_

_O melodie pentru Europa 2017_ was the national final format developed by TRM in order to select Moldova's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. Unlike in previous years, the event only included one semi-final and a final to be held on 24 and 25 February 2017, respectively.[4]

Format

The selection of the competing entries for the national final and ultimately the Moldovan Eurovision entry took place over two rounds. On 21 January 2017, all artists who submitted a song to the broadcaster were invited to take part in a live audition, where the fourteen semi-finalists were decided. The fourteen semi-finalists took part in a live semi-final on 24 February, where eight singers progressed to the live final on 25 February. The winner was decided by voting from the Moldovan public and a jury of music professionals.[5]

Competing entries

Interested artists and composers had until 18 January 2017 to submit their entries to the Moldovan broadcaster.[6] At the conclusion of the submissions period, the broadcaster had received 40 entries, all of which were invited to the live auditions.[7] One artist withdrew from the competition prior to the auditions, and another did not show up, leaving 38 candidates.[8] The fourteen semi-finalists were revealed on 21 January, following the live audition. Constantin Cobîlean and his song "Mama" were disqualified after it was discovered that a Russian language version of the song had been performed on the Russian television series _Glavnaya Stsena_ in 2015. He was replaced by Nadia Moșneagu and the song "Never Give Up on Us".[9][10] On 24 January, Irina Kit decided to withdraw from the selection after it was revealed that heir chorus had similarities to the Akon song Bananza; She was replaced by Samir Loghin and the song "Glow".[11]

SunStroke Project & Ethno Republic & Surorile Osoianu were tied at 22 points but since SunStroke Project received the most votes from the televote they were declared the winners.

Promotion

SunStroke Project made several appearances across Europe to specifically promote "Hey, Mamma!" as the Moldovan Eurovision entry. Between 3 and 6 April, they took part in promotional activities in Tel Aviv, Israel where they performed during the _Israel Calling_ event held at the Ha'teatron venue.[12][13] On 8 April, they performed during the _Eurovision in Concert_ event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Björnsdóttir.[14] On 15 April, they performed during the _Eurovision Spain Pre-Party_, which was held at the Sala La Riviera venue in Madrid, Spain.[15]


At Eurovision

According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[16] On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Moldova was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 9 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.[17]

Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Moldova was set to perform in position 12, following the entry from Poland and before the entry from Iceland.[18]

Semi-final

SunStroke Project took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 4 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. This included the jury show on 8 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.

At the end of the show, Moldova was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final.In the first semi-final, Moldova placed second with the public televote receiving 180 points and fourth with the jury vote with 111 points.

Final

Shortly after the first semi-final, a winners' press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the reverse order the countries appeared in the semi-final running order. Moldova was drawn to compete in the first half. After the completion of the second semifinal press conference, it was decided that Moldova would perform seventh in the grand final running order, following the entry from the Netherlands and preceding the entry from Hungary.

After Eurovision

After the Eurovision performance there was much discussion about the saxophone player Sergey Stepanov in Moldova's entry, who was the main focus of the 'epic sax guy' Internet meme from the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. This has led to online tribute videos being made by fans which have gone viral, one of which is ten hours long.
