Early life

Christina Oxenberg was born on December 27, 1962, in New York City, to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and Howard Oxenberg (1919–2010).[11] Her parents separated when she was 3, and she moved to London along with her mother and her older sister, Catherine Oxenberg. Growing up, Christina attended 14 different schools in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain.[12][13][14] She graduated from the Colorado Rocky Mountain School in Carbondale, Colorado, in 1981.[15]


Career

After high school, Oxenberg worked various jobs in New York ranging from a secretary to a roller-rink attendant. She would then go on a backpacking trip around the world before returning to New York City. Upon her return, Oxenberg secured a job at Studio 54.[16] Between 1984 and 1985, she worked as a research assistant for historian, Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, on his book _Blenheim Revisited_.[17] In 1986, she published her first book, _Taxi_, a collection of celebrity anecdotes and personal observations revolving around experiences in taxicabs. In _Taxi_, Andy Warhol, Bob Costas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and numerous others are featured.[18]

Oxenberg married painter Damian Elwes near Amman, Jordan, in May 1986. The two traveled frequently to places like Costa Rica, Morocco, Paris, Colombia, and elsewhere. Elwes would paint and Oxenberg would promote his art. They later divorced.[19][20]

In 1994, Simon & Schuster commissioned Oxenberg to write a semi-autobiographical novel that would eventually be published as _Royal Blue_. The novel was released in 1997 in the United States and was published by Quartet in the United Kingdom in 1998. The book is fictional but contains true elements.[21][22][23][24] The book received generally favorable reviews from publications like _The Independent_[25] _The Guardian_,[26] and _The Times_.[27] As a result of the book, Oxenberg appeared on the cover of _New York Magazine_[28] and was profiled in _People_.[29] It was called "darkly funny" by the _Chicago Tribune_.[30]

In 2000, Oxenberg went on hiatus from writing and took a job at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Waterkeeper Alliance.[31] Through that job she met Fernando Alvarez, a Peruvian businessman living in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The two discussed the possibility of a clothing line using Oxenberg's name. They designed, produced and wholesaled a collection of luxury knitwear. The pair used exclusively deluxe fibers such as the guanaco from Patagonia, the suri-alpaca from the high Andes and the muskox from the indigenous population in the North West Territories of Canada. From 2002 to 2010, Oxenberg produced two clothing lines (_Christina Oxenberg_ and _Ox_) and her items were sold in Barneys, Bloomingdale's, and luxury boutiques throughout the world.[32][33]

Oxenberg would go on to self-publish several collections of short stories between 2010 and 2014, including _Do These Gloves Make My Ass Look Fat?_, _Life is Short: Read Short Stories_, and _When in Doubt...Double the Dosage_.[34][35][36] Additionally, her writing has appeared in publications like _Allure_, _Penthouse_, _The Sunday Times_, _Takimag_ (where she published a weekly column),[37] _HuffPost_ (where she currently publishes weekly columns), and others.[38]

In 2011, she moved from the Northeastern United States to Key West, Florida. Many of the stories in her short story collections like _Will Write for Compliments_ and _Life is Short: Read Short Stories_ are about or set in Key West. Since 2012 Oxenberg has contributed articles to Key West weekly magazine _Konk Life_.[39][40][41] In 2014, Oxenberg helped organize a visit by John Hemingway (Ernest Hemingway's grandson) to David Wolkowsky's Tennessee Williams Collection.[42]

In 2015, Oxenberg moved to Serbia for a year to write and research her book, _Royal Dynasty – An Insider's History of the Serbian Royal Family_, which was published in Serbian in 2015 by the publisher, Laguna. For her work, Oxenberg received an award from the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2016.[43][44] In February 2018, _Dynasty: A True Story_ was published in English in the UK by the publisher, Quartet Books. Subsequently, Oxenberg was interviewed by the _Sunday Times_,[45] Radio Gorgeous[46] and _Tatler_,[47] and she presented the book at the Oxford Literary Festival on 22 March 2018.[48]
