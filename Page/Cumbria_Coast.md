CUMBRIA COAST is one of England's Marine Conservation Zones. It was designated in 2013, and is one of a number of such zones off the coast of Cumbria. St_Bees_south_head_from_path.jpg The MCZ covers the stretch of sea from Whitehaven down to the mouth of the Ravenglass Estuary.[1] It includes the sea off Sellafield (the nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site), and off St Bees Head.


Fauna

The MCZ protects underwater habitats and animals such as the honeycomb worm.

St Bees Head, where there is an RSPB reserve, is an important breeding site for sea birds. There has been some concern that the MCZ as originally designated did not protect enough of their foraging grounds.[2]
