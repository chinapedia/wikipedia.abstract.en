DAVID CHARLES WEATHERBURN is an Australian-trained, New Zealand chemistry academic.


Academic career

After a MSc[1] and PhD[2] at the University of Sydney in Australia, he did a Postdoc at Purdue University and a brief period at University of Queensland, he joined Victoria University of Wellington in the early 1970s and remained there until his official retirement in 2009.[3] His specialism was coordination chemistry and spectroscopy, but he had a popular sideline in science shows.[4]

In 2011 he was given a Meritorious Service Award by the Tertiary Education Union.[5]
