_BOOK OF MERCY_ is a poetry book by Canadian author, poet and singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, published by McLelland and Stewart, and repackaged in March 2010. Its original publication was in 1984. _Book of Mercy_ is considered a companion volume to Cohen's poetry collection, _Book of Longing_ (published in 2006).[1] The book is often referred to as a book of contemporary psalms. The poems are numbered rather than titled. _Book of Mercy_ contains fifty poems. The topics are often spiritual or religious in nature.

According to Penguin Random House, "the poems in Book of Mercy brim with praise, despair, anger, doubt and trust. Speaking from the heart of the modern world, yet in tones that resonate with an older devotional tradition, these verses give voice to our deepest, most powerful intuitions."[2] Cohen uses both traditional and modern forms of writing.

_Book of Mercy_ was labelled Cohen's "most deeply personal book." He told Robert Sward in a 1984 interview, "'Book of Mercy is a secret book for me. It was written during an intense moment of reassessment of his life and art and remains his sole effort to publish a book of psalms.' Book of Mercy allows us to witness the struggle of a soul engaged in what Cohen described as 'a sacred kind of conversation.' The reputation of this meditative collection has grown steadily, and the book is now widely considered one of the finest compilations of confession and spiritual longing ever written."[3]

_Book of Mercy_ is said to have inspired the production of Cohen's studio album _Various Positions_.[4]
