CONTOUR AIRLINES is a regional airline based in Smyrna, Tennessee, United States. It started operations in 1982 as an on-demand charter service for passengers and freight in the southern United States, as well as a full-service fixed-base operation and Federal Aviation Administration certificated repair station. Its main base is Smyrna Airport.[1] Contour Airlines shares management and ownership with Contour Aviation, which provides charter (Part 135), aircraft management, sales, government services, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services.


History

N11526_BWI_MD1.jpg Contour Airlines, then known as Corporate Flight Management (CFM), operated scheduled flights from Branson, Missouri to a number of destinations starting in 2011 under the Branson Air Express brand. Service ended in 2012, but flights to Chicago and Austin started in 2014 as Buzz Airways, using BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft.[2] Service from Branson ended in November 2016.[3]

CFM began service from Pikeville, Kentucky to Nashville on October 27, 2014 under the Appalachian Air brand.[4] This service ended in July 2015.[5][6]

Contour Airlines commenced flights between Bowling Green, Kentucky and Atlanta, and seasonal service to Destin-Fort Walton Beach, Florida, utilizing Jetstream 41 turboprop aircraft, in the summer of 2016.[7][8] Flights from Bowling Green to Atlanta were discontinued in January 2017 due to insufficient demand, but seasonal service to Destin-Fort Walton Beach continues.[9] By 2018, Contour will have replaced Via Air on the Charlotte to Beckley to Parkersburg segments, and will also add Charlotte to Tampa service to provide one-stop service to Florida.

On April 1, 2019 they retired their Jetstream 31/32 fleet and went solely to 10 EMB-135-ER/LR and one EMB-145-LR.
