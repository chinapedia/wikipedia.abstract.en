SUB ROSA is a Brazilian rock band, created in 2006 with influences of progressive rock and classic rock. Their debut album, "The Gigsaw (2009)",[1] was an independent release and, because it sold well in the US and Europe, it was re-released in Brazil by the label "Progressive Rock Worldwide / Megahard Records", in a remixed, remastered deluxe digipack version, with three bonus tracks and new artwork.[2]


History

Sub Rosa was created by Reinaldo José, Vinicius Mendes and Daniel Deboni, in 2006. This trio never played together, but it was the first step to join the first stable line-up: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Vinicius Mendes (guitars, keyboards and vocals), Junior Mansur (keyboards, guitars and vocals) and Romulo Cesar (drums and vocals).[3] They recorded a demo cd, in 2007.[4]

In 2008, Sub Rosa disbanded during the first recording sessions of the debut album. Reinaldo José produced, by himself, the full album. Soon, Marcia Cristina and Glaydston Friederich (both singers) became official band members, while the album was recorded with the help of some special guests.[5]

THE GIGSAW was released in December/2009. The first show took place in the Ady Rosa de Freitas theatre, with a new line-up: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Barbara Laranjeira (drums and vocals), Marcia Cristina (vocals), Glaydston Friederich (vocals), Al Duarte (keyboards and vocals), Thiago Gil (guitars), and the special guest Daniel Laranjeira (violins).[6]

In 2010, Sub Rosa became the winner of the "I Festival de Música Independente of the WULP Radio".[7] The crescent free publicity brought overseas distributors to "The Gigsaw", and the crescent selling grants the band the "USA EAST COAST TOUR", with six shows in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Newark, New York and Boston. 4 states in 18 days of October/2011.[8][9]

In 2014, with more than 14.000 cd's sold in the US, Asia and Europe, Sub Rosa was not yet recognized in Brazil. Then, the label "Progressive Rock Worldwide/Megahard Records" released "The Gigsaw" in a remixed, remastered deluxe digipack version, with 3 bonus tracks and new artwork. Meanwhile, the band recorded the second album, a double set-cd called "11:11."[10][11]

The actual line-up is believed to be: Reinaldo José (bass and vocals), Bárbara Laranjeira (drums and vocals), Márcia Cristina (vocals), Alexandre Salgueiro (keyboards and vocals), Sérgio William (guitars), Rudolf Pinto (guitars) e Ssíriuss Allpha (keyboards and vocals).[12]


Oddities

The main themes of the band are philosophy, psychology, traditional mysticism, mythology and references to occultism. The more interesting is that the bandleader, Reinaldo José, is the venerable master of a masonic lodge, called Ars Regia Therion[13] and that in several photos he is linked in some way to the rosycross – AMORC and other orders.

There's a theory that the álbum "The Gigsaw" has a synchrony with the motion picture "Neverending Story".

Also, in an interview to the website Whiplash!, they plant the idea that the album "The Gigsaw" is some kind of an enigma, a mathematical, symbolical jigsaw where the songs, the lyrics, the artwork and every single element of the opus is there to be studied and put together to form something.[14]

Although the band left open their songs to free downloads everywhere, they achieved a great success overseas, but not in Brazil.[15]

Another link for Sub Rosa to mystic themes and secret orders is the fact that they work in a studio called "To Mega Therion", the magic nickname of Aleister Crowley.
