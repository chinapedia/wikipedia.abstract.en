Plot

The film tells about a familiar situation: a morning tram filled with passengers, which people are trying to catch to get to work. Children, seniors, a young family and neighbours are discussing the show. This is what the average Ukrainian experiences on his way to work, as the transport situation shows. The situation is shown in an interesting, bright and witty way.
