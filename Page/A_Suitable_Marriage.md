Background

The episode was very controversial. The actors Baron Klaus von Rimmer (Horst Janson) and Alfred Harris (George Innes) had events in the episode, which never got to the stage:_″The episode was considered too controversial for American TV (at any time of the day or night), even though in Britain it got an afternoon repeat in 1973. Nevertheless, events in the episode never got to the stage shown in the lower photo, which is presumably the actors messing around!″_ [4]
