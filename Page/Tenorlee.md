_TENORLEE_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz originally released on the Choice label in 1978 and rereleased by Candid on CD in 1996 with two bonus tracks.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

Scott Yanow on Allmusic said "Konitz explores ten superior standards from the swing era plus a brief unaccompanied workout ... The relaxed, often lyrical, and slightly unpredictable interpretations are quite enjoyable".[4]
