SIMON ARCHER (1956/1957 – September 1993)[1] was a newspaper journalist, press officer,[2] and a biographer of Gerry Anderson.[3]

He spent four years with local newspapers[4] as a journalist[5] and later worked for Kodak Limited in the public relations division as a company press officer. During 1986, Archer made a Kodak book containing photographs taken by Dave Lee Travis.[6] He later went to HBM Limited, where he specialized in PR consultancy. It was during 1990 that he interviewed Anderson for the _Century 21_ magazine.[7] Later on, he started work on his book called _Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Biography_.

In September 1993, Archer became involved in an accident on the M25 and consequently died at the age of thirty-six—he was making a journey to Gerry and Mary Anderson with the first printed copies of a book of his called _Fab Facts_.[8] Additionally, Archer's death meant that he failed to finish his manuscript for Gerry Anderson's biography.[9]
