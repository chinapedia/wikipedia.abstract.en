The UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 1972 took place in order to select the District of Columbia's 3 electoral votes for President of the United States. Democrat George McGovern won the District by an overwhelming margin, receiving nearly 80% of the vote.[1] Along with Massachusetts, the District of Columbia was the only place in the U.S. that voted for George McGovern in the general election.

This would be the first and, as of 2019, the only election where the Republican candidate won over 20 percent of the vote.
