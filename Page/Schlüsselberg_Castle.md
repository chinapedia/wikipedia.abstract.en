SCHLÜSSELBERG CASTLE () was a high medieval, aristocratic castle in the Franconian region of Germany. Its ruins lie on a hill above the _Pulvermühle_, a southern town quarter of Waischenfeld in the Upper Franconian county of Bayreuth in Bavaria.

The _burgstall_ of the castle is freely accessible.


Location

The castle site is located within the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park on the Schlüsselberg, a hill also called the _Galgenberg_ ("gallows hill"), in the valley of the Wiesent. The rocky spur on which the castle stood had the shape of a key (_Schlüssel_), so perhaps the castle was named after the local landmark.

Immediately above the mill of _Pulvermühle_ ("Powder Mill"), which used to be known as the _Schlüsselmühle_ ("Schlüssel Mill"), can be seen the rocks and the site or _burgstall_ of the former spur castle at a height of .

The easiest way to reach the old castle is from the eastern side of the Galgenberg. There, near a monument on the edge of the wood, a path enters the trees. Visitors should follow the path until they reach a sharp curve. This is in the neck ditch of the castle.

In the vicinity of Schlüsselberg are other castles and ruins. To the north are the ruins of Waischenfeld Castle with its tower, the Steinerner Beutel and the former Schloss Gutenbiegen near the eponymous village; to the southeast are Rabenstein Castle and the _burgställe_ of _Wal zum hohen Loch_ and Alte Veste. Further down the Wiesent valley stands Rabeneck Castle. Directly opposite the Galgenberg on the Kreuzberg was another, probably prehistorical, fortification.
