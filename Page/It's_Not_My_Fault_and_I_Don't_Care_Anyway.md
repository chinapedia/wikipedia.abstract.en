_IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND I DON'T CARE ANYWAY_ is a 2017 Canadian comedy-drama film written and directed by Chris Craddock and starring Alan Thicke, Quinton Aaron, Leah Doz and Jesse Lipscombe.[1][2][3] The film is based on Craddock’s one-man play, _Public Speaking_.[4]

Thicke stars as Patrick Spencer, a self-help guru and public speaker whose philosophy of extreme selfishness is encapsulated by the mantra "It's not my fault and I don't care anyway".[5] However, his attitude toward life is put to the test when his daughter Diana (Doz) is kidnapped and held for ransom by drug dealer Johnny Three Fingers (Jesse Lipscombe).[6]

The film marked the penultimate film role of Alan Thicke, who died December 13, 2016. He received a posthumous Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Lead Actor in a TV Drama Program or Limited Series at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards.[7] Jesse Lipscombe won a Rosie Award for Best Performance by an Alberta Actor for his work in the film.[8]

The film premiered at the Whistler Film Festival in 2016 before being distributed primarily through online streaming.[9]
