TAMATEM is a Jordanian mobile game developer and publisher, which localizes globally published mobile games and develops their own games for Arabic speakers.[1] It is the leading mobile games publisher in the MENA market.[2]


History

Tamatem ("tomatoes" in Arabic) was founded in Amman in 2013 by Hussam Hammo , who found that the app stores were lacking Arabic-based content. Previously, he had founded one of the first Arabic social networks and a gaming studio for Arabic social games. For Tamatem, they received investment from 500 Startups in Silicon Valley.[3][4][5]

Tamatem was part of batch 6 accelerator program in Mountain View, California between April 2013 and July 2013. It launched its first product Arabic Stars Quiz in July 2013 and saw 650,000 downloads in one month.[6][7] During its three-month growth hacking scheme at WeWork, Tamatem signed a publishing deal with mobile games Tapinator to localize their games for the MENA market. A round of investment in September 2013 brought them $450,000 from MENA Venture Investments and 500 Startups. The investment in the second round came from Kuwaiti fund Arzan VC.[8]

Their mobile game _Awad the Delivery King_, with the theme of food delivery in Amman, was issued in the summer of 2014. The game was produced in collaboration with the Kharabeesh animation studio. It was downloaded more than 1 million times by the end of the year, helping the company hit the six million download mark.[9] 18 months after launch, Tamatem had published 40 games with 10 million downloads and 1.4 million monthly active users.[10]

By 2015, Tamatem had 12 employees in Jordan and Silicon Valley, and a 35-game portfolio running both on Android and iOS mobile platforms. It became a flagship company in the Middle East gaming sector, topping 40,000 downloads a day and receiving investments worth $500,000 from both regional and US investors. Tamatem backers included Kai Huang, the co-creator of the _Guitar Hero_ franchise.[11] In 2015, it graduated in London as part of the Dojo Distro program.[12] Its game release _A Dumb Question_ became the #1 downloaded app in Saudi Arabia in just four days.[13]

By early 2016, Tamatem had 16 million total downloads of 35 games, of which 25 reached No 1. They had more than 2.1 million monthly active users and 350,000 daily active users.[14] In 2014-15, it had 200% growth over 12 months. In 2016, it was experiencing 40% month-on-month growth on downloads and revenue.[15] Tamatem had published 41 games by November 2016, with 35 million downloads in the Arab world.[16]

By end of 2017, Tamatem had 45 million downloads of 40 games, of which 30 reached No.1.

In 2018, Tamatem closed an investment of $2,500,000 lead by Wamda Capital, with participation from Discovery Nusantara Capital, Raed Ventures, Vision Venture Capital, and Seed Equity Venture Partners.[17]

They also published an Arabic-version of Lithuanian mobile game developers, Game Insight's Airport City. [18]


Concept

Tamatem is based on the idea that less than 1 percent of online content in app stores is accessible to Arabic users. For that reason, the company partners with popular game apps in the U.S., Chinese and European market and converts them into Arabic equivalents that its audience can understand.[19] But it also develops their own games for Arabic speakers.[20]
