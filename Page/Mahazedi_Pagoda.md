MAHAZEDI PAGODA () is a prominent Buddhist pagoda in Bago, Myanmar.


History

The pagoda was built by King Bayinnaung in 1560 to house a gold and jewel-encrusted tooth relic of the Buddha.[1][2] The tooth relic was, in fact, a fake replica from Dharmapala of Kotte, the king of the Kingdom of Kotte, who gifted the tooth, along with an alms bowl and his daughter.[3][4][5] The relics arrived in 1576.[6] In 1599, King Anaukpetlun conquered Bago and removed the relics to Taungoo.[7] In 1636, King Thalun invaded Taungoo and removed the relics to Innwa, enshrining them at the Kaunghmudaw Pagoda in Sagaing.[8] Throughout its history, the pagoda has been destroyed by several earthquakes on the Sagaing Fault, on 13 September 1564, 1583, and 8 October 1888, and completely leveled in 1930.[9][10] Mahazedi Pagoda was rebuilt in the 1950s.[11]
