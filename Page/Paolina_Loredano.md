PAOLINA LOREDANO (fl. 1656), was the Dogaressa of Venice by marriage to the Doge Carlo Contarini (r. 1655-1656).

Paolina Loredano was born to Lorenzo Loredano and married Carlo Contarini in 1600. She was known for her decision never to appear in any public ceremonial. Described as an "immensely stout woman and unusually plain-looking",[1] she was reportedly afraid that "the salutations of the populace would not partake of their usually complimentary character",[2] and that she would have been mocked because of her appearance.

Both she and her spouse were known as the benefactors of the clergy, for which their busts were placed on the facade of the church of San Vidal, sculptured by Guiseppe Guoccola.
