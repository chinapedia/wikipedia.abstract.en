Samling Institute for Young Artists is a charity based in the North East of England that supports young classically trained singers and pianists through intensive training and performance opportunities, principally through two main strands of work: the Samling Artist Programme and Samling Academy. North East-born baritone Sir Thomas Allen is the charity's Patron[1].

The Samling Artist Programme works with young professional singers and pianists at the start of their careers through week-long residential masterclasses, culminating in public masterclasses and concerts at Sage Gateshead. Samling Artist alumni also take part in an annual showcase at Wigmore Hall. A second programme, Samling Academy, works with singers at an earlier stage of their development who live or study in the North East of England.[2]


History

Businessman Roger McKechnie, who co-launched Phileas Fogg snacks, set up the Samling Foundation in 1996[3] together with Karon Wright, who has led the charity as its artistic and executive director ever since. The organisation's first event was a concert in a barn in Cumbria given by Katarina Karnéus, who had just won BBC Cardiff Singer of the World, and was followed by the launch of the Samling Artist Programme.[4]

In parallel with its musical activities, Samling supported emerging visual artists between 1997 and 2012 through a series of commissions, exhibitions and visual arts projects. Projects included 'Divining' (2000-2001), in which three emerging artists worked with 12 A-Level students towards a joint exhibition at Northumbria University. 'Land and the Samling' (2002)[5] engaged five emerging artists in a three-month residency at Kielder in Northumberland to create new work and mentor 60 A-Level students from Tyne and Wear and Northumberland over two weekends. Samling's 'Arena' project (2004)[6], supported by Nesta, set out to examine the nature of public art across Tyne and Wear and offered five major public art commissions to emerging artists. Each artist in turn mentored 12 post-16 students who also exhibited their work in public spaces at the end of the project. The project was led by Sir Antony Gormley.

From 1996 to 2011 Samling’s annual programme of outreach work brought classical music to thousands of schoolchildren aged 5–18 across the North East of England and Cumbria through workshops, residencies, presentations in schools and public performances. Samling’s artistic partners for its outreach work included Southbank Sinfonia[7] and the Berkeley Ensemble. The Samling Academy programme was then launched in 2012 to provide intensive coaching to young singers aged 14-21 who live or study in the North East.[8]

In 2018 the charity was awarded the title of Institute in recognition of the work it does in supporting young artists[9][10].


Samling Artist Programme

The Samling Artist Programme brings together emerging classical singers and pianists – usually in the final stages of their studies, or the early stages of their careers – with internationally recognised artists, directors, actors and movement and language coaches in a series of week-long, intensive, residential masterclasses. Participants are selected through a combination of recommendation and audition. The coaching is predominantly carried out in private, but the residential week ends with a public masterclass and concert.

Leaders of the Samling Artist Programme have included Sir Thomas Allen, Barbara Bonney, Yvonne Kenny, Roderick Williams, Angelika Kirchschlager, Ann Murray DBE, Joan Rodgers CBE, pianists Malcolm Martineau OBE, Helmut Deutsch and Roger Vignoles, and actors such as Richard Pasco, Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Alex Hassell.

SAMLING ARTISTS

Musicians who have completed the Samling Artist Programme are referred to as Samling Artists (known as Samling Scholars until 2014 when the name was changed to avoid confusion with Samling Academy). Over 300 Samling Artists have now taken part in the Programme.[11] As well as the experience of Samling's week-long residencies, Samling Institute also offers its Artists opportunities to return to teach as part of Samling Academy and to perform in public events such as gala concerts, collaborations with orchestras such as Royal Northern Sinfonia, and an annual showcase concert at Wigmore Hall[12].

Notable achievements by Samling Artists include first prizes in the Kathleen Ferrier Award and BBC Cardiff Singer of the World.

Samling Academy

Launched in October 2012 in partnership with Newcastle and Durham Universities and Sage Gateshead, Samling Academy extends the teaching methods of the professional Samling Artist Programme to younger singers who are at an earlier stage in their vocal development and who live or study in the North East of England. Throughout the year. participants receive coaching in vocal technique and stage skills, along with performance opportunities at Samling Institute concerts and other local musical organisations[14]. One notable feature of Samling Academy is that much of the teaching is done by Samling Artists.[15]

SAMLING FUTURES

In 2016 Samling launched the 'Samling Futures' initiative to extend the reach of Samling Academy to more young singers living in the North East of England and especially to pupils in the region's state schools.[16]


Opera

Samling has produced four operas. Mozart's _Così fan tutte_ (2005)[17] [18] and _Don Giovanni_ (2007)[19] were both directed by Sir Thomas Allen and conducted by Thomas Zehetmair, at Sage Gateshead, with Northern Sinfonia (now Royal Northern Sinfonia) and a cast of Samling Artists.

Since 2013, Samling Academy Opera has staged productions of Britten's _Albert Herring_ (2013), Ravel's _L'enfant et les sortilèges_ (2015)[20] and John Blow's _Venus and Adonis_ (2018) at Sage Gateshead and other venues in the North East. These productions have been primarily cast from young singers in Samling Academy and directed by Samling Artists.
