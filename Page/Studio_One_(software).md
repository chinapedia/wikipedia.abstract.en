STUDIO ONE is a digital audio workstation (DAW) application, used to create, record, mix and master music and other audio, with functionality also available for video. It is developed by PreSonus and available for macOS and Windows. In addition to the commercial editions of the software (known as _Studio One Artist_ and _Studio One Professional_), PreSonus also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality (known as _Studio One Prime_).


History

Early Development (2004–2011)

Studio One originally began development under the name _K2_, as a follow-up to the KRISTAL Audio Engine.[1] Although development for this follow-up began in 2004,[2] it transitioned in 2006 to a cooperation between PreSonus and KristalLabs Software Ltd., a start-up founded by former Steinberg employees Wolfgang Kundrus and Matthias Juwan.[3] Kundrus was one of the developers for initial versions of Cubase, and established concepts for the first version of Nuendo.[4] Juwan was the author of the original KRISTAL Audio Engine, wrote the specification for version 3 of the VST plug-in standard, and had also worked on multiple Steinberg products, including Cubase, Nuendo, and HALion.[5]

KristalLabs then became part of PreSonus in 2009,[6] and the former KristalLabs logo was used as the basis for the logo of Studio One.[7]

The first version of Studio One was announced on 1 April 2009 at Musikmesse,[8][9] and released on 27 September 2009.[10][11] The final update for Studio One version 1 (v1.6.5) was released in July 2011.[12][13]

Subsequent Versions (2011 – present)

Version 2 of Studio One was announced on 17 October 2011,[14][15] and released on 31 October 2011 (alongside the 2.0.2 update).[16] This release of the software introduced multiple enhancements, including integration with Celemony Melodyne, transient detection & quantization, groove extraction, multi-track comping, folder tracks, multi-track MIDI editing, an updated browser, and new plug-ins.[17]

The integration of Studio One version 2 with Melodyne was achieved via the creation of a new plug-in extension, known as Audio Random Access (ARA). This extension, developed jointly by PreSonus and Celemony, allows an audio plug-in to appear as an integrated part of the application.[18]

Version 3 of Studio One was released on 20 May 2015.[19] The new features included an arranger track, scratchpads for idea experimentation, the ability to chain together different effects and instruments, MIDI note effects, new plug-ins, and the ability to use curves in automation.[20]

Following teaser images on social media websites in the preceding weeks,[21] version 4 of Studio One was announced via a YouTube live stream event on 22 May 2018, and released simultaneously.[22][23] New features in version 4 included a chord track (with chord detection, transposition and chord substitution options), a dedicated drum editing interface, expanded drum machine & sampler plug-ins, AAF-format import/export functionality (to exchange data with other DAW applications), and support for version 2 of the ARA plug-in extension.[24] Almost exactly a year later, on 21 May 2019, this functionality was expanded further with the live stream announcement and simultaneous release of version 4.5.[25] New functionality introduced with version 4.5 included input channel gain staging and phase/polarity options, a built-in plug-in manager, M4A (AAC/ALAC) support, video export options, new grouping options, RMS metering, pre-fader metering, CPU multi-core optimization, and expanded macro features, alongside a new add-on for batch audio conversion & processing.[26][27]


Features

Standard DAW Features

In addition to its other functionality, Studio One includes fundamental features which are common across most digital audio workstation software, such as the functionality found in multi-track recorders and audio mixing consoles, plus additional functions not possible with analog recording (such as undoing previous actions, editing without loss of information, use of virtual instruments, etc.).[28]

Editions

Studio One is available in 3 editions, each with a different license cost (if any) and set of features:

Other Features

The other core features of Studio One include the following:

-   A multi-touch interface with drag-and-drop functionality and support for multiple screens, including HDPI displays.[44]

Add-Ons

Introduced with version 2.6.2 in January 2014, add-ons are optional items, developed either by PreSonus, or by third-parties, which can be acquired separately from the PreSonus store to expand the capabilities of Studio One. This can include new functionality (often known as 'extensions'), plug-ins, virtual instrument presets, loops, and other assets.[62] Example add-on functionality includes the Audio Batch Converter (released alongside version 4.5), which allows for the offline conversion and processing of multiple audio files simultaneously, including the use of both native and third-party plug-ins.[63]

Add-ons are also available to expand Studio One Artist to include other functionality from the Professional edition, including VST/AU/ReWire plug-in support, MP3 support, and Studio One Remote support.[64][65]

Studio One Remote

Studio_One_Remote_Mixing_Screenshot_iPad.png Introduced alongside Studio One version 3 in 2015, Studio One Remote is an app for wirelessly controlling Studio One via a tablet device connected to the same network.[66] Whilst originally released for the Apple iPad, Remote was subsequently released for Windows & Surface tablets (February 2016),[67] and for Android tablets (June 2017).[68] It uses PreSonus' own _UCNET_ protocol, which is used for network connectivity and remote control across multiple PreSonus products.[69]

Aspects of Studio One functionality which can be controlled via Remote include:[70]

-   The mixing console, including inserts, sends, inputs, outputs, and cue mixes.
-   The transport bar and timeline ruler, including markers and arranger sections.
-   Track macro controls.
-   Plug-in parameters.

Studio One Exchange

Studio One Exchange (previously known as PreSonus Exchange when it was first released in January 2012, alongside version 2.0.4[71][72]) is a service which allows registered Studio One users to exchange plug-in presets, MIDI files and other resources from directly within the application.[73] The Studio One Browser allows users to explore, preview, download, and review items uploaded to this service by other users, as well as upload their own.[74]
