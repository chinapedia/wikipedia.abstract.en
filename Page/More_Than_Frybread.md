Background

The title and concept of this film was heavily influenced by the post-colonial native dish frybread which has a daunting and sad history. In 1864-1968 Navajo Native Americans we forcibly evicted and endured a three-hundred mile journey from Arizona to New Mexico which was formally known as “The Long Walk”. Living on flour, sugar, salt and lard given by the government, was transformed into “Fry Bread”. This dish has been seen as a symbol of pride and has been passed down from generations.[6] When asked “ Why Frybread?” Hamilton responded “I wanted to make a movie that gave us an excuse to shoot on numerous reservations and make new friends. I thought frybread was a good thing that had the potential to bring people together. I liked the idea of a mockumentary frybread contest and wondered why there wasn't a real national frybread contest. I didn’t realize how big frybread really was."[7]

Hamilton's main goal is to change the way people view Native Americans. Due to the fact that there is a very limited amount of comedies and dramas regarding Natives in the mainstream media. He wanted to use frybread as something that could bring people and other culture together.[8] This film's success and great feedback inspired Hamilton to create a spin off of the show as a comedy called "Frybread".[9] The show was put on hold until funding could be found to support the project.

Wanting to continue to display Native Americans through various characters and narratives, Hamilton has made four contemporary films; the others are “Pete and Cleo (2010), “Blue Gap Boyz” (2008) and Turquoise Rose (2007).
