Miller is one of the few remaining original Ticket hosts. Miller has been co-hosting with Dunham on the station since 1994.[2] Miller has been nominated for and received several NAB Marconi Radio Awards throughout his career.[3]

Miller and his cohosts are the highest rated morning radio program in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.[4]

Friday Morning Scattershooting

Every Friday morning at 7:35, Miller hosts the "Friday Morning Scattershooting" Segment, where he discusses an array of topics, ranging from sports facts and stats that stand out to him, incompetent criminals, and a weekly joke. Miller adopted the "Scattershooting" style from late Dallas sports columnist, Blackie Sherrod.[6]


Feud

In January 2019, Miller was involved in a feud with Sylvester Squirrel and 2 of his associates. The Feud ended with Miller using a very low powered BB gun to frighten Squirrel and forcing him into hiding. Squirrel appeared on the Dunham & Miller morning show on January 17, 2019 at 8:40am to vow revenge. [7]
