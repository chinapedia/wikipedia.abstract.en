History

In the place where now stands Grossenrode was an ancient settlement, as evidenced by 1992 archaeological excavations, which uncovered a village with long houses and a cemetery from the Roessen period of around 4800 BC.[2]

In 978 AD, Grossenrode was first named _Nywenrode_ and the land was owned by the Fulda monastery as part of the village of Thüdinghausen. The teacher Ludwig Wöbbeking wrote in 1924 in his _Dorfchronik_ about Grossenrode that it "is a Hardenbergic creation, of around 1230. At that time, the area, which is now the _Grosserroder Feldmark_, was still a large forest. Gunther, a younger son of Hardenberg, who had no desire to enter the spiritual offices like other younger sons of noblemen, went with a number of his father's attendants; they cleared the forest as far as was necessary, and called the freed surface _Rode_ or, as was customary, with a Latin name, _Novalis_."[3]

In 1389, the Hardenbergs sold the property.[4]

From the early years of the 19th century, the Hardenberg's burial grounds were located in the Grossenrode church.[5] The 1850 cholera epidemic spared the Nörten-Hardenberg region. Wappen_Großenrode.png On 1 March 1974, Grossenrode was integrated into the city of Moringen.[6]


Notable persons

A prominent member of the Hardenberg family was Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg, better known as Novalis.
