MEYGEN (full name MEYGEN TIDAL ENERGY PROJECT) will be the worlds largest tidal energy plant, which is currently in construction.[1] The first phase of the project uses four 1.5 MW turbines with 16m rotor diameter turbines submerged on the seabed.[2] The project is owned and run by Tidal Power Scotland Limited and Scottish Enterprise.

The high speed of currents in the area, reaching up to 5 metres per second (11Â mph), made the chosen site in the Pentland Firth well suited to this type of energy generation.[3]

In October 2010 the newly named "MeyGen" tidal project from the nearby Castle of Mey and "Gen" for generation was created by a consortium of Atlantis Resources Limited, Morgan Stanley and received operational lease from the Crown Estate to a 400 MW project for 25 years.[4] Phase 1a began operations in April 2018.[5] Phase 1b is undergoing construction and commissioning with a total of 8 1.5 MW turbines planned. Phase 1c, which will be 49 turbines, will begin construction and deployment in 2018 with the rest of the project aiming to be fully deployed by 2021.[6]

In December 2016 it was announced that the first turbine had begun full power operations,[7] and all four turbines were installed by February 2017. Atlantis plans for 400 MW.[8] , the four turbines have produced 8 GWh.[9]
