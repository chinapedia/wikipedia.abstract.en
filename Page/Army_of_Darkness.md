_ARMY OF DARKNESS_ (also known as _BRUCE CAMPBELL VS. ARMY OF DARKNESS_)[1] is a 1992 American dark fantasy comedy horror film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi,[2] co-produced by Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell and co-written by Ivan Raimi. Starring Campbell and Embeth Davidtz, it is the third installment in the _Evil Dead_ franchise, and continuing from _Evil Dead II_, and follows Ash Williams (Campbell) as he is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.

The film was produced as part of a production deal with Universal Pictures after the financial success of _Darkman_. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: Tony Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were responsible for the makeup effects for Ash and Sheila, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.[3] Tom Sullivan, who had previously worked on _Within the Woods_, _The Evil Dead_, and _Evil Dead II_, also contributed to the visual effects.[4]

_Army of Darkness_ premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over its $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release, it has acquired a cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to Irvin Shapiro, who died during the film's production in 1989.


Plot

After being transported to the Middle Ages, Ash Williams is captured by Lord Arthur's men, who suspect him of being an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw are confiscated, and he is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding that Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way that Ash can return to his time is through the magical _Necronomicon Ex-Mortis._ Ash then starts his search for the _Necronomicon_. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, and he crashes into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it.

When he arrives at the _Necronomicon_{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one and has to determine which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely "Klaatu barada nikto" he forgets and tries unsuccessfully to mumble and cough "nikto". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil clone resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.

Upon his return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army, and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saves Sheila, and brings peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.

Back in the present, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present because Ash again forgot the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a Winchester rifle from the Sporting Goods department and exclaims "hail to the king, baby" before passionately kissing the woman.[5]

Original ending

In the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.[6][7][8]

Production

Development

Plans to make a third _Evil Dead_ film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of _Darkman_.[9] _Evil Dead II_ made enough money internationally that Dino De Laurentiis was willing to finance a sequel.[10] Director and script writer Sam Raimi drew from a variety of sources, including literature with _A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court_ and Jonathan Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_ and films like _The 7th Voyage of Sinbad_, _Jason and the Argonauts_, The Three Stooges, and _Conan the Barbarian_. _Evil Dead II_, according to Bruce Campbell, "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made".[11] Promotional drawings were created and published in _Variety_ during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title for the project was _Medieval Dead_, before it was later known as _Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness_.[12] The title "Army of Darkness" came from an idea by Irvin Shapiro, during the production of _Evil Dead II_.[13]

Screenplay and pre-production

Initially, Raimi invited Scott Spiegel to co-write _Army of Darkness_ because he had done a good job on _Evil Dead II_, but he was busy on rewrites for the Clint Eastwood film _The Rookie_.[14] After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called _Easy Wheels_, Sam and his brother Ivan decided to co-write the film together.[15] They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of _Darkman_.[16] After filming _Darkman_, they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script.[17] Campbell remembers, "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting".[18] Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.[19]

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.[20] _Darkman_ was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so _Army of Darkness_ became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.[21] However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer Robert Tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.[22] Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from Victor Fleming's film _Joan of Arc_ that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in _Army of Darkness_.[23] A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the _Joan of Arc_ storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.[24]

Traci Lords was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_.[25]

Principal photography

Principal photography took place between soundstage and on-location work. _Army of Darkness_ was filmed in Bronson Canyon and Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. The interior shots were filmed on an Introvision stage in Hollywood. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen.[26] Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional rear projection that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.[27] According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".[28]

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.[29] It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near Acton, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.[30] Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.[31] Money problems forced cinematographer Bill Pope to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.[32]

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.[33] Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes".[34] Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live-action skeleton puppets that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.[35]

Post-production

While Dino De Laurentiis gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.[36] Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.[37] In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with Bridget Fonda.[38] Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".[39]

Raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character which Universal needed so that they could film a sequel to _The Silence of the Lambs_.[40] The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for _Army of Darkness_' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.

For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.[41] Raimi ran into further troubles when the Motion Picture Association of America gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being killed early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.[42] In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.[43]

Music

Danny Elfman, who composed the score for _Darkman_, wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for _Army of Darkness_.[44] After the re-shoots were completed, Joseph LoDuca, who composed the music for _The Evil Dead_ and _Evil Dead II_, returned to score the film.[45] The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the Seattle Symphony.[46] The score was released during the MondoCon in Austin, Texas on October 3 and 4, 2015, on Vinyl, over Mondo Records.[47]


Reception

Box office

_Army of Darkness_ was released by Universal on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend. In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US.[48]

Critical reception

The film currently holds a 72% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.9/10;[49] making its critical reception above average but much lower than _The Evil Dead_ and _Evil Dead II_, which received 95% and 98% respectively.[50][51] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[52] Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, "The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as _Evil Dead II_, however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled."[53] In her review for _The New York Times_, Janet Maslin praised, "Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook."[54] Desson Howe, in this review for _The Washington Post_ praised the film's style: "Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, Tony Gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative."[55] However, _Entertainment Weekly_ gave the film a "C+" rating and wrote, "This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland Hollywood extras. By the time _Army of Darkness_ turns into a retread of _Jason and the Argonauts_, featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."[56]

Accolades

_Army of Darkness_ won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film (1994). It was also nominated for Best Make-Up. _Army of Darkness_ was nominated for the Grand Prize at Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, and won the Golden Raven at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film in 1993. The film also won the Critics' Award at Fantasporto, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award in the category of Best Film in 1993. It was also nominated for Best Film at Sitges, the Spanish International Film Festival.


Potential sequel

In March 2013, shortly before the release of _Evil Dead_, a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next _Evil Dead_ film will be _Army of Darkness 2_. Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash.[57][58] At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell and Fede Alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's _Evil Dead 2_ and Raimi's _Army of Darkness 2_ to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia.[59] On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel.[60] Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel.[61] Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.[62][63]

In July 2014, Campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a TV series with him as the star. The ten-episode season of _Ash vs Evil Dead_[64][65] premiered on Starz on October 31, 2015, with the pilot co-written and directed by Sam Raimi.[66] Due to legal issues with Universal, the events from _Army of Darkness_ could not specifically be mentioned in the first season; it was later resolved and the events from that film were mentioned in the second season.[67] In addition to Campbell, the series stars Dana DeLorenzo, Ray Santiago,[68] and Lucy Lawless.
