Business Career

She founded a security company Securico from humble beginnings in Zimbabwe in 1998[4] In an interview she said that the idea to form Securico was conceived out of the need to earn a livelihood but critically to revolutionarise the male dominated security industry. Speaking to a Zimbabwean newspaper she said,

  I thought there was a gap in the industry. Companies that were there were not living up to the needs of the clients. The industry was renowned for wild cat strikes and guards generally were perceived as the lowly-paid in any sector. I wanted to change the perceptions and create a niche in which people could carve out a career and I knew I needed to go in with a different approach and that approach was going to make the difference , the people had to be key or central feature of the vision.

Securico is the first Zimbabwean manned security company to be certified to the internationally acclaimed ISO9001:2008 Quality Management System.[5]
