Born in London, she was the daughter of the Jewish actor and singer John Isaacs (1791-1830), who trained her for the stage.[1] She first appeared in _The Barn Burners_ at the City Theatre in London in 1835 and in 1836 was in the burletta _Riquet with the Tuft_ at the Olympic Theatre.[2] In 1838 she played the central role of the young chimney sweep in Richard Brinsley Peake's _The Climbing Boy: A Comic Drama_.[3]

She toured with the Distin family and sung under the name 'Miss Zuchelli' in 1838. With a voice "of great compass and sweetness", she acted at Drury Lane taking the leading roles in English operas during 1846, and was Directress of Operas at the Strand Theatre from 1852 to 1853, and again in 1855. She played in _The Mountain Sylph_ at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden in 1852.[4]

She was the first Leila in _Satanella_ at Covent Garden in 1858. In 1860 she appeared at the Pavilion Theatre as Amina in _La sonnambula_, as Cinderella in _La Cenerentola_ by Rossini, as Marie, the lead role in _The Daughter of the Regiment_, and as Lucia in _Lucia di Lammermoor_.[5] She often appeared in concerts and operas with Sims Reeves.[6]

Her husband was Thomas Roberts (c1831-1876), a non-Jewish dental surgeon and acting manager of the Princess's Theatre.[7][8]

She is buried in the Actors' Acre in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey with her husband, her infant son Alfred Roberts who died aged three weeks, her daughter Florence Mosely (1857-1925) and her grandson George Henry Mosely (1887-1969).

The National Portrait Gallery in London holds two portraits of Isaacs in its collection.[9]
