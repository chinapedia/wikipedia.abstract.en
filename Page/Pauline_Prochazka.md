PAULINE PROCHAZKA (1842â€“1930) was the founder of the Water Colour Society of Ireland.


Life

Baroness Pauline Prochazka was the daughter of Ottokar, Baron Prochazka, Field Marshal Lieutenant in the Austrian Army,[1] and Leopoldine Henrika Gersch, step-daughter of the late Baron Stuart de Decies, of Dromana, County Waterford.[2][3] Although born in Prague, she left Bohemia very young and was brought up in Ireland.[4]

She founded the Water Colour Society of Ireland in 1870 with a group of six women in Waterford. It was founded initially as the Amateur Drawing Society. Eight years later it was renamed to the "Irish Fine Art Society".[5][6][7]

Prochazka was an accomplished and award-winning water-colourist and became manager of the Royal Irish School of Art Needlework in 1886.[8] She ran the school for twelve years.[9]

She was a niece to Sir Charles Wheeler Cuffe[10] and thus related to the illustrator Charlotte, Lady Wheeler-Cuffe.[11] She lived in Lyrath house in County Kilkenny.[12][13] Her death was announced in the Irish Times of April 24, 1930.[14]
