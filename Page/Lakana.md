Madagascar_-_Traditional_fishing_pirogue.jpg from Madagascar]] _LAKANA_, also known as _LA'KANA_ or _LAKA_, are traditional outrigger canoes of the Malagasy people of Madagascar. It is a single-outrigger canoe with a dugout main hull. It was traditionally rigged with the Austronesian crab claw sail, but most modern _lakana_ are equipped with motor engines. The boat is often referred to by the general French term "pirogue", which can include boats with no outriggers.[1] The technology was adapted in neighboring East Africa, like the Tanzanian _ngalawa_ and the Fulani _laana_.[2][3]
