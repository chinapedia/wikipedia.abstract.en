'''Malangi ''' was a dacoit during the colonial occupation of Punjab. He was known as Robinhood in his native district of Kasur. Punjab has a folklore tradition of appreciating the role of dacoits such as Malangi who defied the authorities of the period and sided with common people. Other such well-known Punjab 'Robin Hoods' were Nizam Lohar, Imam Din Gohavia and Jagga Jatt, who were considered folk heroes by people during the early part of the 20th century.[1] Songs of the bravery of these dacoits are sung even today. One song sung in Punjab that reflects the prominence of _Malangi_ goes like this: Raati raaj Malangi da Din nu raaj Farangi da

(Whereas the British rule in the day It is Malangi who governs the night) [2]


Background and Early life

Malangi lived in a village known as Lakho in the district of Kasur in present-day Punjab, Pakistan. His father passed away when he was just six months old. The land which his father left for Malangi was captured by the feudal lords who dominated the area. Malangi's mother was helpless after the death of her husband, and she married a Sikh despite being a Muslim herself. When he realized that his land had been appropriated by the landlords of his village, Malangi fought to reclaim it. The landlords, who were British-appointed Lumbardar managed to isolate Malangi in the local community, and in anger he became a dacoit.[3]
