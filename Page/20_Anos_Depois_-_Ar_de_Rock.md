_20 ANOS DEPOIS - AR DE ROCK_ (literally _Air of Rock_, meaning "a rock look"; a pun on hard rock: 20 Years Later) is a compilation album released by Portuguese rock singer Rui Veloso. The album was released in 2000.[1]

The disc was recorded in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of his first album _Ar de Rock_ released in 1980.[2]

The album features mostly Portuguese artists including Xutos & Pontapés, Clã, Ala dos Namorados and some more, which recorded the original songs with the first mock-up themes. Other artists included the Portuguese-descended Nuno Bettencourt and Brazilian singers including Os Paralamas do Sucesso and Barão Vermelho. The last three are not included in the previous album.[3]
