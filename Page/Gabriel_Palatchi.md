Career

In 2010, Palatchi released his first album, a solo effort called _Diario de Viaje_ (_Travel Diary_), chosen as one of the best Latin Jazz CD’s of the year by Jazz FM Toronto.[7] _Latin Jazz Net_ noted how the album "works the idioms and metaphors of various not-so-disparate cultures into a fine homogenous mixture that is both delightful and also quite full of surprise... a fresh look at the popular musical motifs of Argentina, Perú, Colombia, Mexico and Cuba... The real stand out work on this album is how Palatchi re-imagines traditional musical art forms."[8] _Ejazznews_ called the album an "impressive debut" and Palatchi one of the "new young lions of Latin jazz."[9] _Rolling Stone_ welcomed him back home in Argentina."[10]

In 2013, he released his second album, _Caja Musical_ (_Music Box_).[11] _World Music Report_ noted a move away from "excessive soloing" to facilitation in arrangements so that the "color of Latin America informs his music in an authentic manner."[12]

In 2015, he released his third album _Trivolution_ with as the "Gabriel Palatchi Trio" with Jose ("Chema") Gonzalez on drums and Kerry Galloway on bass. The trio is touring Argentina, Mexico, Canada, and Europe, starting off in Toronto in June 2015.[13] By this third album, _All About Jazz_ concluded, "revolutionary music is becoming more of the norm... ensuring this gifted musician, a unique place in the ever-changing landscape of jazz."[14]

In 2017, Palatchi recorded _Made in Canada - Live_, which _Latin Jazz_ called "viscerally exciting" performances of Palatchi's "vivid compositions."[15]
