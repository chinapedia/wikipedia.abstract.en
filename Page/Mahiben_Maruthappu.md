MAHIBEN MARUTHAPPU (born 1988) is a British physician, academic researcher, health policy specialist and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder of Cera, a tech-enabled homecare company, and was the first president of the United Kingdom Medical Students' Association (UKMSA).[1] He co-founded the National Health Service (NHS) Innovation Accelerator (NIA), a program that supports and accelerates the adoption of new healthcare treatments and technologies, and served as NHS England's Innovation Adviser. He has published more than 100 research papers in peer-reviewed journals.[2][3]

Maruthappu led the 2016 study that linked the global economic crisis to 260,000 additional cancer deaths in a group of developed countries while demonstrating the protective effect of universal health coverage.[4] The study, published in _The Lancet_,[5] was ranked as one of the most influential research papers of 2016.[6]

In November 2018, Maruthappu was named on the Financial Times' list of the 'Top 100 minority ethnic leaders in technology.'[7]


Early life and education

Maruthappu was born in London in 1988. He studied preclinical medicine at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a triple first class [8], and as a student ran several charities, including CONTACT and Medic to Medic. He studied clinical medicine at Green Templeton College, Oxford and in his fifth year (2010) founded the United Kingdom Medical Students' Association (UKMSA), which provided free educational resources to over 40,000 students.[9] He was also a Kennedy Scholar in Global Health at Harvard University, where he conducted research at Harvard's Center for Surgery and Public Health.[10]


Career

Maruthappu began his career as a physician at Ealing Hospital in 2013. He later practised at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. In 2014, he was appointed scholar at National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, where he focused on the use of structured feedback in surgery.[11] He also advised the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Swiss government.[12]

Maruthappu began to advise Simon Stevens, the chief executive officer of NHS England, in 2014.[13] He co-developed the plan for the NHS, the Five Year Forward View, and established a number of key NHS programmes.[14] He led NHS England's contribution to the Government's Childhood Obesity Plan and originated the NHS Sugar Tax.[15]

Whilst at the NHS, Maruthappu advised on £100 billion in health spending focused on innovation, technology and prevention, and in 2015, he co-founded the NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA), a programme that led to the development of the first NHS innovation tariff, a national reimbursement mechanism for medical technologies and digital health products. It benefited three million people within its first six months.[16][17]

After his mother fell and fractured part of her back, Maruthappu faced difficulties in arranging and managing required home care. In a 2017 interview, he said: “It showed me first hand some of the challenges an individual can experience if they’re trying to organise or care for a loved one themselves.”[18] He subsequently co-founded Cera, a social care provider that uses technology and artificial intelligence to accelerate the process of matching appropriate care workers with patients and allows families to book carers for relatives and track their medical care.[19][20]


Boards, affiliations, and related endeavours

Maruthappu co-founded the NHS's £450 million Workplace Wellness Programme and the Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP), which as of 2017 had been rolled out to half of the population in England . He was formerly on the board of directors for Digital Health London. He lectures undergraduate students at Cambridge University, and is a practising physician in North Central London.
