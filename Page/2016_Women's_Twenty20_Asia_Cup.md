The 2016 WOMEN'S TWENTY20 ASIA CUP was the sixth edition of the ACC Women's Asia Cup, organized by the Asian Cricket Council. It took place from 26 November to 4 December 2016, in Thailand, and was the second edition played as a 20-over tournament.[1] Matches were played at the Asian Institute of Technology Ground and the Terdthai Cricket Ground (both located in Bangkok).[2]

India were undefeated during the tournament, and beat Pakistan by 17 runs in the final. Along with India and Pakistan, four other teams took part – Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, hosts Thailand, and Nepal (the latter two teams qualifying through the Women's World Cup Asia Qualifier).[3] Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka had Twenty20 International (T20I) status, with matches featuring two of these sides being played as such. Matches featuring either Nepal or Thailand did not have T20I status.
