LIST OF CRYPTOGRAPHERS.


Pre twentieth century

-   Al-Kindi, 9th century Arabic polymath and originator of frequency analysis.
-   Athanasius Kircher, attempts to decipher crypted messages
-   Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, wrote a standard book on cryptography
-   Ibn Wahshiyya: published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt magic formulas.[1]
-   John Dee, wrote an occult book, which in fact was a cover for crypted text
-   Ibn 'Adlan: 13th-century cryptographer who made important contributions on the sample size of the frequency analysis.
-   Duke of Mantua Francesco I Gonzaga is the one who used the earliest example of homophonic Substitution cipher in early 1400s.[2][3]
-   Ibn al-Durayhim: gave detailed descriptions of eight cipher systems that discussed substitution ciphers, leading to the earliest suggestion of a "tableau" of the kind that two centuries later became known as the "Vigenère table".
-   Ahmad al-Qalqashandi: Author of _Subh al-a 'sha_, a fourteen volume encyclopedia in Arabic, which included a section on cryptology. The list of ciphers in this work included both substitution and transposition, and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each plaintext letter.
-   Charles Babbage, UK, 19th century mathematician who, about the time of the Crimean War, secretly developed an effective attack against polyalphabetic substitution ciphers.
-   Leone Battista Alberti, polymath/universal genius, inventor of polyalphabetic substitution (more specifically, the Alberti cipher), and what may have been the first mechanical encryption aid.
-   Giovanni Battista della Porta, author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis.
-   Étienne Bazeries, French, military, considered one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts. Best known for developing the "Bazeries Cylinder" and his influential 1901 text _Les Chiffres secrets dévoilés_ ("Secret ciphers unveiled").

It is likely that he did not invent the cipher named after him, as other substitution ciphers were in use well before his time.

-   Auguste Kerckhoffs, known for contributing cipher design principles.
