LAKSHMI KANNAN, also known by her Tamil pen name KAAVERI, (born 1947) is an Indian poet, novelist and short story writer. Writing in Tamil, she translates her works into English.[1][2] Her poetry has received positive reviews in the Indian press.[3]


Biography

Born in Mysore in south-western India on 13 August 1947, Kannan graduated in English language and literature at the University of Delhi before earning a PhD from Calcutta's Jadavpur University in 1977. In addition to her writing, Kannan has spend at least 15 years teaching English.[4] In 1993, she was writer in residence at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. Thereafter, career assignments have included fellow of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla, India, convenor for Tamil Bhasha Samiti at the K.K. Birla Foundation, Dehli, scholar in residence at the American Studies Research Centre in Hyderabad, group chief, Bharat Soka Gakkai, member of the governing body of the Poetry Society of India and member of the jury for the Commonwealth Writers Prize, Eurasia.[5] She has also been an honorary fellow in writing at the University of Iowa and British Council visitor at the University of Cambridge.[6]


Publications

Kannan published three volumes of poetry in English between 1974 and 1985, three volumes of short stories between 1986 and 1993, and one novel in 1998. She is particularly celebrated for her sharp, brief verses concerned with a woman's search for identity, the place of nature in human experience, or cultural identity. They frequently examine how women are viewed in Indian society, adopting an increasingly feminist tone. Her short stories are her own translations of their Tamil originals. They focus on the experiences of middle-class women in both India and abroad. There is however one exception in _Muniyakka_ which deals with the lower classes.[7] In her novel _Going Home_, also translated from the original Tamil, Kannan tells the nostalgic story of a housewife in Dehli who yearns for her affluent past. The tale constantly evokes the hypocrisy of cultured Tam Brahm communities.[8]
