History

IFUSCO was created in 1984 in Göttingen by local students of Finno-Ugric studies, to facilitate contact between other students. The conference was initially a small gathering that mainly served as a forum and as a way of exchanging information. The first IFUSCO had 26 participants from the Netherlands (Groningen) and Germany (Göttingen, Hamburg). Later it has turned into a conference format where lectures are given by and for students, and every year it is organized in a different city by a different university.

There have been 32 IFUSCOs, as in 2001 the conference was canceled. The first conference on the territory of Russia was held in 1999 in Syktyvkar.
