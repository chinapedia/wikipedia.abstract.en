The BASILICA OF ST PETER AND ST PAUL is a Roman Catholic minor basilica located in Nadur, Gozo in Malta. The church also serves as the parish church of the village of Nadur.


History

The parish of Nadur was established by the Bishop of Malta Davide Cocco Palmeri on 28 April 1688. Since the main church was not yet constructed, the church of the Immaculate Conception in Qala—by then still part of the parish territory—became the parish church for some years. The construction of the present church was started on 28 September 1760 and the design is attributed to the Maltese architect Giuseppe Bonici. Construction on the church finished on 12 May 1867. The third Collegiate chapter of Gozo was established on 19 September 1894.[1]

This church is one of the most beautiful churches on the island. In 1907, a refurbishment programme took place to construct the aisles, dome and façade based on the Italian Renaissance design of Prof. F.S. Sciortino. The ceiling, depicting episodes connected with St. Peter and Paul, was painted by Lazzaro Pisani (hailing from Ħaż-Żebbuġ), while the architectural decorations are the work of the Italian Pio Cellini. Principal force behind all these new projects was Archpriest Martin Camilleri. The church became a minor Basilica on 26 June 1967.[2]
