_SATUREJA_ is a genus of aromatic plants of the family Lamiaceae, related to rosemary and thyme. It is native to North Africa, southern and southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. A few New World species were formerly included in _Satureja_, but they have all been moved to other genera. Several species are cultivated as culinary herbs called SAVORY, and they have become established in the wild in a few places.[1][2]


Description

_Satureja_ species may be annual or perennial. They are low-growing herbs and subshrubs, reaching heights of .

The leaves are long, with flowers forming in whorls on the stem, white to pale pink-violet.


Ecology and cultivation

_Satureja_ species are food plants for the larva of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Caterpillars of the moth _Coleophora bifrondella_ feed exclusively on winter savory (_S. montana_).

Savory may be grown purely for ornamental purposes; members of the genus need sun and well-drained soil.


Uses

leaves]] Both summer savory (_Satureja hortensis_) and winter savory (_Satureja montana_) are used to flavor food. The former is preferred by cooks but as an annual is only available in summer; winter savory is an evergreen perennial.

Savory plays an important part in Armenian, Georgian, Bulgarian and Italian cuisine, particularly when cooking beans. It is also used to season the traditional Acadian stew known as __. Savory is also a key ingredient in _sarmale_, a stuffed cabbage dish in traditional Romanian cuisine. The modern spice mixture Herbes de Provence has savory as one of the principal ingredients.

In Azerbaijan, savory is often incorporated as a flavoring in black tea.

    -   The heterogeneous mixture of the _Satureja hortensis L._ essential oil in water serves as a natural herbicide. The addition of this mixture inhibits the root elongation of weeds which reduces the weed's root-to-shoot ratio. This further reduces the weed's cell division and inhibits its germination, growth, and physiological processes.[6]

Etymology

The etymology of the Latin word "satureia" is unclear. Speculation that it is related to _saturare_,[9] to _satyr_,[10] or to za'atar[11] is not well supported. The ancient Hebrew name is ṣathrá צתרה.
