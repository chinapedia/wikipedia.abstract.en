ELDER CREEK is a major stream in Tehama County, California and a tributary of the Sacramento River. It originates at the confluence of its North, Middle and South Forks, which begin in the Mendocino National Forest, and flows [1] east to its confluence with the Sacramento River about a mile (1.6 km) east of Gerber and north of Tehama.
