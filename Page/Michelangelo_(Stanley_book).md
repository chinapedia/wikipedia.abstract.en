Reception

Reviews of _Michelangelo_ include by _Booklist_ that wrote "One of the most pleasing things about Stanley's books is the way her sturdy texts stand up to her strong artwork. That's particularly evident here .."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ that stated "she (Stanley) has crafted a picture-book biography that is as readable as it is useful."[2] _Kirkus Reviews_ in a star review wrote "she weaves all the major elements of Michelangeloâ€™s long and astonishingly creative life into a compelling, anecdote-rich narrative .. This handsome, affordable, lavishly illustrated and wonderfully readable book has broad appeal."[3] and _Publishers Weekly_ called it a "panoramic telling of his life story", concluding "The dislocating effect (Stanley's use of digital art composition) blemishes an otherwise outstanding work."[4]

_The Horn Book Magazine_ review included "Stanley has indeed captured in both words and pictures the essence of Michelangelo, man of the Renaissance-sculptor, painter, architect."[5]
