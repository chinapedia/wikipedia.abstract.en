_A NIGHT AT COUNT BASIE'S_ is a live album by vocalist Joe Williams recorded at Count Basie's nightclub in Harlem in 1956 and released on the Vanguard label.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Buce Eder stated " This may possibly have been, as claimed, the first authorized commercial recording ever done from a neighborhood bar (complete with the sounds of telephones, cash registers, etc., in the distant background), and the results are priceless ... The sound is remarkably clean and sharp, which makes the fact that the band was incredibly "on" that night even more appreciated".[3]
