They are operating as part of the summer collegiate wood bat league known as the California Collegiate League. It began operations in 2016 as members of the Great West League. They play their home games at McBean Stadium in Lincoln. The Potters replaced the Lodi Crushers and Sacramento Stealth, who went inactive for 2017. [1]


History

The Potters were named for the former minor league baseball franchise that played in the Placer-Nevada Baseball League and that was founded by newspaper editor Allen "Scoop" Thurman of the Colfax Record back in 1923. They won PNL championships in 1926, 1941, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1957 and played until 1968. They played under several different name such as Cubs, Tigers, Merchants, and eventually the Potters. They had sponsorship from Gladding McBean, a terra cotta and clay manufacturing company located in Lincoln that replaced much of the friezes and other ornamental decorative pieces that were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The sewer pipe and roofing tile manufacturer was founded in 1875 and still operates today as one of California's oldest companies. [2]

On October 4, 2018, the Potters announced that they were departing the Great West League to play in the California Collegiate League for 2019 and beyond after the GWL announced that they were ceasing operations. [3]
