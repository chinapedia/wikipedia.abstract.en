SOLÓRZANO'S VELVET WORM (_Peripatus solorzanoi_) is a species of velvet worm in the Peripatidae family.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy

The holotype was discovered by herpetologist Alejandro Solórzano in Guayacán de Siquirres, Costa Rica, in 1996. Morera-Brenes and Monge-Nájera subsequently described it in 2010. The generic name _Peripatus_ is derived from the Ancient Greek _peripatos_, meaning "walking about". The specific name _solorzanoi_ is in honour of its discoverer.[4]
