LEJUAN SIMMONS (born 7 April 1993) is a striker who plays for Robin Hood F.C. and the Bermuda national football team[1]


Career

Lejaun Simmons started off his career at major Bermudan side Devonshire Cougars, being in the youth team for 2 years before being promoted to the first team in 2011. However, at the age of 18 he decided to move to England and successfully trialed at Ilkeston F.C., where, except for a short loan at Mickleover Sports F.C., he has remained for 4 years. In July 2015, ahead of the 2015/16 season, it was reported that he was taking a trial at Scottish club St Mirren F.C.,[2] but the move did not materialize.

In August 2017, he came back in Bermuda, to Robin Hood F.C. where he signed a 3 years contract.[3]


International career

Lejaun made his debut against Haiti on 9 September 2012, in the CONCACAF Gold Cup.[4] He scored his first goal just 2 days later against Saint Martin in the same competition.
