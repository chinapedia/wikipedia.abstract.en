On the Island of Jamaica, the MAROON COUNCIL is the executive body with administrative powers and obligations for the Maroon communities.[1][2] Maroon Council members are appointed by the Colonel-in-Chief (Colonel), while the Colonel is officially elected by the community as the Head of Government.[3] Each Maroon Community (Accompong, Nanny Town, Charles Town, Trelawny Town, and Scotts Hall) has its own independent Maroon Council with legislative authority.[4]
