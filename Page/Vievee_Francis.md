Awards

Writing for the judging committee for the Kingsley and Kate Tufts Poetry Awards, Don Share, editor of _Poetry_ magazine praised _Forest Primeval_ as “an intense work, dark … Dantean … dreamlike in its visions.... Francis is reclaiming modernist and feminist legacies of poetry, and it takes great courage to do that.”[8]
