THEO is a Ukrainian fashion brand based in Kiev, launched in 2014 by THEO DEKAN (stylist, musician,[1] artist,[2] photographer, columnist, showman,[3] hairdresser[4] and designer[5]) in partnership with OKSANA DENIS.[6]


THEO DNA

THEO develops three main areas of products created:

1.  _ironic_ - feminine ironically plus bright colors;
2.  _straight_ - concise, based on the male silhouette images with elements of deconstruction;
3.  _eccentric_ - intriguing and bold images for the evening.


BRAND's history and timeline

First appearance of the brand on Ukrainian fashion stage with FW15/16 collection was marked by "NOWFASHION"[7] and received positive feedback from Tony Glenville and Hillary Alexander who visited the show. The lacquer jacket from the debut collection was worn by Nadja Auermann for VOGUE cover story. Flower like white wrap dress by Theo Dekan worn by Alina Baikova was used for MBKFD (Ukraine's biannual international fashion week) promo campaign.
