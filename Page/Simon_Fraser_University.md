SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY (SFU) is a public research university in British Columbia, Canada, with three campuses: Burnaby (main campus), Surrey, and Vancouver. The main Burnaby campus on Burnaby Mountain, located from downtown Vancouver, was established in 1965 and comprises more than 30,000 students and approximately 950 faculty members. The Burnaby campus is on the territory of the Squamish (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw), Tsleil-Waututh, Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm), and Kwikwetlem First Nations; the Vancouver campus is on Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam territories; and the Surrey campus is on territories shared by the Kwiketlem, Musqueam, Katzie, Kwantlen, Qayqayt, and Stó:lō peoples.[1]

Undergraduate and graduate programs at SFU operate on a year-round, three-semester schedule,[2] and it is the only Canadian university which competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). SFU was the first Canadian research university with U.S. accreditation (earning it in 2016)[3] and is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.[4] To date, SFU faculty and alumni have won 43 fellowships to the Royal Society of Canada, three Rhodes Scholarships and one Pulitzer Prize.[5][6]


History

Sfu_1967.jpg Gordon_m_shrum.jpg

Founding

Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1962 report entitled _Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future_, by John B. Macdonald. He recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland and the British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent on March 1, 1963 for the establishment of the university in Burnaby.[7] The university was named after Simon Fraser, a North West Company fur trader and explorer. The original name of the school was Fraser University, but was changed because the initials "FU" evoked the profane phrase "fuck you".[8][9] In May of the same year, Gordon M. Shrum was appointed as the university's first chancellor. From a variety of sites that were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester[10] with 2,500 students.

Early activism

The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today's separate departments.[11]

Coat of arms

The school's original coat of arms was used from the university's inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms. The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one.[12] In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books. In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.[13]

The university today

SFU's president is Andrew Petter, whose term began on September 1, 2010. Petter succeeded Dr. Michael Stevenson, who held a decade-long post as president from 2000 to 2010.[14]

In 2009, SFU became the first Canadian university to be accepted into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[15] Starting in the 2011-2012 season, SFU competed in the NCAA's Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) and has now transitioned all 19 Simon Fraser Clan teams into the NCAA.

SFU has the highest publication impact among Canadian comprehensive universities and the highest success rates per faculty member in competitions for federal research council funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC).[16] In 2007, the University began offering dual and double degree programs by partnering with international universities, such as a dual computing-science degree through partnership with Zhejiang University in China and a double Bachelor of Arts degree in conjunction with Australia's Monash University.[17]

On September 9, 2015, SFU celebrated its 50th anniversary. Over its 50 years, the university educated over 130,000 graduates.[18]


Academics

There are eight faculties at Simon Fraser University:

-   Faculty of Applied Science
-   Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
-   Beedie School of Business
-   Faculty of Communication, Art and Technology
-   Faculty of Education
-   Faculty of Environment
-   Faculty of Health Sciences
-   Faculty of Science

Undergraduate

In the academic year 2010–11, SFU had 29,697 undergraduates, with 14,911 of them being full-time and 14,786 part-time.[19] The university has grown in recent years, recently achieving an alumni population of over 100,000. It had 946 faculty members and 3,403 staff.[20] In fall semester 2012, 4,269 International students enrolled, making up 17% of the undergraduate student body, one of the highest among Canadian universities. The majority of these international students (60%) come from Mainland China [and Hong Kong (6%)] and South Korea (6%).[21] SFU's undergraduate student union is known as the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS).

Graduate

The university enrolls over 5,000 graduate students in a wide range of full-time and part-time academic programs.[22] International students constitute 20% of the graduate student population as a whole and 30–40% in science and technology areas. A Graduate Student Society[23] supports and advocates for graduate students at the university.

Continuing education

SFU also offers non-credit programs and courses to adult students. , SFU Continuing Studies offers more than 300 courses and 27 certificate and diploma programs, mostly delivered either online or part-time from SFU's downtown Vancouver or Surrey campus. Continuing Studies also manages a part-time degree completion program, called SFU NOW: Nights or Weekends, for working adults pursuing a bachelor's degree.[24]

Staff unions

Sfu-maggie-benson.jpg Teaching assistants, tutor markers, sessional instructors, and language instructors at SFU are unionized. The union, the Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU), is independent. Faculty and lecturers are members of the Faculty Association. Staff are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Administrative and Professional Staff Association (APSA), or Polyparty. A few positions at the university such as some in Human Resources and senior administrative positions fall outside of the five associations or unions above.

Under the current president, Andrew Petter, SFU's administration has incurred a number of grievances and bad faith bargaining judgments.[25][26][27] During their most recent rounds of bargaining, both the TSSU and CUPE local 3338 resorted to job action, and the BC Labour Relations Board found SFU's administration to be bargaining in bad faith with the CUPE local.[28] Conflicts since then include unpaid wages (in Fall 2013, 18% of TSSU members reported that they were not paid on the first payday; by the term's third payday, some members still had not received their wages),[29] and a health plan, redundant with the provincial health plan available to all international students after their first three months in-province and costing double a prior plan's cost, in which international students are automatically enrolled.[30]

Reputation

Simon Fraser University has placed in post-secondary school rankings. In the 2018 _Academic Ranking of World Universities_ (ARWU) rankings, the university ranked 301–400 in the world and 13–18 in Canada.[31] The 2019 _Times Higher Education World University Rankings_ placed Simon Fraser 251–300 in the world, and 11–14 in Canada.[32] The 2020 _QS World University Rankings_ ranked the university 314th in the world and thirteenth in Canada.[33] In _U.S. News & World Report_ 2019 global university rankings, the university placed 288th , and 12th in Canada.[34] In _Maclean's_ 2019 rankings, the university placed first in their comprehensive university category, and ninth in their reputation ranking for Canadian universities.[35] Simon Fraser University was ranked in spite of having opted out from participation in Maclean's graduate survey since 2006.[36]

Simon Fraser also placed in a number of rankings that evaluated the employment prospects of graduates. In _QS's_ 2019 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 301–500 in the world, and 10–17 in Canada.[37]

Research

In 2017, Simon Fraser University received a sponsored research income (external sources of research funds) of C$138.964 million, the 17th highest in Canada. In the same year, the university's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $156,300, while graduates averaged $30,900.[38]

Simon Fraser's research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Simon Fraser 378th in the world, and 16th in Canada.[39] In University Ranking by Academic Performance's 2018–19 rankings, the university placed 362nd in the world, and 15th in Canada.[40]

SFU also works with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities. These include Bamfield Marine Station, a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology; TRIUMF, a powerful cyclotron used in subatomic physics and chemistry research. SFU is also a partner institution in Great Northern Way Campus Ltd in Vancouver. In March 2006, SFU approved an affiliation agreement with a private college for international students to be housed adjacent to its Burnaby campus. This new college named Fraser International College, which was in the Multi Tenant Facility (now renamed as "Discovery 2 Building") located in Discovery Parks Trust SFU site,[41] is now moved into "Discovery 1 Building" after Discovery Parks Trust returned the building to Simon Fraser University. The MODAL Research Group, based at Simon Fraser, partners with multiple Canadian universities and arts organizations to carry out multi-disciplinary research in the arts with an emphasis on the study of artistic learning and engagement.[42]


Campuses

SFU_Aerial.jpg Simon Fraser University has three campuses, each located in different parts of Greater Vancouver. SFU's original campus is located in Burnaby, atop Burnaby Mountain. The Vancouver campus consists of multiple buildings in downtown Vancouver and the Surrey campus is located inside Central City Shopping Centre.

The downtown campus has expanded to include several other buildings in recent years, including the Segal Graduate School of Business. In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts[43] moved into the Woodward's redevelopment, known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts.

SFU's three campuses are all accessible by public transit. The Vancouver campus is a block away from the Waterfront SkyTrain station while the Surrey campus is adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. The Burnaby campus is linked to the Production Way–University, Burquitlam, and Sperling–Burnaby Lake SkyTrain stations by frequent shuttle bus service.

Burnaby campus

Simon-fraser-university-night.jpg SFU_AQ_Gardens.jpg Sfu-academic-quadrangle-hall.jpg Blusson_Hall.jpg TASC1.jpg The main campus is located atop Burnaby Mountain, at an elevation of 365 metres, overlooking the Burrard inlet to the north. All major departments in the university are housed at the Burnaby campus. The library on the main campus is called the W. A. C.

Along with the UniverCity development agreement, residents of UniverCity are also allowed to borrow books from the library.

SFU also has a Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which holds many exhibits on lease from the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria. The exhibits are created by students as part of the museum studies courses offered in the Department of Archaeology. Archaeological collections arising from excavations and other research by faculty, staff and students are also housed in the museum.

The SFU Library's Digital Collections provide internet access to digitized documents from a number of archival collections, such as Harrison Brown's Xi'an Incident collection,[48] and the history of British Columbia and Western Canada in general, including documents from the Doukhobor migration from the Russian Empire to Saskatchewan and then to British Columbia assembled for donation to the university by John Keenlyside.[49] Other highlights of the collection include The Vancouver Punk Collection, which includes more than 1200 posters as well as photographs, zines, and ephemera, the British Columbia Postcards Collection, and more than 9800 editorial cartoons from Canadian newspapers.[50]

Simon Fraser University's art galleries include: SFU Gallery on the Burnaby campus (established 1970), Audain Gallery at the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts in Vancouver (established 2010), and Teck Gallery at Harbour Centre in Vancouver (established 1989). SFU Galleries stewards the Simon Fraser University Art Collection, that includes, in its holdings of over 5,500 works, significant regional and national art works spanning the last century.

The Bill Reid Centre for Northwest Coast Art Studies at SFU houses a collection of 50,000 objects, primarily digital images and digitized textual documents, which document the art, culture and history of different First Nations cultures of the Northwest Coast. The collection includes explorers' drawings, sketches, paintings and original photography.[51]

Residences

The SFU Burnaby campus provides residence to 1766 SFU and FIC students in 6 different areas, all located on the western side of the campus.

-   THE TOWERS (officially opened in fall of 2004) are three dormitory-style buildings. One of the Towers features a 14-room hotel called "The Simon Hotel".
-   MCTAGGART-COWAN HALL (built in 1985), traditional-style dormitory building.
-   SHELL HOUSE (built in 1967), traditional-style dormitory building.
-   THE TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX (built in 1993) are 3-level townhouse units accommodating up to 4 students per unit. There are a total of 99 units.
-   HAMILTON HALL (built in 1993 and renovated in 2009) is a studio-style building for graduate students.
-   LOUIS RIEL HOUSE (built in 1969) is an apartment-style building (unfurnished) used for family and graduate housing. Although the residents tried to prevent the building's closure, it officially closed in September 2015, due to mould problems.[52]

UniverCity

UniverCity is an urban community located on top of Burnaby Mountain, adjacent to Simon Fraser University. It has won several awards for sustainable planning and development.[53] Envisioned in 1963 by Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey, the area adjacent to the University was not officially rezoned for development until 30 years later. Development of the community began in early 2000, when Simon Fraser University commenced construction on a new residential and commercial area occupying approximately adjacent to the campus. , approximately 3000 people live in UniverCity. The main commercial district on University High Street now houses restaurants, stores, and a 20,000 square foot Nester's Market. A new elementary school, University Highlands Elementary, opened on September 1, 2010. Several new residential developments are currently in progress, including the construction of a 12-storey highrise in the heart of UniverCity.[54]

Surrey campus

The Surrey campus consists of two buildings located in Whalley / City Centre, Surrey. The main building is part of Central City, an architectural complex adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. It was established in 2002 to absorb the students and programs of the former Technical University of British Columbia, which was closed by the provincial government. It has since expanded to house the Surrey operations of other SFU programs. The Central City complex that houses the campus was designed by architect Bing Thom and opened in 2006. The Fraser Library,[55] a branch of the SFU Library, is located on this campus, and is the only branch with a games room. It also loans equipment to support students in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology.[56][57]

A separate five-floor building opened on April 25, 2019,[58] across the street from the existing Central City complex. The building houses the Sustainability Energy Engineering (SEE) program[59] and supports 440 full-time students with engineering labs, classrooms, lecture halls and office spaces.[60]

Vancouver campus

The Vancouver campus was launched in the 1980s with a store-front classroom. It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia. A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector. The Vancouver campus has four buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU Harbour Centre, the Morris J Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the Segal Graduate School of Business and SFU Contemporary Arts at the restored Woodward's Building. The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989. Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually. Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown. The Belzberg Library[61] is based at the Vancouver campus.

In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward's district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. The SFU facility is part of the Woodward's revitalization project. The new facility accommodates the increasing enrollment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.

Student life and athletics

Student life

The student newspaper _The Peak_ was established shortly after the university opened and is circulated throughout the University. CJSF-FM radio is the school's radio station, broadcasting from 90.1 FM to Burnaby and surrounding communities, online at www.cjsf.ca or on cable at 93.9 FM. The Simon Fraser Student Society provides funding for over 300 campus clubs. Various campus events include the annual Terry Fox Run, Gung Haggis Fat Choy, Clubs Week, and other multi-cultural events.

The Tau chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1966. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America, including the Theta chapter nearby at the University of British Columbia.

Athletics

SFU_McFog_vectorized.png The university's varsity sports teams are called the Simon Fraser Clan, and the mascot is a Scottish Terrier named McFogg the Dog. In sports and other competitions, there tends to be a strong rivalry between SFU and The University of British Columbia.

The Clan is the first and currently the only athletic program from outside of the United States that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[65] Before joining the NCAA, the Clan used to compete in both the Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS, now U Sports) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In total, SFU has 15 varsity sport teams and 300 athletes. All varsity teams compete for their respective NCAA national championships, except for the Women's Wrestling team who competes for the Women's College Wrestling Association's national championship.

Beside the varsity teams, SFU also houses various competitive club teams, including Men's Lacrosse, who currently competes in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association, and Men's Hockey, who currently competes in the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League. Other club teams include rugby, cheerleading, rowing, quidditch, and field hockey.

SFU has won the NAIA NACDA Director's Cup five times, among others.[66] On Friday, July 10, 2009, the NCAA announced that it had accepted SFU as a Division II member and would begin after a two-year transition period. SFU later competed in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference.[67] It is the first Canadian university to be accepted as a member of the NCAA at any level.[68] In 2012, the Clan was accepted as the first international full member of the NCAA.[69]

Many former Clan athletes later represented Canada during the Olympic Games, including gold medalists Carol Huynh and Daniel Igali, and Olympic medalists Sue Holloway and Hugh Fisher. Other Clan alumni include: Jay Triano, Chris Rinke and Carolyn Murray.

Appearances in popular culture

Library-SFU-Burnaby-British-Columbia-Canada-02A.jpg Due to the contemporary Brutalist architecture of the Burnaby Mountain campus, many buildings, including the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle have been used for location shots in a variety of films and television programmes over the years.[95]

In film

Its first use as a film set was for the 1972 science fiction film _The Groundstar Conspiracy_, in which the entire campus complex was used. It was then followed by _The Fly II_, which has scenes shot inside and outside the Burnaby campus. The campus also appeared in the 1989 movie _American Boyfriends_, set in 1965, with the buildings dressed to look like they were still under construction. The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film _Antitrust_. Recently, in addition to other Vancouver-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie _The 6th Day_ as well as _Agent Cody Banks_. The 2007 film _Personal Effects_, was filmed in the newly constructed Blusson Hall at the Burnaby campus. In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (2008 Remake). Filming of the 2012 movie _Underworld: Awakening_ starring Kate Beckinsale, began in early 2011 with parts of the AQ modified as part of the set. The SFU Surrey Campus has also been featured in blockbuster movies such as _I, Robot_, _Fantastic Four_, and _Catwoman_. SFU was also the film location for _Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn_, representing the Corbulo Academy of Military Science.

In television

The Burnaby campus has been prominently featured in science fiction television series such as _Stargate SG-1_, _Battlestar Galactica_, and _Andromeda_. The Academic Quadrangle has also served as a backdrop for shots of "FBI headquarters" in the television series _The X-Files_, as well as the "National Academy For Seers" in _Sliders_. Exterior shots of the Academic Quadrangle have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series _JPod_ (based on the book). The SFU Surrey campus has been featured in several episodes of _Smallville_ and _Caprica_, with the entire mezzanine and registration area being transformed into the Caprica Inter-colonial Space Port. Recently, filming of the TV show _Hellcats_ commenced in the West Gym of the Chancellor's Gymnasium in November 2010. In _Stargate SG-1_, SFU was the homeworld for the technologically-advanced Tollan,[96] as seen in the Tollan-centric episodes "Pretense" (season 3 Ep. 15) and "Between Two Fires" (season 5 Ep. 9).
