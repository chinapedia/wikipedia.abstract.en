The ALBERTUS BUILDING, also known as the GUTENBERG HAUS, is a historic building located in Guttenberg, Iowa, United States. The two-and three-story structure of locally quarried limestone was completed around 1855 by C. Albertus. A unique feature of the building are the pointed arch doorways and windows, which have not been found on similar commercial buildings in Iowa.[1] The building was initially used for a combination of commercial and residential use. Clothing and grocery stores were located on the first floor of the southern three-story block. By 1886 the northern two-story block was all residential, and by 1894 the whole building had gone residential.

The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 26, 1979.[2] In 1984 it was listed as a contributing property in the Front Street (River Park Drive) Historic District.[3]
