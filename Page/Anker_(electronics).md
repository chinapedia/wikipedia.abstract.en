History

AnkerAstro.jpg Anker_SoundCore_interactive_speaker_display_at_a_Walmart_in_Gillette,_Wyoming.jpg Steven Yang started Anker in 2011 after working as software engineer for Google in California. He moved to Shenzhen, China. In early 2012, _Google_'s then-head of sales in China, Dongping Zhao, was hired and as of 2018, is president of _Anker Innovations_.[2] In 2012, Anker switched its focus from replacement laptop batteries to smartphone battery chargers and wall chargers.[3]

Anker maintains subsidiaries in United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and China. Before 2017, Anker devices were almost exclusively sold at Amazon Marketplace.


Products

Anker charging devices use its proprietary "PowerIQ" technology, which the company claims detects the connected device and automatically optimizes the current delivered to charge it faster.[4] Many of Anker's charging devices also use various fast-charging technologies, such as Quick Charge. Anker was mentioned in 2015 as the leading brand of mobile chargers on Amazon.com.[5]

Besides mobile accessories, Anker also produces smart home appliances,[6] headphones, portable speakers, portable video projectors and car accessories.


Controversies

In 2014, an Indiegogo campaign to promote a set of magnetic accessories called _Zolo_ was launched.[7] Due to prolonged manufacturing challenges the project was set on hold and 1863 backers were offered a 200% refund.

In 2016, a batch of Anker USB-C charging cables suffered a manufacturing defect that could potentially cause damage to connected hardware, leading to a recall.[8]
