THE BEACH BOYS are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era.[1] The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.

The Beach Boys began as an early garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wilsons' father Murry. In 1963, the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, later dubbed the "California Sound". After 1964, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the _Pet Sounds_ album and "Good Vibrations" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era. Following the dissolution of the group's _Smile_ project in 1967, Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues. The group's commercial momentum subsequently faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound, they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archetypal "pop music cop-outs".

Carl took over as the band's musical leader until the late 1970s, during which they rebounded as an increasingly successful live concert draw. Personal struggles, creative disagreements, and the overshadowing success of the band's greatest hits albums precipitated their transition into an oldies act. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, the group and its corporation, Brother Records Inc (BRI), permitted Love to lead a touring band under the "Beach Boys" name. Even though they have not performed together since their 2012 reunion tour, Brian, Jardine, and Love remain a part of BRI and as official members of the band.

The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and influential bands of all time.[2] They were one of the earliest self-contained rock bands and one of the few US bands who maintained their success before, during and after the 1964 British Invasion. Between the 1960s and 2010s, they had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them in the US Top 40 (the most by a US rock band), and four reaching number-one on the _Billboard_ Hot 100.[3] They have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, and are ranked number 12 on _Rolling Stone_ magazine's 2004 list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[4][5] In 2017, a study of AllMusic's catalog indicated the Beach Boys as the sixth most frequently cited artist influence in its database.[6] The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.[7]


History

1958–1961: Formation

Beach_Boys_Landmark_-_Plano_general_I.jpg, marking where the Wilson family home once stood]]

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl – aged thirteen and eleven, respectively – in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, Murry Wilson, play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as the Four Freshmen. After dissecting songs such as "Ivory Tower" and "Good News", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian received a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He learned how to overdub, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian played piano with Carl and David Marks, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to Johnny Otis' KFOX radio show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the rhythm and blues songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Love gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones", a pun on "Pendleton", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time. Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group, and he suggested that the group write songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in Southern California. Brian finished the song, titled "Surfin'", and with Mike Love, wrote "Surfin' Safari". Murry recalled, "They had written a song called 'Surfin',' which I never did like and still don't like, it was so rude and crude."

Murry Wilson, who was a sometime songwriter, arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher Hite Morgan.[8] He said: "Finally, [Hite] agreed to hear it, and Mrs. Morgan said 'Drop everything, we're going to record your song. I think it's good.' And she's the one responsible." On September 15, 1961, the band recorded a demo of "Surfin'" with the Morgans. A more professional recording was made on October 3, at World Pacific Studio in Hollywood. David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.[9] Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of Candix Records and Era Records, and he signed the group on December 8. When the single was released a few weeks later, the band found that they had been renamed "the Beach Boys". Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers until Russ Regan, a young promoter with Era Records, noted that there already existed a group by that name. He suggested calling them the Beach Boys. "Surfin{{'}}" was a regional success for the West Coast, and reached number 75 on the national _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart. It was so successful that the number of unpaid orders for the single bankrupted Candix.

1962–1967: Peak years

_Surfin' Safari_, _Surfin' U.S.A._, _Surfer Girl_, and _Little Deuce Coupe_

Beach_Boys_1963.jpg outfits, performing at a local high school, late 1962.]] By this time the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, Murry landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach. In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants. In early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny & the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym "Kenny". The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.[10] In February, Jardine left the Beach Boys to study dentistry and was replaced by David Marks. Murry remembered that after "Surfin{{'}}", the group had a difficult time being picked up by another label; "they [all] thought [the group was] a one-shot record."[11]

After being turned down by Dot and Liberty, the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records.[12] This was at the urging of Capitol executive and staff producer Nick Venet who signed the group, seeing them as the "teenage gold" he had been scouting for. On June 4, 1962, the Beach Boys debuted on Capitol with their second single, "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of _Billboard_, which praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had potential.[13] "Surfin' Safari" rose to number 14 and found airplay in New York and Phoenix, a surprise for the label.

The Beach Boys completed their first album, _Surfin' Safari_, with production credited to Nick Venet. Carl later denied that Venet had any significant role in the group's early music, saying that Venet "would be in the booth, and he would call the take number, and that was about it. I wouldn't call him a musical heavy by any ... Brian didn't want anything to do with Venet."[14] _Surfin' Safari_, released in October 1962, was different from other rock albums of the time in that it consisted almost entirely of original songs, primarily written by Brian with Mike Love and friend Gary Usher. Another unusual feature of the Beach Boys was that, although they were marketed as "surf music", their repertoire bore little resemblance to the music of other surf bands, which was mainly instrumental and incorporated heavy use of spring reverb. For this reason, some of the Beach Boys' early local performances had young audience members throwing vegetables at the band, believing that the group were poseurs.[15]

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten single, "Surfin' U.S.A.", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The album of the same name followed in March and reached number 2 on the _Billboard_ charts. Its success propelled the group into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze, albeit the Beach Boys' vocal approach to the genre, not the original instrumental style pioneered by Dick Dale.[16] Biographer Luis Sanchez highlights the "Surfin' U.S.A." single as a turning point for the band, "creat[ing] a direct passage to California life for a wide teenage audience ... [and] a distinct Southern California sensibility that exceeded its conception as such to advance right to the front of American consciousness." Five days prior to the release of the _Surfin' U.S.A._ album, Brian produced "Surf City", a song he had written for Jan and Dean. "Surf City" reached number one on the Billboard charts in July,[17] a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had "given away" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.

Throughout 1963, and for the next few years, Brian produced a variety of singles for outside artists. Among these were the Honeys, a surfer trio that comprised sisters Diane and Marilyn Rovell with cousin Ginger Blake. Brian was convinced that they could potentially be a successful female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and he produced a number of singles for them, although they could not replicate the Beach Boys' popularity. He also attended some of Phil Spector's sessions at Gold Star Studios. His creative and songwriting interests were revamped upon hearing the Ronettes' 1963 song "Be My Baby", which was produced by Spector. The first time he heard the song was while driving, and was so overwhelmed that he had to pull over to the side of the road and analyze the chorus. Later, he reflected: "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song."

_Surfer Girl_ marked the first time the group used outside musicians on a substantial portion of an LP. Many of them were the musicians Spector used for his Wall of Sound productions. To close 1963, the band released a standalone Christmas-themed single, "Little Saint Nick", backed with an a cappella rendition of the scriptural song "The Lord's Prayer". The A-side peaked at No. 3 on the US _Billboard_ Christmas chart.

British Invasion, _Shut Down_, _All Summer Long_, and _Christmas Album_

The surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was slowly replaced by the British Invasion. Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the Beach Boys returned home to face their new competition, the Beatles. Both groups shared the same record label in the US, and Capitol's support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to "twist executive arms." Carl said that Phil Spector "was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [him] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it."[18] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles closer than anyone else in the band, while Brian was the most "rattled" by the Beatles and felt tremendous pressure to "keep pace" with them. For Brian, the Beatles ultimately "eclipsed a lot [of what] we'd worked for ... [they] eclipsed the whole music world."

Brian wrote his last surf song in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single "I Get Around", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. He remained in close contact with the group and attempted to continue advising on their career decisions. When "I Get Around" was released in May, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so, proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporary British pop groups. In July, the album that the song appeared on, _All Summer Long_, reached No. 4 in the US. _All Summer Long_ introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, _Beach Boys Concert_, was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a set list of previously recorded songs and covers that they had not yet recorded.

In June 1964, Brian recorded the bulk of _The Beach Boys' Christmas Album_ with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds. The album was a response to Phil Spector's _A Christmas Gift for You_ (1963). Released in December, the Beach Boys' album was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. It would be regarded as one of the finest holiday albums of the rock era. One single from the album, "The Man with All the Toys", was released, peaking at No. 6 on the US _Billboard_ Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for _The T.A.M.I. Show_, a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.

_Today!_, _Summer Days_, and _Party!_

By the end of 1964, the stress of road travel, writing, and producing became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the musical variety series _Shindig!_. In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, session musician Glen Campbell served as Brian's temporary replacement in concert. Carl took over as the band's musical director onstage.[19]

Now a full-time studio artist, Brian wanted to move the Beach Boys beyond their surf aesthetic, believing that their image was antiquated and distracting the public from his talents as a producer and songwriter.[20] In the period following his resignation from touring, Brian put more distance between him and his bandmates, and began expanding his social circle to include a mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. He also took an increasing interest in the developing Los Angeles "hip" scene and in recreational drugs (particularly marijuana, LSD, and Desbutal).[21] Musically, he said he began to "take the things I learned from Phil Spector and use more instruments whenever I could. I doubled up on basses and tripled up on keyboards, which made everything sound bigger and deeper."

Released in March 1965, _The Beach Boys Today!_ marked the first time the group experimented with the "album-as-art" form. The tracks on side one feature an uptempo sound that contrasts side two, which consists mostly of emotional ballads.[22] Music writer Scott Schinder referenced its "suite-like structure" as an early example of the rock album format being used to make a cohesive artistic statement. Brian also established his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical; journalist Nick Kent wrote that the subjects of Brian's songs "were suddenly no longer simple happy souls harmonizing their sun-kissed innocence and dying devotion to each other over a honey-coated backdrop of surf and sand. Instead, they'd become highly vulnerable, slightly neurotic and riddled with telling insecurities." In the book _Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop_, Bob Stanley remarked that "Brian was aiming for Johnny Mercer but coming up proto-indie." In 2012, the album was voted 271 on _Rolling Stone_ magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".[23]

Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as "America's Top Surfin' Group!" and expected Brian to write more beachgoing songs for the yearly summer markets. In April 1965, Campbell's own career success pulled him from touring with the group. Columbia Records staff producer Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the June 4 vocal sessions for "California Girls", which first appeared in the band's next album _Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)_ and eventually charted at number three in the US while the album went to number two. The album also included a reworked arrangement of "Help Me, Rhonda" which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965.

To appease Capitol's demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, Brian conceived _Beach Boys' Party!_, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin'", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier songs. The album was an early precursor of the "unplugged" trend. It included a cover of the Regents' song "Barbara Ann" which unexpectedly reached number-two when released several weeks later. In November, the group released another top-twenty single, "The Little Girl I Once Knew". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far. The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. It was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough, peaking at number 20.[24] According to Luis Sanchez, in 1965, Bob Dylan was "rewriting the rules for pop success" with his music and image, and it was at this juncture that Wilson "led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs."

_Pet Sounds_

Brian_Wilson_1966.png In January 1966, Wilson commenced recording sessions for the Beach Boys' forthcoming album _Pet Sounds_, which was largely a collaboration with jingle writer Tony Asher. The album was a refinement of the themes and ideas that were introduced in _Today!_.[25] In some ways, the music was a jarring departure from their earlier style. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with a substantial portion of the new album, and various reports suggest that they fought over the new direction.[26] Musicologist Daniel Harrison wrote, "In terms of the structure of the songs themselves, there is comparatively little advance from what Brian had already accomplished." In _The Journal on the Art of Record Production_, Marshall Heiser writes that _Pet Sounds_ "diverges from previous Beach Boys' efforts in several ways: its sound field has a greater sense of depth and 'warmth;' the songs employ even more inventive use of harmony and chord voicings; the prominent use of percussion is a key feature (as opposed to driving drum backbeats); whilst the orchestrations, at times, echo the quirkiness of 'exotica' bandleader Les Baxter, or the 'cool' of Burt Bacharach, more so than Spector's teen fanfares."[27] Tony Asher recalled witnessing "tense" recording sessions in which Brian's bandmates complained that the music "'isn't our kind of shit!'".

For _Pet Sounds_, Brian desired to make "a complete statement", similar to what he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album _Rubber Soul_, released in December 1965. Brian was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression that it had no filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45 rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. He later said: "It didn't make me want to copy them but to be as good as them. I didn't want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level."[28] Thanks to mutual connections, Brian was introduced to the Beatles' former press officer Derek Taylor, who was subsequently employed as the Beach Boys' publicist. Responding to Brian's request to reinvent the band's image, Taylor devised a promotion campaign with the tagline "Brian Wilson is a genius", a belief which Taylor sincerely held.[29] Taylor's prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective to those on the outside, and his efforts are widely recognized as instrumental in the album's success in Britain.[30]

Released on May 16, 1966, _Pet Sounds_ was widely influential and raised the band's prestige as an innovative rock group. Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a slight drop-off from the run of albums that immediately preceded it. It was assumed that Capitol considered _Pet Sounds_ a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing. Within two months, the label capitulated by releasing the group's first greatest hits compilation, _Best of the Beach Boys_, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. By contrast, _Pet Sounds_ met a highly favorable critical response in Britain, where it reached number 2 and remained among the top-ten positions for six months. Responding to the hype, _Melody Maker_ ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and progressive, or "as sickly as peanut butter". The author concluded that "the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable."

In its evaluation of _Pet Sounds_, the book _101 Albums that Changed Popular Music_ (2009) calls it "one of the most innovative recordings in rock", and that it "elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius". In 1995, a panel of numerous musicians, songwriters and producers assembled by _MOJO_ voted _Pet Sounds_ as the greatest record ever made. Paul McCartney frequently spoke of his affinity with the album, citing "God Only Knows" as his favorite song of all time, and crediting his melodic bass-playing style to the album.[31][32] He acknowledged that _Pet Sounds_ was the primary impetus for the Beatles' 1967 album _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_. According to author Carys Wyn Jones, the interplay between these two groups during the _Pet Sounds_ era remains one of the most noteworthy episodes in rock history. In 2003, when _Rolling Stone_ magazine created its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time", the publication placed _Pet Sounds_ second to honour its influence on the highest ranked album, _Sgt. Pepper's_.

"Good Vibrations" and _Smile_

Throughout the summer of 1966, Brian concentrated on finishing the group's next single, "Good Vibrations". During the making of _Pet Sounds_, Wilson started changing his writing process. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an acetate disc home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics. With "Good Vibrations", Wilson said, "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic." Most of the song's structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Brian limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time.[33] Coming at a time when pop singles were usually recorded in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, with sessions for the song stretching over several months in four major Hollywood studios. It was also the most expensive single ever recorded to that point, with the production costs estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

Van_Dyke_Parks_1967.png, Brian's lyricist and collaborator for the unfinished album _Smile_]]

While in the midst of "Good Vibrations" sessions, Wilson invited session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys' next album project, soon titled _Smile_, to which Parks agreed. Wilson and Parks intended _Smile_ to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs. It was explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming British dominance of popular music at the time. Some of the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, classical tone poems, cartoon sound effects, _musique concrète_, and yodeling.[34] _Saturday Evening Post_ writer Jules Siegel famously recalled that, during one evening in October, Brian announced to his wife and friends that he was "writing a teenage symphony to God". Brian told _Melody Maker_: "Our new album will be better than _Pet Sounds_. It will be as much an improvement over _Sounds_ as that was over _Summer Days_."[35] Derek Taylor continued to write articles in the music press, sometimes anonymously, in an effort to further speculation about the album.

Recording for _Smile_ lasted about a year, from mid 1966 to mid 1967, and followed the same modular production approach as "Good Vibrations". Concurrently, Wilson planned many different multimedia side-projects, such as a sound effects collage, a comedy album, and a "health food" album.[36] Capitol did not support some of these ideas, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was "the most receptive" to the proposal, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound "best friend" David Anderle as the head of the label, even though it was against the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. In a press release, Anderle stated that Brother Records was to give "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." The group established a short-lived film production company, called "Home Movies", to create live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys. The company completed only one production, a music video for "Good Vibrations".

Released on October 10, 1966, "Good Vibrations" was the Beach Boys' third US number-one single, reaching the top of the _Billboard_ Hot 100 in December, and became their first number one in Britain. That month, the record was their first single certified gold by the RIAA. It came to be widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. In December 1966, the Beach Boys were voted the number-one band in the world in an annual readers' poll conducted by _NME_, ahead of the Beatles, the Walker Brothers, the Rolling Stones, and the Four Tops. _Billboard_ said that this result was probably influenced by the success of "Good Vibrations" when the votes were cast, together with the band's recent tour, whereas the Beatles had neither a recent single nor had they toured the UK throughout 1966; the reporter added that "The sensational success of the Beach Boys, however, is being taken as a portent that the popularity of the top British groups of the last three years is past its peak."[37]

The Beach Boys ended the final quarter of 1966 as the strongest selling album act in the UK, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles.[38] In 1971, a writer in _Cue_ magazine noted that, from mid 1966 to late 1967, the band "were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture."[39] Biographer David Leaf wrote that the success of "Good Vibrations" "bought Brian some time [and] shut up everybody who said that Brian's new ways wouldn't sell ... his inability to _quickly_ follow up [the single was what] became a snowballing problem." Sanchez writes that as time passed, the hype for _Smile_ turned into "expectation", "doubt", and finally, "bemusement".

Collapse

By December 1966, Wilson had completed much of the _Smile_ backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new music he had recorded and the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him.[40] Gaines wrote that David Anderle now appeared to them as the leader of "a whole group of strangers [that] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys". Throughout the first half of 1967, the album's release date was repeatedly postponed as Brian tinkered with the recordings, experimenting with different takes and mixes, unable or unwilling to supply a completed version of the album. Meanwhile, he suffered from delusions and paranoia, believing on one occasion that the album track "Fire" (also known as "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow") caused a building to burn down. On January 3, 1967, Carl Wilson refused to be drafted for military service, leading to indictment and criminal prosecution which he challenged as a conscientious objector.[41] He was arrested by the FBI in April, and it would take several years in the courts before the matter would be resolved.[42]

After months of recording and media hype, the original _Smile_ project was shelved due to the numerous personal, technical, and legal issues which surrounded its making. A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Since the group's future at Capitol was in limbo, an immediate release of _Smile_ would have been unlikely, regardless of whether the album was completed. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Brian later said: "Time can be spent in the studio to the point where you get so next to it, you don't know where you are with it, you decide to just chuck it for a while."[43] He discussed breaking up the Beach Boys "on many occasions," according to Anderle, "But it was easier, I think to get rid of the outsiders like myself than it was to break up the brothers. You can't break up brothers."

In the decades following _Smile_{{'}}s non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique and gained status as the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music. Many of the album's advocates believe that had it been released, it would have altered the group's direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators. In October 1967, _Cheetah_ magazine published "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!", a memoir by Jules Siegel that chronicled his time with Brian during the _Smile_ sessions. The article propelled the mythology of _Smile_ and the Beach Boys and credited the album's collapse to "an obsessive cycle of creation and destruction that threatened not only his career and his fortune but also his marriage, his friendships, his relationships with the Beach Boys and, some of his closest friends worried, his mind". Carl blamed the article and "a lot of that stuff that went around before" with "really turn[ing Brian] off."[44] Some of the original _Smile_ tracks continued to trickle out in later releases, often as filler tracks to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. In 2011, _Uncut_ magazine staff voted _Smile_ to be the "greatest bootleg recording of all time".[45]

1967–1969: Faltered popularity and Brian's reduced involvement

Monterey Pop cancellation

In May 1967, the Beach Boys attempted to tour Europe with four extra musicians brought from the US, but were stopped by the British musicians' union. The tour went on without the extra support, and critics described their performances as "amateurish" and "floundering". Days after announcing that _Smile_ was "scrapped", Derek Taylor terminated his employment with the group to focus his attention on organizing the Monterey Pop Festival, an event held in June that the Beach Boys declined to headline at the last minute. David Leaf explained: "Monterey was a gathering place for the 'far out' sounds of the 'new' rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds (excepting "Good Vibrations") to display. The net result of all this internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go to Monterey, and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the 'underground' tide against them."[46]

Publicly, the band said that they could not play Monterey because of Carl's military draft, but many of the people involved with the festival thought that the group was simply too scared to compete with the "new music". Love later said that "Carl was to appear in federal court the Tuesday after the concert, but for all we knew, they were going to arrest him again if he performed onstage. ... None of us were afraid to perform at Monterey." Steven Gaines wrote that the decision ultimately "had a snowballing effect" that came to represent "a damning admission that [the Beach Boys] were washed up". A controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group developed among critics and fans.[47] On December 14, 1967, _Rolling Stone_ co-founder and editor Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced the Beach Boys as "just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles. It's a pointless pursuit." Many rock fans thus began excluding the group from "serious consideration".

_Smiley Smile_ and _Wild Honey_

The Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to record and present an album to Capitol. Carl remembered: "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of [_Smile_] instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was _Smiley Smile_."[48] Sessions for the new album lasted from June to July 1967 at Brian's new makeshift home studio. Most of the album featured the Beach Boys playing their own instruments, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work.[49] It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. When asked if Brian was "still the producer of _Smiley Smile_", Carl answered, "Most definitely."[50]

In July, lead single "Heroes and Villains" was issued, arriving after months of public anticipation, and reached number 12 in US. It was met with general confusion among underwhelming reviews, and in the _NME_, Jimi Hendrix famously dismissed the single as a "psychedelic barbershop quartet". By then, the group's lawsuit with Capitol was resolved, and it was agreed that _Smile_ would not be the band's next album. In August, the group embarked on a two-date tour of Hawaii. Bruce Johnston, who was absent for most of the _Smiley Smile_ recording, did not accompany the group, although Brian did. Their performances were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, _Lei'd in Hawaii_, which was also left unfinished and unreleased. Jesse Jarnow of _Pitchfork_ opined that the Hawaii performances "most definitely would not have passed the Monterey acid test against the likes of the Who and Jimi Hendrix."[51] In an interview that month, Brian stated: "I think rock n' roll–the pop scene–is happening. It's great. But I think basically, the Beach Boys are squares. We're not happening."

_Smiley Smile_ was released on September 18, 1967, and peaked at number 41 in the US, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It began a string of under-performing Beach Boys albums that would last until 1974. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9. Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album. According to Scott Schinder, the album was released to "general incomprehension. While _Smile_ may have divided the Beach Boys' fans had it been released, _Smiley Smile_ merely baffled them." Over the years, the album gathered a reputation as one of the best "chill-out" albums to listen to during an LSD comedown. In 1974, the writing staff of _NME_ voted it as the 64th greatest album of all time.

The Beach Boys immediately recorded a new album, _Wild Honey_, which was an excursion into soul music. Carl described it as "music for Brian to cool out by. He was still very spaced." The album was a self-conscious attempt by the Beach Boys to "regroup" themselves as a rock band in opposition to their more orchestral affairs of the past. Its music differs in many ways from previous Beach Boys records: it contains very little group singing compared to previous albums, and mainly features Brian singing at his piano. Again, the Beach Boys recorded mostly at his home studio.[52] Love reflected that _Wild Honey_ was "completely out of the mainstream for what was going on at that time, which was all hard rock/psychedelic music. It just didn't have anything to do with what was going on, and that was the idea."[53]

_Wild Honey_ was released on December 18, 1967, in competition with the Beatles' _Magical Mystery Tour_ and the Rolling Stones' _Their Satanic Majesties Request_. It had a lower chart placing than _Smiley Smile_ and remained on the charts for only 15 weeks.[54] As with _Smiley Smile_, contemporary critics viewed it as inconsequential, and it alienated fans whose expectations had been raised by _Smile_.[55] That month, Mike Love told a British journalist: "Sure people were baffled and mystified by _Smiley Smile_ but it was a matter of progression. We had this feeling that we were going too far, losing touch I guess, and this new one brings us back more into reality ... Brian has been re-thinking our recording program and in any case we all have a much greater say nowadays in what we turn out in the studio."[56] _Wild Honey_ remained the last Beach Boys album to feature Brian as a primary composer until 1977. Over the coming months, its non-conforming approach would be echoed in albums released by Bob Dylan (_John Wesley Harding_), the Kinks (_Village Green Preservation Society_), and the Byrds (_The Notorious Byrd Brothers_).[57]

_Friends_, _20/20_, and Manson affair

The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s, and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image, which remained incongruous with the "heavier" music of their peers.[58] From 1968 onward, Brian's songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of "Brian-as-leader" continued. After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and Donovan traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968. The following Beach Boys album _Friends_ had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi. In support of the _Friends_ album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the U.S.. Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently canceled at a cost estimated at $250,000 for the band. _Friends_, released on June 24, peaked at number 126 in the US. A collection of Beach Boys backing tracks, _Stack-o-Tracks_, was issued by Capitol in August. The album became the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the US and UK.

Dennis_Wilson_in_1966.png

In June 1968, Dennis befriended Charles Manson, an aspiring singer-songwriter, and their relationship lasted for several months. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Manson, and so a deal was never made. In July 1968, the group released a standalone single, "Do It Again", which was written in the style of their earlier songs. Around this time, Brian admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital. His bandmates wrote and produced material in his absence. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album, _20/20_, released in January 1969. It consisted mostly of outtakes and leftovers from recent albums; Brian produced virtually none of the record. In 1976, Dennis called it "the only letdown of the Beach Boys' career that embarrassed me through and through ... we had to find things that Brian worked on and try and piece it together. That's when [he had] no involvement at all."[59]

The Beach Boys recorded one song penned by Manson without his involvement: "Cease to Exist", rewritten as "Never Learn Not to Love", which was included on _20/20_, but first released as the B-side of a single one month earlier. Manson was enthused by the idea of the group recording one of his songs; however, after accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics, which angered Manson. As his cult of followers took over Dennis' home, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson. In November 1969, three months after the Tate–LaBianca murders, Manson was apprehended by the police, and his connections with the Beach Boys was the subject of media attention. He was later convicted for several counts of murder and conspiracy to murder. Dennis refused to testify against him. In 1976, Dennis commented that "I don't talk about Manson. I think he's a sick fuck. I think of Roman [Polanski] and all those wonderful people who had a beautiful family and they fucking had their tits cut off. I want to benefit from that?" Mike Love remembered that Dennis "couldn’t talk about it with anyone", including family, friends, and investigators:

Selling of the band's publishing

In April 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over $2 million for unpaid royalties and production duties. In May, Brian told the music press that the group's funds were depleted to the point that they were considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which _Disc & Music Echo_ called "stunning news" and a "tremendous shock on the American pop scene". Brian hoped that the success of a forthcoming single, "Break Away", would mend their financial issues. The song, which was written and produced by Brian and Murry, reached number 63 in the US and number 6 in the UK, and Brian's remarks to the press ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon. The group's Capitol contract expired two weeks later with one more album still due, after which the label deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. The lawsuit was later settled in their favor and they acquired the rights to their post-1965 catalog.

In August, Sea of Tunes, the Beach Boys' catalog, was sold to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Brian, according to his wife Marilyn Wilson, was devastated by the sale. Over the years, the catalog would generate more than $100 million in publishing royalties, none of which Murry nor the band members ever received.

1970–1978: Reprise era

_Sunflower_ and _Surf's Up_

The group were signed to Reprise Records in 1970.[60] Scott Schinder described the label as "probably the hippest and most artist-friendly major label of the time." The deal was brokered by Van Dyke Parks, who was then employed as a multimedia executive at Warner Music Group. Reprise's contract stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums By the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.[61]

After recording over 30 different songs and going through several album titles, their first LP for Reprise, _Sunflower_, was released on August 31, 1970.[62] _Sunflower_ featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on _Sunflower_ and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. The album received critical acclaim in both the US and the UK. This was offset by the album reaching only number 151 on US record charts during a four-week stay,[63] becoming the worst selling Beach Boys album at that point. In his review for _Rolling Stone_, critic Jim Miller praised the album as "without doubt the best Beach Boys album in recent memory, a stylistically coherent _tour de force_", but mused: "It makes one wonder though whether anyone still listens to their music, or could give a shit about it."[64] In the UK, the album reached 29. Fans generally regard the LP as the Beach Boys' finest post-_Pet Sounds_ album. In 2003, it placed at number 380 on _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s "Greatest Albums of All Time" list.

Sometime in 1969, Brian opened a short-lived health food store called the Radiant Radish,[65] While working there, he met journalist and radio presenter Jack Rieley.[66] Rieley spoke with Brian for a radio interview, with the subject eventually turning to the unreleased song "Surf's Up", a track which had taken on notoriety since the demise of the _Smile_ album three years earlier. Brian did not feel it should be released. On August 8, 1970, Rieley offered a six-page memo ruminating on how to stimulate "increased record sales and popularity for The Beach Boys."[67] In the fall of 1970, the Beach Boys hired Rieley as their manager. One of his initiatives was to encourage the band to record songs featuring more socially conscious lyrics. He also requested the completion of "Surf's Up" and arranged a guest appearance at a Grateful Dead concert at Bill Graham's Fillmore East in April 1971 to foreground the Beach Boys' transition into the counterculture. During this time, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage.

On August 30, 1971, the band released _Surf's Up_, which included the title track. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at Carnegie Hall; their live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. A large portion of their set lists culled from _Pet Sounds_ and _Smile_. Music writer Domenic Priore noted, "They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967." Dennis injured his hand during the _Surf's Up_ sessions, leaving him temporarily unable to play the drums.

_So Tough_, _Holland_, and greatest hits LPs

Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song "Sail On, Sailor", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, Tandyn Almer, Ray Kennedy, Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin. Reprise subsequently approved, and the resulting album, _Holland_, was released in January 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, _Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)_ was included as a bonus EP.

In August 1973, the 41-song soundtrack to _American Graffiti_ was released, including the band's early songs "Surfin' Safari" and "All Summer Long". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness.[68] s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973.|date=May 2014}} Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). In June 1974, Capitol issued _Endless Summer_, the band's first major pre-_Pet Sounds_ greatest hits package. The compilation rose to the top of the _Billboard_ album charts. It remained on the charts for two years, the longest of any Beach Boys release. Capitol followed with a second compilation, _Spirit of America_, which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks. _Rolling Stone_ named the Beach Boys the "Band of the Year" for 1974.

Fataar remained with the band until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future Eagles member Joe Walsh. Chaplin's replacement, James William Guercio, started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. A new album was attempted, with sessions being held both at Guercio's Caribou Ranch recording studio in Colorado and at the bands own Brother Studios in L.A. Only a scattering of material from these sessions saw eventual release. The impetus had shifted from recording new material to large venue touring and under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's single "Wishing You Were Here". While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music.

"Brian's Back!", _15 Big Ones_, and _Love You_

Brian spent the majority of two years secluded in the chauffeur's quarters of his home, abusing alcohol, taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting other self-destructive behavior. Although increasingly reclusive during the day, Wilson spent many nights at singer Danny Hutton's house, fraternizing with colleagues such as Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop. In 1975, Brian attempted to join California Music, a Los Angeles collective that included Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, and Bruce Johnston. The Beach Boys' recent _Endless Summer_ compilation was selling well, and the band was touring non-stop, making them the biggest live draw in the US. Guercio was then fired by the group and replaced by Steve Love, who urged the group to encourage Brian to return to the production helm. According to Steve: "We were under contract with Warner Bros., and we couldn't have him going on a tangent. If he was going to be productive, it's gotta be for the Beach Boys." Brian, who had already grown tired of working with the Beach Boys, was then legally ousted from California Music in order to focus his undivided attention on the band. In October, Marilyn persuaded Brian to admit himself under the care of psychotherapist Eugene Landy, who was successful in keeping Brian from indulging in substance abuse with constant supervision.

At the end of January 1976, the Beach Boys returned to the studio with an apprehensive Brian producing once again. At the time, he felt: "It was a little scary because [the Beach Boys and I] weren't as close. We had drifted apart, personality-wise. A lot of the guys had developed new personalities through meditation. ... But we went into the studio with the attitude that we had to get it done." Group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Brian decided the band should do an album of rock and roll and doo wop standards. Carl and Dennis disagreed, feeling that an album of originals was far more ideal, while Love and Jardine wanted the album out as quickly as possible. Brian's production role was undermined as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks, without his knowledge, to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. He later attributed his hoarse voice on the album to a bout of laryngitis.

Released on July 5, 1976, _15 Big Ones_ was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. Its lead single, a cover of Chuck Berry's "Rock and Roll Music", peaked at number five. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press. Dennis said: "It was a great mistake to put Brian in full control. He was always the absolute producer, but little did he know that in his absence, people grew up, people became as sensitive as the next guy. Why do I relinquish my rights as an artist? The whole process was a little bruising." Brian said that "the new album is nothing too deep", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's "Good Vibrations". An August 1976 NBC-TV special, titled _The Beach Boys_, was produced by _Saturday Night Live_ (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, and featured appearances by _SNL_ cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. In December, Brian was released from Landy's program due to disputes over the doctor's monthly fee.

From late 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album _The Beach Boys Love You_, a collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced alone. He later called _Love You_ one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that "That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies." The album's engineer, Earle Mankey, compared it to the surrealist film _Eraserhead_, and said that while it was "lighthearted" on the surface, it was intended to be a "serious, autobiographical work". Writing for _Pitchfork_, D. Erik Kempke said the album "stands in sharp contrast to the albums that preceded and followed it, because it was a product of genuine inspiration on Brian Wilson's part, with little outside interference."[69] Al Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having "the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother."[70]

Released on April 11, 1977, _Love You_ peaked at number 53 in the US and number 28 in the UK. It was divided between fans and critics. Some saw the album as a work of "eccentric genius" whereas others dismissed it as "childish and trivial". In a review for _Circus_, Lester Bangs called the Beach Boys "a diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one ... But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health." The album was released weeks after the band signed a new record deal with CBS. Gaines hypothesized that the lack of promotion Reprise put into _Love You_ was a byproduct of the falling out between artist and label.

Band tensions, solo careers, and scrapped albums

After _Love You_ was released, Brian assembled _Adult/Child_, an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Brian from 1976 and 1977 with select big band arrangements by Dick Reynolds. Although publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, _Adult/Child_ caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic. The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to _Rolling Stone_ on September 3 that he had left the band: "It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now [_Pacific Ocean Blue_], like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don't like to admit it's doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews."[71]

The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter. Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album, _Bambu_. The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle.

Their last album for Reprise, _M.I.U. Album_ (1978), was recorded at Maharishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as "executive producer". _M.I.U._ was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result.

1980s: Dennis' death, Brian's estrangement, and "Kokomo"

In an April 1980 interview, Carl reflected that "the last two years have been the most important and difficult time of our career. We were at the ultimate crossroads. We had to decide whether what we had been involved in since we were teenagers had lost its meaning. We asked ourselves and each other the difficult questions we'd often avoided in the past."[72] By the next year, he left the touring group because of unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He stated: "I haven't quit the Beach Boys but I do not plan on touring with them until they decide that 1981 means as much to them as 1961."[73]

Carl returned on May 1982, after approximately 14 months of being away, on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from "Las Vegas-type" engagements. Later that year, Brian overdosed on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs. His former therapist Eugene Landy was once more employed, and a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore Brian to health.[74] This involved removing him from the group on November 5, 1982, at the behest of Carl, Love, and Jardine,[75] in addition to putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen. Coupled with long, extreme counseling sessions, this therapy was successful in bringing Brian back to physical health, slimming down from to .[76]

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and the Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds.[77][78] However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that "rock bands" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted "the wrong element", who would steal from attendees.[79] During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, "...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element."[80][81] Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, "They're my friends and I like their music".[82] Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans.[83] White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had "shot himself in the foot".[84]

In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against the other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned at the age of 39 in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage.

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged Brian about $430,000 annually. When he requested more money, Carl was obliged to give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties.[85] As Brian's recovery consolidated, he stopped working with the Beach Boys on a regular basis. Commenting on his relationship to the band in 1988, Brian said that he avoided his family at Landy's suggestion, and that "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends."[86] In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, "I influence all of [Brian]'s thinking. I'm practically a member of the band ... [We're] partners in life." Brian later responded to allegations with, "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge." Mike Love denied Landy's accusation that he and the band were keeping Brian from participating with the group, and later wrote that Landy's "goal ... was to destroy us ... [and become] the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy."

The Beach Boys spent the next several years touring, often playing in front of large audiences - they returned to Washington, D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people.[87] On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of over one million in Philadelphia, and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington.[88] They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert.[89]

During that time, the band also recorded songs for film soundtracks and various artists compilations. In 1988, they unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. number one single in 22 years with "Kokomo", which topped the chart for one week.[90] It appeared in the movie _Cocktail_ They released the album _Still Cruisin'_, which went platinum in the US.[91]

1990s: Lawsuits and death of Carl

Love filed a defamation lawsuit against Brian due to how he was presented in Brian's 1992 memoir _Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story_. Its publisher HarperCollins settled the suit for $1.5 million. He said that the suit allowed his lawyer "to gain access to the transcripts of Brian's interviews with his [book] collaborator, Todd Gold. Those interviews affirmed—according to Brian—that I had been the inspiration of the group and that I had written many of the songs that [would soon be] in dispute." Other defamation lawsuits were filed by Carl, Brother Records, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.

With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning $12 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.[92] He later called it "almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history".

The day after California courts issued a restraining order between Brian and Landy, Brian phoned Sire Records staff producer Andy Paley to collaborate on new material tentatively for the Beach Boys. After losing the songwriting credits lawsuit with Love, Brian told _MOJO_ in February 1995: "Mike and I are just cool. There's a lot of shit Andy and I got written for him. I just had to get through that goddamn trial!"[93] In April, it was unclear whether the project would turn into a Wilson solo album, a Beach Boys album, or a combination of the two.[94] The project ultimately disintegrated. Instead, Brian and his bandmates recorded _Stars and Stripes Vol. 1_, an album of country music stars covering Beach Boys songs, with co-production helmed by River North Records owner Joe Thomas. Afterward, the group discussed finishing the album _Smile_, but Carl rejected the idea, fearing that it would cause Brian another nervous breakdown.

In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song. Carl died on February 6, 1998, at the age of 51, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree.

2000s: Band split

The_Beach_Boys_concierto.jpg In turn, Jardine left the band and began to tour regularly with his band "Beach Boys: Family & Friends" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts.[95] Marks left the touring band in 1999 because of his health.

In 2000, ABC-TV premiered a two-part television miniseries, _The Beach Boys: An American Family_, that dramatized the Beach Boys' story. It was produced by John Stamos, and was criticized for historical inaccuracies. Wilson said that he "didn't like the second part. It wasn't really true to the way things were. I'd like to see another movie if it was done right."[96]

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album _Brian Wilson Presents Smile_, a reinterpretation of the unfinished _Smile_ project. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the _Mail On Sunday_ that included Beach Boys songs he had recently rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.[97] Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues.[98]
