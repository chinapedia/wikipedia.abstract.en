_FLASH TRAFFIC: CITY OF ANGELS_ is a game developed by Tsunami Games and published by Time Warner Interactive for MS-DOS systems in 1994.


Plot

The DEA hit a warehouse, where they kill two people and take three suspects. They believe the warehouse only contains drugs, but find the materials to make a nuclear bomb. The player is tasked to find out who made the bomb, retrieve it, and defuse it before it destroys the Northern Hempsphere.[1]


Gameplay

When a scene ends, players are given three choices on how to proceed.[2] They impact the story and gameplay, but the wrong choice does not usually end the game. However, some choices can result in the player's death.


Release

Tsunami Games debuted the game at COMDEX in November 1994.[3]


Reception

_Entertainment Weekly_ rated it C+ and said "An uninspiring script and so-so acting make _Flash Traffic_ play like a direct-to-video cheapie with a multiple-personality disorder."[4] Stephen Manes of _The New York Times_ called it "stronger on acting and dialogue than on plot". Manes said some choices do not seem to affect the plot, making it unsatisfying.[5]
