"MARTIAN MAN" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul[1] that was destined to be a track on her 1976 album _Before You Go Tonight_ (aka _Take Your Time_), but was shelved as part of a legal dispute with former manager Don Arden.[2]

Although the dispute was solved in de Paul's favour, the album was first released in 1990 in Japan.[3] "Martian Man" finally appeared internationally as a track on de Paul's 2013 anthology CD, _Into My Music: 1975-1979_.[4] De Paul explained that the ethereal song is about former boyfriend and zany musician Roy Wood, hence the strange lyrics about a woman who falls in love with a stranded Martian.[5] "He came to collect me at my flat and he's dyed his hair green - I thought he looked like a Martian", she said in the booklet to her _Into My Music_ album. Ironically, it was Wood who had recommended Don Arden as her new manager when she left MAM Records.

In 1996, the ex-All About Eve singer and longterm de Paul fan, Julianne Regan, released an electronic version of the song that was approved by de Paul,[6] as a track on the extended play CD _The Milkman_ by Regan's group, Mice,[7] which reached No. 92 on the UK Singles Chart in May that year.[8] This recording of the song was also included on the 2001 Julianne Regan and Mice album, _New and Improved_.[9]
