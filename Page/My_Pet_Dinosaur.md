Development

Matt Drummond began writing the script to My Pet Monster in early 2015 after the success of his debut feature,[4] Dinosaur Island.[5] The international rights were acquired at the American Film Market by Faisal Toor from Empress Road Pictures for its newly formed _Selects_ Division.

Rehearsals began December 2015. Principal photography commenced in 6 January 2016 in Australia, with Drummond directing. Live-action filming locations included Lithgow, Katoomba, Rydal and Portland, while CGI was done at Hive Studios International in Leura, New South Wales. Additional filming took place around the Lithgow area before transferring to Portland. Principal photography was completed on 15 February 2016.

The film is scored by Chris Wright, who also composed the score for Drummond's debut feature, Dinosaur Island (2014). Sound mix was completed by the Academy Award winning Peter Purcell,[6] known for Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).

Visual effects were completed by Hive Studios International, with Drummond acting as Visual effects supervisor.

Critical Response

Upon its Australian release, My Pet Dinosaur has received mixed yet positive reviews. Richard Gray from The Reel Bits gave the film a positive review, rewarding four out of five stars. He stated "My Pet Dinosaur is an amazing achievement, proving that a combination of story-first genre filmmaking can be accomplished using local resources. Delightful and heartwarming, it's also a great indicator of where independent filmmaking is headed in Australia at the moment.[13] Alaisdair Leith from Novastream Networks gave the film five out of five stars describing the film as visually stunning, 'the CG work on Magnus (particularly baby Magnus) is Hollywood standard and for an Australian production provides the best visual effects used in an Australian film to date."[14]

The Movie Critic next door awarded the film four out of five stars citing My Pet Dinosaur is a film that hearkens back to the beloved Spielberg classics of the 80's – yes, like E.T., but also The Goonies or even the Spielberg-produced Super 8 ...but the kids' efforts are outrageously fun and heartwarming to watch. Magnus is amazingly real, the villains perfectly villainous, and the young actors manage to carry the movie, though it's often Mike who steals the show. And it's a show worth stealing, four out of five stars' worth. The editing is a bit off, with some of the scene changes a bit confusing, but overall it's a nostalgic and wonderful romp."[15]

Jacki McTaggart from The Spotlight Report gave 3.5 stars out of 5 stars and describes the film as "a family friendly science fiction movie that creates an imaginative story, full of heart that will take audiences to a place where anyone can be a child with a magical creature at their side."[16] Mike McLelland from FlickeringMyth.com rewarded it a mixed review with two out of five stars. But in response to the central CGI character states "Magnus is a lovely central creature, cute and curious at the beginning and later imposing and magnificent. Though there were obvious budget constraints, Magnus remains interesting and believable throughout, and his arc is dynamic and will be particularly exciting for younger viewers, though the proceedings do get a bit violent for tiny tots.[17] Jarod Walker from Filmink reviewed the film with a 10 out of 20 rating stating My Pet Dinosaur is a "Spielbergian adventure that will amuse the kids but adults will find it under budget and highly derivative."[18]
