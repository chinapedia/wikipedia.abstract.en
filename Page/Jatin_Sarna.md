He appears in _Sacred Games_, an original Netflix series directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap.[4]


Personal life

Jatin was born and brought up in a Punjabi family in New Delhi, India. He is a commerce graduate and did his B.Com from Delhi University. In 2006, he joined Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts and completed his 2 years course in acting and later served there as a repertory actor till 2011.


Career

After completing his acting course, Jatin acted in several plays including _Spartacus, The Seagull, Hamlet, Veer Abhimanyu, Gangster Samiti, Khidki_ and _Maharathi_. He has acted in more than 25 plays.[5][6] His play _Gangster Samiti_ got tremendous response from both the audiences and critics.[7] He acted in the television series _Zindagi Dot Com_, _Faujji...The Iron Man_ and ''Kyunki Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai. He also appeared in a TV commercial for Murugappa Group.[8]

Jatin's first film role came in director Rakesh Ranjan Kumar's _Dear Friend Hitler_ (2011), which was released as _Gandhi to Hitler_ in India. He next appeared as Javed in _Oass_ in 2012. In the same year he acted in a short film, _A Perfect Murder_, which won numerous awards at the Delhi 48 Hour Film Project including Best Actor award for Jatin. He then made brief appearances in films like _Chor Chor Super Chor_, _O Teri_ and _Unfreedom_, however none of the films could garner the needed attention.

In 2015, he bagged a key role in Zeishan Quadri's _Meeruthiya Gangsters_, which had an ensemble cast including Jaideep Ahlawat, Aakash Dahiya, Nushrat Bharucha, Sanjay Mishra and Mukul Dev. His portrayal of Sanjay 'Foreigner'[9] in the film got him rave reviews.[10] In 2016, he appeared in writer director Sanjeev Sharma's _Saat Uchakkey_ as Babbe Tashni. Despite having a stellar cast of Manoj Bajpayee, Vijay Raaz, Kay Kay Menon, Annu Kapoor and Anupam Kher, the film failed to impress the critics as well as the audiences.[11] On_the_sets_of_'Saat_Uchakkey'.jpg with Aparshakti Khurana, Kay Kay Menon, Vijay Raaz, Manoj Bajpayee]]

He recently appeared in _On Camera with Ravie_ and shared his experiences and journey in Bollywood.[12][13]

On 8 July 2017, the Delhi premiere of his award winning short film _Rage_ was held at Instituto Cervantes, Connaught Place, New Delhi, as a part of Whatashort Independent International Film Festival.[14]

He is currently shooting for _Sacred Games_,[15][16] an original Netflix series directed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane based on Sacred Games (novel) by Vikram Chandra (novelist). He plays Deepak "Bunty" Shinde, a pivotal character in the series.[17]
