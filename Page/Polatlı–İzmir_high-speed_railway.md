The POLATLI–İZMIR HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY is a long high-speed railway currently under construction in Turkey. Once completed, it will be the longest high-speed railway in the country, surpassing the Istanbul-Ankara HSR which holds the title since 2009.

The railway will split from the Polatlı-Konya high-speed railway about south of Polatlı junction, where the Polatlı-Konya HSR splits from the Istanbul-Ankara HSR, and head west to Afyonkarahisar, then it will parallel the Izmir-Afyon railway to Menemen, where it will join the railway just north of İzmir. Travel times between Ankara-Afyon and Ankara-Izmir will be 1 hour, 30 minutes and 3 hours, 30 minutes respectively.
