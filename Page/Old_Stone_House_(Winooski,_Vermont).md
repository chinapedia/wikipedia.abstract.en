The OLD STONE HOUSE is a historic house at 73 East Allen Street in central Winooski, Vermont. Built about 1790, it is the city's oldest building. It has served as a tavern, and as residences, and is now in use as professional offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.[1]


Description and history

The Old Stone House stands a short way east of Winooski's central Rotary Park, on the north side of East Allen Street between Cascade Way and Abenaki Way. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, built out of rough-cut stone and capped by a side gable roof. It has a five-bay front facade, with sash windows in the outer bays set in rectangular openings. The front entrance is at the center, flanked by wide sidelight windows, and there is a second doorway above on the second level, set at a recess with an iron balustrade across the lower part of the opening. A wood-frame addition, which is nearly as old as the main block, extends to the rear.[2]

The house was supposedly built around 1790 by Roswell Butler, and is the city's only surviving building from the period immediately following the American Revolutionary War. It served as a public accommodation (at times a tavern, but also for some time as a hotel) until 1826, with the rear addition added in 1793. It was then converted into a multi-unit residential apartment house, a use that was abandoned in the 1960s.[3] It now houses professional offices.
