_BRETWALDA_ (also _BRYTENWALDA_ and _BRETENANWEALDA_, sometimes capitalised) is an Old English word. The first record comes from the late 9th-century _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_. It is given to some of the rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention. The term _bretwalda_ also appears in a 10th-century charter of Æthelstan. The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either 'wide-ruler' or 'Britain-ruler'.

The rulers of Mercia were generally the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings from the mid 7th century to the early 9th century but are not accorded the title of _bretwalda_ by the _Chronicle_, which had an anti-Mercian bias. The _Annals of Wales_ continued to recognise the kings of Northumbria as "Kings of the Saxons" until the death of Osred I of Northumbria in 716.

Etymology

The first syllable of the term _bretwalda_ may be related to _Briton_ or _Britain_. The second element is taken to mean 'ruler' or 'sovereign', though is more literally 'wielder'. Thus, this interpretation would mean 'sovereign of Britain' or 'wielder of Britain'.[1][2] The word may be a compound containing the Old English adjective _brytten_ (from the verb _breotan_ meaning 'to break' or 'to disperse'),[3] an element also found in the terms _bryten rice_ ('kingdom'), _bryten-grund_ ('the wide expanse of the earth') and _bryten cyning_ ('king whose authority was widely extended'). Though the origin is ambiguous, the draughtsman of the charter issued by Æthelstan used the term in a way that can only mean 'wide-ruler'.[4]

The latter etymology was first suggested by John Mitchell Kemble[5] who alluded that "of six manuscripts in which this passage occurs, one only reads _Bretwalda_: of the remaining five, four have _Bryten-walda_ or _-wealda_, and one _Breten-anweald_, which is precisely synonymous with Brytenwealda"; that Æthelstan was called _brytenwealda ealles ðyses ealondes_,[6] which Kemble translates as 'ruler of all these islands'; and that _bryten-_ is a common prefix to words meaning 'wide or general dispersion' and that the similarity to the word _bretwealh_ ('Briton') is "merely accidental".[7]


Contemporary use

The first recorded use of the term _Bretwalda_ comes from a West Saxon chronicle of the late 9th century that applied the term to Ecgberht, who ruled Wessex from 802 to 839.[8] The chronicler also wrote down the names of seven kings that Bede listed in his _Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum_ in 731.[9] All subsequent manuscripts of the _Chronicle_ use the term _Brytenwalda_, which may have represented the original term or derived from a common error.

There is no evidence that the term was a title that had any practical use, with implications of formal rights, powers and office, or even that it had any existence before the 9th-century. Bede wrote in Latin and never used the term and his list of kings holding _imperium_ should be treated with caution, not least in that he overlooks kings such as Penda of Mercia, who clearly held some kind of dominance during his reign. Similarly, in his list of bretwaldas, the West Saxon chronicler ignored such Mercian kings as Offa.

The use of the term _Bretwalda_ was the attempt by a West Saxon chronicler to make some claim of West Saxon kings to the whole of Great Britain. The concept of the overlordship of the whole of Britain was at least recognised in the period, whatever was meant by the term. Quite possibly it was a survival of a Roman concept of "Britain": it is significant that, while the hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in charters often included the title _rex Britanniae_, when England was unified the title used was _rex Angulsaxonum_, ('king of the Anglo-Saxons'.)


Modern interpretation by historians

For some time, the existence of the word _bretwalda_ in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which was based in part on the list given by Bede in his _Historia Ecclesiastica_, led historians to think that there was perhaps a "title" held by Anglo-Saxon overlords. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian Frank Stenton said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that "his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings".[10] He argued that the term _bretwalda_ "falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions".

Over the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged. Patrick Wormald interpreted it as "less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status" and emphasised the partiality of its usage in favour of Southumbrian rulers.[11] In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that "it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England".[12] The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one.[13] In 1995, Simon Keynes observed that "if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state".[14]

Modern interpretations view the concept of _bretwalda_ overlordship as complex and an important indicator of how a 9th-century chronicler interpreted history and attempted to insert the increasingly powerful Saxon kings into that history.


Overlordship

A complex array of dominance and subservience existed during the Anglo-Saxon period. A king who used charters to grant land in another kingdom indicated such a relationship. If a king held sway over a large kingdom, such as when the Mercians dominated the East Anglians, the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of the Mercian dominance of the Hwicce, which was a comparatively small kingdom. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late 7th though 8th centuries, though Mercian kings are missing from the two main "lists". For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria and he regarded powerful kings such as the pagan Penda as standing in the way of the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. Bede omits them from his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly powerful Mercia kings such as Offa are missed out of the West Saxon _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.
