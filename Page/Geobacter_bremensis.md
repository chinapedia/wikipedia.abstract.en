_GEOBACTER BREMENSIS_ is a gram-negative, metal-reducing species of proteobacteria. Isolates of this species were initially discovered in samples of mud from ditches in Bremen, Germany. Isolates of the related species _Geobacter pelophilus_ were found in the same source.[1]

Isolates of _G. bremensis_ have been tested for their use in producing electricity.[2]
