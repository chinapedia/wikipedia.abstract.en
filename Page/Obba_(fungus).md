_OBBA_ is a genus of three species of poroid, white rot crust fungi in the family Gelatoporiaceae. The genome sequence of the type species, _O. rivulosa_, was reported in 2016.[1]


Taxonomy

The genus was circumscribed in 2012 by mycologists Otto Miettinen and Mario Rajchenberg. The three species are members of the _Cinereomyces_ clade, a grouping of phylogenetically related fungi distinct from the core polyporoid clade. _O. rivulosa_ was introduced to science by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1869 as _Polyporus rivulosus_.[2] The type species, _O. valdiviana_,[3] was originally described as a variety of _Ceriporiopsis rivulosa_ by Rajchenberg in 1995.[4] The genus was formally transferred to the new family Gelatoporiaceae in 2017.[5]

The generic name _Obba_ alludes to the similarity of the bottle-shaped cystidioles characteristic of the genus to the household containers for liquids used in Rome.[6]


Description

_Obba_ species have crust-like fruit bodies that are white (when young) or cream to ochre (when dry). They range in length from a few millimetres up to long, and are about 3 mm thick. _Obba_ has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae, and these hyphae have clamp connections.[7]


Habitat and distribution

_Obba_ causes a white rot in the trunks of both gymnosperms and angiosperms. _Obba_ species have been recorded in subtropical and boreal zones. _O. valdiviana_ occurs in southern Argentina and Chile, and has been recorded a couple of times from Australia. _O. rivulosa_ is found in the Caribbean, Europe, North America, and South America.[8] _O. thailandica_ was described from Thailand in 2017. It was found growing on charred pine wood.[9]
