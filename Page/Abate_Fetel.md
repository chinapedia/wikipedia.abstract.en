The ABATE FETEL or ABBÉ FETEL is a cultivar of the European Pear (_Pyrus communis_).

Originally of France, it was obtained by the abbot Fetel – hence the name – who started working on it in 1865, when he was the priest of Chessy, Rhône, and using several local cultivars as a starting point. Fetel was later transferred to Charentay, where he continued his hybridisations, ultimately obtaining the 'Abate Fetel' after a few years.[1]

Nowadays, the 'Abate Fetel' pear is the most produced and exported pear cultivar in Italy. It is mostly cultivated in the Emilia-Romagna region which is a Protected Geographical Indication for this cultivar. Another important producer country is Argentina.[2]
In Italy the 'Abate Fetel' is usually harvested in September; it maintains its quality for up to 23 weeks of cold storage. A characteristic feature is its elongated shape which is easily recognizable by consumers.[3]
