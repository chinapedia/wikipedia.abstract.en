C60a.png C20_Fullerene.png Carbon_nanotube_zigzag_povray_cropped.PNG C60-Fulleren-kristallin.JPG A FULLERENE is an allotrope of carbon whose molecule consists of carbon atoms connected by single and double bonds so as to form a closed or partially closed mesh, with fused rings of five to seven atoms. The molecule may be a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, or many other shapes and sizes. Graphene (isolated atomic layers of graphite), which is a flat mesh of regular hexagonal rings, can be seen as an extreme member of the family.

Fullerenes with a closed mesh topology are informally denoted by their empirical formula C_(_n_), often written C_n_, where _n_ is the number of carbon atoms. However, for some values of _n_ there maybe more than one isomer.

The family is named after buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀), the most famous member, which in turn is named after Buckminster Fuller. The closed fullerenes, especially C₆₀, are also informally called BUCKYBALLS for their obvious resemblance to the standard ball of association football ("soccer"). Nested closed fullerenes have been named BUCKY ONIONS. Cylindrical fullerenes are also called carbon nanotubes or BUCKYTUBES. The bulk solid form of pure or mixed fullerenes is called FULLERITE.

Fullerenes had been predicted for some time, but only after their accidental synthesis in 1985 were they detected in nature [1][2] and outer space.[3][4] The discovery of fullerenes greatly expanded the number of known allotropes of carbon, which had previously been limited to graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon such as soot and charcoal. They have been the subject of intense research, both for their chemistry and for their technological applications, especially in materials science, electronics, and nanotechnology.[5]


History

Predictions and limited observations

The icosahedral cage was mentioned in 1965 as a possible topological structure.[6] Eiji Osawa currently of Toyohashi University of Technology predicted the existence of in 1970.[7][8] He noticed that the structure of a corannulene molecule was a subset of the shape of a soccer ball, and hypothesised that a full ball shape could also exist. Japanese scientific journals reported his idea, but neither it nor any translations of it reached Europe or the Americas.

Also in 1970, R. W. Henson (then of the UK Atomic Energy Research Establishment) proposed the structure and made a model of it. Unfortunately, the evidence for that new form of carbon was very weak at the time, so the proposal was met with skepticism, and was never published. It was acknowledged only in 1999.[9][10]

In 1973, independently from Henson, a group of scientists from the USSR made a quantum-chemical analysis of the stability of and calculated its electronic structure. The paper was published in 1973,[11] but the scientific community did not give much importance to this theoretical prediction.

Around 1980, Sumio Iijima identified the molecule of C60 from an electron microscope image of carbon black, where it formed the core of a particle with the structure of a "bucky onion".[12]

Discovery of

In 1985 Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex, working with James R. Heath, Sean O'Brien, Robert Curl and Richard Smalley from Rice University, discovered fullerenes in the sooty residue created by vaporising carbon in a helium atmosphere. In the mass spectrum of the product, discrete peaks appeared corresponding to molecules with the exact mass of sixty or seventy or more carbon atoms, namely and . The team identified their structure as the now familiar "buckyballs".[13]

The name "buckminsterfullerene" was eventually chosen for by the discoverers as an homage to American architect Buckminster Fuller for the vague similarity of the structure to the geodesic domes which he popularized; which, if they were extended to a full sphere, would also have the icosahedral symmetry group.[14] The "ene" ending was chosen to indicate that the carbons are unsaturated, being connected to only three other atoms instead of the normal four. The shortened named "fullerene" eventually came to be applied to the whole family.

Kroto, Curl, and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry[15] for their roles in the discovery of this class of molecules.

Further developments

Kroto and the Rice team already discovered other fullerenes besides C60,[16] and the list was much expanded in the following years. Carbon nanotubes were first discovered and synthesized in 1991.[17][18]

After their discovery, minute quantities of fullerenes were found to be produced in sooty flames, and by lightning discharges in the atmosphere.[19] In 1992, fullerenes were found in a family of minerals known as shungites in Karelia, Russia.[20].

The production techniques were improved by many scientists, including Donald Huffman, Wolfgang Krätschmer, Lowell D. Lamb, and Konstantinos Fostiropoulos. Thanks to their efforts, by 1990 it was relatively easy to produce gram-sized samples of fullerene powder. Fullerene purification remains a challenge to chemists and to a large extent determines fullerene prices.

In 2010, the spectral signatures of C₆₀ and C₇₀ were observed by NASA's Spitzer infrared telescope in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a star 6500 light years away.[21] Kroto commented: "This most exciting breakthrough provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has, as I long suspected, existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy."[22] According to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, "It’s possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth."[23] In 2019, ionized C60 molecules were detected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the space between those stars.[24][25]


Types

There are two major families of fullerenes, with fairly distinct properties and applications: the closed buckyballs and the open-ended cylindrical carbon nanotubes.[26] However, hybrid structures exist between those two classes, such as carbon nanobuds — nanotubes capped by hemispherical meshes or larger "buckybuds".

Buckyballs

Buckminsterfullerene

Buckminsterfullerene is the smallest fullerene molecule containing pentagonal and hexagonal rings in which no two pentagons share an edge (which can be destabilizing, as in pentalene). It is also most common in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in soot.

The empirical formula of buckminsterfullerene is and its structure is a truncated icosahedron, which resembles an association football ball of the type made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.

The van der Waals diameter of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 1.1 nanometers (nm).[27] The nucleus to nucleus diameter of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 0.71 nm.

The buckminsterfullerene molecule has two bond lengths. The 6:6 ring bonds (between two hexagons) can be considered "double bonds" and are shorter than the 6:5 bonds (between a hexagon and a pentagon). Its average bond length is 1.4 angstroms.

Other fullerenes

Another fairly common fullerene has empirical formula ,[28] but fullerenes with 72, 76, 84 and even up to 100 carbon atoms are commonly obtained.

The smallest possible fullerene is the dodecahedral . There are no fullerenes with 22 vertices.[29] The number of different fullerenes C_(2n) grows with increasing _n_ = 12, 13, 14, ..., roughly in proportion to _n_⁹ . For instance, there are 1812 non-isomorphic fullerenes . Note that only one form of , buckminsterfullerene, has no pair of adjacent pentagons (the smallest such fullerene). To further illustrate the growth, there are 214,127,713 non-isomorphic fullerenes , 15,655,672 of which have no adjacent pentagons. Optimized structures of many fullerene isomers are published and listed on the web.[30]

Heterofullerenes have heteroatoms substituting carbons in cage or tube-shaped structures. They were discovered in 1993[31] and greatly expand the overall fullerene class of compounds. Notable examples include boron, nitrogen (azafullerene), oxygen, and phosphorus derivatives.

Trimetasphere carbon nanomaterials were discovered by researchers at Virginia Tech and licensed exclusively to Luna Innovations. This class of novel molecules comprises 80 carbon atoms () forming a sphere which encloses a complex of three metal atoms and one nitrogen atom. These fullerenes encapsulate metals which puts them in the subset referred to as metallofullerenes. Trimetaspheres have the potential for use in diagnostics (as safe imaging agents), therapeutics[32] and in organic solar cells.[33]

Carbon nanotubes

Kohlenstoffnanoroehre_Animation.gif shows its 3D structure.]] Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical fullerenes. These tubes of carbon are usually only a few nanometres wide, but they can range from less than a micrometer to several millimeters in length. They often have closed ends, but can be open-ended as well. There are also cases in which the tube reduces in diameter before closing off. Their unique molecular structure results in extraordinary macroscopic properties, including high tensile strength, high electrical conductivity, high ductility, high heat conductivity, and relative chemical inactivity (as it is cylindrical and "planar" — that is, it has no "exposed" atoms that can be easily displaced). One proposed use of carbon nanotubes is in paper batteries, developed in 2007 by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.[34] Another highly speculative proposed use in the field of space technologies is to produce high-tensile carbon cables required by a space elevator.


Derivatives

Buckyballs and carbon nanotubes have been used as building blocks for a great variety of derivatives and larger structures, such as [35]

-   Nested buckyballs ("carbon nano-onions" or "buckyonions")[36]proposed for lubricants;[37]
-   Nested carbon nanotubes ("carbon megatubes")[38]
-   Linked "ball-and-chain" dimers (two buckyballs linked by a carbon chain)[39]
-   Rings of buckyballs linked together.[40]


Heterofullerenes and non-carbon fullerenes

After the discovery of C60, many fullerenes have been synthesized (or studied theoretically by molecular modeling methods) in which some or all the carbon atoms are replaced by other elements. Inorganic nanotubes, in particular, have attracted much attention.

Silicon

Silicon buckyballs have been created around metal ions.

Boron

A type of buckyball which uses boron atoms, instead of the usual carbon, was predicted and described in 2007. The structure, with each atom forming 5 or 6 bonds, is predicted to be more stable than the buckyball.[41] One reason for this given by the researchers is that is actually more like the original geodesic dome structure popularized by Buckminster Fuller, which uses triangles rather than hexagons. However, this work has been subject to much criticism by quantum chemists[42][43] as it was concluded that the predicted I_(h) symmetric structure was vibrationally unstable and the resulting cage undergoes a spontaneous symmetry break, yielding a puckered cage with rare T_(h) symmetry (symmetry of a volleyball).[44] The number of six-member rings in this molecule is 20 and number of five-member rings is 12. There is an additional atom in the center of each six-member ring, bonded to each atom surrounding it. By employing a systematic global search algorithm, later it was found that the previously proposed B80 fullerene is not global minimum for 80 atom boron clusters and hence can not be found in nature.[45] In the same paper by Sandip De et al., it was concluded that boron's energy landscape is significantly different from other fullerenes already found in nature hence pure boron fullerenes are unlikely to exist in nature.

Other elements

Inorganic (carbon-free) fullerene-type structures have been built with the disulfides of molybdenum (MoS₂), long used as a graphite-like lubricant, tungsten (WS₂), titanium (TiS₂) and niobium (NbS₂). These materials were found to be stable up to at least 350 tons/cm² (34.3 GPa).[46]


Main fullerenes

Below is a table of main closed carbon fullerenes synthesized and characterized so far, with their CAS number when known.[47] Fullerenes with fewer than 60 carbon atoms have been called "lower fullerenes", and those with more than 70 atoms "higher fullerenes".

[TABLE]

In the table, "Num.Isom." is the number of possible isomers within the "isolated pentagon rule", which states that two pentagons in a fullerene should not share edges.[48] "Mol.Symm." is the symmetry of the molecule,[49][50], whereas "Cryst.Symm." is that of the crstalline framework in the solid state. Both are specified for the most experimentally abundant form(s). The asterisk * marks symmetries with more than one chiral form.

When or crystals are grown from toluene solution they have a monoclinic symmetry. The crystal structure contains toluene molecules packed between the spheres of the fullerene. However, evaporation of the solvent from transforms it into a face-centered cubic form.[51] Both monoclinic and face-centered cubic (fcc) phases are known for better-characterized {{chem and [[C70_fullerene|
