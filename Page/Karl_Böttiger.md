KARL AUGUST BÖTTIGER (8 June 1760 – 17 November 1835) was a German archaeologist and classicist, and a prominent member of the literary and artistic circles in Weimar and Jena.[1]


Biography

Böttiger was born in Reichenbach, in the kingdom of Saxony,[2] and educated at Schulpforta and Leipzig. Under the influence of Johann Gottfried Herder, he was for 13 years headmaster at the gymnasium and consistorial councillor[3] in Weimar, from 1790 to 1804. For the remaining 31 years of his life, he resided at Dresden as director of the Museum of Antiquities, and was active as a journalist and public lecturer. As a schoolmaster, he had published a considerable number of pedagogic and philological programs. In 1810, Böttiger with Swiss painter Heinrich Meyer released a monograph on the painting in the Vatican known as the "Aldobrandini marriage". His archaeological works, mainly produced at Dresden, fall into three groups:

The first of these is private antiquities, best represented by his _Sabina, or morning scenes in the dressing room of a wealthy Roman lady_ (; 1803, 2 vols.; 2nd ed., 1806), which was translated into French and served as a model for Wilhelm Adolf Becker's _Gallus_ and _Charicles_.[4] The second, the Greek theatre, which Böttiger had been interested in since his time as a drama critic in Weimar; his unfavorable review of August Wilhelm Schlegel's _Ion_ was withdrawn at the request of Goethe. It was mainly as a schoolmaster in Weimar that he wrote his papers on the distribution of the parts, on the masks and dresses, and on the machinery of the ancient stage, as well as a dissertation on the masks of the Furies in 1801. Thirdly, he worked in the domain of ancient art and mythology; his work in this area was popular but, according to some 20th-century critics, superficial.[5]

His accomplishments in Dresden led him to be noticed by the court of the Kingdom of Saxony, and he was the Aulic councilor of the kings of Saxony.[6] Böttiger supplied the descriptive letter-press to the 1797 German edition of Tischbein's reproductions from William Hamilton's second collection of Greek vases, and thus introduced the study of Greek vase-painting into Germany. He published lectures on the history of ancient sculpture in 1806, and painting in 1811, and edited the three volumes of an archaeological periodical called _Amalthea_ from 1820 to 1825, which included contributions from the most eminent classical archaeologists of the day.[7]

In 1832 Böttiger was elected a member of the French Institute.[8] He died in Dresden.[9] His pupil, who edited many of Böttiger's works after his death, was the German classicist Karl Julius Sillig.

His son, Karl Wilhelm Böttiger (15 August 1790 - 26 November 1862; not to be confused with the Swedish writer Carl Wilhelm Böttiger), was a historian and biographer of his father. He wrote _Karl August Böttiger. Eine biographische Skizze_, a biographical sketch (Leipzig, 1837). From his father's papers, he edited the posthumous work _Litterarische Zustände und Zeitgenossen_ (Literary circumstances and contemporaries, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1838).[10][11] Karl Wilhelm Böttiger contributed the history of Saxony to Heeren and Ukert's _Europäische Staatengeschichte_, and his _Allgemeine Geschichte für Schule und Haus_ (Universal history for school and home) and _Deutsche Geschichte für Schule und Haus_ (German history for school and home) passed through many editions. From 1821 until his death he was professor of history in Erlangen.[12]
