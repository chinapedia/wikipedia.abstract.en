After serving as mayor, he went on to serve terms as the tax collector for the Port of St. Paul as well as the inspector of steamboats. Kennedy pursued several other business interests including a stagecoach line and a successful venture gold mining in Montana, but remained most well known for his heavy involvement in the hotel business. He died on June 21, 1889. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery in St. Paul.[1][2]
