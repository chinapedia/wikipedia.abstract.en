JAN ZAJÍČEK (born 4 March 1977 in Prague, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech film director, screenwriter and artist.


Early life

002_SKARF_1997.jpg Jan Zajíček was born on 4 March 1977, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He studied fine art at the Václav Hollar School of Art and film directing at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU).[1][2] In 1992 he began to create graffiti art, one of the earliest graffiti artists in Czechoslovakia (under the pseudonym "Scarf" or "Skarf").[3] His experience with graffiti later influenced his strongly visual cinematic style, characterised by its combination of live-action with animation and visual effects.[4] Between 1993 and 2000 he was a member of the Czech hip hop group WWW,[5] which played in Prague venues including Alterna Komotovka, RC Bunkr, ROXY, and Rock Café, and in 1996 supported Sinéad O'Connor. During his studies and after graduation, he was a lecturer of experimental audio-visual production at the Josef Škvorecký Literary Academy.[6] Since 2010, he has been a resident at the MeetFactory Contemporary Art Centre.


Career

Music videos

His first video, for the song "Známka punku" (The Sign of Punk) by the Czech punk band Visací zámek,[7] was named Best Music Video of the Year by the Czech Music Academy.[8][9] Other videos that received attention included "Days Will Never Be the Same",[10] and "Meleme, meleme kávu" (Grinding the Coffee) by Czech hip hop artists Hugo Toxxx and Vladimir 518,[11] which received _Filter_ magazine's award for Best Music Video of the Year,[12] and was selected by the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen for screening during its MuVi programme in 2010.[13]

Theatre and stage design

In 2012, he created video content for the 60 metre screen at the Czech House for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. Along with Tomáš Mašín, he was also the co-director of Czech rock band Lucie's 2014 concert tour.[14]

Film

005_END_OF_INDIVIDUAL.jpg In 2003 Zajíček produced a short experimental student film, _The End of the Individual_ (), a study of the social structure of society on a model of one's own death. The film is a combination of 3D animation and live-action with a non-linear narrative. The film received several awards and was received positively internationally.[15] In 2010, he created the short video montage _Polys_ and contributed to the Czech pavilion at Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.[16][17]

He has also directed several commercials (for General Electric, ING, Nike, Skoda Auto, Kia Motors) and co-edited several documentaries. In 2011 he edited a documentary about the impact of corporate psychopaths upon society, and how the overuse of anti-depressants can result in erratic behavior; entitled _I Am Fishead_, it featured Peter Coyote, Philip Zimbardo, Václav Havel, Nicholas Christakis, Robert D. Hare and Christopher J. Lane.[18] He was a co-creator (with rapper Vladimir 518) of the Czech TV documentary series _Kmeny_ (Tribes), about urban subcultures,[19][20] and in 2015 he wrote and directed the show's episode about hackers.[21][22][23][24] In 2016 he wrote and co-directed (with the female Czech graffiti artist Sany) a documentary about female graffiti entitled _Girl Power_,[25][26] the first documentary on this topic.[27] It starred Martha Cooper, Lady Pink, and others, and was screened at cinemas and festivals all around the globe.
