Women have historically played minor roles in agriculture in the United Kingdom,[1] but the number of female farmers is rising rapidly in the 21st century. In 2008 there were 13,000 female farmers; by 2014 there were 23,000.[2][3]

A 2014 survey by _Farmers Weekly_ showed that 59% of women felt that agriculture was at least as good as other industries in equal opportunities for women. Women were also bringing money into farms through initially small diversifications into other businesses.[4] _Farmers Weekly_ ran a television show, _Farmers Apprentice_, presented by the Leicestershire dairy farmer Philippa Hall.[5] In March 2016, the then Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss celebrated International Women's Day with women farmers.[6] In Scotland, too, the government and the National Farmers Union Scotland are working to promote women in agriculture in the 21st century.[7] In February 2018, the 110 year old National Farmers' Union of England and Wales elected the beef farmer Minette Batters as their first female president.[8]
