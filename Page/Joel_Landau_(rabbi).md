Life and career

Early life and education

Joel Landau was born in Queens, New York, to a religious Zionist family. He spent his childhood in New York and Israel. In 1974 he and his family moved to Kefar Hanoar Hodayot, a village in Israel, and a few years later they moved to the Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.[3] This allowed him to get involved in the reclamation of Jewish owned property in the Moslem Quarter. Upon finishing high school he joined the "Shvut Yisrael” Hesder Yeshiva.[4] Joel Landau has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Empire State College, a teaching credential from Lipshitz College, ordination from the Chief Rabbinate in Jerusalem, and a post graduate degree in Judaic Studies issued by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.[5]

In 2004, Rabbi Joel Landau returned to Israel and became involved with Yad Ezra V’Shulamit, and through this organization he helped provide thousands of food baskets every week and distribute them to those in need across Israel.
