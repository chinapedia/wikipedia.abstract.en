History

In 2009, Lancaster's two daily newspapers, the morning _Intelligencer Journal_ and the evening _Lancaster New Era_, which were both published by Lancaster Newspapers (present-day LNP Media Group) and headquartered in the same building, were merged to form the INTELLIGENCER JOURNAL-LANCASTER NEW ERA. Though the Sunday sister paper, the _Sunday News_, joined the combined newsroom in 2012, it continued to be published under the same masthead until the rebranding in October 2014.

In 2014, the INTELLIGENCER JOURNAL-LANCASTER NEW ERA, as well as the _Sunday News_, were combined, rebranded, and renamed _LNP_. The first issue of the newly renamed _LNP_ was published on October 16, 2014.[4] Under its current masthead, _LNP_ adopted the tagline _Always Lancaster_.[5][6] The rebranding was "aimed at representing and embracing the history of Lancaster County," the brand and the audience, according to the publisher.[7] The slogan also alludes to the abbreviation that was used to refer to "Lancaster Newspapers" for much of the latter part of the 20th century. The paper was redesigned to include a more visually-appealing format and more user-friendly sections and pages.

LNP's current newsroom includes journalists from the former _The Intelligencer Journal_, _Lancaster New Era_ and _Sunday News_.

In May 2015, _LNP_ closed its newspaper printing facility in downtown Lancaster, citing the need to improve print quality and upgrade full color options required for every page in the newspaper.[8] _LNP_ newspapers are now printed at a newer facility owned by Advance Central Services Pennsylvania and the PA Media Group in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania, approximately 50 miles northwest of Lancaster.[9][10] The move allowed LNP to print an additional 60,000 newspapers on weekdays, as well as 80,000 more papers for its Sunday edition.[11]


Endorsements

On October 18, 2016, _LNP's_ editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the 2016 presidential election.[12]
