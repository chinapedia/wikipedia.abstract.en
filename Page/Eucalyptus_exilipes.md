_EUCALYPTUS EXILIPES_, commonly known as the FINE-LEAVED IRONBARK,[1] is a species of medium to tall tree and is endemic in Queensland. It has dark grey or black "ironbark", linear to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to shortened spherical fruit. It is similar to _E. crebra_, differing only in the length of the pedicels.


Description

_Eucalyptus exilipes_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, dark grey to black ironbark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have petiolate, dull greyish, linear leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs in July and August and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. This species is very similar to _E. crebra_, differing only slightly in the dimensions of the pedicels.[2]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus exilipes_ was first formally described in 1987 by Ian Brooker and Anthony Bean from a specimen they collected in the White Mountains in 1985. The description was published in the journal _Brunonia_.[3] The specific epithet (_exilipes_) is derived from Latin and refers to the slender pedicels of this species.[4]


Distributiont

The fine-leaved ironbark is only known from a few locations in north Queensland, including the White Mountains, Blackbraes National Park and north of Cooktown.[5]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus exilipes_ is classified as "least concern" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.[6]
