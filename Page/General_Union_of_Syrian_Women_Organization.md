The GENERAL UNION OF SYRIAN WOMEN (GUSW) is an organization that is not funded by the Syrian government but works closely with the government to promote equality from women. The GUSW has its own constitution, bylaws, and infrastructure outside of the government, They have made an effort to eliminate illiteracy among the women of Syria from the ages 6â€“12 to ensure that they can pursue their education when they grow up.[1] The GUSW advocates for rights beyond equality; they also fight against terrorism and promote literacy for women across their country so that everyone can earn an education in Syria not just men.
