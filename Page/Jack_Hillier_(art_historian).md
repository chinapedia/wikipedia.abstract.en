JACK RONALD HILLIER (29 August 1912 – 5 January 1995) was a British scholar of Japanese art.

Hillier was born on 29 August 1912 in Fulham, England. He left school at 15 and worked for an insurance company until 1967. During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force.

He became interested in Japanese ukiyo-e art in the 1940s, when it was at a low ebb in terms of interest from the West. He collected Japanese prints, books, and paintings. He taught himself to draw and make prints, and in 1951 had _Old Surrey Watermills_ published, with his own illustrations.

Hillier went on to become a leading European ukiyo-e scholar. He assisted in the formation of several collections, and catalogued collections by those such as Henri Vever. He was cataloguer for Japanese prints at Sotheby's for 25 years. Hillier had his first book on ukiyo-e, _Japanese Masters of the Colour Print_, published by Phaidon Press in 1954. He followed with the monographs _Hokusai_ in 1955, _Utamaro_ in 1961, and _Hokusai Drawings_ in 1966. Later books include _The Uninhibited Brush_ (1974), about the Shijō school of painting; _The Art of Hokusai in Book Illustration_ (1980); and _The Art of the Japanese Book_ (1987). Hillier eventually sold his Nanga and Shijō paintings to Oxford's Ashmolean Museum and his collection of books to the British Museum.

Hiller gave the Cohn Memorial Lecture at Oxford in 1977; he was the only speaker to deliver it who had never held an academic or museum post. He was subject to a Festschrift on his 70th birthday in 1982. The Japanese government conferred on him the Rising Sun with Gold Rays and Rosette.

Hillier married Mary Louise Palmer in 1938, with whom he had a son and daughter. He died in Redhill, Surrey, on 5 January 1995.
