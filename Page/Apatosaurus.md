_APATOSAURUS_ (;[1][2] meaning "deceptive lizard") is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period. Othniel Charles Marsh described and named the first-known species, _A. AJAX_, in 1877, and a second species, _A. LOUISAE_, was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. _Apatosaurus_ lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the late Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian age, and are now known from fossils in the Morrison Formation of modern-day Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Utah in the United States. _Apatosaurus_ had an average length of , and an average mass of . A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11–30% greater than average and a mass of .

The cervical vertebrae of _Apatosaurus_ are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of _Diplodocus_, a diplodocid like _Apatosaurus_, and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that _Apatosaurus_ was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. _Apatosaurus_ had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The _Apatosaurus_ skull, long thought to be similar to _Camarasaurus_, is much more similar to that of _Diplodocus_. _Apatosaurus_ was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, _Apatosaurus_ had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.

The skull of _Apatosaurus_ was confused with that of _Camarasaurus_ and _Brachiosaurus_ until 1909, when the holotype of _A. louisae_ was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of _Apatosaurus_ with a _Camarasaurus_ skull cast. Until 1970, _Apatosaurus_ skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to _Diplodocus_ were more likely from _Apatosaurus_.

_Apatosaurus_ is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more basal genera, with only _Amphicoelias_ and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only _Brontosaurus_ is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. _Brontosaurus_ has long been considered a junior synonym of _Apatosaurus_; its only species was reclassified as _A.excelsus_ in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that _Brontosaurus_ is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from _Apatosaurus_, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, _Apatosaurus_ would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as _Allosaurus_, _Camarasaurus_, _Diplodocus_, and _Stegosaurus_.


Description

Apatosaurus_scale_mmartyniuk_wiki.png'' (green)]] _Apatosaurus_ was a large, long-necked, quadrupedal animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hindlimbs. Most size estimates are based on specimen CM3018, the type specimen of _A.louisae_. In 1936 this was measured to be , by measuring the vertebral column.[3] Current estimates are similar, finding that the individual was long and had a mass of .[4][5][6] A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of _Dreadnoughtus_, _Apatosaurus_, and _Giraffatitan_ estimates CM3018 at , similar in mass to _Dreadnoughtus_.[7] Past estimates have put the creature's mass as high as .[8] Some specimens of _A.ajax_ (such as OMNH1670) represent individuals 1130% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM3018 or , potentially rivalling the largest titanosaurs.[9] Apatosaurus_ajax_skull.jpg

The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet.[10] The snout of _Apatosaurus_ and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only _Nigersaurus_ having a squarer skull.[11] The braincase of _Apatosaurus_ is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids.[12] Some skulls of _Apatosaurus_ have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.[13] Apatosaurus_ajax_holotype_cervical.png 1860) in side and anterior view]] Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck.[14] The vertebral formula for the holotype of _A.louisae_ is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species.[15] The cervical vertebrae of _Apatosaurus_ and _Brontosaurus_ are stouter and more robust than those of other diplodocids and were found to be most similar to _Camarasaurus_ by Charles Whitney Gilmore.[16][17] In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section.[18] In _Apatosaurus louisae_, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated.[19] _Apatosaurus_ has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body.[20] The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. _Apatosaurus_, like its close relative _Supersaurus_, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. _Apatosaurus_ also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest.[21] As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.[22]

Apatosaurus_louisae_by_durbed.jpg of _A. louisae_]] The limb bones are also very robust.[23] Within Apatosaurinae, the scapula of _Apatosaurus louisae_ is intermediate in morphology between those of _A.ajax_ and _Brontosaurus excelsus_. The arm bones are stout, so the humerus of _Apatosaurus_ resembles that of _Camarasaurus_, as well as _Brontosaurus_. However, the humeri of _Brontosaurus_ and _A.ajax_ are more similar to each other than they are to _A.louisae_. In 1936 Charles Gilmore noted that previous reconstructions of _Apatosaurus_ forelimbs erroneously proposed that the radius and ulna could cross; in life they would have remained parallel.[24] _Apatosaurus_ had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than _Shunosaurus_.[25][26] The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one.[27] The single manual claw bone (ungual) is slightly curved and squarely truncated on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust ilia, and the fused (co-ossified) pubes and ischia. The femora of _Apatosaurus_ are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of _Diplodocus_ but are nearly indistinguishable from those of _Camarasaurus_. The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of _Apatosaurus_ has three claws on the innermost digits; the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. The first metatarsal is the stoutest, a feature shared among diplodocids.[28][29]


Discovery and species

Apatosaurus_ajax_sacrum.jpg The name _Apatosaurus ajax_ was coined in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, Professor of Paleontology at Yale University, based on a nearly complete skeleton (holotype, YPM1860) discovered in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Gunnison County, Colorado.[30][31][32] The composite term _Apatosaurus_ comes from the Greek words _apatē_ ()/_apatēlos_ () meaning "deception"/"deceptive", and _sauros_ () meaning "lizard";[33] thus, "deceptive lizard". Marsh gave it this name based on the chevron bones, which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs; instead, the chevron bones of _Apatosaurus_ showed similarities with those of mosasaurs.[34][35] During excavation and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another _Apatosaurus_ individual originally described as _Atlantosaurus immanis_; as a consequence, some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence.[36] Marsh distinguished the new genus _Apatosaurus_ from _Atlantosaurus_ on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae, with _Apatosaurus_ possessing three and _Atlantosaurus_ four. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at Como Bluff, Wyoming. He gave this specimen a new name based on the conventions of his age and the relatively sparse fossil record available at that time. It was later recognised that the features he had used to distinguish genera and species were in fact more widespread among sauropods.[37][38] He named the new species _Brontosaurus excelsus_.[39] All specimens currently considered _Apatosaurus_ were from the Morrison Formation, the location of the excavations of Marsh and his rival Edward Drinker Cope.[40]

Sharp_lull_brontosaurus.jpg]] Another specimen, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, which is occasionally assigned to _Apatosaurus_, is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted.[41] The specimen was found north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1898 by Walter Granger, and took the entire summer to extract.[42] To complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of _Diplodocus_which was later found to be more accuratebut was based on "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries".[43][44][45][46] These skulls were likely those of _Camarasaurus_, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find _Apatosaurus_ skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was "largely conjectural and based on that of _Morosaurus_" (now _Camarasaurus_).[47] FMNH_Apatosaurus_Pano.jpg]] In 1903 Elmer Riggs published a study that described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described _Brontosaurus_. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both _Brontosaurus_ and _Apatosaurus ajax_, Riggs realized that the holotype of _A.ajax_ was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since _Apatosaurus_ was the earlier name, _Brontosaurus_ should be considered a junior synonym of _Apatosaurus_. Because of this, Riggs recombined _Brontosaurus excelsus_ as _Apatosaurus excelsus_. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to _Apatosaurus_, Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to _A.excelsus_.[48]

Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the _Apatosaurus_ mount of the American Museum of Natural History _Brontosaurus_.[49][50] Because of this decision the name _Brontosaurus_ was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered _Apatosaurus_, and the museum's popularity meant that _Brontosaurus_ became one of the best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[51] Apatosaurus_louisae_side_(Morrison_Formation,_Upper_Jurassic;_Carnegie_Quarry,_Dinosaur_National_Monument,_northeastern_Utah,_USA).jpg It was not until 1909 that an _Apatosaurus_ skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was found a short distance from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species _Apatosaurus louisae_, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of _Diplodocus_.[52] Another smaller skeleton of _A.louisae_ was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018.[53] The skull was accepted as belonging to the _Apatosaurus_ specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton.[54] After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a _Camarasaurus_ skull on the mount.[55]

While most other museums were using cast or sculpted _Camarasaurus_ skulls on _Apatosaurus_ mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a _Camarasaurus_, with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 illustration of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.[56] Apatosaurus_Einstein.jpg No _Apatosaurus_ skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of _Diplodocus_ and _Apatosaurus_. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that _Apatosaurus_ had a _Diplodocus_-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to _Diplodocus_ might instead be those of _Apatosaurus_. They reassigned multiple skulls to _Apatosaurus_ based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that _Apatosaurus_ might have possessed a _Camarasaurus_-like skull, based on a disarticulated _Camarasaurus_-like tooth found at the precise site where an _Apatosaurus_ specimen was found years before.[57] On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of _Apatosaurus_ was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie.[58] In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to _Brachiosaurus_.[59] In 2011 the first specimen of _Apatosaurus_ where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMCVP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from _A.louisae_, but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with _A.ajax_.[60] Another well-preserved skull is Brigham Young University specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western Colorado.[61] Brontosaurus_infographic.svg Almost all modern paleontologists agreed with Riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name _Apatosaurus_, having been published first, has priority as the official name; _Brontosaurus_ was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use.[62][63][64][65] Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that _A.ajax_ and _A.excelsus_ were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.[66]

In 2015 Emanuel Tschopp, Octávio Mateus, and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that _A.ajax_ and _A.louisae_ differ in twelve characters, and _Diplodocus carnegiei_ and _D.hallorum_ differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in _D.carnegiei_ and _A.louisae_, but five differing features in _B.excelsus_. Therefore, Tschopp etal. argued that _Apatosaurus excelsus_, originally classified as _Brontosaurus excelsus_, had enough morphological differences from other species of _Apatosaurus_ that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of _Apatosaurus_ species compared to _B.excelsus_. Other species previously assigned to _Apatosaurus_, such as _Elosaurus parvus_ and _Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin_ were also reclassified as _Brontosaurus_. Some features proposed to separate _Brontosaurus_ from _Apatosaurus_ include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the acromial edge and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the astragalus 0.55 or greater.[67] Sauropod expert Michael Daniel D'Emic pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name _Brontosaurus_ again if newer analyses obtained different results.[68] Mammal palaeontologist Donald Prothero criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature, concluding that he would keep "Brontosaurus" in quotes and not treat the name as a valid genus.[69]

Valid species

AMNH_Apatosaurus.jpg as re-mounted in 1995]] Many species of _Apatosaurus_ have been designated from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of _Apatosaurus_. They found that _A.louisae_ was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a polytomy of _A.ajax_, _A.parvus_, and _A.excelsus_.[70] Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of _Apatosaurus_ slightly differently, and also supported separating _Brontosaurus_ from _Apatosaurus_.[71]

-   _APATOSAURUS AJAX_ was named by Marsh in 1877 after Ajax, a hero from Greek mythology.[72] Marsh designated the incomplete, juvenile skeleton YPM1860 as its holotype. The species is less studied than _Brontosaurus_ and _A.louisae_, especially because of the incomplete nature of the holotype. In 2005 many specimens in addition to the holotype were found assignable to _A.ajax_, YPM1840, NSMT-PV 20375, YPM1861, and AMNH460. The specimens date from the late Kimmeridgian to the early Tithonian ages.[73] In 2015 only the _A.ajax_ holotype YPM1860 assigned to the species, with AMNH460 found either to be within _Brontosaurus_, or potentially its own taxon. However, YPM1861 and NSMT-PV 20375 only differed in a few characteristics, and cannot be distinguished specifically or generically from _A.ajax_. YPM1861 is the holotype of _"Atlantosaurus" immanis_, which means it might be a junior synonym of _A.ajax_.[74]
-   _APATOSAURUS LOUISAE_ was named by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial skeleton that was found in Utah.[75] The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. _Apatosaurus louisae_ specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument.[76] In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of _Apatosaurus laticollis_ to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of _A.louisae_.[77]

Skeleton_of_Apatosaurus_ajax.jpg The cladogram below is the result of an analysis by Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). The authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus.[78]

Reassigned species

Einstein_Apatosaurus.jpg

-   _Apatosaurus grandis_ was named in 1877 by Marsh in the article that described _A.ajax_. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed.[79] Marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to _Apatosaurus_ when he reassigned it to his new genus _Morosaurus_ in 1878.[80] Since _Morosaurus_ has been considered a synonym of _Camarasaurus_, _C.grandis_ is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.[81]
-   _Apatosaurus excelsus_ was the original type species of _Brontosaurus_, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified _Brontosaurus_ as a synonym of _Apatosaurus_ in 1903, transferring the species _B.excelsus_ to _A.excelsus_. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus, so they reclassified it back into _Brontosaurus_.[82]
-   _Apatosaurus parvus_, first described from a juvenile specimen as _Elosaurus_ in 1902 by Peterson and Gilmore, was reassigned to _Apatosaurus_ in 1994, and then to _Brontosaurus_ in 2015. Many other, more mature specimens were assigned to it following the 2015 study.[83]
-   _Apatosaurus minimus_ was originally described as a specimen of _Brontosaurus_ sp. in 1904 by Osborn. In 1917 Henry Mook named it as its own species, _A.minimus_, for a pair of ilia and their sacrum.[84][85][86] In 2012 Mike P. Taylor and Matt J. Wedel published a short abstract describing the material of _A. minimus_, finding it hard to place among either Diplodocoidea or Macronaria. While it was placed with _Saltasaurus_ in a phylogenetic analysis, it was thought to represent instead some form with convergent features from many groups.[87] The study of Tschopp etal. did find that a camarasaurid position for the taxon was supported, but noted that the position of the taxon was found to be highly variable and there was no clearly more likely position.[88]
-   _Apatosaurus alenquerensis_ was named in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It was based on post cranial material from Portugal. In 1990 this material was reassigned to _Camarasaurus_, but in 1998 it was given its own genus, _Lourinhasaurus_.[89] This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where _Lourinhasaurus_ was found to be sister to _Camarasaurus_ and other camarasaurids.[90]
-   _Apatosaurus yahnahpin_ was named by James Filla and Patrick Redman in 1994. Bakker made _A.yahnahpin_ the type species of a new genus, _Eobrontosaurus_ in 1998,[91] and Tschopp reclassified it as _Brontosaurus yahnahpin_ in 2015.[92]


Classification

Apatosaurus_ajax_scapulocoracoid.jpg of _A. ajax_]] _Apatosaurus_ is a member of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including _Diplodocus_, _Supersaurus_, and _Barosaurus_. _Apatosaurus_ is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include _Suuwassea_, _Supersaurus_, and _Brontosaurus_.[93][94][95] Othniel Charles Marsh described _Apatosaurus_ as allied to _Atlantosaurus_ within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae.[96][97] In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including _Apatosaurus_, _Atlantosaurus_, _Morosaurus_ (=_Camarasaurus_) and _Diplodocus_. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped _Apatosaurus_ within Opisthocoelia.[98] Sauropoda is still used as the group name.[99] In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed _Apatosaurus_ a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than _Supersaurus_.[100][101]

Cladogram of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015).[102]


Palaeobiology

Infant_Apatosaurus_dinosaur_tracks.jpg It was believed throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like _Apatosaurus_ were too massive to support their own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.[103] A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of _Apatosaurus_ suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser.[104] It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae.[105] Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.[106]

A 2015 study of the necks of _Apatosaurus_ and _Brontosaurus_ found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of _Apatosaurus_ and _Brontosaurus_ were used for intraspecific combat.[107] Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.[108]

Trackways of sauropods like _Apatosaurus_ show that they may have had a range of around per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of per hour.[109] The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling, or to recoil after strides.[110] A trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism, though this is disputed.[111][112]

Neck posture

Apatosaurus33.jpg Diplodocids like _Apatosaurus_ are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like _Apatosaurus_ were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.[113][114][115]

Other studies by Taylor find that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. _Apatosaurus_, like _Diplodocus_, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture.[116][117] Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state _Apatosaurus_ had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally.[118] The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet.[119]

Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like _Diplodocus_ were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs.[120][121] The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of _Apatosaurus_ and _Diplodocus_. He found that the neck of _Apatosaurus_ was very flexible.[122]

Physiology

Apatosaurus_caudal_vertebrae.png

Given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like _Apatosaurus_, physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed. Beginning with the assumption that, like crocodilians, _Apatosaurus_ did not have a diaphragm, the dead-space volume (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about for a specimen. Paladino calculates its tidal volume (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at with an avian respiratory system, if mammalian, and if reptilian.[123]

On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been parabronchi, with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in avian lungs, and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of _Apatosaurus_ has been estimated at , allowing for a , four-chambered heart and a lung capacity. That would allow about for the necessary tissue.[124] Evidence for the avian system in _Apatosaurus_ and other sauropods is also present in the pneumaticity of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.[125]

James Spotila et al. (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat.[126] They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat.[127] Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain.[128] Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.[129]

James Farlow (1987) calculates that an _Apatosaurus_-sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents.[130] Assuming _Apatosaurus_ had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino etal. (1997) estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day.[131]

Growth

Baby_Apatosaurus_OMNH.jpg A 1999 microscopic study of _Apatosaurus_ and _Brontosaurus_ bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10years.[132] In 2008, a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, _Apatosaurus_ would have grown to 25t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15years, with growth peaking at in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found _Apatosaurus_ grew per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70years old.[133] These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling.[134] One of the first identified growth factors of _Apatosaurus_ was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature's maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936.[135]

Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler etal. (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded the _Apatosaurus_ sp.SMA0014 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 21years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated _Apatosaurus_ sp.BYU 601–17328 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 19years, and died aged 31.[136]

Juveniles

Compared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from _Apatosaurus_. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of _Apatosaurus_; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish _Apatosaurus_ from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus.[137][138] Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.[139]

Tail

An article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of _Apatosaurus_ tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like _Apatosaurus_ was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.[140]

A pathology has been identified on the tail of _Apatosaurus_, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints.[141] It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to _Shunosaurus_ and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.[142]


Paleoecology

Clash_of_Titans_Saurophaganax_and_Apatosaurus.jpg]] The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base,[143] and 146.8mya at the top,[144] placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains.[145] This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.[146]

Apatosaurus_ischium_Dinosaur_Journey_Museum.jpg _Apatosaurus_ was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after _Camarasaurus_.[147] _Apatosaurus_ may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs.[148] Fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of _Apatosaurus ajax_ are known exclusively from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. _A.louisae_ fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional _Apatosaurus_ remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species,[149] and thus may instead belong to _Brontosaurus_.[150]

The Morrison Formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs.[151] Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods _Allosaurus_, _Ceratosaurus_, _Ornitholestes_, _Saurophaganax_, and _Torvosaurus_; the sauropods _Brontosaurus_, _Brachiosaurus_, _Camarasaurus_, and _Diplodocus_; and the ornithischians _Camptosaurus_, _Dryosaurus_, and _Stegosaurus_.[152] _Apatosaurus_ is commonly found at the same sites as _Allosaurus_, _Camarasaurus_, _Diplodocus_, and _Stegosaurus_.[153] _Allosaurus_ accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web.[154] Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinhã Formationmainly _Allosaurus_, _Ceratosaurus_, and _Torvosaurus_or have a close counterpart_Brachiosaurus_ and _Lusotitan_, _Camptosaurus_ and _Draconyx_, and _Apatosaurus_ and _Dinheirosaurus_.[155] Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the _Araucaria_-like conifer _Brachyphyllum_.[156]
