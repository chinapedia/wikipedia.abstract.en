KRYPTONITE is a fictional material that appears primarily in Superman stories. In its most well-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman's home world of Krypton, that emits a peculiar radiation that weakens Superman, but is generally harmless to humans when exposed to it in short term. There are other varieties of kryptonite such as red and gold kryptonite which have different but still generally negative effects on Superman. Due to Superman's popularity _kryptonite_ has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with "Achilles' heel".[1]


Origin

_Action Comics Annual_ #10 (March 2007). Art by Art Adams and Alex Sinclair.]] An unpublished 1940 story titled "The K-Metal from Krypton", written by Superman creator Jerry Siegel, featured a prototype of kryptonite. It was a mineral from the planet Krypton that drained Superman of his strength while giving superhuman powers to mortals. This story was rejected because in it Superman reveals his identity to Lois.[2]

The mineral known as kryptonite was introduced in the radio serial _The Adventures of Superman_, in the story "The Meteor from Krypton", broadcast in June 1943.[3] An apocryphal story claims that kryptonite was introduced to give Superman's voice actor, Bud Collyer, the possibility to take a vacation at a time when the radio serial was performed live. In an episode where Collyer would not be present to perform, Superman would be incapacitated by kryptonite, and a substitute voice actor would make groaning sounds. This tale was recounted by Julius Schwartz in his memoir.[4] However, the historian Michael J. Hayde disputes this: in "The Meteor From Krypton", Superman is never exposed to kryptonite. If kryptonite allowed Collyer to take vacations, that was a fringe benefit discovered later. More likely, kryptonite was introduced as a plot device for Superman to discover his origin.[5]

In the radio serial, Krypton was located in the same solar system as Earth, in the same orbit, but on the opposite side of the Sun. This provided an easy explanation for how kryptonite found its way to Earth.

Kryptonite was incorporated into the comic mythos with _Superman_ #61 (November 1949).[6] Editor Dorothy Woolfolk stated in an interview with _Florida_ _Today_ in August 1993, that she "felt Superman's invulnerability was boring."[7]


Forms: colors and effects

Various forms of the fictional material have been created over the years in _Superman_ publications.

  GREEN KRYPTONITE                        Originally red in color, the material debuted in _Superman_ #61 (Nov. 1949) and did not adopt its characteristic green hue until _Action Comics_ #161 (Aug. 1951). Green kryptonite weakens Superman and other Kryptonians. It can and will kill them with long-term exposure. Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure experience severe muscular weakness, usually to the point of collapse, and excruciating pain, with both conditions progressively intensifying. Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure usually develop a fever and eventually will lose consciousness before death. Under kryptonite exposure, the blood of Kryptonians begins turning green, and their skin gradually assumes a green color. Although canonical depictions vary widely, the majority of accounts maintain that although kryptonite exposure victims experience severe weakness and pain, exposure in itself does not eradicate the victim's superpowers, except those related to physical strength. Therefore victims retain most of their visual and sensory powers, although kryptonite itself appears impervious to damage by heat vision. Kryptonite exposure does not compromise the subject's invulnerability to other forms of injury; therefore it is not a practical strategy for a villain to first expose the victim to kryptonite, then kill them with a gun or other conventional weapon. Some accounts maintain paralysis is an effect of kryptonite exposure, although most depictions show victims still capable of limited movement. Kryptonian characters have been shown to become immune to the effects of green kryptonite due to either long-term absorption of sunlight[8] or extremely high short-term exposure to the sun.[9] Post-_Crisis_ sources establish that green kryptonite is also harmful to humans; with sufficient long-term exposure, it can result in cancer, as Lex Luthor discovered from a ring with a kryptonite jewel he wore to ward off Superman's presence.[10]
  RED KRYPTONITE                          Debuted in _Adventure Comics_ #255 (Sept. 1958). Originally red kryptonite simply weakened Superman, but to a greater degree than green kryptonite. Red kryptonite was later described as causing odd behavior or bizarre transformations, albeit temporary and non-fatal. The effects of red kryptonite are sometimes described as lasting exactly 24 hours, but in other accounts the effects may persist up to three days. In the Smallville spin-off red kryptonite affects Clarks mental state and the effect wears off as soon as he stops being in close proximity to the stone.
  ANTI-KRYPTONITE/FOOL'S KRYPTONITE       Debuted in _Action Comics_ #252 (May 1959). Harmless to Kryptonians, but has the same effect as the green variety on normal humans. Anti-kryptonite is also the power source for one version of the character Ultraman, Superman's evil counterpart from an antimatter universe.[11]
  X-KRYPTONITE                            Debuted in _Action Comics_ #261 (Jan. 1960). Created by Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) in an unsuccessful attempt to find an antidote to green kryptonite. Harmless to Kryptonians, the mineral gives normal life-forms superhuman abilities, as in the case of Supergirl's pet cat Streaky. Revised in _Superman Family_ #203 (Oct. 1980) to have the same effect as the green variety on Kryptonians.
  BLUE KRYPTONITE                         Debuted in _Superman_ #140 (Oct. 1960). An imperfect form of kryptonite which affects the imperfect Superman duplicate Bizarro and members of the Bizarro League in the same way that green kryptonite affects Kryptonians. Kryptonians, however, are unaffected by it. Blue kryptonite is also the antidote to the random and bizarre effects of red kryptonite.
  WHITE KRYPTONITE                        Debuted in _Adventure Comics_ #279 (Dec. 1960). Kills all plant life from any world.
  RED-GREEN KRYPTONITE (FIRST VARIETY)    Debuted in _Action Comics_ #275 (April 1961). An alloy created by the villain Brainiac, the red-green kryptonite caused Superman to mutate, temporarily growing a third eye in the back of his head.
  GOLD KRYPTONITE                         Debuted in _Adventure Comics_ #299 (Aug. 1962). Kryptonite affected by atomic radiation, capable of permanently removing a Kryptonian's ability to process yellow sunlight, which nullifies all superhuman abilities. In post-_Crisis_ stories, this kryptonite only removes a Kryptonian's powers temporarily (in _Superman II_, the crystal chamber from Superman's Fortress of Solitude exhibited the same effect, although this process was reversed via Jor-El's green crystal).[12]
  RED-GREEN-BLUE-GOLD KRYPTONITE          Debuted in _Superman_ #162 (July 1963). An imaginary story in which Superman combines the minerals to power an intelligence-expanding device. An explosion occurs and the hero is split into two separate beings ("Superman-Red" and "Superman-Blue"), both of whom possess enhanced intelligence.
  SILVER KRYPTONITE                       Debuted in _Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen_ #70 (July 1963). Revealed by Jimmy Olsen to be a hoax. In post-_Crisis_ stories, silver kryptonite first appeared in _Superman/Batman_ #46 (April 2008), modeled after the version that appeared in the _Smallville_ TV series, season 5 episode 7 "Splinter", where Clark suffers paranoid delusions. Silver kryptonite causes Kryptonians to suffer from altered perceptions, loss of inhibitions, and extreme hunger cravings. On the _Supergirl_ TV series, this kryptonite causes Superman to hallucinate his "greatest fear" of an attacking General Zod during the final episode of season 2, "Nevertheless, She Persisted".
  JEWEL KRYPTONITE                        Debuted in _Action Comics_ #310 (March 1964). Fragments of Krypton's Jewel Mountains. Amplifies the psychic powers of the criminals imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, allowing them to project illusions or perform mind control.
  BIZARRO-RED KRYPTONITE                  Debuted in _Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen_ #80 (Oct. 1964). Affects humans in the same manner that red kryptonite affects Kryptonians.
  RED-GREEN KRYPTONITE (SECOND VARIETY)   Debuted in _Superboy Comics_ #121 (June 1965). This caused Superboy to lose his powers permanently, but the Phantom Zone criminal Vakox unwillingly cured him, restoring his powers.
  RED-GOLD KRYPTONITE                     Debuted in _Superman_ #178 (July 1965). Temporarily deprives Kryptonians of their memories.
  MAGNO-KRYPTONITE                        Debuted in _Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen_ #92 (April 1966). Created by the villain Mr. Nero, this variety is magnetically attracted to all substances originally from Krypton.
  RED-GREEN-GOLD KRYPTONITE               Debuted in _Superman_ #192 (Jan. 1967). An imaginary story in which the alloy permanently removes Superman's powers and memories of himself as Superman.
  SLOW KRYPTONITE                         Debuted in _The Brave and the Bold_ #175 (June 1981). A modified variety of green kryptonite produced by the supervillan Metallo that affects humans in a manner similar to green kryptonite.
  KRYPTONITE-X                            Debuted in _The Adventures of Superman_ #511 (April 1994). A one-time fluke, kryptonite-X was created when the Eradicator filtered a harmful barrage of kryptonite discharged by the villain the Cyborg Superman at Superman. The result was beneficial for Superman, supercharging him and restoring his ability to process solar radiation.
  PINK KRYPTONITE                         Debuted in _Supergirl_ vol. 4 #79 (April 2003). Pink kryptonite seemingly turns Kryptonians gay. This type of kryptonite was mentioned in a single panel in a story that was a satire of the plots of many Silver Age comic stories (such as those listed above) which featured some strange new variety of kryptonite. In the _Justice League Action_ short "True Colours" it switches a Kryptonian's gender.
  BLACK KRYPTONITE                        Debuted in _Supergirl_ #2 (vol. 5, Oct. 2005). In pre-_Flashpoint_ continuity, it could split a Kryptonian into two separate entities: one good and the other evil (the kryptonite manufactured by the villains of _Superman III_ had just such an effect on the Man of Steel). In _Dark Nights: Metal - The Batman Who Laughs_ #1, set on the Dark Multiverse's Earth -22, a Batman corrupted by the Joker creates a modified strand of black kryptonite. He tests this first on Supergirl, causing her to murder her family before dying. He then uses it again on Superman and Superboy, who literally tear apart Lois Lane before also dying themselves.
  ORANGE KRYPTONITE                       Debuted in _Krypto the Superdog_ #4 (Feb. 2007). Provides super abilities for 24 hours to any animal that comes into contact with it.
  PERIWINKLE KRYPTONITE                   Debuted in _Superman Family Adventures_ #9 (March 2013). A non-canon story. Exposure to periwinkle kryptonite causes Kryptonians to lose all inhibitions.

-   _Superboy_ (1988-1992) featured green kryptonite in the episodes: "Kryptonite Kills" and "Metallo", "Bride of Bizarro", "Kryptonite Kid", and "Obituary for a Super-Hero". The red variety was featured in the episode "Super Menace". A Bizarro White variant was featured in the episode "The Battle With Bizarro", which heals the title character.
-   _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_ (1993-1997) featured green kryptonite in the episodes "The Green, Green Glow of Home", "Barbarians at the Planet", "The House of Luthor", "Metallo", "Top Copy" and "Battleground Earth". The red variety was featured in the episodes "Individual Responsibility", "Ultrawoman" and "Lethal Weapon".
-   _Smallville_ (2001-2011) featured kryptonite on a regular basis. A large quantity of the green variety descends to Earth in a meteor shower, arriving in the town of Smallville, Kansas with the spaceship containing the infant Kal-El. The material is colloquially referred to by Smallville residents as "meteor rock", but is eventually called "kryptonite" by Clark Kent once he discovers his origins in season two episode "Visitor" (in real life, the area near Brenham, Kansas is known as the site of a major meteorite strike between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago).[13] Aside from being harmful to Clark Kent, the mineral produces bizarre changes in flora and fauna. It also occasionally bestows metahuman abilities on humans depending on the circumstances of their exposure to it, such as a girl treated for a rare bone disease acquiring shapeshifting powers. These people are commonly known by the inhabitants of Smallville as "Meteor Freaks". The green variety of the mineral appears in several episodes every season, although other varieties appear, including: red in "Red" (2002), "Exodus", "Exile", "Phoenix" (2003), "Unsafe" (2005), "Crimson" (2007) and "Upgrade" (2010); black, formed when superheating green kryptonite in "Crusade" (2004) and "Doomsday" (2009); silver in "Splinter" (2005); blue in "Blue" (2007), "Persona" (2008), "Kandor" (2009), "Salvation" (2010) and "Harvest" (2011); as a gem in "Persuasion" (2010) and gold in "Prophecy" and "Finale" (2011). _Smallville_ was the first appearance of a black kryptonite that would split a person into their good and evil halves, before later being brought into the comic canon in _Supergirl_ (vol. 5) #2 (Oct. 2005).
-   _Supergirl_ (2015–present) featured green kryptonite in the episodes: "Pilot", "Stronger Together", "Hostile Takeover", "For the Girl Who Has Everything", and "Distant Sun". In the second part of Arrowverse's 2017 crossover "Crisis on Earth-X," reveals that Green Arrow of Earth-1 somehow obtains samples of green kryptonite, and uses them to construct kryptonite arrows as deterrents against rogue Kryptonians such as Overgirl (Supergirl's parallel universe counterpart from Krypton-X) and Superman imposter John Deegan (on 2018 crossover "Elseworlds"). DEO manages to synthesize and create blue kryptonite which is featured in the episode "Bizarro". The red kryptonite is featured in the episode "Falling" as a failed attempt to recreate green kryptonite by Maxwell Lord. Silver kryptonite is featured in the episode "Nevertheless, She Persisted". In season 3, the black kryptonite is pivotal to its arc, first appearing in the episode "The Fanatical", in which it is being referred to as Harun-El by Kryptonians. The Worldkiller Coven from Krypton, headed by dark priestess Selena, schemes to use the Harun-El to terraform Earth into a Krypton-like planet for Kryptonians to inhabit. The protagonists uses the Harun-El to split the Worldkiller Coven's servant, Reign, from her human alter-ego Samantha Arias. By the end of the season finale, it is revealed that Supergirl's being is also divided after her exposure to it during her final battle with Reign. In season 4, Lena Luthor develops a serum derived from Harun-El, and Lex Luthor and James Olsen both develop metahuman abilities after being injected with it.

Films

-   In _Superman_ (1978) Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) deduces that a meteorite found in Addis Ababa is actually a radioactive piece of the exploded planet Krypton. Luthor uses the mineral to weaken Superman (Christopher Reeve), who is saved by Luthor's lover Eve Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine).
-   In _Superman III_ (1983) billionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) orders the creation of synthetic kryptonite. Computer programmer Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) uses tar to compensate for an unknown component of kryptonite, causing the newly created mineral to eventually turn Superman evil and split the hero into two beings. Gorman's "supercomputer" later fights Superman and uses a kryptonite ray.
-   In _Superman Returns_ (2006) Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) steals the Addis Ababa L9 Pallasite Meteorite and uses kryptonite to create a new Kryptonian landmass and a dagger for use against Superman. The film describes kryptonite's formula as "sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine". A year after the film was released, a substance with a similar formula was discovered, jadarite, a coincidence which led to media attention.[14][15][16][17] The new mineral, unlike the fictional material in the movie, does not contain fluorine and does not glow green.[18]
-   In _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_ (2010) an alternate universe version of Lex Luthor uses blue kryptonite against the villain Ultraman.
-   In _Justice League: Doom_ (2012), the villain Metallo wounds Superman with a kryptonite bullet, but he is saved by the JLA.
-   In _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ (2016) kryptonite is discovered by men working for Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and experimented with by Luthor, who learns of its harmful effect on Kryptonians when the corpse of General Zod is exposed to it. The kryptonite is then stolen from Luthor by Batman (Ben Affleck), who uses it to create kryptonite gas pellets and a kryptonite-tipped spear, both of which he later uses in battle with Superman (Henry Cavill). Doomsday is also shown to be weakened by kryptonite, allowing Superman to use the spear to kill him in the film's climax.[19]

Video games

-   In _Superman: Atari 2600_ (1978) Luthor has created kryptonite satellites and scattered them around Metropolis that take away Superman's ability to fly when touched. Superman must then walk around Metropolis until he finds and meets Lois Lane, to regain his powers.
-   _Superman 64_ (1999) it appears as kryptonite fog, coined as an excuse for the game's poor draw distance.
