ROBERT REYNOLDS 'RENNY' CUSHING (born July 20, 1952) is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from the town of Hampton. First elected in 1996, Cushing currently represents Rockingham District 21. He has served several non-consecutive terms (previously representing Rockingham Districts 15 and 22).[1] Cushing graduated from Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, and his first foray into civic engagement was in the 1970s when he was involved with the Clamshell Alliance, an anti-nuclear coalition that attempted to prevent the construction of a nuclear power plant in nearby Seabrook, New Hampshire. In June 1988, his father was murdered in his own house.[2] In years subsequent, he has become an advocate to abolish capital punishment.[3] Cushing lives in Hampton with his wife and has three adult daughters.
