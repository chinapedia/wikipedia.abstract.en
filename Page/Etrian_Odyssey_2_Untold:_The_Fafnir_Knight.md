_ETRIAN ODYSSEY 2 UNTOLD: THE FAFNIR KNIGHT_ is a role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus for the Nintendo 3DS. It is part of the _Etrian Odyssey_ series, and is a remake of _Etrian Odyssey II: Heroes of Lagaard_. It was released in Japan in November 2014, in North America in August 2015, and in Europe in February 2016.


Gameplay

There are two modes, Classic and Story which was first introduced in _Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl_. Classic mode is the same as other entries, with custom characters and maps. Story mode has an expansive story with preset characters, cutscenes and voice acting, but the players will have to draw their own dungeon maps just like in Classic Mode. The game also contains three difficulty settings: Picnic, which allows for easy gameplay; Normal, which allows for moderately difficult but manageable gameplay; and Expert, which allows for the toughest gameplay possible.


Characters

As with its predecessor _Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl_, Story Mode has five playable characters available to the player:

Fafnir Knight: the player's avatar: a young man from the Midgard Library who is dispatched to High Lagaard to assist the daughter of the Duke of Caledonia in venturing through Ginnungagap.

Flavio: an adventurer and the best friend of the player's avatar. An energetically positive 18 year old young man who sometimes acts as a voice of reason within the group.

Arianna Caledonia: The daughter of the Duke of Caledonia. A very ladylike but scatterbrained 18-year-old girl. Escorted by the player's avatar and Flavio throughout Ginnungagap to complete her ritual.

Bertrand de Gervaise: first introduced in Ginnungagap. A knight of unknown age with a lazy personality, however can be serious and protective when needed. He tries to keep his past hidden from the player and group.

Chloe: first introduced in Ginnungagap, later explained to be a distant relative of Bertrand. An asocial 13-year-old girl who usually calls people by their job rather than their name. Has an unnatural love of meat.
