DAVID ABERCROMBY was a 17th-century Scottish physician and writer, thought to have died in 1702.[1] Brought up at Douai as a Roman Catholic by Jesuit priests, he was converted to Protestantism in 1682 and came to abjure popery, and published _Protestancy proved Safer than Popery_ (1686).


Works

His medical reputation was based on his _Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus_ (1684) which was translated into French, Dutch and German. Two other works by him were _De Pulsus Variatione_ (1685), and _Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore_ (1688); his _Opuscula_ were collected in 1687. These professional writings gave him a place and memorial in Albrecht von Haller, _Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae_ (1779). According to Haller he was alive early in the 18th century.[2]

He also wrote some books in theology and philosophy, controversial in their time but little remembered today. But the most noticeable of his productions is _A Discourse of Wit_ (1685), which contains some of the most characteristic metaphysical opinions of the Scottish philosophy of common sense. It was followed by _Academia Scientiarum_ (1687), and by _A Moral Discourse of the Power of Interest_ (1690), dedicated to Robert Boyle,[3] Abercromby's patron in the 1680s. He later wrote _Reasons Why A Protestant Should not Turn Papist_ (1687), which has often wrongly been attributed to Boyle. _A Short Account of Scots Divines_, by him, was printed at Edinburgh in 1833, edited by James Maidment.[4]
