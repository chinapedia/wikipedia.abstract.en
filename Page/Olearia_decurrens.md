_OLEARIA DECURRENS_, commonly known as the CLAMMY DAISY BUSH, is a shrub or subshrub species in the family Asteraceae native to inland Australia.[1]

Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described it in 1836 in the fifth volume of his _Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis_ as _Eurybia decurrens_, from material collected by Allan Cunningham in the vicinity of the Lachlan River.[2] The species name _decurrens_ "decurrent" is derived from the leaf base running down the stem.[3]

The plant is a woody shrub growing to high and wide. New growth and stems are covered in resin.[4] The bright green oblanceolate leaves are alternately arranged along the stems,[5] and are long by across with pointed tips. Flowering takes place from December to June, the daisy-like flowers having a yellow disc and 3-5 white rays. They are arranged in panicles.[6][7] The slender seeds are cylindrical, tipped at one end by a tuft with 35 to 50 filaments.[8]

_Olearia decurrens_ is found across inland Australia, from Dubbo and Brewarrina in New South Wales,[9] westwards across Victoria and South Australia and into Western Australia. It grows in Mallee and Mulga scrub,[10] on stony or sandy soil in the former plant community and sandy loam or calcareous soils in the latter.[11]

Seldom seen in cultivation, _Olearia decurrens_ is drought- and frost-tolerant. It grows best in sunny or part-shaded locations with good drainage. Pruning prevents plants from becoming too spindly or leggy.[12]
