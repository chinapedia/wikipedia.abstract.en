: TIPPERARY SENIOR FOOTBALL SEASON 2016

The 2016 SEASON was Liam Kearns's first year as manager of the Tipperary senior football team.

Tipperary recorded their first victory over Cork in the Munster Senior Football Championship since 1944 and reached the All-Ireland semi-finals for the first time since 1935.

In November 2015, Liam Kearns had been named as the new manager of the Tipperary senior football team.[1][2][3]

Intersport/Elverys continued as sponsors of Tipperary GAA for the second year. The Tipperary jersey for the 2016 season was the same as was used in 2015 and displayed the Intersport brand name on the front and their co-sponsor Elvery’s name on the back.[4]

On 3 November 2016, Michael Quinlivan won Tipperary's first All-Star award since 2003, being picked in the full-forward position. Evan Comerford, Robbie Kiely, Peter Acheson, and Conor Sweeney were also nominated. Josh Keane and Jimmy Feehan were also nominated for the All Stars Young Footballer of the Year award.[5][6] Quinlivan became just the second Tipperary footballer to claim an All Star, joining Declan Browne who won the awards in 1998 and 2003.[7]
