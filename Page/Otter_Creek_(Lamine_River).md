OTTER CREEK is a stream in Cooper and Morgan Counties in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of the Lamine River.

The stream headwaters arise in northern Morgan County northeast of Syracuse and just west of Missouri Route 5 at [2] at an elevation of about 930 feet.[3] The stream flows to the northwest into Cooper County and on to its confluence with the Lamine River about two miles northeast of Otterville[4] at and an elevation of 645 feet.[5]

Otter Creek was so named for the fact it was a hunting ground for otters by pioneers.[6]
