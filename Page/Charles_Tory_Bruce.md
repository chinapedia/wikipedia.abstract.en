As a creative writer, he published the poetry collections _Wild Apples_ (1927), _Tomorrow's Tide_ (1932), _Personal Note_ (1941), _Grey Ship Moving_ (1945), _The Flowing Summer_ (1947) and _The Mulgrave Road_ (1951), the novel _The Channel Shore_ (1954) and the short story collection _The Township of Time_ (1959).[9] His poetry also appeared in magazines such as _Harper's_, _Saturday Night_, _Canadian Poetry_ and _The Saturday Evening Post_.[10] Mount Allison University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters in 1952,[11] and the year after his Governor General's Award win he served as a judge in the same category.[12]

His final book, a history of the Southam News company titled _News and the Southams_, was published in 1968.[13]
