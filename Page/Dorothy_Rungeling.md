Dorothy is also known for own her writing as a published author and Aviation Editor for the Evening Tribune, Welland[5] and won an Aviation Writers Award at the 1953 AITA convention.[6] Before venturing into flying, Dorothy also trained and showed horses and wrote a series of instructions for fellow trainers.[7]

As a pilot, she participated in Canadian and International Aviation competitions including: All Women’s International Air Races, the Women’s Transcontinental Air Races, and the Canadian Governor-General’s Cup Air Race. Once she received her private pilot licence, she joined the Ninety-Nines (worldwide organization of female pilots formed in 1929).[8] She also worked to make Welland an air-marking and it is believed to be the first air-marking in Canada.[9] She worked in politics, and in 1964 she became the first woman to serve on Pelham town council.

In 2003, she received the Order of Canada for her accomplishments as a female pilot, which include receiving her pilot’s licence, commercial licence, instructor’s certification, and senior commercial pilot’s licence.[10] A commemorative stamp was issued in honour of Dorothy Rungeling, the first woman to solo a helicopter, on her 99th birthday.[11] She turned 100 in May 2011.[12] Dorothy continued her writing in a column for The Voice of Pelham entitled Viewpoints. She wrote her last article for the publication in February 2013 at the age of 101.
