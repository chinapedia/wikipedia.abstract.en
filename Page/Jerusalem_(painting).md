_JERUSALEM_ () is an 1867 painting by the French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme. It is also known as _Golgotha_, _Consumatum Est_ and _The Crucifixion_ (_La Crucifixion_). The foreground depicts the ground of Golgotha with the shadows of three crucified men: Jesus and the two thieves. Further back in the picture is a crowd of people moving away from the scene. In the background is the city of Jerusalem under a cloudy sky.

The painting marked Gérôme's return to history painting after a period of exploring orientalism. Like much Christian art of the era, the depiction was influenced by Ernest Renan's _Life of Jesus_.[1]

The painting was presented at the 1868 Salon. Since 1990 it is located at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.[2]
