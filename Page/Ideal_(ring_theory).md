In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, an IDEAL is a special subset of a ring. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers, such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number; these closure and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal. An ideal can be used to construct a quotient ring similarly to the way that, in group theory, a normal subgroup can be used to construct a quotient group.

Among the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the non-negative integers: in this ring, every ideal is a principal ideal consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the prime ideals of a ring are analogous to prime numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to ideals. There is a version of unique prime factorization for the ideals of a Dedekind domain (a type of ring important in number theory).

The concept of an order ideal in order theory is derived from the notion of ideal in ring theory. A fractional ideal is a generalization of an ideal, and the usual ideals are sometimes called INTEGRAL IDEALS for clarity.


History

Ideals were first proposed by Richard Dedekind in 1876 in the third edition of his book _Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie_ (English: _Lectures on Number Theory_). They were a generalization of the concept of ideal numbers developed by Ernst Kummer.[1][2] Later the concept was expanded by David Hilbert and especially Emmy Noether.


Definitions and motivation

For an arbitrary ring (R, +, ⋅ ), let (R,  + ) be its additive group. A subset I is called a LEFT IDEAL of R if it is an additive subgroup of R that "absorbs multiplication from the left by elements of R"; that is, I is a LEFT IDEAL if it satisfies the following two conditions:

1.  (I,  + ) is a subgroup of (R,  + ),
2.  For every r ∈ R and every x ∈ I, the product rx is in I.

A RIGHT IDEAL is defined with the condition "_r x_ ∈ _I_" replaced by "_x r_ ∈ _I_. A TWO-SIDED IDEAL is a left ideal that is also a right ideal, and is sometimes simply called an ideal. We can view a left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal of _R_ as a left (resp. right, bi-) _R_-submodule of _R_ viewed as an _R_-module. When _R_ is a commutative ring, the definitions of left, right, and two-sided ideal coincide, and the term IDEAL is used alone.

To understand the concept of an ideal, consider how ideals arise in the construction of rings of "elements modulo". For concreteness, let us look at the ring ℤ_(_n_) of integers modulo a given integer _n_ ∈ ℤ (note that ℤ is a commutative ring). The key observation here is that we obtain ℤ_(_n_) by taking ℤ and wrapping it around itself so that _n_ gets identified with 0 (since _n_ is congruent to 0 modulo _n_). However, when doing so we must ensure that the resulting structure is again a ring. This requirement forces us to make some additional identifications. The notion of an ideal arises when we ask the question:

  What is the exact set of integers that we are forced to identify with 0?

The answer is the set _n_ℤ = {_nm_ | _m_∈ℤ} of all integers congruent to 0 modulo _n_. That is, we must wrap ℤ around itself infinitely many times so that the integers ..., _n ⋅ -2_, _n ⋅ -1_, _n ⋅ +1_, _n ⋅ +2_, ... will all align with 0. If we look at what properties this set must satisfy in order to ensure that ℤ_(_n_) is a ring, then we arrive at the definition of an ideal. Indeed, one can directly verify that _n_ℤ is an ideal of ℤ.

REMARK. Identifications with elements other than 0 also need to be made. For example, the elements in 1 + _n_ℤ must be identified with 1, the elements in 2 + _n_ℤ must be identified with 2, and so on. Those, however, are uniquely determined by _n_ℤ since _ℤ_ is an additive group.

We can make a similar construction in any commutative ring _R_: start with an arbitrary _x_ ∈ _R_, and then identify with 0 all elements of the ideal _xR_ = { _x r_ : _r_ ∈ _R_ }. It turns out that the ideal _xR_ is the smallest ideal that contains _x_, called the ideal GENERATED by _x_. More generally, we can start with an arbitrary subset _S_ ⊆ _R_, and then identify with 0 all the elements in the ideal generated by _S_: the smallest ideal (_S_) such that _S_ ⊆ (_S_). The ring that we obtain after the identification depends only on the ideal (_S_) and not on the set _S_ that we started with. That is, if (_S_) = (_T_), then the resulting rings will be the same.

Therefore, an ideal _I_ of a commutative ring _R_ captures canonically the information needed to obtain the ring of elements of _R_ modulo a given subset _S_ ⊆ _R_. The elements of _I_, by definition, are those that are congruent to zero, that is, identified with zero in the resulting ring. The resulting ring is called the QUOTIENT of _R_ by _I_ and is denoted _R/I_. Intuitively, the definition of an ideal postulates two natural conditions necessary for _I_ to contain all elements designated as "zeroes" by _R/I_:

1.  _I_ is an additive subgroup of _R_: the zero 0 of _R_ is a "zero" 0 ∈ _I_, and if _x_₁'' ∈ _I_ and _x_₂'' ∈ _I_ are "zeros", then _x_₁'' - _x_₂'' ∈ _I_ is a "zero" too.
2.  Any _r_ ∈ _R_ multiplied by a "zero" _x_ ∈ _I_ is a "zero" _rx_ ∈ _I_.

It turns out that the above conditions are also sufficient for _I_ to contain all the necessary "zeroes": no other elements have to be designated as "zero" in order to form _R/I_. (In fact, no other elements should be designated as "zero" if we want to make the least amount of identifications.)

REMARK. If _R_ is not necessarily commutative, the above construction still works using two-sided ideals.


Examples and properties

_For the sake of succinctness, some results are stated only for left ideals but are usually also true for right ideals with appropriate notation changes._

-   In a ring _R_, the set _R_ itself forms a two-sided ideal of _R_ called the UNIT IDEAL. It is often also denoted by (1) since it is precisely the two-sided ideal generated (see below) by the unity 1_(R). Also, the set {0_(R)} consisting of only the additive identity 0_(_R_) forms a two-sided ideal called the ZERO IDEAL and is denoted by (0).[3] Every (left, right or two-sided) ideal contains the zero ideal and is contained in the unit ideal.
-   A (left, right or two-sided) ideal that is not the unit ideal is called a PROPER IDEAL (as it is a proper subset).[4] Note: a left ideal 𝔞 is proper if and only if it does not contain a unit element, since if u ∈ 𝔞 is a unit element, then r = (ru^( − 1))u ∈ 𝔞 for every r ∈ R. Typically there are plenty of proper ideals. In fact, if _R_ is a skew-field, then (0), (1) are its only ideals and conversely: that is, a nonzero ring _R_ is a skew-field if (0), (1) are the only left (or right) ideals. (Proof: if x is a nonzero element, then the principal left ideal Rx (see below) is nonzero and thus Rx = (1); i.e., yx = 1 for some nonzero y. Likewise, zy = 1 for some nonzero z. Then z = z(yx) = (zy)x = x.)
-   The even integers form an ideal in the ring ℤ of all integers; it is usually denoted by 2ℤ. This is because the sum of any even integers is even, and the product of any integer with an even integer is also even. Similarly, the set of all integers divisible by a fixed integer _n_ is an ideal denoted nℤ.
-   The set of all polynomials with real coefficients which are divisible by the polynomial _x_² + 1 is an ideal in the ring of all polynomials.
-   The set of all _n_-by-_n_ matrices whose last row is zero forms a right ideal in the ring of all _n_-by-_n_ matrices. It is not a left ideal. The set of all _n_-by-_n_ matrices whose last _column_ is zero forms a left ideal but not a right ideal.
-   The ring C(ℝ) of all continuous functions _f_ from ℝ to ℝ under pointwise multiplication contains the ideal of all continuous functions _f_ such that _f_(1) = 0. Another ideal in C(ℝ) is given by those functions which vanish for large enough arguments, i.e. those continuous functions _f_ for which there exists a number _L_ > 0 such that _f_(_x_) = 0 whenever |_x_| > _L_.
-   A ring is called a simple ring if it is nonzero and has no two-sided ideals other than (0), (1). Thus, a skew-field is simple and a simple commutative ring is a field. The matrix ring over a skew-field is a simple ring.
-   If f : R → S is a ring homomorphism, then the kernel ker (f) = f^( − 1)(0_(S)) is a two-sided ideal of R. By convention, f(1_(R)) = 1_(S) and thus if S ≠ 0, then ker (f) is a proper ideal. More generally, for each left ideal _I_ of _S_, the pre-image f^( − 1)(I) is a left ideal. If _I_ is a left ideal of _R_, then f(I) is a left ideal of the subring f(R) of _S_: unless _f_ is surjective, f(I) need not be an ideal of _S_; see also #Extension and contraction of an ideal below.
-   IDEAL CORRESPONDENCE: Given a surjective ring homomorphism f : R → S, there is a bijective order-preserving correspondence between the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of R containing the kernel of f and the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of S: the correspondence is given by I ↦ f(I) and the pre-image J ↦ f^( − 1)(J).
-   (For those who know modules) If _M_ is a left _R_-module and S ⊂ M a subset, then the annihilator Ann_(R)(S) = {r ∈ R ∣ rs = 0, s ∈ S} of _S_ is a left ideal. Given ideals 𝔞, 𝔟 of a commutative ring _R_, the _R_-annihilator of (𝔟 + 𝔞)/𝔞 is an ideal of _R_ called the ideal quotient of 𝔞 by 𝔟 and is denoted by (𝔞 : 𝔟); it is an instance of idealizer in commutative algebra.
-   Let 𝔞_(i), i ∈ S be an ASCENDING CHAIN OF LEFT IDEALS in a ring _R_; i.e., S is a totally ordered set and 𝔞_(i) ⊂ 𝔞_(j) for each i < j. Then the union ⋃_(i ∈ S)𝔞_(i) is a left ideal of _R_. (Note: this fact remains true even if _R_ is without the unity 1.)
-   The above fact together with Zorn's lemma proves the following: if E ⊂ R is a possibly empty subset and 𝔞₀ ⊂ R is a left ideal that is disjoint from _E_, then there is an ideal that is maximal among the ideals containing 𝔞₀ and disjoint from _E_. (Again this is still valid if the ring _R_ lacks the unity 1.) When R ≠ 0, taking 𝔞₀ = (0) and E = {1}, in particular, there exists a left ideal that is maximal among proper left ideals (often simply called a maximal left ideal); see Krull's theorem for more.
-   An arbitrary union of ideals need not be an ideal, but the following is still true: given a possibly empty subset _X_ of _R_, there is the smallest left ideal containing _X_, called the left ideal generated by _X_ and is denoted by RX. Such an ideal exists since it is the intersection of all left ideals containing _X_. Equivalently, RX is the set of all the (finite) left _R_-linear combinations of elements of _X_ over _R_:
    _R__X_ = {_r_₁_x_₁ + … + _r__(_n_)_x__(_n_) ∣ _n_ ∈ ℕ, _r__(_i_) ∈ _R_, _x__(_i_) ∈ _X_}.

    (since such a span is the smallest left ideal containing _X_.)[5] A right (resp. two-sided) ideal generated by _X_ is defined in the similar way. For "two-sided", one has to use linear combinations from both sides; i.e.,
    _R__X__R_ = {_r_₁_x_₁_s_₁ + … + _r__(_n_)_x__(_n_)_s__(_n_) ∣ _n_ ∈ ℕ, _r__(_i_) ∈ _R_, _s__(_i_) ∈ _R_, _x__(_i_) ∈ _X_}. 

-   A left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by a single element _x_ is called the principal left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by _x_ and is denoted by Rx (resp. xR, RxR). The principal two-sided ideal RxR is often also denoted by (x). If X = {x₁, …, x_(n)} is a finite set, then RXR is also written as (x₁, …, x_(n)).
-   In the ring ℤ of integers, every ideal can be generated by a single number (so ℤ is a principal ideal domain), as a consequence of Euclidean division (or some other way).
-   There is a bijective correspondence between ideals and congruence relations (equivalence relations that respect the ring structure) on the ring: Given an ideal _I_ of a ring _R_, let _x_ ~ _y_ if _x_ − _y_ ∈ _I_. Then ~ is a congruence relation on _R_. Conversely, given a congruence relation ~ on _R_, let _I_ = {_x_ : _x_ ~ 0}. Then _I_ is an ideal of _R_.


Types of ideals

_To simplify the description all rings are assumed to be commutative. The non-commutative case is discussed in detail in the respective articles._

Ideals are important because they appear as kernels of ring homomorphisms and allow one to define factor rings. Different types of ideals are studied because they can be used to construct different types of factor rings.

-   MAXIMAL IDEAL: A proper ideal _I_ is called a MAXIMAL IDEAL if there exists no other proper ideal _J_ with _I_ a proper subset of _J_. The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a simple ring in general and is a field for commutative rings.[6]
-   MINIMAL IDEAL: A nonzero ideal is called minimal if it contains no other nonzero ideal.
-   PRIME IDEAL: A proper ideal _I_ is called a PRIME IDEAL if for any _a_ and _b_ in _R_, if _ab_ is in _I_, then at least one of _a_ and _b_ is in _I_. The factor ring of a prime ideal is a prime ring in general and is an integral domain for commutative rings.
-   RADICAL IDEAL or semiprime ideal: A proper ideal _I_ is called RADICAL or SEMIPRIME if for any _a_ in _R_, if _a_^(_n_) is in _I_ for some _n_, then _a_ is in _I_. The factor ring of a radical ideal is a semiprime ring for general rings, and is a reduced ring for commutative rings.
-   PRIMARY IDEAL: An ideal _I_ is called a PRIMARY IDEAL if for all _a_ and _b_ in _R_, if _ab_ is in _I_, then at least one of _a_ and _b_^(_n_) is in _I_ for some natural number _n_. Every prime ideal is primary, but not conversely. A semiprime primary ideal is prime.
-   PRINCIPAL IDEAL: An ideal generated by _one_ element.
-   FINITELY GENERATED IDEAL: This type of ideal is finitely generated as a module.
-   PRIMITIVE IDEAL: A left primitive ideal is the annihilator of a simple left module.
-   IRREDUCIBLE IDEAL: An ideal is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of ideals which properly contain it.
-   COMAXIMAL IDEALS: Two ideals 𝔦, 𝔧 are said to be COMAXIMAL if x + y = 1 for some x ∈ 𝔦 and y ∈ 𝔧.
-   REGULAR IDEAL: This term has multiple uses. See the article for a list.
-   NIL IDEAL: An ideal is a nil ideal if each of its elements is nilpotent.
-   NILPOTENT IDEAL: Some power of it is zero.
-   PARAMETER IDEAL: an ideal generated by a system of parameters.

Two other important terms using "ideal" are not always ideals of their ring. See their respective articles for details:

-   FRACTIONAL IDEAL: This is usually defined when _R_ is a commutative domain with quotient field _K_. Despite their names, fractional ideals are _R_ submodules of _K_ with a special property. If the fractional ideal is contained entirely in _R_, then it is truly an ideal of _R_.
-   INVERTIBLE IDEAL: Usually an invertible ideal _A_ is defined as a fractional ideal for which there is another fractional ideal _B_ such that _AB_=_BA_=_R_. Some authors may also apply "invertible ideal" to ordinary ring ideals _A_ and _B_ with _AB_=_BA_=_R_ in rings other than domains.


Ideal operations

The sum and product of ideals are defined as follows. For 𝔞 and 𝔟, left (resp. right) ideals of a ring _R_, their sum is

𝔞 + 𝔟 := {_a_ + _b_ ∣ _a_ ∈ 𝔞 and _b_ ∈ 𝔟}
, which is a left (resp. right) ideal, and, if 𝔞, 𝔟 are two-sided,

𝔞𝔟 := {_a_₁_b_₁ + … + _a__(_n_)_b__(_n_) ∣ _a__(_i_) ∈ 𝔞 and _b__(_i_) ∈ 𝔟, _i_ = 1, 2, …, _n_;  for _n_ = 1, 2, …},
i.e. the product is the ideal generated by all products of the form _ab_ with _a_ in 𝔞 and _b_ in 𝔟.

Note 𝔞 + 𝔟 is the smallest left (resp. right) ideal containing both 𝔞 and 𝔟 (or the union 𝔞 ∪ 𝔟), while the product 𝔞𝔟 is contained in the intersection of 𝔞 and 𝔟.

The distributive law holds for two-sided ideals 𝔞, 𝔟, 𝔠,

-   𝔞(𝔟 + 𝔠) = 𝔞𝔟 + 𝔞𝔠,
-   (𝔞 + 𝔟)𝔠 = 𝔞𝔠 + 𝔟𝔠.

If a product is replaced by an intersection, a partial distributive law holds:

𝔞 ∩ (𝔟 + 𝔠) ⊃ 𝔞 ∩ 𝔟 + 𝔞 ∩ 𝔠
where the equality holds if 𝔞 contains 𝔟 or 𝔠.

REMARK: The sum and the intersection of ideals is again an ideal; with these two operations as join and meet, the set of all ideals of a given ring forms a complete modular lattice. The lattice is not, in general, a distributive lattice. The three operations of intersection, sum (or join), and product make the set of ideals of a commutative ring into a quantale.

If 𝔞, 𝔟 are ideals of a commutative ring _R_, then 𝔞 ∩ 𝔟 = 𝔞𝔟 in the following two cases (at least)

-   𝔞 + 𝔟 = (1)
-   𝔞 is generated by elements that form a regular sequence modulo 𝔟.

(More generally, the difference between a product and an intersection of ideals is measured by the Tor functor
Tor₁^(_R_)(_R_/𝔞, _R_/𝔟) = (𝔞 ∩ 𝔟)/𝔞𝔟.
[7])

An integral domain is called a Dedekind domain if for each pair of ideals 𝔞 ⊂ 𝔟, there is an ideal 𝔠 such that $\mathfrak \mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{b} \mathfrak{c}$.[8] It can then be shown that every nonzero ideal of a Dedekind domain can be uniquely written as a product of maximal ideals, a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.


Examples of ideal operations

In ℤ we have

(_n_) ∩ (_m_) = lcm (_n_, _m_)ℤ
since (n) ∩ (m) is the set of integers which are divisible by both n and m.

Let R = ℂ[x, y, z, w] and let I = (z, w),  J = (x + z, y + w),  K = (x + z, w). Then,

-   I + J = (z, w, x + z, y + w) = (x, y, z, w) and I + K = (z, w, x + z)
-   IJ = (z(x + z), z(y + w), w(x + z), w(y + w)) = (z² + xz, zy + wz, wx + wz, wy + w²)
-   IK = (xz + z², zw, xw + zw, w²)
-   I ∩ J = IJ while I ∩ K = (w, xz + z²) ≠ IK

In the first computation, we see the general pattern for taking the sum of two finitely generated ideals, it is the ideal generated by the union of their generators. In the last three we observe that products and intersections agree whenever the two ideals intersect in the zero ideal. These computations can be checked using Macaulay2.[9][10][11]


Radical of a ring

Ideals appear naturally in the study of modules, especially in the form of a radical.

    _For simplicity, we work with commutative rings but, with some changes, the results are also true for non-commutative rings._

Let _R_ be a commutative ring. By definition, a primitive ideal of _R_ is the annihilator of a (nonzero) simple _R_-module. The Jacobson radical J = Jac (R) of _R_ is the intersection of all primitive ideals. Equivalently,

_J_ = ⋂_(𝔪 maximal ideals)𝔪.
Indeed, if M is a simple module and _x_ is a nonzero element in _M_, then Rx = M and R/Ann (M) = R/Ann (x) ≃ M, meaning Ann (M) is a maximal ideal. Conversely, if 𝔪 is a maximal ideal, then 𝔪 is the annihilator of the simple _R_-module R/𝔪. There is also another characterization (the proof is not hard):

_J_ = {_x_ ∈ _R_ ∣ 1 − _y__x_  is a unit element for every _y_ ∈ _R_}.
For a not-necessarily-commutative ring, it is a general fact that 1 − yx is a unit element if and only if 1 − xy is (see the link) and so this last characterization shows that the radical can be defined both in terms of left and right primitive ideals.

The following simple but important fact (Nakayama's lemma) is built-in to the definition of a Jacobson radical: if _M_ is a module such that JM = M, then _M_ does not admit a maximal submodule, since if there is a maximal submodule L ⊊ M, J ⋅ (M/L) = 0 and so M = JM ⊂ L ⊂ M, a contradiction. Since a nonzero finitely generated module admits a maximal submodule, in particular, one has:

    If JM = M and _M_ is finitely generated, then M = 0.

A maximal ideal is a prime ideal and so one has

nil (_R_) = ⋂_(𝔭 prime ideals )𝔭 ⊂ Jac (_R_)
where the intersection on the left is called the nilradical of _R_. As it turns out, nil (R) is also the set of nilpotent elements of _R_.

If _R_ is an Artinian ring, then Jac (R) is nilpotent and nil (R) = Jac (R). (Proof: first note the DCC implies J^(n) = J^(n + 1) for some _n_. If (DCC) 𝔞 ⊋ Ann (J^(n)) is an ideal properly minimal over the latter, then J ⋅ (𝔞/Ann (J^(n))) = 0. That is, J^(n)𝔞 = J^(n + 1)𝔞 = 0, a contradiction.)


Extension and contraction of an ideal

Let _A_ and _B_ be two commutative rings, and let _f_ : _A_ → _B_ be a ring homomorphism. If 𝔞 is an ideal in _A_, then f(𝔞) need not be an ideal in _B_ (e.g. take _f_ to be the inclusion of the ring of integers Z into the field of rationals Q). The EXTENSION 𝔞^(e) of 𝔞 in _B_ is defined to be the ideal in _B_ generated by f(𝔞). Explicitly,

𝔞^(_e_) = {∑_y__(_i_)_f_(_x__(_i_)) : _x__(_i_) ∈ 𝔞, _y__(_i_) ∈ _B_}

If 𝔟 is an ideal of _B_, then f^( − 1)(𝔟) is always an ideal of _A_, called the CONTRACTION 𝔟^(c) of 𝔟 to _A_.

Assuming _f_ : _A_ → _B_ is a ring homomorphism, 𝔞 is an ideal in _A_, 𝔟 is an ideal in _B_, then:

-   𝔟 is prime in _B_ ⇒ 𝔟^(c) is prime in _A_.
-   𝔞^(ec) ⊇ 𝔞
-   𝔟^(ce) ⊆ 𝔟

It is false, in general, that 𝔞 being prime (or maximal) in _A_ implies that 𝔞^(e) is prime (or maximal) in _B_. Many classic examples of this stem from algebraic number theory. For example, embedding ℤ → ℤ[i]. In B = ℤ[i], the element 2 factors as 2 = (1 + i)(1 − i) where (one can show) neither of 1 + i, 1 − i are units in _B_. So (2)^(e) is not prime in _B_ (and therefore not maximal, as well). Indeed, (1 ± i)² =  ± 2i shows that (1 + i) = ((1 − i) − (1 − i)²), (1 − i) = ((1 + i) − (1 + i)²), and therefore (2)^(e) = (1 + i)².

On the other hand, if _f_ is surjective and 𝔞 ⊇ ker f then:

-   𝔞^(ec) = 𝔞 and 𝔟^(ce) = 𝔟.
-   𝔞 is a prime ideal in _A_ ⇔ 𝔞^(e) is a prime ideal in _B_.
-   𝔞 is a maximal ideal in _A_ ⇔ 𝔞^(e) is a maximal ideal in _B_.

REMARK: Let _K_ be a field extension of _L_, and let _B_ and _A_ be the rings of integers of _K_ and _L_, respectively. Then _B_ is an integral extension of _A_, and we let _f_ be the inclusion map from _A_ to _B_. The behaviour of a prime ideal 𝔞 = 𝔭 of _A_ under extension is one of the central problems of algebraic number theory.

The following is sometimes useful:[12] a prime ideal 𝔭 is a contraction of a prime ideal if and only if 𝔭 = 𝔭^(ec). (Proof: Assuming the latter, note 𝔭^(e)B_(𝔭) = B_(𝔭) ⇒ 𝔭^(e) intersects A − 𝔭, a contradiction. Now, the prime ideals of B_(𝔭) correspond to those in _B_ that are disjoint from A − 𝔭. Hence, there is a prime ideal 𝔮 of _B_, disjoint from A − 𝔭, such that 𝔮B_(𝔭) is a maximal ideal containing 𝔭^(e)B_(𝔭). One then checks that 𝔮 lies over 𝔭. The converse is obvious.)

In addition to the finite sums of products of things in _X_ with things in _R_, we must allow the addition of _n_-fold sums of the form _x_+_x_+...+_x_, and _n_-fold sums of the form (_−x_)+(_−x_)+...+(_−x_) for every _x_ in _X_ and every _n_ in the natural numbers. When _R_ has a unit, this extra requirement becomes superfluous.
