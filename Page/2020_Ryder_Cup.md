Team qualification and selection

 United States

The United States qualification rules were announced on February 20, 2019. The qualification rules are similar to those used for the 2018 Ryder Cup.[2] The majority of the team are selected from the Ryder Cup points list which is based on prize money won in important tournaments. Generally one point is awarded for every $1,000 earned. The team consists of:

-   THE LEADING EIGHT PLAYERS ON THE RYDER CUP POINTS LIST, GAINED IN THE FOLLOWING EVENTS
    -   2019 major championships
    -   2019 World Golf Championship events and The Players Championship (half points)
    -   2020 major championships (double points for the winner, 50% extra for those who make the cut)
    -   2020 PGA Tour events. Qualifying events in this category are those played between January 1 and August 23, 2020, the date of the BMW Championship, and including the Zurich Classic of New Orleans team event and WGC events. "Alternate" events (those played opposite a major or WGC event) do not earn points
-   FOUR CAPTAIN'S PICKS
    -   To be announced after the 2020 Tour Championship, which concludes on September 1.

 Europe

The European team qualification rules were announced on May 8, 2019. The number of captain's picks was reduced from four to three. The team will consist of:[3][4]

-   THE LEADING FOUR PLAYERS ON THE RACE TO DUBAI POINTS LIST
    -   Points earned in all Race to Dubai tournaments starting in September 2019 with the BMW PGA Championship and ending with the BMW PGA Championship in September 2020. Points earned in the later events of 2020 will be multiplied by 1.5.
