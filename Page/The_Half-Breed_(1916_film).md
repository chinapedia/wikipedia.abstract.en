_THE HALF-BREED_ is a 1916 film directed by Allan Dwan. It stars Douglas Fairbanks as Lo ("Sleeping Water") Dorman a man competing for the love of the local preacher's daughter (Jewel Carmen) with the local sheriff (Sam De Grasse). The audience, however, knows that Sheriff Dunn is actually Lo's father.

Monica Nolan has suggested that the film follows the "common strategy of exposing racism and then evading a real confrontation with its consequences" by arranging for Lo to meet a more worthy (and politically acceptable) love interest, Teresa (Alma Rubens), "who, as both a Mexican and an outlaw, is his social equal."[1]

The film was shot at in Sequoia National Park and near Santa Cruz, California. [2]
