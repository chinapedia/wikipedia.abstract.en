Two_Torah_scrolls.jpg YEMENITE SCROLLS OF THE LAW containing the Five Books of Moses (the _Torah_) represent one of three authoritative scribal traditions for the transmission of the Torah, the other two being the Ashkenazi and Sephardic traditions that slightly differ.[1] While all three traditions purport to follow the Masoretic traditions of Aaron ben Asher, slight differences between the three major traditions have developed over the years. Biblical texts proofread by ben Asher survive in two extant codices (the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex), the latter said to have only been patterned after texts proofread by Ben Asher. The former work, although more precise, was partially lost following its removal from Aleppo in 1947.

The Yemenite Torah scroll is unique in that it contains many of the oddly-formed letters, such as the "overlapping" _pe_ (פ) and the "crooked" _lamed_ (ל), etc., mentioned in _Sefer Tagae_,[2] as also by Menachem Meiri[3] and by Maimonides,[4] although not found in ben Asher's orthography. The old line arrangements employed by the early Yemenite scribes in their Torah scrolls are nearly the same as prescribed by ben Asher. Like ben Asher's Masoretic tradition, it also contains nearly all the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_, as well as the large and small letters employed in the writing of the Torah, a work held by medieval scribes in Israel to be the most accurate of all Masoretic traditions.

The disputes between ben Asher and Ben Naphtali are well-known to Hebrew grammarians. Maimonides' verdict in that dispute is in accordance with ben Asher.[5]

  The codex that we have relied upon in these matters is the well-known codex in Egypt, comprising twenty-four canonical books, [and] which was in Jerusalem for several years to proof-read the scrolls there from, and all [of Israel] used to rely upon it, since BEN-ASHER had proof-read it and scrutinized it for many years, and proof-read it many times, just as they had copied down. Now, upon it, I relied with regard to the book of the Law that I wrote, according to the rules which govern its proper writing.

Maimonides' ruling in this regard eventually caused the Jews of Yemen to abandon their former system of orthography, and during his lifetime most scribes in Yemen had already begun to replace their former system of orthography for that of Ben-Asher.[6] Scribes in Yemen, especially the illustrious Benayah family of scribes[7] of the 15th and 16th centuries, patterned their own codices containing the proper orthography, vocalization and accentuation after Maimonides' accepted practice in his _Sefer Torah_, who, in turn, had based his Torah-scroll on Ben-Asher's orthography,[8] with especial attention given to the line arrangements of the two Prosaic Songs mentioned by him, the Open and Closed sections of the Torah, and _plene_ and _defective scriptum_.[9] Such codices were disseminated all throughout Yemen. The _tījān_ (codices) were copied with particular care, since they were intended as model texts from which scribes would copy Torah scrolls, with the one exception that in the Torah scrolls themselves they contained no vocalization and accentuations. In most of these _tījān_, every three pages equalled one column in the Sefer Torah.[10] A recurring avowal appears in nearly all copies of codices penned by the Benayah family, namely, that the codex which lay before the reader was written "completely according to the arrangement of the book which was in Egypt, which was edited by Ben Asher...."[11] Based on the preceding lines of this avowal, the reference is to the Open and Closed sections that were copied from the section on orthography in the Yemenite MS. of Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, a work which Maimonides himself claims to have been based on Ben-Asher (i.e. the Aleppo Codex), universally recognized since the time of Maimonides as the most accurate recension of the Hebrew Bible. Benayah’s use of this avowal simply mirrors the words of Maimonides in his _Hilkhot Sefer Torah_, while most scholars doubt if he had actually seen a codex proofread by Ben-Asher.[12] Others say that the avowal merely refers to the Tiberian masoretic tradition (vowels and accentuations) adopted by the Benayah family in their codices.[13]

Layout

The Yemenite scroll of the Torah is traditionally written on 51 lines to each column,[14] differing from Ashkenazi and Sephardic scrolls that are almost exclusively made of 42 lines to each column. Unique to Yemenite scrolls, based on what is prescribed in their codices, is that each column concludes with the end of a particular verse and begins with the start of a new verse; never broken in the middle.[15] Each column starts afresh, excepting in only six designated places, whose mnemonics are בי"ה שמ"ו (see _infra_), and excepting in the two prosaic songs (the _Song of the Sea_ and _Ha'azinu_), where the columns in these places begin in the middle of a verse.[16] These six places (five places when בראשית of Gen. 1:1 is excluded, since it is only used to form the mnemonic) are the only exceptions to the rule, and which practice is intended to ensure uniformity and exactness in the scribal practice and layout in the _Sefer Torah_ throughout all generations. Yemenite scrolls comprise a total of 226 columns (רכ"ו דפים),[17] and which average width of each column is approximately four finger-breadths, usually , with a space of between columns. Columns containing the Prosaic Songs are considerably wider to facilitate the writing of the song in its usual format. For the Prosaic Song _Ha'azinu_, the first column which contains the song is made ca. in width, while the second column that concludes the song is made ca. in width. For the Prosaic _Song of the Sea_ the column measures approximately in width. The sheets of parchment used in making the scroll measure approximately in length (from top to bottom), although varying in width, with at least three columns to each sheet. Most are made with full-grain leather (Heb. _ğawīl_),[18] that is, leather where the "split" layer has not been removed from it. In Yemen, the custom was to treat the raw hide with a tannin-solution made from the leaves of Acacia etbaica (Arabic: _qarāḍ_) to ensure the leather's lasting durability. This also gave to the leather a reddish-brown luster. The sheets of parchment were traditionally sewn together with sinews (tendons) taken from the animal's loins (flanks), rather than from the animal's heels (the latter being prescribed by Maimonides).[19]


Plene and defective scriptum

There are thirteen orthographic traditions in the first category which are peculiar to the Yemenite tradition and which differ from the traditions borne by other groups. The Yemenite arrangement has been published in many sources, the most notable of which being that of the last Chief Rabbi of Yemen, Rabbi Amram Qorah.[20] By a comparative study, the Yemenite tradition in _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ is nearly in complete harmony with that of the Aleppo Codex which was proofread by the masorete, Ben-Asher.[21] Yemenite_Sefer_Torah_on_Givil_200_years_old.jpg

The prevailing view is that if there is found a Torah scroll that has not been written as prescribed in all of the above (as bequeathed by the ancients) then that same scroll is invalid (lowered in sanctity) and is considered as merely one of the codices (Heb. _ḥūmashin_).[52]


Irregular letters

Rabbi Yitzhak Razhabi has noted that in the Yemenite Jewish tradition there are over 400 peculiar types of letters (special forms of certain characters) in the Torah and which have been largely adhered to by Yemenite scribes.[53] While these irregular letters do not invalidate a Torah scroll if they had been neglected,[54] the scribes in Yemen still strictly adhered to its practice.

The Large Letters

The Yemenite tradition of writing the _Otiyyot Gedolot_ (Large Letters) in the Torah differs in some respects from other communities, and follows the traditions as they received them from the scribes of old. The following is a list of all the Large Letters found in the Yemenite scroll of the Pentateuch (Five Books of Moses), as published by 17th century Yemenite scribe, Rabbi Yihye Bashiri, in his book, _Havatzelet Hasharon_:[55] Parchment_of_Torah.jpg

Unlike the scribal tradition of Ashkenaz and Sepharad which is to make the _nun_ (נ) of נצר חסד לאלפים in Exodus of large size, in the Yemenite Jewish tradition the _nun_ is of regular size.[87][88] Rabbi Yihye Bashiri, in his _Havatzelet HaSharon_, brings down other traditions concerning the writing of large and small letters in the Torah scroll, but which traditions were not practised in Yemen, and therefore ought to be reckoned as his sole opinion (since they are not mentioned by the renowned Yemenite scribe David Benayah, neither are they written in the Hibshoosh Codex, nor mentioned by the last Chief Rabbi of Yemen, Rabbi Amram Qorah, or in the vast majority of Yemenite codices. Rabbi Yihye Bashiri had, apparently, culled these other traditions from the writings of the kabbalists and other rabbinic scholars outside of Yemen, and wished to incorporate them in the Yemenite tradition, but which practices had never taken hold in Yemen.[89][90]

Oddly-shaped letters

According to Rashi, the final _nun_ (ן) in וימת תרח בחרן (Gen. 11:32) is to be written upside down, although this was never a practice in the Yemenite Jewish tradition.[105] Instead, the final _nun_ here was written in its ordinary fashion. In other places, however, the Yemenites have preserved the practice of making oddly-shaped letters, where the tradition called for doing so. The Yemenite tradition calls for making 154 overlapping _pe_`s (פ) in their designated places, with the mouth recoiling inwards upon itself (made by a very thin nib of the pen).[106] The following is an abridged list of some of the common usages in Yemenite Torah scrolls.

Prosaic Song _Ha'azinu_

Jewish scribes have preserved a carefully guarded tradition regarding the line arrangements of certain verses, namely, which words are to be written at the forefront of a line, and which words are to be written at the end of the same. The line arrangements of _Shirat Ha'azinu_ (Deut. 32:1–43) in the Yemenite Torah scrolls follow closely that of Ben Asher as conveyed by Maimonides' Mishne Torah, and, unlike the Sephardic tradition of writing the song in seventy lines (based on the _Shulhan Arukh_),[125] the Yemenite tradition is to write the song in only sixty-seven lines.[126]

The column on the sheet of parchment containing the prosaic song _Ha'azinu_ is made wider than other columns, so as to make room for the poem's layout, written in the format of sixty-seven double half-columns, meaning to say, spaces are made between the verses which appear to descend in two columns. The prosaic song itself is preceded by a blank space, above which are six lines that are written in a format fixed by tradition, with the following words at the head of each line: the 1st line starting with ואעידה and ending with ידעתי; the 2nd line starting with אחרי and ending with מן; the 3rd line starting with הדרך and ending with הרעה; the 4th line starting with באחרית and ending with God's divine name, יהוה; the 5th line starting with להכעיסו and ending with כל; and the 6th line starting with קהל and ending with תמם.[127] It is to be noted that the original Yemenite practice was to write these six short lines with indentations before and after the text of each line, rather than draw-out the lines unto the margins by stretching certain letters within the text.[128] The scribal practice of indenting these six lines was also the widespread practice used in Turkey, in very old and exquisite Torah scrolls during the time of Rabbi Chaim Benveniste (1603–1673).[129] After these six lines there is a space followed by the Prosaic Song, written in the format of a song. The Yemenite tradition follows the Aleppo Codex's layout of the Prosaic Song, excepting lines 38 and 39, being the only deviation in word sequence, now believed by most scholars to be an anomaly, by way of confusing the double usage of the Hebrew word גם (q.v. Deut. 32:25) and not knowing which word Maimonides actually had in mind when bringing down the condensed layout for the song.[130]

Prosaic Song of the Sea

Rabbi Meir ben Todros Halevi (ca. 1170–1244), when trying to ascertain the correct scribal tradition, mentions his having written to Shemuel ibn Tibbon the physician of Marseilles, inquiring about the scroll of the Torah that was with him and which was copied from Maimonides’ scroll of the Torah. Ibn Tibbon replied, sending to him an accurate copy of the arranged lines of the _Song of the Sea_ () in Exodus 15:1–19 as found in the scroll that was copied from Maimonides’ Torah scroll. He writes that he found the three words, את מי הים (= "_the waters of the sea_"), written at the beginning of the last line.[134] Notwithstanding, Rabbi Meir ben Todros admitted to having deviated from this tradition, having decided against its orthography, seeing that in the _Song of the Sea_ all of the previous lines had thus far ended in one word, and it seemed fitting to him that the second to the last line should also end in one word. He therefore changed its order, by his own admittance. The author of _Minḥat Shai_ followed in suit and also changed the original order of the last two lines in the _Song of the Sea_. The Yemenite Jews still maintain the old tradition in the line arrangements of the _Song of the Sea_, following Ben Asher's format in the words that are to begin each line, as well as in the words which are to conclude each line.[135] Their fidelity to tradition has been praised by Dr. Penkower, a specialist of Textual Transmission of the Bible and the _Masorah_ at the Department of the Bible in Bar-Ilan University, who wrote: "It's worthy of adding that in the Yemenite manuscripts of the Torah the arrangement of lines in the Prosaic _Song of the Sea_ is exactly like the arrangement found in the Aleppo Codex, including the last two lines and the lines that are before the _Song_ and that are after it."[136]

While all communities will write the _Song of the Sea_ (_Shirat ha-Yam_) on thirty lines, the format which concludes the song has been slightly altered in some communities due to the doubt raised by Rabbi Meir Abulafia ben Todros of Spain.[137]

Testimonies from travelers and emissaries who had seen the Aleppo Codex have concurred, unequivocally, that the words, כס יה in , were written as one word, (e.g. כי יד על כסיה).[139][140] However, in the Yemenite tradition, the words are not joined together, but are written as two words,[141] just as the words appear in the Leningrad Codex and in the Damascus Pentateuch. This anomaly may be attributed to the fact that the Yemenite copyists in their transmission of the _masorah_ made use of several ancient works, and perhaps even their own ancient Torah scrolls, just as they did when conveying the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ of the _textus receptus_ (which almost completely agreed with that of masorete, Ben-Asher) – yet, without the aid or assistance of Maimonides who left no indication on how these words should be written, or just as they did also with the irregular letters written in the Torah, although here, too, Maimonides gave no indication about which of these letters should be made differently.[142] While Ben Asher was the arbiter in cases of vocalization in the Aleppo Codex, he was not, admittedly, the scribe who wrote the text, which scribe was rather Shlomo ben Buya'a. Since the Leningrad Codex, a codex also proofread by Ben-Asher, stands at variance here with the Aleppo Codex's entry, one might only speculate if Ben-Asher ever totally agreed with everything written in those codices. Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century), a man who had actually seen the Aleppo Codex and noted its rendition of כסיה as one word, continued to write in his own papers the word as being made-up of two words. Moreover, the _Treatise Sofrim_[143] which brings down a list of words in the Torah that are written as one word, but read as two words (e.g. בגד in Gen. 30:11 which is read as בא גד, and אשדת in Deut. 33:3 which is read as אש דת) does not list כסיה as one of these words.

Mordechai Breuer makes note of the fact that "versions in the Talmud differ in many instances from the versions of the Masoretes (see, for example, _Gilyon ha-Shas_, the comments of R. Aqiba Eiger on the margin of the Talmud, _Shabbat_ 55b). Accordingly, Talmudic versions are of no relevance here; perhaps they reflect the 'correct' or 'original' text of the Bible, but they are non-Masoretic by definition, and they have nothing to do with the uniform version which was accepted by the Tiberian Masoretes."[144]

Similarly, according to Rashi, the verse ויהי ביום כלות משה (in Numbers 7:1) is written with כלת in _defective scriptum_. This, however, is not the case in the Masoretic Texts, nor in the Yemenite Jewish tradition, where the word כלות is written in _plene_ scriptum. Elsewhere, according to Rashi, the word פילגשים in (Genesis 25:6) is also written in _defective scriptum_, and which is not the case in either the Masoretic texts or in the Yemenite Jewish tradition.

A famous rabbinic dictum states that scribes are to be careful to have certain columns begin with fixed words, known by their mnemonics, בי"ה שמ"ו.[145] These, too, can be found in their designated places, each letter commencing the word of that column. Such was also the practice in Yemen.[146] For example: The Hebrew character _bet_ (ב) represents the first word in the Torah, בראשית (Gen. 1:1); the Hebrew character _yod_ (י) represents יהודה אתה יודוך (Gen. 49:8); the Hebrew character _he_ (ה) represents הבאים אחריהם בים (Exo. 14:28); the Hebrew character _shin_ (ש) represents שמר ושמעת (Deut. 12:28); the Hebrew character _mim_ (מ) represents מוצא שפתיך תשמר (Deut. 23:24); and, finally, the Hebrew character _waw_ (ו) represents ואעידה בם (Deut. 31:28). Aside from the first word in this mnemonic device taken from Psalm 68:5, the other letters come to represent the only places in the entire Torah where the column begins in the middle of a verse, whereas in all other columns, the start of a new verse always commences a new column. Likewise, in _Parashat Shemini_ (Leviticus 10:16), a tradition passed down by the scribes was to ensure that each scribe when copying from a master text is careful to write the first דרש (_derosh_) at the very end of the line, while the second דרש (_derash_) be written at the forefront of the next line.[147] In the Yemenite Torah scroll brought out from Yemen, now belonging to Azriel ben Saadia Tzadok (Saleh) of Benei Barak, from which a _Tikkun Soferim_ was made in five small pocket volumes to facilitate the accurate transmission of the same _masorah_ by scribes, the first word דרש is, indeed, found at the very end of line # 14, whereas the second word דרש is found written at the forefront of line # 15.[148]

Places in the Yemenite scrolls which differ from the Aleppo Codex

The oldest manuscripts containing the Masora of the early masoretes, such as the London Codex (British Library Or. 4445) and the Leningrad Codex, the Damascus Crown and the Aleppo Codex (based on various testimonies), were all written with a Closed section in pericope _Ki Tisa_ (Exo. 34:1), in the verse פסל לך, while in pericope _Ṣav_ (Lev. 7:28–29) there was written an Open section in the verse המקריב.[149] Neither one of these sections reflect the custom of Yemen today, which points to the assumption that, apparently, they changed their ancient practice in this matter to conform with that of Maimonides, as stated by the late chief Yemenite Rabbi, Yosef Qafih.[150] Scholars have pointed out eight differences between the Aleppo Codex and the Yemenite tradition of orthography.[151] At least in one reference it is believed to be an error by the copyist of the Aleppo Codex, and is not generally practised by any community in Israel, namely, that of writing היא in Leviticus 25:10–12 (יובל היא) with a _yod_ (י) instead of a _waw_ (ו).[152] It is not immediately clear if the Yemenites retained portions of their old tradition when incorporating in their writings the _masorah_ of Ben-Asher.

  : Comparative study of codices

In the days of Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon (1186–1237), the Jews of Yemen addressed thirteen questions unto him, one of which concerning the Open and Closed sections of the Torah as prescribed by his father, Maimonides, and what to do with a tradition that differs, to which he replied: "We see that there are many differences between the scribes in the matter of the Open and Closed sections, while the books that are in Israel greatly differ in this matter, and we have already seen the exponents of our laws, of blessed memory, who have taken positions in each of these works, which thing has its rightful place, since we do not possess the Book of the Temple court, which [if we had] we could meticulously learn from it about the matter, nor is there regarding this matter a tradition whereupon everyone agrees, to the extent that we could actually disqualify whatsoever contradicts it. Nevertheless, the right thing is to scrupulously attend to the matter, just as it appears in the _Composition_ (i.e. Mishne Torah), in the Book of _Ahavah_, but whatsoever is found to be different from it, no one is to give judgment concerning it that it is invalid, unless it is different from all the books that are in existence."[237]


Treating of leather and ink used in Torah scroll

In Yemen, large goats (2 yrs. old) were used in making the parchment for Torah scrolls, as opposed to _tefillin_ (phylacteries) in which only small kids of the goats (appx. 2 months old) were used for the vellum.[238] In Torah scrolls, the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the _salam_-tree (_Acacia etbaica_; _A. nilotica kraussiana_), a tree known locally by the name _qaraḍ_ (_garadh_). The same tannin substance and its use in treating leather for sacred scrolls is mentioned by Maimonides (1989:298). These leaves, being astringent, have the same function as gall.[239] A bath solution of the crushed leaves of this tree, into which raw leather had been inserted for prolonged soaking, would take only 15 days for curing. The water and leaves, however, required changing after seven or eight days, and the leather needed to be turned over daily. Usually such treatment would suffice, without the need of spreading any other salve onto the leather,[240] but only in cases where there was an erasure and the newly applied ink would spread would scribes in Yemen practise "sizing" of the leather, a process so-called by treating the leather parchment with a paste of Tragacanth gum () or Gum arabic, and allowing the place to dry before applying ink. In some places, the fleshy-side of the leather (being the side that is written upon) was treated with a fine application of castor oil, taken directly from the bean of the castor oil plant (_Ricinus communis_), and which application is known to give added elasticity and durability to the leather.

According to Amram Qorah, the way in which leather was prepared in Yemen for use in writing a Torah scroll was as follows:

    If it were whole leather (Heb. _ğawīl_) that the scribe wanted to write a Torah scroll upon, he would go to the tanner, select for himself sheep hides that had been treated (cured) to his satisfaction, and the tanner would sell them to him in their imperfect state, without trimming and without modification. The scribe then brings them to his house, softens them by sprinkling water upon them, and then spreads them out and stretches them, and then smooths the face of the leather on its flesh side, by scraping it with an instrument called a rasp (Arabic: _mibshara_). Afterwards, he cuts away the excessive edges and the outer corners, until he is left with a square sheet of leather. He then stains the sheet [of leather] with a dye solution made of turmeric, which resembles the colour of saffron, and then marks on the two ends of the sheet of parchment with the aid of a tool called a ruler the number of lines that are customarily made, and thus he delineates lines after he had rubbed the face of the leather on the side facing the hairs, with a smooth stone, in a scrupulous manner, so that it will be fitting and make writing easier. He then divides the columns[241] and, forthwith, begins his task [of writing].
    [As for the parchment known as _q'laf_] (the leather that is not whole, and used mainly for writing the portions contained in the Tefillin), most scribes were skilled in treating leather for use as _q'laf_. The scribe does all those steps mentioned in the working of _ğawīl_, and smooths the face of the leather on its flesh side, for the space of what is needed to write upon [and no more], leaving it white, without dyeing it any colour."[242]

In Yemen, scribes prepared their own ink concoction, usually made from soaking copper sulphate crystals (copper vitriol) in water, known locally as _zāğ_ (), but more often by mixing in the water _al-ḥura_ (Litharge of alum),[243] _qishr rumān_ (Pomegranate rinds), _ʿafaṣ_ (Gall), ground to a powder and steeped in water and exposed to the sun's rays for two or three days, sifted of its residue and its yellowish liquid added to the ink concoction only near the time of writing, and after the ink had once again been allowed to sit in the sun for more than a day in order to receive its luster. An excessive amount of gall was seen as detrimental to the ink, therefore, used sparingly, as also too many pomegranate rinds will cause the ink to fade. A little sugar was also added to the ink concoction, as well as soot from the flame of burnt oils held against glass and _ṣameġ_ (Gum Arabic).[244] In some places, wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), or what is called in Arabic _shiba_, was added to the ink to preserve the leather from mold and mildew. The traditional writing instrument in Yemen was the cane reed (calamus), rather than the feathered quill.[245]


Forms of the letters and special techniques

Just as there is a unique style of writing associated with Ashkenazi scrolls, and another style for Sephardic scrolls, so too is there a style of writing that is peculiar to Yemenite scribes of the previous centuries. Each community, however, makes use of the square Hebrew script. In some scrolls of Yemenite provenance, there was not a practice among scribes to write the Hebrew letters with their _Tagim_, since the accurate tradition of doing so had long been lost. The ancient practice in Yemen when writing the letter _ḥet_ (ח) is to make its roof flat, and not a "gable-roof," as prescribed by Rabbeinu Tam (Yaakov Meir), although more modern scrolls have adopted Rabbeinu Tam's method. The difference stems from one's understanding of the word חטרי in Tractate _Menaḥoth_.[246] In Yemenite scrolls, the Hebrew letters are made to suspend a fraction below the ruled lines, rather than hang directly from the ruled lines.

The manner in which Jewish scribes made certain Hebrew characters has evolved throughout the years in Yemen. Rabbi David ben Zimra (1479–1573) mentions the practice of the Jews of Aden, where in all their Torah scrolls the left leg of the Hebrew character _he_ (ה) was slightly joined to the roof of the letter, a practice which he disqualifies, although admitting that such was also the practice that he found in old scrolls written in Egypt, and which practice had been rendered valid by Rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet and Rabbi Joseph Colon.[247] Nevertheless, the old practice in Yemen of slightly joining the leg of the Hebrew character _he_ (ה) to its roof, or the leg of the _qof_ (ק) to its roof, eventually evolved to conform with the custom that is practised in other communities in Israel. Rabbi Yosef Qafih, commenting on Maimonides' _Mishne Torah_, responds to the old practice and goes to great lengths to show that such letters, had they been written in such a way, should not be disqualified, although the custom in Israel has now changed.[248]

One of the unique features found in scrolls penned in Yemen is the practice of marking the end of the biblical verse, not with ink, but by stamping the leather with a round-tipped metal instrument at the end of the verse, in order to assist the _baal qoré_ when reading and knowing when he is to come to a full-stop. These dot-like impressions in the leather were made so as to resemble an inverted _segol_ (one dot on top of two dots). Where the reading was to produce the sound made by the trope symbol _etnaḥa_ (brief pause), it too was marked with only one dot by the same instrument beneath the word whose reading is to be read as such. Two diagonal stamp marks were made above the word whose reading called for it to be read with a _zarqa_. Some have questioned the validity of marking a Torah scroll in this way, but the sages of Yemen have explained its validity by saying that extraneous markings that are made in the leather without ink are permitted.[249][250]

Yemenite Torah scrolls traditionally had also the additional feature where the top corners of each leather sheet of parchment were folded backwards, immediately following the leather's treatment and before the actual writing.[251] This was done to distinguish between each sheet, as also to give the reader the ability to grasp with his two hands the sheet of parchment by the folds, without touching the letters themselves. The left and right margins of each sheet of parchment were made to a standard width of one-fingerbreadth (ca. 2.5 cm.), and when coupled together with other sheets, the margins came to two fingerbreadths.[252] The stitching of the sheets of parchment together was made differently from the practices found among other groups, in that the stitching made with ligaments was made closer together (appx. one centimeter between stitches) and more tightly fitting in Yemenite scrolls.[253] As required in Jewish law, and as found among all other groups, they did not sew the sheets together at the upper and lower ends of the margins, but left a space there unstitched.

Torah cases

The Torah case (Heb. _tiq_) traditionally used in Yemen was either a seven faceted or octagonal wooden box, typically made of a light wood, such as Sudanese teak (Cordia abyssinica), equipped with a pair of brass clasps cut in ornamental floral shapes for closing. The entire wooden box was fitted tightly with a thickly woven decorative cloth, replete with 3 to 5 buttons with matching loops. The top of the box was made with slits wherein they inserted protruding staves for carrying the decorative silver finials (Heb. _rimmonim_).[254]


Testimonials

Yaakov Sapir (1822–1886), a Lithuanian Jewish scholar from Jerusalem, was commissioned by the Jerusalem Rabbinate and traveled to Egypt, to Yemen and to India between the years 1857 to 1863. In 1859, he visited the Jewish community in Yemen, publishing an account of his travels soon thereafter in a book entitled, _Iben Sapir_, perhaps one of the most momentous travelogues ever to have been written in that century, and where he describes the life of the Jewish community there. He also described the Torah scrolls and codices had in Yemen and their peculiar tradition of orthography, an excerpt of which follows.[255]

And lo, in their books of the Torah there are to be found several differences in _defective_ and _plene_ letters, for example: _minnaso_ (Gen. 4:13), [in the verse, "My iniquity is greater than I can bear,"] lacks a _waw_; [or] _maʻayanoth_ (Gen. 7:11) [in the verse, "All of the fountains of the deep were opened,"] lacks a _waw_; [as well as] _wiyiheyu kol yamei noaḥ_ (Gen. 9:28), [in the verse, "And all of the days of Noah were," etc., is written] with the addition of a _waw_ at its end; _teʻaseh_ (Exo. 25:31), [in the verse, "Of beaten work shall the candlestick be made,"] lacks a _yod_; _ḥodsheikhem_ (Num.10:10), [in the verse, "Your new moons," etc., is written] with the addition of a _yod_; as also in the lay-out of the Song of the Sea (Exo.15: 1-ff.) and in certain closed sections [of the Law]. And I saw that all their ancient books were [written] in this way.

(A note appended later by R. Yaakov Sapir to the above section reads as follows:)

I do recall my faults this day. When I had taken with me a scroll of the Torah [written] in the handwriting of the scriveners of Yemen, and when I had proofread it, I found in it the differences that I formerly mentioned, as well as other [changes] – besides that which can be attributed to scribal error, and I corrected it after the manner of our own books. Then when I happened to be, afterwards, in Paris during [the month of] Tishri, 5625 _anno mundi_ (1865 CE), I saw a book in the library of that great personage, the savant and honorable teacher and Rabbi, Rabbi Hertz Ginsburg (may his light shine), which [library] stood under the supervision of my beloved friend, the wise and illustrious Rabbi, [even] our teacher the Rabbi, S. Zacks (may his light shine), a most dear manuscript made by the Rabbi [who is known as] _the Meiri_, of blessed memory, [and which book was entitled], _Kiryat Sefer_.

Its name is derived from [its content, which treats on] all the laws governing the scroll of the Law, how it ought to be written, and how read, therein showing all of the _defective_ [letters], and _plene_ [letters], open sections and closed sections, [etc., which scribes are wont to make in a scroll of the Law] – nothing being left undone, whether small or great, which he did not bring out in that book. He has withal done far more than what could ever have been expected, whether it were of any man who came before him, or who should come after him. Now I shall copy here, in short, an outline of the matters from one of the chapters, being useful for the purport [of our discourse], and whose words are as follows:

"Now behold, herein, do I make a copy of the writing which the forenamed Rabbi (i.e. the _Ramah_, of blessed memory) sent to the sages of Burgos [in Spain] who had belabored themselves on this point (i.e. over the subject of proofreading the scroll of the Law) with a well-known book [of the Law] attributed to Hillel the elder, [and] which was called by them _Halleujah_."

The [author of the book] _Yuchasin_ wrote these words: "Now in the year 4956 _anno mundi_ (1196 CE), on the 8th of Menaḥem Av, there fell out a great religious persecution in the kingdom of León, to the extent that they carried away from there a Codex containing the 24 canonical books of the Bible, called the _Biblia_, which R. Hillel had written, and from which they would proofread the texts of all the scrolls. Now I saw some of them (i.e. scrolls) that were sold in Africa, and at my time, they were nine-hundred years old since the time they were first written." The [same author of the book] _Yuchasin_, on the year 5250 _anno mundi_ (1490 CE), wrote: _ha-Qimḥi_ (c. 1160–c. 1235) said in his _Piece on Grammar_, in the chapter _lemaʻan tizkaru_, that the Codex was in Toledo [of Spain], and [that it was found written after its prescription] in the books [of the Law] left by the early Geonim, [particularly] by Rav Sherira [Gaon] and Rabbeinu Hai [Gaon]. And when the books of Rabbeinu Moshe (i.e. Maimonides, of blessed memory) came amongst them and they saw his tradition of orthography in this regard, they sent to him (i.e. to the _Ramah_) and he answered them after [much] flowery speech and many praises, whose words were these: 'But presently I shall tell you the truth, that all the books that have reached us of those books written by Rabbeinu Moshe (Maimonides), may peace rest on him, with regard to open sections and closed sections, all of them were engrossed with different errors one from the other, since the words of the book were concealed [from understanding], and those copyists who copied from it made rash decisions on their own, and each one added [what he pleased], and diminished [from the true text] according to his own understanding, thus defacing the books with things that they imagined in their heart to be true, and which they gave their opinion to, but which I was compelled to investigate and make inquiry into, etc., etc. And so, I sent to Marseilles, to the most erudite man [there], Samuel Ibn Tibbon, the physician, and I asked him to send me an [accurate] account of the closed and open sections from the book [of the Law] that was copied from the book [of the Law] belonging to that Rabbi (i.e. Maimonides) that came with him to Marseilles, and which said Rabbi (may his memory be blessed) had signed in his own handwriting; as also that which I, myself, had written down from the book (that was no longer before me), _I am Moshe, the son of Rabbi Maimon the Sepharadi_. And so did he do, sending them to me with due speed, and I found in the copy of the writing, etc. all the things that you brought to my attention for a decision [as touching the writings of Maimonides] that they were [indeed] true, etc. and that the other matters that were concealed [therein from our understanding] were not made clear unto me by that book until I was compelled to once again search and inquire [into them], etc., and it was revealed unto me their import by the help of Him who favors man with understanding. Now, behold! They are written in this [leafed] booklet which is being sent to you, etc., [both] open and closed [sections], [and] that which is neither an open [section] nor a closed [section], but rather an arranged [section], in my own handwriting. Likewise, I have written for you the lay-out of the [prosaic] song _Ha'azinu_ in two categories: one, containing the names of words that come at the beginning of each line; the other, containing the names of words that come at the end of each line. (Now there are altogether sixty-seven lines [in the prosaic song _Ha'azinu_], just as it is found in my handwritten Bible Codex, and in [copies of] Maimonides of [those made by the] early exponents of our laws…) … [Signed]: From him that has been afflicted with reproof of instruction, not with whips, _per se_, but with scorpions, until he was compelled to confess his sorrow unto many – perchance they will seek mercy upon him from Him who has mercy; [I], who writes to his friends and companions, MEIR HALEVI, THE SON OF R. TODROS.' "

And, there, the Rabbi who is _the Meiri_, of blessed memory, writes more, [_viz_.], that in Toledo [of Spain] there was a book [of the Law] called _the Book of Ezra_, and a certain Codex that was copied from the Codex belonging to the _Ramah_ (i.e. Meir ha-Levi b. Todros Abulafia, c. 1165–1244), whom we mentioned, which [latter] was proofread many times with utmost diligence by several scribes and wise men, in the forenamed city, with painstaking care and great expense, and came afterwards into his hand with all the testimonies of the proofreaders and scribes, and, based on it, he wrote in this, his own book _Kiryat Sefer_, every word which is either _defective_ or _plene_, open and closed sections, in the year of the exile of France, which corresponds to the year 5066 _anno mundi_ (1306 CE). Unto here we have brought down his words. Now, behold! I have found [and] seen in this [book], _Kiryat Sefer_, exactly as it is found written in the scrolls of Yemen! (q.v. _supra_, the treatise on Egypt, where I have elaborated in great length about all their details.) And so, in vain have I erased and made corrections. Now if I had seen it beforehand, I would not have touched it [with my own] hand! But He is merciful [and] atones for iniquity… END

[1] Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), p. 68. According to Penkower, the Ashkenazi tradition– with respect to _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in their Torah scrolls – follows more closely the teachings of Rabbi Meir Halevi Abulafia (the Ramah), Rabbi Menahem Lonzano (author of _Or Torah_) and Rabbi Jedidiah Norzi, the author of the seminal work, _Minḥat Shai_. Their accepted orthography for the Hebrew Bible was published in the Tartaz Codex, printed in Amsterdam in 1666. Excluding the irregular letters in the Torah, the Ashkenazi tradition differs from the Yemenite tradition in some thirteen places. Penkower goes on to say that the Yemenite tradition, in terms of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_, is nearly identical to the Aleppo Codex; see also Breuer, M. (1976), English Introduction (p. xxvii).

[7] Benayah ben Sa'adyah has long been acknowledged as the greatest scribe of Yemenite Jewry and as patriarch of an entire family of Yemenite scribes which flourished beginning in the latter half of the fifteenth century, in and around the capital, Sana'a. In addition to Benaya himself, at least four of his children (three sons and a daughter) and two of his grandsons followed in his footsteps and penned Hebrew manuscripts. According to Yemenite tradition, the Benayah family is said to have copied some 400 volumes. Out of this great number, only about 36 codices have survived.

The advantage of taking the tendons from the flanks (Heb. כסלים) is that they were naturally long, unlike those taken from the heel, and they did not require softening by working them with a stone, nor was it necessary to twine the tendons before making use of them (ibid.).

The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word מנשא written without a _waw_, in _defective scriptum_.

[26] The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word מעינת written without a _waw_, in _defective scriptum_. M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sathon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, מעינת, was indeed written in _defective scriptum_.

[27]

[28]

[29] The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word ויהיו written with a final _waw_. In Hibshoosh, Yehiel (1985), s.v. Gen. 9:29, the word is written with a final _waw_. A comparison made with another Codex written by the same scribe in 1490, now at the British Museum (Or. 2349) reveals the same final _waw_ in ויהיו כל ימי נח; see: The British Library MS Viewer, frame 33v. M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sethon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, ויהיו, was indeed written in _plene scriptum_.

[30] Qorah, A. (1987), p. 103. Likewise, Hibshoosh, Yehiel (1985), s.v. Gen. 41:45, where the word פוטיפרע ("Potifera") is written as one word. So, too, in the Damascus Pentateuch the name is written as one word. However, the Aleppo Codex, based on the testimony passed down by Yaakov Sapir (_Me'oroth Nathan_), had the name פוטי פרע written in two words.

[31]

[32] Qorah, A. (1987), p. 104. Cf. Sapir, Y. (1986), p. 166, where he brings down the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ as relayed to him by the overseers of the Jewish community in Aleppo in the then complete Aleppo Codex, and where he wrote that in Exodus 25:31 the word תעשה was written in the Aleppo Codex in _defective scriptum_ – without a _yod_. The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word תעשה written without a _yod_, in _defective scriptum_. Concerning this word in Exodus 25:31, Avraham ibn Ezra has written: "I have seen books [of the Torah] that were checked by the sages of Tiberias, and fifteen of their elders have sworn that they have looked three times upon every word and every point, and [upon] every word written in _plene_ and _defective scriptum_, and lo! There was written a _yod_ in the word תֵּיעֲשֶׂה. But I haven’t found so in the books [of the Torah] in Spain and in France, and beyond the sea. Moreover, the ancients have expounded that the addition of a _yod_ (i.e. numerical value of ten) alludes to the ten candelabrums that Solomon would make, although the general rule states that if there were there a _yod_ it is a foreign word. By way of an exegesis [they have said] that it was made by itself (i.e. because of its passive-perfect tense). The reason being is that all those who saw it were astonished how a man could make it, etc." It is to be noted that the Spanish Jewish community has since abandoned its old tradition in this regard.

[34] Qorah, A. (1987), p. 104.

[35] The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word האפד written without a _waw_, in _defective scriptum_. M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sathon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, האפד, was indeed written in _defective scriptum_.

[36]

[37] The Leningrad Codex, a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also an Open Section for this reading. So, too, the Yemenite MS. of Maimonides' Mishne Torah has this section listed as an Open Section; see: Qafih, Y. (1985), chapter 8, p. 402 note 19.

[40]

[41] Although the Leningrad Codex and the Damascus Pentateuch both have the word בשמות in Numbers 1:17 as containing a _waw_ (i.e. in _plene scriptum_), Rabbi Jacob Saphir (Sapir, Y. 1986) brings down the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ as relayed to him by the overseers of the Jewish community in Aleppo in the then complete Aleppo Codex, and writes that in Numbers 1:17 the word בשמת was written in the Aleppo Codex in _defective scriptum_ – without a _waw_. In this case, the Yemenite Jewish tradition still finds solid ground and support on which to base its own scribal traditions. M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sathon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, בשמת, was indeed written in _defective scriptum_.

[42]

[43]

[44] M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sathon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, חדשיכם, was indeed written in _plene scriptum_, with a _yod_.

[45]

[46]

[47] Cf. Sapir, Y. (1986), p. 171, where he brings down the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ as relayed to him by the overseers of the Jewish community in Aleppo in the then complete Aleppo Codex, and where he wrote that in Numbers 25:12 the _waw_ (ו) of the word שלום was written complete, and without being broken in the Aleppo Codex.

[51] In the Torah codex (Pentateuch) copied by David ben Benaya in 1490, now at British Museum (Or. 2349), the word דכא is written with an "aleph." See: The British Library MS Viewer, frame 136r. M.D. Cassuto, a man who made a copy of Menashe Sathon's list of _plene_ and _defective scriptum_ in the Aleppo Codex, has attested that this word, דכא, was written with an _aleph_ (א).

[52] Maimonides, _Mishne Torah_ (_Hil. Sefer Torah_ 7:11), who writes: "...If he wrote plene defective, or defective plene, or if he wrote an open section closed or a closed section open... then it is invalid and it has no sanctity of a Torah scroll at all." See also Qorah, A. (1987), p. 103; Yihye Saleh (Maharitz), _Ḥeleq ha-Diqdūq_, Parashat Noaḥ, s.v. ויהיו כל ימי נח (Hebrew). Rabbi Menachem Meiri objects, saying in the Preface to his _Kiryat Sefer_, Jerusalem 1956, that where there is a variant tradition in the _plene_ and _defective scriptum_, or in the Open and Closed sections, and they are supported by the writings of the early exponents of the Torah, even though the tradition has not been accepted by other scribes, we do not invalidate such a Torah scroll. However, where no support can be found in the writings of Israel's early sages or exponents, we invalidate such a Torah scroll.

[123] In the Benayah codex written in 1535, now in the possession of Rabbi Hayyim Kessar's daughter and son-in-law in Jerusalem, as in all other Yemenite codices, the head of the _lamed_ (ל) is inverted backwards.

[126] The Yemenite tradition, in terms of number of lines in _Shirat Ha'azinu_, follows the ruling of Maimonides, in his handwritten Ms. of Mishne Torah, now at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England (Ms. Huntington 80), pp. 135b–136a. In the printed texts, however, the text of Maimonides' _Mishne Torah_ (_Hil. Sefer Torah_ 8:4) has been altered to read "seventy lines" (rather than 67). A comparison with the partially extant Book of Deuteronomy in the Aleppo Codex reveals that it, too, was written in only 67 lines. See: The Aleppo Codex Online (select Book of Deuteronomy from list, starting with chapter 32_28).

[127] See the 15th century Yemenite Codex at the British Library, Or. 2350, showing the six lines with their proper indentations. Every three pages in the codex equals one column in the Sefer Torah.

[128] Saleh Y. (1979), vol. 2, _responsum_ # 22. Although Maharitz suggested a compromise of sorts out of respect to those exponents of the law who objected to this practice of making indentations in these six lines, the original Yemenite tradition viewed the practice as valid, and Yemenite scribes continued to make use of this practice, without change.

[134] Meiri (1956), p. 47, who mentions this invaluable account, wherein he copies down a letter written by Rabbi Meir b. Todros Halevi where he states explicitly that he found the words as written above, but decided against its orthography because of the way the previous lines had been made.

[135]

[136] Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), pp. 40–41

[137] This may have also been the result of the variant readings found in the works of the masoretes. The Damascus Codex (10th cent.), as well as a beautifully written Spanish codex of the 11th or 12th century (now Vatican ebr. 448, frame 102r) and the London Codex (Or. 4445) all show differing orthographic renditions for the last two lines in the Song of the Sea.

[138] The lines of the _Song of the Sea_ in the Sephardic scroll are based on the _Tikkun Soferim_, "Ish Matzliach," by Rabbi Matzliach Mazuz, which, in turn, are founded upon Rabbi Jedidiah Norzi's _Minḥat Shai_. The Yemenite tradition is well-known, and follows the pattern found in the Leningrad Codex (B19a), p. 85 in pdf. Although the Book of Exodus in the Aleppo Codex is no longer extant, the arrangement of lines in the Prosaic _Song of the Sea_ is attested to have been identical to the Yemenite tradition of today. See: Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), pp. 40–41. The arrangement of lines is also identical with _Shirat ha-Yam_ in Maimonides' own hand-written copy of the Mishne Torah, now at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England (Ms. Huntington 80), p. 137a – chapter 9 (top).

[139] The Hebrew verse is expressed by an idiom, literally: "The hand of the Lord upon the throne, the Lord shall be at war with Amalek from generation to generation." Meaning, God has sworn by His throne that he will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

[140] Sapir, Y. (1986), p. 165 (entry # 137). The Damascus Pentateuch of the 10th century, which incorporates both the Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali traditions, also writes these words as one word (see ibid., p. 140 in vol. 1).

[149] Rabbi Judah Attiya of Aleppo, at the behest of M.D. Cassuto, copied down the Open and Closed sections of the Aleppo Codex for the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, and presented these to Cassuto. The Open and Closed sections for the book of Genesis were checked by Cassuto himself. In these findings, there emerged differences between the Aleppo Codex and the Yemenite tradition (based on Maimonides) in three different sections. See: Offer, Joseph (1989), pp. 325 [49]–326 [50]).

[150]

[151] These being: Gen. 41:45; Exo. 1:19; Exo. 17:16; Exo. 34:1; Lev. 7:28–29; Lev. 19:16; Lev. 25:10–12 and Num. 22:5.

[152] Offer, Joseph (1989), p. 312 [36]. Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby, citing Menashe Sathon, claims that the Aleppo Codex had erred in three places: בטרם תבוא אליהן (Exo. 1:19), לא תעמד על דם רעיך (Lev. 19:16) and יובל היא תהיה לכם (Lev. 25:10). See Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (1992), _responsum_ # 146, s.v. ועתה בחדש תמוז (p. 251).

[153] Aside from the shapes of the letters, the Sephardic tradition of today (e.g. _plene_ and _defective scriptum_, the Open and Closed sections, etc.) is the same as that of the Ashkenazi tradition. Among Ashkenazi Jews, _Tikkun Soferim Dovidovitch_ is now the standard text used for copying modern Ashkenazi writing. Among Sephardic Jews, the Tikkun Soferim, _Ish Matzliach_, by Rabbi Matzliach Mazuz, is now used as a model text for copying modern Sephardic scrolls.

[154] Known also as the Codex Orientales 4445, which Ch. D. Ginsburg dated to 820–850 CE, and which Kahle dated to the 10th-century CE. The current manuscript was written by two different scribes, the older square script believed to be from the 9th century, whereas the newer Yemenite square script was written in the 16th century (1539 CE). Today, the Codex is held at the British Library (The London Codex (Or. 4445) and other MSS.)

[237] Abraham Maimuni (1937), _responsum_ # 91 (pp.134–135)

[238] In Yemen, small kids of the goats, approximately two months old, were used for vellum (kalaf) in making Tefillin. It was not necessary to split the leather, in this case, since it was already very thin. The custom in treating leather hides that were to be used for the books of the Law and for the scroll of Esther was, indeed, to put them into an astringent solution of a gall-like substance extracted from the leaves of acacia (Arabic: _qaradh_). However, the vellum (kalaf) used in writing the Tefillin was never treated with any gall-like substance. (The reason being that leather, when treated with gall or similar substances, constricts and usually takes on a darker colour. Although this treatment gives the leather its durability , it makes writing on such parchment very difficult, as the ink tends to glide on the parchment and is not absorbed so readily into the leather. This makes writing the four portions of scripture in the Tefillin all the more difficult, since the strips of parchment were very small in order that they might be inserted within the phylactery boxes. For this reason, in Yemen as in other places of world Jewry, the leather used in writing the four portions of scripture for the Tefillin went without the treatment of gall, and was subsequently white.)

[239] Gall substances used in tanning leather is a requisite according to many exponents of Jewish law, such as the author of the lexicon, _Sefer Ha-Arukh_, and Maimonides, and Rabbeinu Hananel, and Rabbi Hai Gaon, and the Sheëltot of Rabbi Achai of Shibha. The gall gives the leather its lasting durability. The Shulhan Arukh of Maran, on the other hand, writes that it is sufficient to treat leather with lime alone. Leaves from the _salam_-tree (Ar. _qarat_) were crushed and put within a bath of water. The untreated leather was added to this solution for a period of 15 days, the time allotted for its preparation. After the first 8 days of soaking, the leaves are changed with a batch of fresh leaves. After another 7–8 days, the leather was ready for use. The _salam_-tree leaves give the leather a reddish-tinge. The tree, known locally as _qarāḍ_, grows plenteous in the coastal areas of Arabia and Oman.

[243] A yellowish-white mineral having the same property as vitriol, and which turns the water black. It was derived from a saline earth found in the ravines and gulches of Yemen. The same earth, when extracted, was usually mixed with alum. The alum was then cleansed of its litharge until it became white. The litharge was then taken up and mixed with water to produce a black dye. In this, the Yemenites did not follow the teaching of Maimonides who wrote that the ink must not be indelible. The use of vitriol made the ink indelible.

[248] Qafih, Y. (1985), _Hil. Sefer Torah_ 10:1 (note 8). Qafih wrote: "...If a letter touched itself in a place where its shape is not made entirely corrupt thereby, and [if] it does not resemble a different letter, it is [still] valid... And if it is a questionable matter, they bring a young child who is neither wise, nor unintelligent, just as it is explained in the Gemara (_Menahoth_ 29b). So it is our custom to render valid anything similar to these cases, and even as a first resort they are [permitted] to read in a scroll of the Law that has in it such joining, and it is not necessary to amend it. Look at Saleh, Y. (1979b), vol. 3, _responsum_ # 213, who wrote in the name of Rabbi Levi, the son of Habib (HaRalbach), who quotes in turn from the Meiri in _Qiryat Sefer_. And even if the left leg of the letter _he_ (ה) was found clinging to its rooftop, with [only] a slight joining and not a considerable one, so long as the shape of the [Hebrew] letter _he_ (ה) is [still] recognizable and a young child reads it as the letter _he_, it is valid. So did Rabbi Shimon Bar Tzemach (the _Tashbetz_) write in the second volume [of his Questions & Responsa], section # 73. Moreover, even if the entire scroll was written from the start in this way, it is valid and does not require being amended. And he brings down proof from that which is written in [Tractate] _Menahoth_ [29b], that the more meticulous scribes would hang the [left] leg of the letter he. By this wording we learn that only as a first rule of thumb, being of a more superlative nature, was it stated, and not that it is indispensable... Be apprised, [moreover], that in the ancient Torah scrolls of Yemen the leg of the letter _qof_ (ק) was joined to its roof, and in this manner was [written] the scroll of the Law known as "Tam," which was in the village Qaryat al-Qabil. All of the legs of the letter _qof_ were joined to their roof. And so were the ancient scrolls of the Law in Tunis and Tripoli made, just as Rabbi Shimon Bar Tzemach (the _Tashbetz_) wrote in a _responsum_, vol. I, [_responsum_] # 50. Look there, for he went to great lengths to prove that it is valid. And there, in _responsum_ # 51, he brought evidence from the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra that in this manner were [written] the scrolls of the Law in Spain. Wherefore, [such a scroll] is valid as a first resort."
