THEODORA BÜTTNER (born Theodora Reichel, 17 June 1930) is a retired East German historian. For many years she was a professor at the Karl Marx University (as it was known at the time) in Leipzig. Much of her own research was focused on the precolonial history of Africa and on the anti-colonial liberation movements.[1][2]


Life

Theodora Reichel was born in Thum, a small former mining town in the hills south of Chemnitz. Her mother worked in retailing and her father was employed as a businessman.[3] She attended school locally between 1936 and 1949, by which time she had lived through the Second World War (1939–1945) and the region of Germany in which she grew up had come to be administered as the Soviet occupation zone (1945–1949). Between 1949 and 1953 she studied successfully for a degree in History, English studies and Pedagogy[4] at the teacher training section (_"Lehramt"_) of the University of Leipzig.[5]

Between 1946 and 1953 she was a member of the Free German Youth (_"Freie Deutsche Jugend"_ / FDJ) which was in effect the youth wing of the Socialist Unity Party (_"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"_ / SED), a new political party, launched under contentious circumstances in April 1946 and, by the time the German Democratic Republic was founded in October 1949, well on its way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. In 1953, the year of her twenty-third birthday, she herself became a member of the SED.[6] It was also in 1953 that she was appointed an assistant at the university's Philosophy (including other "humanities") Institute.[7]

She received her doctorate from Leipzig in 1957. Her dissertation concerned the socio-religious Circumcellion movement.[8] During this period she was employed as a research assistant (1954-1961) and then as a senior research assistant (1961-1965) in the Middle Ages Department at the Institute for General History of Leipzig University.[9] Her habilitation (higher academic degree)), which concerned the socio-economic structure of Adamawa Region during the nineteenth century, opened the way for a successful academic career. In 1966 she obtained a teaching post in African History at the Leipzig University Africa Institute.[10] In 1968 she was appointed a full professor for African History at the Africa Institute, and in 1969 further promotion followed as she was given a post covering the Africa and Middle East section, but her own work continued to focus on Africa.[11]

From 1988 till 1992 Theodora Büttner was a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences at (East) Berlin.[12] She retired in 1992.[13]


Personal

Theodora Büttner was married to (Kurt) Hermann Büttner (1926–1999) who was, like her, an Africa specialist in the Leipzig University History department.[14]
