The was a Japanese coin worth one tenth of a Japanese yen, as 100 _sen_ equalled 1 yen.[1] These coins were minted from the late 19th century up until the end of World War II.


History

Ten sen coins were first minted in 1870, and like the other sen coins were made for international convenience. The Japanese government bought a mint in Hong Kong, and the machinery was established in Osaka. In _The British Almanac_ from 1873, author John Crowdy notes that the Japanese put a lot more thought into convenience than the German Empire.[2] These coins were minted during eight periods that spanned three different imperial eras. Two different varieties were produced in 1940, 1941, and 1943 when the coin was ultimately reduced in size. At the end of World War II, aluminium coins were produced from late 1945 into 1946. These should not be confused with the scarce clay baked coins which unofficially circulated before the end of the war. The final ten-sen coins were produced in 1946, and were eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953.[3]

Circulation figures

Meiji

The following are circulation figures for ten sen coins that were minted between the 3rd, and the 45th year of Meiji's reign. The dates all begin with the Japanese symbol 明治 (Meiji), followed by the year of his reign the coin was minted. Each coin is read clockwise from right to left, so in the example used below "二十三" would read as "year 32" or 1899. Some of the mintages included cover more than one variety of a given coin.

-   "Year" ← "Number representing year of reign" ← "Emperors name" (Ex: 年 ← 二十三 ← 治明)

Taishō

The following are circulation figures for ten sen coins that were minted between the 1st and the 15th (last) year of Taishō's reign.
