VANOSS is an unincorporated community in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma.[1] The community is located 10 miles west of Ada.[2] The town was originally named Midland and was located a few miles away from its present location.[3] When the Oklahoma Central Railroad was built, the townspeople moved the town so it would be next to the railroad,[4] and they changed its name to Vanoss in honor of Salomon Frederik van Oss (S.F. Vanoss), who was a Dutch director and financier of the Oklahoma Central Railroad.[5][6][7] Though little remains of the community, Vanoss Public Schools, including an elementary school, a middle school, and Vanoss High School, continue to serve the surrounding area.[8]
