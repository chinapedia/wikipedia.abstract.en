Plot

Coulson, Fitz and Robbie are trapped out of sync with reality, unable to interact with the real world, with no-one else able to see, hear or touch them. They are being drawn to another dimension, which Robbie describes as Hell, revealing that the Ghost Rider spirit has been there before. Killing several agents using his new powers, Morrow escapes, while the Ghost Rider spirit, unwilling to return to 'Hell', abandons Robbie and instead possesses Mack, just as he learns Morrow was allied with the Chinese Watchdogs, having recruited them to retrieve the ghost scientists and find the Darkhold. Mack hunts down the remaining Chinese gang members, and Daisy pursues him, unknowingly accompanied by Robbie, who convinces the spirit to return to him and help him exact revenge on Morrow, in exchange for Robbie continuing to serve as the spirit's host afterwards.

May decides to use the Darkhold to rescue Coulson, Fitz and Robbie, and enlists Radcliffe to read the Darkhold, but he finds the contents are too overwhelming for the human brain to perceive. AIDA suggests she reads it instead, revealing her android nature to May (and Coulson), and with the magical knowledge she learns from the book, she builds a machine that opens a dimensional portal, through which Coulson, Fitz and Robbie return.

Meanwhile, Simmons frees Vijay from his Terrigen cocoon by touching it, at which point Nadeer immediately has her removed. Upon returning to the Playground she reunites with Fitz, who learned of the deal Mace made with Nadeer while out of sync. In an end tag, AIDA secretly begins experimenting with her new knowledge from the Darkhold, creating an artificial brain.
