ROMAN NUMERALS are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. Modern usage employs seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value:[1]

Modern clock faces that use Roman numerals still usually employ for four o'clock but for nine o'clock, a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the Wells Cathedral clock of the late 14th century.[2][3][4] However, this is far from universal: for example, the clock on the Palace of Westminster tower, "Big Ben", uses a subtractive for 4 o'clock.[5]

These vary from - a classical use of additive notation for (1910), as seen on Admiralty Arch, London, to the more unusual, if not unique for (1903), on the north entrance to the Saint Louis Art Museum.[6]

Sometimes 5 and 50 have been written and instead of and , and there are instances such as and rather than or .[7][8]

Irregular subtractive notation

The irregular use of subtractive notation, such as for 17,[9] for 18,[10] for 97,[11] for 98,[12][13] and for 99[14] were occasionally used in more modern times. A possible explanation is that the word for 18 in Latin was _duodeviginti_, literally "two from twenty". Similarly, the words for 98 and 99 were _duodecentum_ (two from hundred) and _undecentum_ (one from hundred), respectively.[15] These ways of saying 18, 98 and 99 have been attributed to influence from the Etruscans, who would say _ciem zaθrum_ (three from twenty) for 17, _eslem zaθrum_ (two from twenty) for 18 and _θunem zaθrum_ (one from twenty) for 19.[16] Apparently, at least one ancient stonecutter mistakenly thought that the of "22nd Legion" stood for 18, and "corrected" it to .[17] However, the explanation does not seem to apply to and , since the Latin words for 17 and 97 were _septendecim_ (seven ten) and _nonaginta septem_ (ninety seven), respectively.

Another example of irregular subtractive notation is the use of for 18. It was used by officers of the XVIII Roman Legion to write their number.[18][19] The notation appears prominently on the cenotaph of their senior centurion Marcus Caelius ( – AD 9). There does not seem to be a linguistic explanation for this use, although it is one stroke shorter than .

Rare variants

While the subtractive and additive notations seem to have been used interchangeably through history, some other Roman numerals have been occasionally observed that do not fit either system. Some of these variants do not seem to have been used outside specific contexts, and may have been regarded as errors even by contemporaries. Padlock,_Athlone.jpg of the Irish town of Athlone.

-   was how people associated with the XXII Roman Legion used to write their number. The practice may have been due to a common way to say "twenty-second" in Latin, namely _duo et vice_(_n_)_sima_ (literally "two and twentieth") rather than the "regular" _vice_(_n_)_sima secunda_ (twentieth second).[20]

-   There are some examples of year numbers after 1000 written as two Roman numerals 1-99, e.g. 1613 as , corresponding to the common reading "sixteen thirteen" of such year numbers in English, or 1519 as as in French _quinze-cent-dix-neuf_ (fifteen-hundred-ten-nine), and similar readings in other languages.[22]
-   In some French texts from the 15th century and later one finds constructions like for 99, reflecting the French reading of that number as _quatre-vingt-dix-neuf_ (four-score and nineteen).[23] Similarly, in some English documents one finds, for example, 77 written as "" (which could be read "three-score and seventeen").[24]
-   Another medieval accounting text from 1301 renders numbers like 13,573 as ", that is, "(13 × 1000) + (5 × 100) + (3 × 20) + 13".[25]
-   Other numerals that do not fit the usual patterns — such as for 45, instead of the usual — may be due to scribal errors, or the writer's lack of familiarity with the system, rather than being genuine variant usage.
-   Not all combinations of symbols used in Roman numerals are intended to be taken numerically. For example, "XXX" and "XL" have other connotations besides their values as Roman numerals, while "IXL" more often than not means "I excel", and is in any case not an unambiguous Roman numeral.


Origin of the system

The system as we use today is closely associated with the city of Rome and the Empire that it created. However, due to the scarcity of surviving examples, the origins of the system are obscure and there are several competing theories, largely conjectural.

Precedents

By the time the city-state of Rome was founded, the Mediterranean east of Italy had already known several advanced literate civilizations, such as the Ancient Egypt, Phoenicia, Minos, Mycenae and several others in Asia Minor and the Levant. These civilizations influenced the Romans directly or indirectly, such as in the alphabet (via the Etruscans).

The most obvious similarity between the Roman numerals and those older number systems is the use of 10 as the base, instead of 60 (as had been in use in Mesopotamia for a millennium) or 20. That choice, however, seems to have been made through most of Eurasia, including in India and China.

The old Egyptian system had a different non-phonetic symbol for each power of ten (so that, like the Romans, they did not need a symbol for zero). However, it repeated that symbol up to nine times to get the digits 1 to 9. The Egyptians had no separate symbols for 5, 50, etc. The symbol for 1 was a vertical stroke, and that for 10 was an inverted "U"; but higher powers were denoted by figurative hieroglyphs.

The use of separate symbols for 5, 50, 500 etc. was a feature of the old Greek number system, the Attic numerals. The additive notation for writing the digits 6-9 (as the digit 5 plus the digits 1-4) was also a feature of that system. However, the symbols of the latter were letters of the Greek alphabet taken from the names of those numbers ("Π" from _ΠΕΝΤΕ_ for 5), "Δ" from _ΔΕΚΑ_ for 10, "Η" from _ΗΕΚΑΤΟΝ_ for 100, etc. or modified "Π" like "𐅄" for 50 an "𐅅" for 500.

The Attic numerals were later replaced in Greece by the classical Greek system, that also used letters to denote numbers, like the Romans, and a different set of letters for each power of 10. However, the similarities ended there. The Greek system (apparently borrowed from the late Egyptian Hieratic system) uses the first 9 letters of the alphabet to encode the units 1 to 9, then the next 9 letters for the tens 10 to 90, and similarly for the hundreds. (For this purpose an archaic alphabet was used which included additional letters not present in the classical Greek alphabet.)

Etruscan numerals

Rome was founded sometime between 850 and 750 BC. At the time, the region was inhabited by diverse populations speaking distinct languages. These included several Italic branches of the Indo-European family, as well as the Etruscans, a people of unknown origin who spoke an isolated language.

At that time, the Etruscans were the most advanced civilization in the region, and the ancient Romans themselves admitted that they inherited much of their knowledge and customs from them. Rome was located next to the southern edge of the Etruscan domain, which covered a large part of north-central Italy. Besides the Etruscans, the original population of Rome was allegedly drawn mainly from the Latins and the Sabinians, who were only two among the several Italic-speaking tribes in the peninsula.

The Roman numerals, in particular, are directly derived from the Etruscan number symbols: "𐌠", "𐌡", "𐌢", "𐌣", and "𐌟" for 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 (They had more symbols for larger numbers, but it is unknown which symbol represents which number). As in the basic Roman system, the Etruscans wrote the symbols that added to the desired number, from higher to lower value. Thus the number 87, for example, would be written 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 𐌣𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌡𐌠𐌠 (this would appear as 𐌠𐌠𐌡𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌣 since Etruscan was written from right to left.)[26]

The symbols "𐌠" and "𐌡" resembled letters of the Etruscan alphabet, but "𐌢", "𐌣", and "𐌟" did not. The Etruscans used the subtractive notation, too, but not like the Romans. They wrote 17, 18, and 19 as "𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢", "𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢", and 𐌠𐌢𐌢, mirroring the way they spoke those numbers ("three from twenty", etc.); and similarly for 27, 28, 29, 37, 38, etc. However they did not write "𐌠𐌡" for 4 (or "𐌢𐌣" for 40), and wrote "𐌡𐌠𐌠", "𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠" and "𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌠" for 7, 8, and 9, respectively.[27]

Early Roman numerals

The early Roman numerals for 1, 10, and 100 were the Etruscan ones: "", "", and "". The symbols for 5 and 50 changed from and "𐌣" to and ↆ at some point. The latter had flattened to (an inverted T) by the time of Augustus, and soon afterwards became identified with the graphically similar letter .[28]

The symbol for 100 was written variously as or , was then abbreviated to or , with (which matched a Latin letter) finally winning out. It may have helped that is the initial of _centum_, Latin for "hundred".

The numbers 500 and 1000 were denoted by or overlaid with a box or circle. Thus 500 was like a superimposed on a . It became or by the time of Augustus, under the graphic influence of the letter . It was later identified as the letter ; an alternative symbol for "thousand" was a , and half of a thousand or "five hundred" is the right half of the symbol, , and this may have been converted into .[29]

The notation for 1000 was a circled or boxed : Ⓧ, , , and by Augustinian times was partially identified with the Greek letter _phi_. Over time, the symbol changed to and . The latter symbol further evolved into , then , and eventually changed to under the influence of the Latin word _mille_ "thousand".[30]

According to Paul Kayser, the basic numerical symbols were , , and (or ) and the intermediate ones were derived by taking half of those (half an is , half a is and half a is ).[31]


Use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance

Lower case, minuscule, letters were developed in the Middle Ages, well after the demise of the Western Roman Empire, and since that time lower-case versions of Roman numbers have also been commonly used: , , , , and so on. Excerpt_from_BnF_ms._23112_fr.,_fol._343v.png Since the Middle Ages, a "" has sometimes been substituted for the final "" of a "lower-case" Roman numeral, such as "" for 3 or "" for 7. This "" can be considered a swash variant of "". The use of a final "" is still used in medical prescriptions to prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it is written.[32][33]

Numerals in documents and inscriptions from the Middle Ages sometimes include additional symbols, which today are called "medieval Roman numerals". Some simply substitute another letter for the standard one (such as "" for "", or "" for ""), while others serve as abbreviations for compound numerals ("" for "", or "" for ""). Although they are still listed today in some dictionaries, they are long out of use.[34]

Chronograms, messages with dates encoded into them, were popular during the Renaissance era. The chronogram would be a phrase containing the letters , , , , , , and . By putting these letters together, the reader would obtain a number, usually indicating a particular year.


Modern use

By the 11th century, Arabic numerals had been introduced into Europe from al-Andalus, by way of Arab traders and arithmetic treatises. Roman numerals, however, proved very persistent, remaining in common use in the West well into the 14th and 15th centuries, even in accounting and other business records (where the actual calculations would have been made using an abacus). Replacement by their more convenient "Arabic" equivalents was quite gradual, and Roman numerals are still used today in certain contexts. A few examples of their current use are:

Carlos_IV_Coin.jpg

-   Names of monarchs and popes, e.g. Elizabeth {{rn of the United Kingdom, Pope Benedict {{rn. These are referred to as regnal numbers and are usually read as ordinals; e.g. is pronounced "the second". This tradition began in Europe sporadically in the Middle Ages, gaining widespread use in England during the reign of Henry {{rn. Previously, the monarch was not known by numeral but by an epithet such as Edward the Confessor. Some monarchs (e.g. Charles {{rn and Louis {{rn) seem to have preferred the use of instead of on their coinage (see illustration).
-   Generational suffixes, particularly in the US, for people sharing the same name across generations, for example William Howard Taft {{rn.
-   In the French Republican Calendar, initiated during the French Revolution, years were numbered by Roman numerals – from the year  (1792) when this calendar was introduced to the year  (1805) when it was abandoned.
-   The year of production of films, television shows and other works of art within the work itself. It has been suggested – by BBC News, perhaps facetiously – that this was originally done "in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes."[37] Outside reference to the work will use regular Arabic numerals.
-   Hour marks on timepieces. In this context, 4 is often written .
-   The year of construction on building faces and cornerstones.
-   Page numbering of prefaces and introductions of books, and sometimes of appendices and annexes, too.
-   Book volume and chapter numbers, as well as the several acts within a play (e.g. Act , Scene 2).
-   Sequels to some films, video games, and other works (as in _Rocky {{rn_).
-   Outlines that use numbers to show hierarchical relationships.
-   Occurrences of a recurring grand event, for instance:
    -   The Summer and Winter Olympic Games (e.g. the [[2010_Winter_Olympics|

The block also includes some _apostrophus_ symbols for large numbers, an old variant of "L" (50) similar to the Etruscan character, the Claudian letter "reversed C", etc.

  Symbol   ↀ       ↁ       ↂ        ↅ   ↆ    ↇ        ↈ
  -------- ------- ------- -------- --- ---- -------- ---------
  Value    1,000   5,000   10,000   6   50   50,000   100,000
