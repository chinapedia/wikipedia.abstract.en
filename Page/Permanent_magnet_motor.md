A PERMANENT MAGNET MOTOR is a type of brushless electric motor that uses permanent magnets rather than winding in the field.

This type of motor is used in the Tesla Model 3[1], the Chevy Bolt[2], and the Chevy Volt.

Permanent magnet motors are more efficient than traditional induction motors or motors with field windings for certain high-efficiency applications such as electric vehicles. Tesla's Chief Motor Designer was quoted discussing these advantages, saying: “It’s well known that permanent magnet machines have the benefit of pre-excitation from the magnets, and therefore you have some efficiency benefit for that. Induction machines have perfect flux regulation and therefore you can optimize your efficiency. Both make sense for variable-speed drive single-gear transmission as the drive units of the cars. So, as you know, our Model 3 has a permanent magnet machine now. This is because for the specification of the performance and efficiency, the permanent magnet machine better solved our cost minimization function, and it was optimal for the range and performance target. Quantitatively, the difference is what drives the future of the machine, and it’s a trade-off between motor cost, range and battery cost that is determining which technology will be used in the future.”[3]
