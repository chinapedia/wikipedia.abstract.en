SAMUEL Z. CARDON (November 24, 1918 – December 28, 1996) was a chemist and scientist entrepreneur who worked primarily for U.S. government agencies in need of technical forecasting.


Biography

Samuel Cardon lived in Bratenahl, Ohio and was married to chemist Neva Lucille Campbell Cardon. They adopted two daughters, Lisa Cardon Tietze and Julie Cardon Bayko. Cardon worked at the Rand Development Corporation. In 1964, he started General Technical Services in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania with Arthur Iberall. Cardon died in 1996.


Work

Cardon published numerous reports with Arthur Iberall for U.S. government agencies in need of chemical and physical modelling including analysis of waters of the US for the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,[1][2] water pollution for the Public Health Service,[3] space suit related clothing designs for the United States Army.[4][5] They also did technical forecasting, cybernetics, application of systems science, social physics, autonomous systems designs, computer modeling for strategic needs. For NASA, they worked on the general dynamics of human and other mammalian systems,[6] and thermodynamic issues in long space voyages.[7] For the United States Department of Commerce, they worked on internal human responses. For the United States Department of Transportation, they did systems models for transportation planning, urban systems functions, and modelling trade.[8][9][10] Together, they solved technical problems for businesses such as Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Co., Westinghouse, Sherwin-Williams, Illinois Tool Works, Ohio Brass Co., and Industrial Fasteners Institute.
