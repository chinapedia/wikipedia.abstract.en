__NOTOC__ KOHINOOR is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on Kangaroo Island about south-west of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-east of the municipal seat of Kingscote.[1][2]

Its boundaries were created in March 2002 for the “long established name” which was derived from Kohinoor Hill, a hill located within the locality’s boundaries.[3]

Kohinoor is bounded in part by the Playford Highway to the north.[4] The principal land use in the locality is primary production.[5][6]

Kohinoor is located within the federal division of Mayo, the state electoral district of Mawson and the local government area of the Kangaroo Island Council.[7][8][9]
