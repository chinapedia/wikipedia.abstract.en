LEMONAID is a for-profit recruiting organization that connects high school student-athletes with colleges. LemonAid mobile applications suggest possible recruiting matches based on social, academic and athletic metrics that student athletes share with a college. Complementing the search, club and high school coaches can offer vetted recommendations to both college and athlete alike, while college sports fans can also rank, recommend, and read up on college recruiting.


History

LemonAid was co-founded in May 2015[1] by former USA National Team, NCAA Champion and All-American swimmer Nate Boyle after he helped coach co-founder Eric Knight to an American Record in the 200 Medley Relay. As a college coach, Boyle missed out on recruiting Knight to Davidson College because Knight would walk-on at George Mason University after going unrecruited out of high school. LemonAid officially launched its mobile applications in August 2015 to assist overlooked athletes, colleges, and sports with athletic recruiting. The company is headquartered in Ashburn, VA.


Recognition and partnerships

While LemonAid initially launched to the swimming community,[2] in May 2016 LemonAid became the preferred mobile recruiting application of the NAIA,[3] and began expansion into rowing.[4] Shortly thereafter, LemonAid was certified NCAA compliant and became available in nearly every collegiate sport.[5]
