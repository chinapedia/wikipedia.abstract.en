A MOUSSE (French 'foam' ) is a soft prepared food that incorporates air bubbles to give it a light and airy texture. It can range from light and fluffy to creamy and thick, depending on preparation techniques. A mousse may be sweet or savory.[1]

Sweet mousses are typically made with whipped egg whites, whipped cream,[2] or both, and flavored with one or more of chocolate, coffee, caramel,[3] puréed fruits, or various herbs and spices, such as mint or vanilla.[4] In the case of some chocolate mousses, egg yolks are often stirred into melted chocolate to give the final product a richer mouthfeel. Mousses are also typically chilled before being served, which gives them a denser texture. Sweetened mousse is served as a dessert, or used as an airy cake filling. It is sometimes stabilized with gelatin.[5][6]

Savory mousses can be made from meat, fish, shellfish, Foie gras, cheese, or vegetables. Hot mousses often get their light texture from the addition of beaten egg whites.[7]


History

Various desserts consisting of whipped cream in pyramidal shapes with coffee, liqueurs, chocolate, fruits, and so on either in the mixture or poured on top were called _crème en mousse_ 'cream in a foam', _crème mousseuse_ 'foamy cream', _mousse_ 'foam', and so on,[8][9] as early as 1768.[10][11][12] Modern mousses are a continuation of this tradition.
