'''Roman roads ''' (Latin: _viae Romanae_ IPA: ; singular: _via Romana_ IPA: ; meaning "Roman way") were physical infrastructure vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, and were built from about 300 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.[1] They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, civilians, inland carriage of official communications, and trade goods.[2] Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills, or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations.[3][4]

At the peak of Rome's development, no fewer than 29 great military highways radiated from the capital, and the late Empire's 113 provinces were interconnected by 372 great roads.[5][6] The whole comprised more than of roads, of which over were stone-paved.[7][8] In Gaul alone, no less than of roadways are said to have been improved, and in Britain at least .[9] The courses (and sometimes the surfaces) of many Roman roads survived for millennia; some are overlaid by modern roads.


Roman systems

Livy mentions some of the most familiar roads near Rome, and the milestones on them, at times long before the first paved road—the Appian Way.[10] Unless these allusions are just simple anachronisms, the roads referred to were probably at the time little more than levelled earthen tracks.[11] Thus, the Via Gabina (during the time of Porsena) is mentioned in about 500 BC; the Via Latina (during the time of Coriolanus) in about 490 BC; the Via Nomentana (also known as "Via Ficulensis"), in 449 BC; the Via Labicana in 421 BC; and the Via Salaria in 361 BC.[12]

In the Itinerary of Antoninus, the description of the road system, after the death of Julius Caesar and during the tenure of Augustus, is as follows:

  "With the exception of some outlying portions, such as Britain north of the Wall, Dacia, and certain provinces east of the Euphrates, the whole Empire was penetrated by these _itinera_ (plural of _iter_). There is hardly a district to which we might expect a Roman official to be sent, on service either civil or military, where we do not find roads. They reach the Wall in Britain; run along the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and cover, as with a network, the interior provinces of the Empire."[13]

A road map of the empire reveals that it was generally laced with a dense network of prepared _viae_.[14] Beyond its borders there were no paved roads; however, it can be supposed that footpaths and dirt roads allowed some transport.[15] There were, for instance, some pre-Roman ancient trackways in Britain, such as the Ridgeway and the Icknield Way.[16]

    _For specific roads, see_ Roman road locations _below_.


Laws and traditions

The Laws of the Twelve Tables, dated to about 450 BC, required that any public road (Latin _via_) be 8 Roman feet (perhaps about 2.37 m) wide where straight and twice that width where curved. These were probably the minimum widths for a _via_; in the later Republic, widths of around 12 Roman feet were common for public roads in rural regions, permitting the passing of two carts of standard (4 foot) width without interference to pedestrian traffic.[17] Actual practices varied from this standard. The Tables command Romans to build public roads and give wayfarers the right to pass over private land where the road is in disrepair. Building roads that would not need frequent repair therefore became an ideological objective, as well as building them as straight as practicable to construct the shortest possible roads, and thus save on material.

Roman law defined the right to use a road as a _servitus_, or liability. The _ius eundi_ ("right of going") established a claim to use an _iter_, or footpath, across private land; the _ius agendi_ ("right of driving"), an _actus_, or carriage track. A _via_ combined both types of _servitutes_, provided it was of the proper width, which was determined by an _arbiter_. The default width was the _latitudo legitima_ of 8 feet.

Roman law and tradition forbade the use of vehicles in urban areas, except in certain cases. Married women and government officials on business could ride. The _Lex Iulia Municipalis_ restricted commercial carts to night-time access in the city within the walls and within a mile outside the walls.


Types

Carved_steps_along_Ancient_Roman_Road.jpg to Beit Gubrin, adjacent to regional hwy 375 in Israel]] Roman roads varied from simple corduroy roads to paved roads using deep roadbeds of tamped rubble as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from between the stones and fragments of rubble, instead of becoming mud in clay soils. According to Ulpian, there were three types of roads:[18]

1.  _Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae_ or _militares_
2.  _Viae privatae, rusticae, glareae_ or _agrariae_
3.  _Viae vicinales_

_Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae_ and _militares_

Aeclanum_(Ancient_Roman_Street).jpg.]] The first type of road included public high or main roads, constructed and maintained at the public expense, and with their soil vested in the state. Such roads led either to the sea, or to a town, or to a public river (one with a constant flow), or to another public road. Siculus Flaccus, who lived under Trajan (98-117), calls them _viae publicae regalesque_,[19] and describes their characteristics as follows:

1.  They are placed under _curatores_ (commissioners), and repaired by _redemptores_ (contractors) at the public expense; a fixed contribution, however, being levied from the neighboring landowners.[20]
2.  These roads bear the names of their constructors (e.g. Via Appia, Cassia, Flaminia).[21]

Roman roads were named after the censor who had ordered their construction or reconstruction. The same person often served afterwards as consul, but the road name is dated to his term as censor. If the road was older than the office of censor or was of unknown origin, it took the name of its destination or of the region through which it mainly passed. A road was renamed if the censor ordered major work on it, such as paving, repaving, or rerouting. With the term _viae regales_ compare the roads of the Persian kings (who probably organized the first system of public roads) and the King's highway.[22] With the term _viae militariae_ compare the Icknield Way (e.g., Icen-hilde-weg, or "War-way of the Iceni").[23]

However, there were many other people, besides special officials, who from time to time, and for a variety of reasons, sought to connect their names with a great public service like that of the roads.[24] Gaius Gracchus, when Tribune of the People (123-122 BC), paved or gravelled many of the public roads, and provided them with milestones and mounting-blocks for riders. Again, Gaius Scribonius Curio, when Tribune (50 BC), sought popularity by introducing a Lex Viaria, under which he was to be chief inspector or commissioner for five years. Dio Cassius mentions as one of the forcible acts of the triumvirs of 43 BC (Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus), that they obliged the senators to repair the public roads at their own expense.

_Viae privatae, rusticae, glareae_ and _agrariae_

The second category included private or country roads, originally constructed by private individuals, in whom their soil was vested, and who had the power to dedicate them to the public use.[25] Such roads benefited from a right of way, in favor either of the public or of the owner of a particular estate. Under the heading of _viae privatae_ were also included roads leading from the public or high roads to particular estates or settlements. These Ulpian considers to be public roads in themselves.[26]

Features off the _via_ were connected to the _via_ by _viae rusticae_, or secondary roads.[27] Both main or secondary roads might either be paved, or left unpaved, with a gravel surface, as they were in North Africa. These prepared but unpaved roads were _viae glareae_ or _sternendae_ ("to be strewn"). Beyond the secondary roads were the _viae terrenae_, "dirt roads".

_Viae vicinales_

The third category comprised roads at or in villages, districts, or crossroads, leading through or towards a _vicus_ or village.[28] Such roads ran either into a high road, or into other _viae vicinales_, without any direct communication with a high road. They were considered public or private, according to the fact of their original construction out of public or private funds or materials. Such a road, though privately constructed, became a public road when the memory of its private constructors had perished.[29]

Siculus Flaccus describes _viae vicinales_ as roads "_de publicis quae divertunt in agros et saepe ad alteras publicas perveniunt_" (which turn off the public roads into fields, and often reach to other public roads). The repairing authorities, in this case, were the _magistri pagorum_ or magistrates of the cantons. They could require the neighboring landowners either to furnish laborers for the general repair of the _viae vicinales_, or to keep in repair, at their own expense, a certain length of road passing through their respective properties.[30]

Governance and financing

With the conquest of Italy, prepared _viae_ were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building _viae_ was a military responsibility and thus came under the jurisdiction of a consul. The process had a military name, _viam munire_, as though the _via_ were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called _viae vicinales_. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt us to believe that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.

Financing road building was a Roman government responsibility. Maintenance, however, was generally left to the province. The officials tasked with fund-raising were the _curatores viarum_. They had a number of methods available to them. Private citizens with an interest in the road could be asked to contribute to its repair. High officials might distribute largesse to be used for roads. Censors, who were in charge of public morals and public works, were expected to fund repairs _suâ pecuniâ_ (with their own money). Beyond those means, taxes were required.

A _via_ connected two cities. _Viae_ were generally centrally placed in the countryside. The construction and care of the public roads, whether in Rome, in Italy, or in the provinces, was, at all periods of Roman history, considered to be a function of the greatest weight and importance. This is clearly shown by the fact that the censors, in some respects the most venerable of Roman magistrates, had the earliest paramount authority to construct and repair all roads and streets. Indeed, all the various functionaries, not excluding the emperors themselves, who succeeded the censors in this portion of their duties, may be said to have exercised a devolved censorial jurisdiction.[31]

Costs and civic responsibilities

The devolution to the censorial jurisdictions soon became a practical necessity, resulting from the growth of the Roman dominions and the diverse labors which detained the censors in the capital city. Certain _ad hoc_ official bodies successively acted as constructing and repairing authorities. In Italy, the censorial responsibility passed to the commanders of the Roman armies, and later to special commissioners – and in some cases perhaps to the local magistrates. In the provinces, the consul or praetor and his legates received authority to deal directly with the contractor.[32]

The care of the streets and roads within the Roman territory was committed in the earliest times to the censors. They eventually made contracts for paving the street inside Rome, including the Clivus Capitolinus, with lava, and for laying down the roads outside the city with gravel. Sidewalks were also provided. The aediles, probably by virtue of their responsibility for the freedom of traffic and policing the streets, co-operated with the censors and the bodies that succeeded them.[33]

It would seem that in the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54) the quaestors had become responsible for the paving of the streets of Rome, or at least shared that responsibility with the quattuorviri viarum.[34] It has been suggested that the quaestors were obliged to buy their right to an official career by personal outlay on the streets. There was certainly no lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change in the nature of the expenditure imposed on the quaestors.

Official bodies

The official bodies which first succeeded the censors in the care of the streets and roads were two in number. They were:[35]

1.  _Quattuorviri viis in urbe purgandis_, with jurisdiction inside the walls of Rome;
2.  _Duoviri viis extra urbem purgandis_, with jurisdiction outside the walls.

Both these bodies were probably of ancient origin, but the true year of their institution is unknown.[36] Little reliance can be placed on Pomponius, who states that the _quattuorviri_ were instituted _eodem tempore_ (at the same time) as the _praetor peregrinus_ (i.e. about 242 BC) and the _Decemviri litibus iudicandis_[37] (time unknown).[38] The first mention of either body occurs in the _Lex Julia Municipalis_ of 45 BC. The quattuorviri were afterwards called _Quattuorviri viarum curandarum_. The extent of jurisdiction of the Duoviri is derived from their full title as _Duoviri viis extra propiusve urbem Romam passus mille purgandis_.[39][40] Their authority extended over all roads between their respective gates of issue in the city wall and the first milestone beyond.[41]

In case of an emergency in the condition of a particular road, men of influence and liberality were appointed, or voluntarily acted, as _curatores_ or temporary commissioners to superintend the work of repair.[42] The dignity attached to such a curatorship is attested by a passage of Cicero. Among those who performed this duty in connection with particular roads was Julius Caesar, who became _curator_ (67 BC) of the Via Appia, and spent his own money liberally upon it. Certain persons appear also to have acted alone and taken responsibility for certain roads.

In the country districts, as has been stated, the magistri pagorum had authority to maintain the _viae vicinales_.[43] In Rome itself each householder was legally responsible for the repairs to that portion of the street which passed his own house.[44] It was the duty of the aediles to enforce this responsibility. The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the public treasury and the private owner shared the expense equally. No doubt, if only to secure uniformity, the personal liability of householders to execute repairs of the streets was commuted for a paving rate payable to the public authorities who were responsible from time to time.

Augustus's changes

The governing structure was changed by Augustus. In the course of his reconstitution of the urban administration he created new offices in connection with the public works, streets, and aqueducts of Rome. He found the _quattuorviri_ and _duoviri_ forming part of the body of magistrates known as vigintisexviri.[45] These he reduced from 26 to 20 members (vigintiviri), but retained the _quattuorviri_ among them. The latter were certainly still in existence under Hadrian (117–138).[46] Augustus abolished the _duoviri_, no doubt because the time had come to deal comprehensively with the superintendence of the roads which connected Rome with Italy and the provinces. Dio Cassius relates that Augustus personally accepted the post of superintendent.[47] In this capacity he represented the paramount authority which belonged originally to the censors. Moreover, he appointed men of praetorian rank to be road-makers, assigning to each of them two lictors. He also made the office of curator of each of the great public roads a perpetual magistracy, instead of a special and temporary commission, as had been the case hitherto.

In Augustus' capacity as supreme head of the public road system, he converted the temporary _cura_ of each of the great roads into a permanent magistracy. The persons appointed under the new system were of senatorial or equestrian rank, according to the relative importance of the roads respectively assigned to them. It was the duty of each curator to issue contracts for the maintenance and repairs of his road, and to see that the contractor who undertook the work performed it faithfully, as to both quantity and quality. Moreover, he authorized the construction of sewers and removed obstructions to traffic, as the aediles did in Rome.[48] It was in the character of an imperial curator, though probably of one armed with extraordinary powers, that Corbulo (as has been already mentioned) denounced the _magistratus_ and _mancipes_ of the Italian roads to Tiberius.[49] He pursued them and their families with fines and imprisonment for 18 years (AD 21–39), and was rewarded with a consulship by Caligula, who was himself in the habit of condemning well-born citizens to work on the roads. It is noticeable that Claudius brought Corbulo to justice, and repaid the money which had been extorted from his victims.

Other _curatores_

Special _curatores_ for a term seem to have been appointed on occasion, even after the institution of the permanent magistrates bearing that title.[50] The Emperors who succeeded Augustus exercised a vigilant control over the condition of the public highways. Their names occur frequently in the inscriptions to restorers of roads and bridges. Thus, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Trajan, and Septimius Severus were commemorated in this capacity at Emérita.[51] The Itinerary of Antoninus, which was probably a work of much earlier date, republished in an improved and enlarged form, under one of the Antonine emperors, remains as standing evidence of the minute care which was bestowed on the service of the public roads.


Construction and engineering

Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advances that would be lost in the Middle Ages. These accomplishments would not be rivaled until the Modern Age. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier designs. Some of the common, earlier designs incorporated arches.

Practices and terminology

Roman road builders aimed at a regulation width (see Laws and traditions above), but actual widths have been measured at between and more than . Today, the concrete has worn from the spaces around the stones, giving the impression of a very bumpy road, but the original practice was to produce a surface that was no doubt much closer to being flat. Many roads were built to resist rain, freezing and flooding. They were constructed to need as little repair as possible.

Roman construction took a directional straightness. Many long sections are ruler-straight, but it should not be thought that all of them were. Some links in the network were as long as . Gradients of 10%–12% are known in ordinary terrain, 15%–20% in mountainous country. The Roman emphasis on constructing straight roads often resulted in steep slopes relatively impractical for most commercial traffic; over the years the Romans themselves realized this and built longer, but more manageable, alternatives to existing roads. Roman roads generally went straight up and down hills, rather than in a serpentine pattern.

As to the standard Imperial terminology that was used, the words were localized for different elements used in construction and varied from region to region. Also, in the course of time, the terms _via munita_ and _vía publica_ became identical.[52]

Materials and methods

_Viae_ were distinguished not only according to their public or private character, but according to the materials employed and the methods followed in their construction. Ulpian divided them up in the following fashion:[53]

1.  _Via terrena_: A plain road of leveled earth.
2.  _Via glareata_:[54] An earthed road with a graveled surface.
3.  _Via munita_:[55] A regular built road, paved with rectangular blocks of the stone of the country, or with polygonal blocks of lava.

The Romans, though certainly inheriting some of the art of road construction from the Etruscans, borrowed the knowledge of construction of _viae munitae_ from the Carthaginians according to Isidore of Sevilla.[56]

_Via terrena_

The _Viae terrenae_ were plain roads of leveled earth. These were mere tracks worn down by the feet of humans and animals, and possibly by wheeled carriages.[57]

_Via glareata_

The _Viae glareatae_ were earthed roads with a graveled surface or a gravel subsurface and paving on top. Livy speaks of the censors of his time as being the first to contract for paving the streets of Rome with flint stones, for laying gravel on the roads outside the city, and for forming raised footpaths at the sides.[58] In these roads, the surface was hardened with gravel, and although pavements were introduced shortly afterwards, the blocks were allowed to rest merely on a bed of small stones.[59][60] An example of this type is found on the Praenestine Way. Another example is found near the Via Latina.[61]

_Via munita_

The best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation _via munita_ are:[62]

1.  The many existing remains of _viae publicae_. These are often sufficiently well preserved to show that the rules of construction were, as far as local material allowed, minutely adhered to in practice.
2.  The directions for making pavements given by Vitruvius. The _pavement_ and the _via munita_ were identical in construction, except as regards the top layer, or surface. This consisted, in the former case, of marble or mosaic, and, in the latter, of blocks of stone or lava.
3.  A passage in Statius describing the repairs of the Via Domitiana, a branch road of the Via Appia, leading to Neapolis.

After the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a _groma_, which helped them obtain right angles. The _gromatici_, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the _rigor_. As they did not possess anything like a transit, a civil engineering surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the _gromatici_ to move them as required. Using the _gromae_ they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.

The _libratores_ then began their work using ploughs and, sometimes with the help of legionaries, with spades excavated the road bed down to bed rock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the _fossa_, the Latin word for ditch. The depth varied according to terrain.

The general appearance of such a metalled road and footway is shown in an existing street of Pompeii.

The method varied according to geographic locality, materials available and terrain, but the plan, or ideal at which the engineer aimed was always the same. The roadbed was layered. The road was constructed by filling the ditch. This was done by layering rock over other stones.

Into the ditch was dumped large amounts of rubble, gravel and stone, whatever fill was available. Sometimes a layer of sand was put down, if it could be found. When it came to within 1 yd (1 m) or so of the surface it was covered with gravel and tamped down, a process called _pavire_, or _pavimentare_. The flat surface was then the _pavimentum_. It could be used as the road, or additional layers could be constructed. A _statumen_ or "foundation" of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers.

The final steps utilized lime-based concrete, which the Romans had discovered.[63] They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the ditch. First a small layer of coarse concrete, the _rudus_, then a little layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or _statumen_. Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the _summa crusta_. The _crusta_ was crowned for drainage.

An example is found in an early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus. It had travertine paving, polygonal basalt blocks, concrete bedding (substituted for the gravel), and a rain-water gutter.[64]

Obstacle crossings

Romans preferred to engineer solutions to obstacles rather than circumvent them. Outcroppings of stone, ravines, or hilly or mountainous terrain called for cuttings and tunnels. An example of this is found on the Roman road from Cazanes near the Iron Gates. This road was half carved into the rock, about 5ft to 5ft 9in (1.5 to 1.75m), the rest of the road, above the Danube, was made from wooden structure, projecting out of the cliff. The road functioned as a towpath, making the Danube navigable. Tabula Traiana memorial plaque in Serbia is all that remains of the now-submerged road.

Bridges and causeways

Roman bridges, built by ancient Romans, were the first large and lasting bridges built. River crossings were achieved by bridges, or _pontes_. Single slabs went over rills. A bridge could be of wood, stone, or both. Wooden bridges were constructed on pilings sunk into the river, or on stone piers. Larger or more permanent bridges required arches. These larger bridges were built with stone and had the arch as its basic structure (see arch bridge). Most also used concrete, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges. Roman bridges were so well constructed that a number remain in use today.

Causeways were built over marshy ground. The road was first marked out with pilings. Between them were sunk large quantities of stone so as to raise the causeway to more than above the marsh. In the provinces, the Romans often did not bother with a stone causeway, but used log roads (_pontes longi_).


Military and citizen utilization

The public road system of the Romans was thoroughly military in its aims and spirit.[65] It was designed to unite and consolidate the conquests of the Roman people, whether within or without the limits of Italy proper. A legion on the march brought its own baggage train (_impedimenta_) and constructed its own camp (_castra_) every evening at the side of the road.

Milestones and markers

Milestones divided the via Appia even before 250 BC into numbered miles, and most _viae_ after 124 BC. The modern word "mile" derives from the Latin _milia passuum_, "one thousand paces", which amounted to . A milestone, or _miliarium_, was a circular column on a solid rectangular base, set for more than into the ground, standing tall, in diameter, and weighing more than 2 tons. At the base was inscribed the number of the mile relative to the road it was on. In a panel at eye-height was the distance to the Roman Forum and various other information about the officials who made or repaired the road and when. These miliaria are valuable historical documents now. Their inscriptions are collected in the volume XVII of the _Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum_.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Examples of Roman Milestones

The Romans had a preference for standardization wherever possible, so Augustus, after becoming permanent commissioner of roads in 20 BC, set up the _miliarium aureum_ ("golden milestone") near the Temple of Saturn. All roads were considered to begin from this gilded bronze monument. On it were listed all the major cities in the empire and distances to them. Constantine called it the _umbilicus Romae_ ("navel of Rome"), and built a similar—although more complex—monument in Constantinople, the Milion.

Milestones permitted distances and locations to be known and recorded exactly. It was not long before historians began to refer to the milestone at which an event occurred.

Itinerary maps and charts

Part_of_Tabula_Peutingeriana.jpg'' (Southern Italy centered).]] Combined topographical and road-maps may have existed as specialty items in some Roman libraries, but they were expensive, hard to copy and not in general use. Travelers wishing to plan a journey could consult an _itinerarium_, which in its most basic form was a simple list of cities and towns along a given road, and the distances between them.[66] It was only a short step from lists to a master list, or a schematic route-planner in which roads and their branches were represented more or less in parallel, as in the _Tabula Peutingeriana_. From this master list, parts could be copied and sold on the streets. The most thorough used different symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The Roman government from time to time would produce a master road-itinerary. The first known were commissioned in 44 BC by Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Three Greek geographers, Zenodoxus, Theodotus and Polyclitus, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary; the task required over 25 years and the resulting stone-engraved master itinerary was set up near the Pantheon. Travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies from it.

Vehicles and transportation

Römischer_Reisewagen.JPG (reconstruction)]] Outside the cities, Romans were avid riders and rode on or drove quite a number of vehicle types, some of which are mentioned here. Carts driven by oxen were used. Horse-drawn carts could travel up to per day,[67] pedestrians . For purposes of description, Roman vehicles can be divided into the car, the coach, and the cart. Cars were used to transport one or two individuals, coaches were used to transport parties, and carts to transport cargo.

Of the cars, the most popular was the _carrus_, a standard chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A _carrus_ with two horses was a _biga_; three horses, a _triga_; and four horses a _quadriga_. The tyres were of iron. When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage.

A more luxurious version, the _carpentum_, transported women and officials. It had an arched overhead covering of cloth and was drawn by mules. A lighter version, the _cisium_, equivalent to a gig, was open above and in front and had a seat. Drawn by one or two mules or horses, it was used for cab work, the cab drivers being called _cisiani_. The builder was a _cisarius_.

Of the coaches, the mainstay was the _raeda_ or _reda_, which had four wheels. The high sides formed a sort of box in which seats were placed, with a notch on each side for entry. It carried several people with baggage up to the legal limit of 1000 Roman _librae_ (pounds), modern equivalent . It was drawn by teams of oxen, horses or mules. A cloth top could be put on for weather, in which case it resembled a covered wagon.

The _raeda_ was probably the main vehicle for travel on the roads. _Raedae meritoriae_ were hired coaches. The _fiscalis raeda_ was a government coach. The driver and the builder were both referred to as a _raedarius_.

Of the carts, the main one was the _plaustrum_ or _plostrum_. This was simply a platform of boards attached to wheels and a cross-tree. The wheels, or _tympana_, were solid and were several centimetres (inches) thick. The sides could be built up with boards or rails. A large wicker basket was sometimes placed on it. A two-wheel version existed along with the normal four-wheel type called the _plaustrum maius_.

The military used a standard wagon. Their transportation service was the _cursus clabularis_, after the standard wagon, called a _carrus clabularius_, _clabularis_, _clavularis_, or _clabulare_. It transported the _impedimenta_ (baggage) of a military column.

Way stations and traveler inns

Non-military officials and people on official business had no legion at their service and the government maintained way stations, or _mansiones_ ("staying places"), for their use. Passports were required for identification. _Mansiones_ were located about apart. There the official traveller found a complete _villa_ dedicated to his use. Often a permanent military camp or a town grew up around the _mansio_. For non-official travelers in need of refreshment, a private system of "inns" or _cauponae_ were placed near the _mansiones_. They performed the same functions but were somewhat disreputable, as they were frequented by thieves and prostitutes. Graffiti decorate the walls of the few whose ruins have been found.

Genteel travelers needed something better than _cauponae_. In the early days of the _viae_, when little unofficial provision existed, houses placed near the road were required by law to offer hospitality on demand. Frequented houses no doubt became the first _tabernae_, which were hostels, rather than the "taverns" we know today. As Rome grew, so did its _tabernae_, becoming more luxurious and acquiring good or bad reputations as the case may be. One of the best hotels was the _Tabernae Caediciae_ at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a _taberna_ complex, such as Rheinzabern in the Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace.

A third system of way stations serviced vehicles and animals: the _mutationes_ ("changing stations"). They were located every . In these complexes, the driver could purchase the services of wheelwrights, cartwrights, and _equarii medici_, or veterinarians. Using these stations in chariot relays, the emperor Tiberius hastened in 24 hours to join his brother, Drusus Germanicus,[68][69] who was dying of gangrene as a result of a fall from a horse.

Post offices and services

Two postal services were available under the empire, one public and one private. The Cursus publicus, founded by Augustus, carried the mail of officials by relay throughout the Roman road system. The vehicle for carrying mail was a _cisium_ with a box, but for special delivery, a horse and rider was faster. On average, a relay of horses could carry a letter [70] in a day. The postman wore a characteristic leather hat, the _petanus_. The postal service was a somewhat dangerous occupation, as postmen were a target for bandits and enemies of Rome. Private mail of the well-to-do was carried by _tabellarii_, an organization of slaves available for a price.
