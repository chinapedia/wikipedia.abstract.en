The 2016 DUBAI WOMEN'S SEVENS was the opening tournament of the 2016–17 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.[1] It was held on 1–2 December 2016 at The Sevens Stadium in Dubai, and was the 5th edition of the Women's Dubai Sevens as part of the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.[2][3][4] The defending champions Australia started their first game against the invited South Africans. The opening game of the Dubai tournament matched Spain up against England.[5]

Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby Chairman, said: "With the excitement of the Olympic Games still fresh in people's memories, anticipation has never been higher ahead of a new HSBC World Rugby Women's Sevens Series season kicking off".
