THE PRESIDENT'S EDUCATION AWARDS PROGRAM (PEAP) is awarded on behalf of the President of the United States and the United States Secretary of Education. PEAP was founded in 1983. The purpose of the program is to recognize American students in elementary, middle and high school for their educational achievements.

The program awards both the President's Award for Educational Excellence and the President's Award for Educational Achievement. Both awards can be given at the sole discretion of the participating school's principal.[1]


President's Award for Educational Excellence

To receive the PRESIDENT'S AWARD FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE, students must be enrolled in elementary, middle, or high school, they must meet a minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.5. They must reach certain levels on state tests, or receive a recommendation from a teacher, as well as a strong production of academic excellence.[2]


President's Award for Educational Achievement

To receive the PRESIDENT'S AWARD FOR EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT, students (from elementary, middle or high school) must demonstrate "educational growth, improvement, commitment or intellectual development."[3] Listed below are the suggested examples as of October 2016.

-   Demonstrate unusual commitment to learning in academics despite various obstacles.
-   Maintain a school record that would have met the school's selection criteria for the President's Award for Educational Excellence but illness, personal crisis, or special needs prevented the student from maintaining such high standards despite hard work.
    -   Achieve a minimum of A 3.0 GPA
-   Achieve high scores or show outstanding growth, improvement, commitment or intellectual development in particular subjects, such as English, math, science, etc.
-   Demonstrate achievement in the arts such as music or theater.
