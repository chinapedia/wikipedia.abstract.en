Plot

_While You Were Sleeping_ is a combination of the legal drama and fantasy genres, focusing on the tale of three young adults who have acquired the ability to see the future through their dreams: field reporter Nam Hong-joo (Bae Suzy), rookie prosecutor Jung Jae-chan (Lee Jong-suk), and police officer Han Woo-tak (Jung Hae-in). Some of these dreams show crimes that Jae-chan has to investigate and disastrous events that either the three of them have to suffer. Troubled by these dreams, the trio collaborate with each other to prevent these ominous dreams from turning into reality and to take down one of their archenemies, the corrupt lawyer Lee Yoo-beom (Lee Sang-yeob).

_While You Were Sleeping_ (Episode 1–2)

The series opens with Hong-joo waking up from a dream where she hugs and expresses her gratitude to a wounded stranger in a crossroad under a snowy night. Just in time, the stranger in her dream, Jae-chan, arrives in their neighborhood with his younger brother Jung Seung-won (Shin Jae-ha) and moves in a house across theirs.

While working with her mother Yoon Moon-sun (Hwang Young-hee) in their _samgyeopsal_ restaurant, Hong-joo meets a chain smoker whom she dreamed of and was bound to die in a gasoline station. Hong-joo becomes unnerved when the smoker died as what she had dreamed of, plus another dream where her mother was destined to die also due to an accident Hong-joo is about to get into; this pushed her to cut off her hair since she had a long hair in the dream.

On his first day at the Division 3 Prosecutors' Office, Jae-chan meets Lawyer Lee Yoo-beom whom he quietly loathes because of a bitter incident back in his adolescence. One night, Jae-chan dreams that Yoo-beom takes Hong-joo in a date. In the dream, Hong-joo excuses herself to go home thinking that she had left the door at their house ajar. Yoo-beom drives Hong-joo's car and this leads into an accident that killed a policeman. The disaster leads to Yoo-beom falsifying evidences, Hong-joo wrongly accused of the accident, and her mother dying just to retrieve her. Jae-chan, who was the prosecuter in charge of the case in the dream, was unable to stop her from committing suicide.

When Jae-chan senses that his dream is about to become real on a snowy night on Valentine's Day, he follows Yoo-beom and Hong-joo in another road and, using his own vehicle, intercepts Hong-joo's car just before Yoo-beom could accidentally hit Han Woo-tak, the policeman shown in the dream. Yoo-beom rebukes Jae-chan, thinking it was a form of revenge, but Hong-joo hugs and expresses her gratitude to him just as what she had dreamed of.

_The Good, The Bad, and The Weird_ (Episode 3–4)

Although incredulous, Jae-chan learns that he shares the same future-seeing ability as Hong-joo though they do not know why they have to see each other in their dreams. The skeptical Jae-chan thinks that Hong-joo is crazy and he kept on denying the existence of such dreams.

Meanwhile, high school piano virtuosa Park So-yoon (Kim So-hyun), who was Seung-won's love interest, had her piano recital. While being interviewed by the media, her mother Do Geum-sook (Jang So-yeon) faints, causing confusion in the venue. The police and the media saw what seemed like footprints on Geum-sook's undergarments while So-yoon's father Park Jun-mo (Um Hyo-sup) tried to cover it and insisted that he did not do it. So-yoon realized that her father, who was actually abusive to them, had beaten up her mother again. As Jun-mo was being arrested by the police for investigation, So-yoon pleads Seung-won to pretend that he does not know about her father's cruelty.

Lawyer Yoo-beom takes Jun-mo's case at once and falsifies evidences and testimonies so that the case will become unprosecutable. Goaded by the discreet admonishments from his seniors in the prosecution office, Jae-chan becomes disappointed that he cannot fully investigate Jun-mo's case and satirically declares the case to be unprosecutable. Knowing that her father will win once again in the case, So-yoon plans to kill her father by poisoning him. Seung-won becomes aware of her plans, though he insists to her that she must report it to the police.

Shortly after, Jae-chan dreams for the second time. This time, he sees Seung-won being carried away by the police and Hong-joo resenting him for unbelieving the precognitive power of their dreams. Utterly worried, Jae-chan tells Hong-joo of his dream, and he gets surprised when Hong-joo tells him of her dream. In Hong-joo's dream, she saw a man abusing his wife just before Seung-won interferes, pushes the man off the balcony, and blames Jae-chan for him becoming a murderer. Just in time, Seung-won caught So-yoon in a store searching for poisonous chemicals, and he asks her to go home with him.

_Secretly, Greatly_ (Episode 5–6)

Knowing that the dream will happen soon, Jae-chan and Hong-joo analyzes their dreams and realizes that it is related to Park Jun-mo's domestic abuse case, which Jae-chan had declared unprosecutable. On the other hand, So-yoon receives a call from her mother. Sensing that something wrong is about to happen, Seung-won and So-yoon rush to the Park residence, located in a high rise apartment. Jae-chan and Hong-joo dash to the residence to stop them.

Meanwhile, police officer Han Woo-tak began having future-seeing dreams after Jae-chan had saved him from getting killed in the car accident on Valentine's Day. On his first dream while sleeping in their patrol car, he sees himself arresting a high school boy (Seung-won), who was pleading for innocence, and Jae-chan screaming to the police to set the boy free. Just in time, he sees Jae-chan and Hong-joo running on the streets. Sensing that the dream is about to happen, he follows them to the Park residence.

In the Park residence, Geum-sook pleads for divorce, asking Jun-mo to pay for So-yoon's education abroad. Jun-mo arrogantly rejects her offer, but just before he starts beating her up, Hong-joo puts up a false alarm, prompting all occupants to exit the building. Jae-chan catches Seung-won, who rebukes him for being lax about Jun-mo's case. To hide from Jun-mo, So-yoon and Geum-sook escapes to Hong-joo's residence, accompanied by Woo-tak who offered them a ride on his patrol car. Jae-chan, then, decides to reopen Jun-mo's case, despite getting scolded by his chief.

Soon after the ruckus at the Park residence, Woo-tak sees another vision in his sleep. He saw himself and his fellow policeman Oh Kyung-han (Lee Yoo-joon) going to Hong-joo's _samgyeopsal_ restaurant. In the dream, Lawyer Yoo-beom arrives in the restaurant to convince So-yoon and Geum-sook to take back their appeal to prosecute Jun-mo so that So-yoon can retain her reputation as a pianist. Intensely frustrated and willing to give up her career for their family to be peaceful again, So-yoon attempts to injure her hand with a chopstick but Hong-joo interferes and gets her hand impaled instead.

To prevent the tragedy from happening and also to express his gratitude for saving his life, Woo-tak invites Jae-chan instead to the restaurant. While having their meal, Jae-chan gets curious upon seeing Woo-tak counting down from five. Just in time, the door opens, and Yoo-beom arrives to meet So-yoon and Geum-sook.

_A Few Good Men_ (Episode 7–8)

Woo-tak is amazed that his dream is already happening exactly as it is, except that he was having a meal with Jae-chan, not Kyung-han. Jae-chan overhears the conversation between Yoo-beom, So-yoon, and Geum-sook, and just before the accident happens, Jae-chan intervenes with the argument and promises So-yoon and Geum-sook that he will prosecute Jun-mo in every way he can. Woo-tak learns from Jae-chan and Hong-joo about their future-seeing dreams although the trio are still curious why they were the ones chosen to have the dreams out of the many people around them.

Jae-chan starts the investigation and gathers as many evidences as possible. Later on, Woo-tak and Hong-joo both dream about Jun-mo's case and persuades Jae-chan to let his co-worker, Inspector Choi Dam-dong (Kim Won-hae), to do the interrogation first. Jae-chan lets Inspector Choi do the investigation despite his suspicions about him siding with Yoo-beom who already prepared fabricated evidences and claims as Jun-mo's attorney. Unexpectedly, Inspector Choi was able to deduce the truth out of Jun-mo and Jae-chan prosecutes him successfully to Yoo-beom's disappointment. Jae-chan senses that Inspector Choi is unbiased, meticulous, and accountable in his work and apologizes for his doubt about him.

_Don't Trust Her_ (Episode 9–10)

Meanwhile, Hong-joo has long been discomfited by one recurring dream, which shows herself wearing a blue jacket-like field reporter's uniform and lying apparently dead on a grassy terrain during a rainy night. It was the dream which impelled her to leave her job as a field reporter in SBC and to work alongside her mother in their restaurant.

However, Hong-joo intends to return to work after concluding that she can change the future portrayed in their dreams, but her mother is against her plans out of her fear that her dream might actually come true. To convince her mother, Hong-joo brings a fire extinguisher and saves coffee shop attendant Kang Cho-hee (Kim Da-ye) who was bound to be burned to her death in a fire. Jae-chan and Woo-tak, who dreamed about the same incident, works together to keep Hong-joo safe.

On the other hand, the Division 3 Prosecutors' Office (including Inspector Choi) investigates a car accident case involving Cho-hee's older brothers, one of which apparently died when the other, Kang Dae-hee (Kang Ki-young), drove the vehicle. The seemingly distressed Dae-hee refused an autopsy to be done to his brother's corpse and requested it to be cremated.

Later on, Hong-joo's reluctant mother personally asks Jae-chan to protect Hong-joo and invites him to have breakfast every day at their house. On Hong-joo's first day back at work, her co-worker Bong Du-hyun (Oh Eui-sik) presents to her the new field reporters' new uniform: the blue jacket-like attire she saw in her death dream.

_City of the Blind_ (Episode 11–12)

After his younger brother's cremation, Kang Dae-hee goes to Lawyer Lee Yoo-beom and, offering him a big sum of money, reveals to him that he had actually killed his brother so that he can claim his insurance. He had mixed his brother's herbal drink with potassium cyanide and crashed his car to make the scene look like a car accident.

Meanwhile, Jae-chan dreams of himself and Hong-joo watching the latter reporting on TV that a man named Kang Dae-hee was proven guilty of killing both of his younger brother and younger sister due to their insurances. Jae-chan learns at the prosecution office that Dae-hee is already accused of killing his younger brother for the insurance, and that Dae-hee's younger sister (Cho-hee) is still alive. At her work, Hong-joo began covering a serial poisoning case of about 100 cats around Seoul.

To prosecute Dae-hee, Jae-chan's fellow prosecutor Shin Hee-min (Ko Sung-hee) takes the case but her arguments get overruled by Yoo-beom's which claim that Hee-min's evidences are insignificant to charge Dae-hee, who was then acquitted. On the other hand, Jae-chan gets worried after dreaming once again, this time seeing Dae-hee attacking Hong-joo and his sister Cho-hee at a building rooftop. Hong-joo, who was still gathering data about the serial cat poisoning, goes with Woo-tak to a chicken restaurant where she once saw a man feeding cats, not knowing that it was actually Dae-hee.

With Dae-hee on the loose, Jae-chan recalls at work the two dreams he recently had. He also remembers that Hong-joo was covering a cat poisoning case and notes that he saw in the first dream a pouch with a straw, one of the evidences that proved Dae-hee's crime. When Jae-chan speculates the possibility of poisoning, Inspector Choi recalls that the wounds and blood stains on the victim's corpse were pinkish and near orange (instead of blueish red), a sign of potassium cyanide poisoning. To apprehend Dae-hee, Jae-chan and Inspector Choi request for backup and rush to the site of the incident in his second dream, just in time to see Woo-tak already wounded and Dae-hee about to attack Hong-joo and Cho-hee at the rooftop.

_A Secret That Can't Be Told_ (Episode 13–14)

As the ambulance arrives to rescue Woo-tak, Jae-chan and Inspector Choi arrest Dae-hee, saving Hong-joo and Cho-hee. Jae-chan gathers all evidences of the crime, which also points Dae-hee as the culprit of the serial cat poisoning. Jae-chan successfully indicts him of murder and had him imprisoned for life.

After the struggle with Dae-hee, Jae-chan and Hong-joo decide to recompense Woo-tak until his recovery for his efforts to keep Hong-joo safe. Previously, it was Jae-chan who requested Woo-tak to watch over Hong-joo after he saw the two dreams on Dae-hee. Steadily, Woo-tak is having an affection for Hong-joo, although he is keeping his feelings concealed sensing that Hong-joo and Jae-chan are developing feelings for each other. Hong-joo also sees another dream where Jae-chan crosses the street at night, carrying a engagement ring for her.

Soon after Woo-tak's recovery, Hong-joo and Woo-tak dream about Do Hak-young (Baek Sung-hyun), the latter's roommate and friend in high school who works as an internet installer. In Hong-joo's dream, Hak-young barges in Woo-tak's house at night and asks for his help in a case he gets involved in. In Woo-tak's, he saw himself being interrogated by Jae-chan because of Hak-young. A worried Hong-joo checks up on Woo-tak, shortly before Hak-young actually arrives in his house.

Hak-young reveals to Woo-tak that he has been falsely accused of the murder of athlete Yoo Soo-kyung (Cha Jung-won), who was one of his clients. Right after Hak-young had finished fixing Soo-kyung's internet connection, the latter was found dead on her own pool of gore with a mysterious geometrical figure drawn on the floor with her blood. Woo-tak, then, urges Hak-young to turn himself in and to trust the law after Hak-young swears that he may disclose to the police the secret Woo-tak has been hiding.

_Pride and Prejudice_ (Episode 15–16)

With the public enraged by Soo-kyung's sudden death, Jae-chan investigates the crime at once and cross-examines Woo-tak to find out more about the suspect Do Hak-young's past. He gradually thinks that Hak-young is actually innocent, though he is still clueless about the geometrical figure on the floor which was impossible for a person to create within a short period of time. The autopsy results also showed that Soo-kyung has a history of otolithiasis, that she died out of cerebral hemorrhage, and that she had no scars on her body except for a wound on her head.

On the other hand, Lawyer Yoo-beom involves himself in the case as the plaintiff for the Yoo family, insisting that Jae-chan is being too time-consuming with the case. Yoo-beom also tries to persuade Hong-joo to make an online article revealing Hak-young's personal information so that she can “help” in finding evidence against Hak-young using social media. Nevertheless, Hong-joo considers Hak-young's personal information irrelevant to the case and refuses to post them in media. With the lack of evidence, Jae-chan sets Hak-young free.

Soon after, Hong-joo gets distressed when the dream showing Jae-chan's proposal gets altered, now revealing that he will be stabbed by an unknown man just before he was able to cross the street and express his love for her.

_The Usual Suspect_ (Episode 17–18)

Hong-joo and her mother, Woo-tak, and Seung-won all feel saddened to hear about Jae-chan's forthcoming disaster. Hong-joo also suspects that the change in her dream is attributed to Hak-young's release. In addition, the public is in outrage with the prosecution with Jae-chan being the subject of every criticism about Hak-young's case, especially in social media. When the criticisms seemed to be out of hand, Hong-joo opens a link in one of the comments for an anti-Jae-chan article (Korean: 유수경 살인 사건 현장에 핏자국을 보니까 떠오르는 사진; RR: _Yusugyeong sarin sageon hyeonjange pitjagugeul bonikka tteo-oreuneun sajin_; English: _The bloodstains at the scene of Yoo Soo-kyung's murder case reminds me of a photo_), leading to a picture of a robot vacuum cleaner running over a dog's excrement creating a geometric pattern on the floor similar to the blood pattern in Yoo Soo-kyung's case.

At the same time, Soo-kyung's housekeeper, whom Jae-chan was interrogating as a witness, also mentions of a robot vacuum cleaner which, according to Inspector Choi, was not found among the items inside the victim's residence. Putting the clues together, however, Inspector Choi infers that Soo-kyung could have fainted due to her otolithiasis and lost a lot of blood out of a head injury upon her fall, while the robot vacuum cleaner ran over the pool of blood, created the pattern on the floor, and strayed outside the house (making the inspection team unable to retrieve it).

To prove their hypothesis, Jae-chan traced the item with Inspector Choi and found it in an e-waste disposal facility with the help of Hong-joo (with co-worker Bong Du-hyun) and Woo-tak (with fellow policeman Oh Kyung-han). Yoo Soo-kyung's blood was found in it, attesting their claim and proving Hak-young's innocence. Upon a request from Woo-tak, Hong-joo gives Hak-young a chance to make a public appeal of his innocence to be broadcast in the media.

Later, upon hearing Jae-chan's success in Hak-young's case in the news, Lawyer Lee Yoo-beom implicitly goads Yoo Soo-kyung's father, skilled marksman Yoo Man-ho (Jeon Kuk-hwan) who was already suffering from a later stage of pancreatic cancer, into going against Jae-chan. He had given him stolen photos of Woo-tak, Hak-young, and Jae-chan and speculated a bribery between the three. On the other hand, Jae-chan learns that Hong-joo was his childhood acquaintance “Bamtori” (Korean: 밤톨이; English: _Chestnut_) whose father was murdered by the same culprit who killed Jae-chan's. Jae-chan buys an engagement ring so that he can propose to Hong-joo, but the latter's dream unfortunately comes true in a different set-up: before Jae-chan could cross the street, Yoo Man-ho arrives in a car and shoots Jae-chan right in front of Hong-joo.

_Boy Meets Girl_ (Episode 19–20)

After shooting Jae-chan, Yoo Man-ho finds Woo-tak and Hak-young and attempts to ram them with his car. As Woo-tak and Hak-young were about to get killed, the police apprehend Yoo Man-ho but finds him unconscious inside his car. Jae-chan is rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment and he fortunately improves from his injury. Man-ho is also confined to the hospital due to his worsening pancreatic cancer.

Hong-joo receives the engagement ring from the still confined Jae-chan, but along with it is a note which she had given to a childhood acquaintance whose father was killed by the same person who killed hers when she was still a teenager. She realizes that Jae-chan was that childhood acquaintance, whose father Police Chief Officer Jung Il-seung (Jang Hyun-sung) was killed by a runaway soldier who also killed her father Nam Chul-doo (Choi Won-young), a bus driver.

Thirteen years ago, the deaths of Hong-joo's father and Jae-chan's father were given the same funeral, since their deaths happened at the same day and from the same culprit. It was during the funeral when Hong-joo, a.k.a. Bamtori, met Jae-chan. Teenagers Hong-joo and Jae-chan ran into a teary-eyed police officer, who was the culprit's older brother. The policeman, who was also Chief Jung's subordinate, asked for forgiveness but the bereaved teenagers rebuked him. Deeply ashamed of his younger brother's crimes, the policeman ran away and attempted to commit suicide by drowning himself in a lake. Jae-chan decided to save the policeman with Hong-joo's help, but while he was underwater Hong-joo hesitated out of her anger towards the policeman. As Jae-chan and the policeman were about to completely drown, Hong-joo rids herself of all resentment and pulls them out of the water. Because of these bad memories, especially of nearly killing Jae-chan in the lake, Hong-joo hesitates to wear the ring Jae-chan gave her. Feeling sad about it, Hong-joo reveals to Jae-chan what really happened at the lake, telling him that it pains her to see him, the boy she nearly killed.

As Hong-joo attends a book launching ceremony, Jae-chan intends to interrogate Yoo Man-ho for what he had done to him. Accompanied by Prosecutor Shin, Jae-chan suddenly remembers his teenage years with Hong-joo and feels a change of heart. He clarifies, instead, to Man-ho the truth about Yoo Soo-kyung's case.

Subsequently, Jae-chan escapes from the hospital to search for Hong-joo and reveal his feelings for her, despite the rain and his still sensitive gunshot wound. Hong-joo, who instantly dreamt about what Jae-chan will do, rushes to the hospital and comes across him shortly after. Jae-chan discloses to Hong-joo that he also felt the same resentment and hesitation as her back then. Jae-chan and Hong-joo finally profess their love for each other and share a kiss.

_To Die or to be Bad_ (Episode 21–22)

Meanwhile, Lawyer Yoo-beom receives a call from a new client, professor-novelist Moon Tae-min (Ryu Tae-ho) who has recently finished his launching party for his new book. During this party, his teaching assistant Lee Hwan (Moon Yong-suk) revealed his bad deeds. Being, in reality, abusive to his students and subordinates, Professor Moon secretly strangled Lee Hwan and pushed him down a derelict elevator shaft. With the crime finished, Professor Moon is apprehensive when he noticed a child's cap lying nearby on the floor, implying that someone saw him killing Lee Hwan. The victim is already brain-dead in the hospital, can ultimately die within a week, and is a prospect organ donor to seven patients, while the witness is a five-year-old kindergartner.

In line with Professor Moon's case, Hong-joo and Woo-tak both dream of Jae-chan resigning from his job. In Hong-joo's dream, Jae-chan conducts an autopsy and successfully prosecute Professor Moon, but the seven patients waiting for the transplant perish in return. In Woo-tak's version, Jae-chan agrees with the organ transplant and reveals in court that Professor Moon is the culprit, but with no autopsy done, Professor Moon is acquitted from the murder charge while Lee Hwan's father (Kim Ki-cheon) blames Jae-chan for Professor Moon's release.

Although hesitant, Hong-joo tells Jae-chan about the dreams. After having their days off, Hong-joo and Jae-chan decide to face the situation no matter what. Just in time, Woo-tak arrests Professor Moon, who was already assaulting the kindergartner witness. To prevent Hong-joo and Woo-tak's dreams from coming true, Jae-chan decides to let the autopsy be done after the organ transplant since the injuries that Lee Hwan had were all contained to his head only.

_Knocking on Heaven's Door_ (Episode 23–24)

Jae-chan begins with the lawsuit against Professor Moon. While Yoo-beom kept on asserting Professor Moon's innocence, Jae-chan interrogates the kindergartner, using childlike language to establish rapport with the child. With the help of senior prosecutor Son Woo-joo (Bae Hae-sun), the credibility of the autopsy results and the possibility of a transplant be done before an autopsy were proven.

Nevertheless, Yoo-beom argues that the surgeon should be blamed for Lee Hwan's death since Lee Hwan's cardiac death happened after the transplant, not after Professor Moon's crime (cardiac death is the favored kind of death in courts than brain death). Hong-joo and Lee Hwan's father vehemently protests on Yoo-beom's argument. Jae-chan strongly asserted the baselessness of such claim, emphasizing that Professor Moon's crime would have led to Lee Hwan's ultimate cardiac death even without the organ transplant. Professor Moon is finally prosecuted of murder and is sentenced up to seven years of imprisonment. With the future once again changed, Jae-chan and Hong-joo spend an intimate moment at the beach.

_We're On Our Way to Meet You Now_ (Episode 25–26)

At the beach, Jae-chan and Hong-joo wonder if they could still meet the police officer they saved at the lake thirteen years ago. Jae-chan supposes that they could have crossed their paths with him once though they could have not recognized him.

After Professor Moon's case, Lawyer Yoo-beom invites Inspector Choi and Jae-chan's assisting officer Moon Hyang-mi (Park Jin-joo) to work at Yoo-beom's company, the Haekwang Law Firm. Inspector Choi refuses the offer and chooses to stay. Jae-chan, who learns from Hyang-mi about Yoo-beom's offer, tries to convince Inspector Choi not to quit his job.

Meanwhile, Jae-chan receives from his younger brother Seung-won the last will of Dr. Myung Yi-suk, the father of Seung-won's classmate Myung Dae-gu and the supposed culprit of an intravenous drip serial killing case of 11 hospital patients. Years ago, it was Yoo-beom who handled the case when he was still a prosecutor, and the case earned him an award from the Public Prosecutor General. Recently, Myung Yi-suk committed suicide inside his prison cell and left a note saying that he was falsely accused of the crime.

On the other hand, Hong-joo is tasked to cover prosecution work for a TV program in SBC titled “Three-Day Experience.” At first, she covered Prosecutor Shin in her daily activities. For the night shift, he covered Jae-chan who was interrogating a cellphone thief whose paralytic nine-year-old daughter died when he was in jail a decade ago. The thief, then, gives him a flash drive, which contains files from one of the phones he recently pocketed.

Upon investigating the flash drive, Inspector Choi Dam-dong uncovers photos of 19 hospital patients, 11 of which were the victims of the Myung Yi-suk intravenous drip serial killing case. The prosecution team deduces that the real culprit is still at large, and Inspector Choi bitterly realizes that Yoo-beom had fabricated the evidences, leading to Myung Yi-suk being indicted instead. Later, Jae-chan and Hong-joo, who were looking for the cellphone owner, gets trapped in a fire. Inspector Choi fortunately arrives at the scene and saves the couple from burning to their deaths.

_Catch Me If You Can_ (Episode 27–28)

While being rushed with Hong-joo to the hospital, Jae-chan wonders how Inspector Choi managed to find them. Upon reporting back to their works, Jae-chan and Hong-joo learns that the remaining eight patients in the 19 photos were killed after Myung Yi-suk's arrest, further proving the existence of a real culprit, which they infer also as the culprit behind the arson that nearly killed them. Jae-chan and another senior prosecutor Lee Ji-kwang (Min Sung-wook) are instructed to reinvestigate the intravenous drip serial killing case, while Prosecutors Son and Shin are directed to inspect the arson case. With the reopening of the IV drip killings, it is assumed that there is an error in Yoo-beom and Inspector Choi's investigation, but Jae-chan strongly believes in Inspector Choi's innocence.

On the other hand, Yoo-beom began receiving ominous text messages from an unknown source, asking him if he really manipulated the evidences for the IV drip serial killing case. He was also interviewed by Hong-joo who told him that she already knew that something went wrong with the case and that he could be the one to be blamed. Yoo-beom decides to unmask the secret texter by meeting him up at his office late at night. Just as the prosecution and Hong-joo's reporting team found out that it was actually a woman who owned the phone and bought the gasoline used for the arson, the secret texter and the real culprit of the serial killing, Ha Joo-an (Lee Na-ra), revealed herself to Yoo-beom.

Joo-an discloses to Yoo-beom her bitter past which lead her to doing such a heinous crime. She was a bed-ridden patient having Crohn's disease, and she utterly despised her fellow patients who were already being discharged from the hospital. Even though she knew it was extremely evil, she injected her first 11 victims with fatal amounts of Vecaron and, after Myung Yi-suk's arrest, killed in the same manner the remaining eight. She did not even care if she will be punished, but with Yoo-beom prosecuting another person instead of her, she sensed a feeling of hope for the first time. Now that the case is being reinvestigated, she knew the Yoo-beom's fame as a lawyer may be ruined soon. Completely distraught, Yoo-beom plans to put Hong-joo in a trap so that the secret of the case will only be kept between him and Joo-an.

At the prosecution office, Jae-chan discovers that Inspector Choi was the policeman he and Hong-joo saved from committing suicide in the lake. Inspector Choi was the older brother of the young runaway soldier who murdered Jae-chan and Hong-joo's fathers. When Jae-chan seeks to be reconciled with him, the former policeman quits from his job as an inspector after days of tolerating the suspicions and rumors about him manipulating the evidences in the IV drip killing case. He leaves his resignation letter to Jae-chan, pleading his innocence from the accusations.

Yoo-beom invites Hong-joo for a late-night interview, minutes before a scheduled power interruption in the building. Before she arrived, he placed a sleeping pill in her cup of coffee. Unknowing that it was already the fulfillment of the dream of her impending death, Hong-joo drinks her coffee and collapses, nearly unconscious. She was, then, carried by Yoo-beom and Joo-an to the law firm's rooftop garden under the heavy rain.

_Stand by Me_ (Episode 29–30)

While being drugged by Joo-an, Hong-joo spoke as if talking to Jae-chan so that he will find out through dreaming the exact time and place of her impending death. Minutes before, Jae-chan dreams exactly as how the incident would happen and rushes to save Hong-joo, asking back-up from Woo-tak and the rest of the police.

As Woo-tak and the reinforcements arrive first, Yoo-beom decides to kill Joo-an to rid of all suspicions. He took a sleeping pill so that he can pretend that he had been drugged also by Joo-an. Before Joo-an can defend herself, he pushed her off the building just as Woo-tak reached the rooftop. Jae-chan arrives next and immediately resuscitates Hong-joo before the ambulance arrived to rescue her and Yoo-beom.

At the hospital, Yoo-beom wakes up and tells the police detectives his fake story, but he suddenly felt nervous upon learning that Hong-joo also recovered, thanks to Jae-chan's early response. Jae-chan gets furious upon hearing that Yoo-beom had played victim, but Inspector Choi arrives to comfort him and to advise him not to act rashly. Later, Hong-joo is discharged and is placed under witness protection, while the prosecution prepares for the lawsuit against Yoo-beom, who will be defended by his boss, Lawyer Ko (Son Byong-ho). Yoo-beom will be charged by the prosecution of evidence tampering, attempted murder of Hong-joo, and the murder of the Ha Joo-an.

As the lawsuit verges to its opening, Woo-tak gets anxious after dreaming the fates of the three witnesses to be summoned to court: Inspector Choi telling his part in the investigation of the IV drip killing case, Hong-joo's statements getting impeached, and finally his own long-hidden secret going to be exposed. The evidence lists were read and reviewed on the first day of the lawsuit, with Jae-chan and senior prosecutor Lee Ji-kwang representing the prosecution. Lawyer Ko disagreed with the statements presented by Inspector Choi, Hong-joo, and Woo-tak and requested to the judges for a subpoena to be imposed on the three. Before the day of the next trial, Hong-joo, Jae-chan, and Woo-tak spend time with each other. While Hong-joo excused herself to answer a call, Jae-chan and Woo-tak revealed to one another that both of them had feelings for Hong-joo and decided to keep their friendship going nevertheless.

On the next trial, cross-examination of the witnesses began with Inspector Choi. As what Woo-tak had dreamt, Inspector Choi admits that he is part of the inspection of the seized items related to the IV drip serial killing case. He told the court that he was with Yoo-beom when he rechecked the seized items and saw three bottles of Vecaron, which were not among the items before. When Lawyer Ko nearly destroys his credibility as witness, Jae-chan won the juries over by emphasizing the fact the Yoo-beom have fabricated evidences to gain fame and a position in Lawyer Ko's law firm. Hong-joo was interrogated next and, as what Woo-tak had dreamt, her statements get impeached since Lawyer Ko insisted that she had been drugged and could have only been hallucinating. To counter the argument, Jae-chan impeaches Yoo-beom's statements since the latter declares that he was also drugged by Joo-an and, thus, should be assumed to be hallucinating also during the incident.

During a break in the trial, Hong-joo is worried that Woo-tak may incorrectly describe the umbrellas (Yoo-beom's green umbrella and Joo-an's red umbrella), which were important pieces of evidence that Woo-tak saw at the rooftop. While waiting for his turn to be cross-examined, Woo-tak realizes that Hong-joo knew all along his secret: that he is suffering from color blindness, which is strictly unacceptable for policemen and one of the grounds for dismissal.

_Goodbye, My Friend_ (Episode 31–32)

While Hong-joo was talking to Woo-tak about the umbrellas and Woo-tak's colorblindness, Inspector Choi also informed Jae-chan and Ji-kwang that Yoo-beom plans to escape from Korea after the trial. Later, Woo-tak is interrogated and fearlessly reveals his color blindness, shocking Jae-chan and everybody in the court. Before Lawyer Ko could impeach his statements, though, he revealed that even though he is colorblind he can describe the umbrellas correctly by their shades and form. By accurately describing the shape of the umbrellas and using Yoo-beom's green necktie and the red lace on Jae-chan robe as color references, he was able to win over the juries and prove his credibility. He also added that he already had his resignation letter prepared so that he can testify in the trial.

Lawyer Ko gives up the case and tells Yoo-beom to create his own statements for himself, knowing that they will be defeated in the next and last trial. The prosecution quickly requested for a travel ban be issued on Yoo-beom. Undeniably devastated, Yoo-beom rebukes Inspector Choi and deliberately rams his car into him in front of Jae-chan. As Yoo-beom is taken away by the police, the dying inspector reveals to the mourning Jae-chan that he also have the ability to see the future through dreams and that he had seen his death by Yoo-beom in one of his dream when he was still a policeman. Jae-chan expresses his respect and thanks for him, apologizing to him for not being able to recognize him when they first met at the prosecution office, for compelling him to work too much in the investigations, and for making him worry when he acts foolishly. Inspector Choi gives his last words to Jae-chan before he finally dies. After Inspected Choi's funeral, Yoo-beom finally admits his crimes and is sentenced to lifetime imprisonment.

Days after Yoo-beom's trial, Hong-joo and Jae-chan go to Woo-tak's to provide him books so that Woo-tak can study law and become a lawyer, now that he is unemployed. A year later, pianist and Seung-won's girlfriend Park So-yoon return to the country and, together with Hong-joo, Jae-chan, and their friends and colleagues, attend the wedding party of senior prosecutors Ji-kwang and Son Woo-joo who were dating unbeknownst to their co-workers in the prosecution office.

At the closing scene of the series, Jae-chan reveals to Hong-joo one of his choices that he never regretted: his choice of meeting up with Hong-joo whom he had been looking for since they last met thirteen years ago.

Main

-   Bae Suzy as Nam Hong-joo 남홍주 [5] (a.k.a. Bamtori)
    -   Shin Yi-joon as young Nam Hong-joo

    A 29-year-old journalist and field reporter who has the power of precognition (the ability to see events in the future), which takes effect while dreaming. She was once a tomboyish girl nicknamed “Bamtori” (Korean: 밤톨이; English: _Chestnut_) who aspires to become a baseball player. Since she was a child, Hong-joo has been haunted by seeing the deaths of other people in her dreams, one of which is the untimely death of her father, Nam Chul-doo, by the hands of a runaway soldier who also killed Jae-chan’s father. By saving Jae-chan from drowning, she had inadvertently made Jae-chan acquire the same ability that she has.

    Now that she is fatherless, Hong-joo began dreaming of the impending deaths of her mother, Yoon Moon-sun, and herself: the former happening due to an accident she gets into and the latter due to her occupation as a field reporter. Unfortunately, as all the other dreams, she does not know when the deaths will happen; she can only guess. In her attempt to stop her dreams from becoming reality, she leaves her job and helps her mother in running a _samgyeopsal_ restaurant. Nevertheless, she regains her resolve in doing her job as a field reporter with Jae-chan to support her in preventing their dreams from coming true.

Back in his adolescent years, he was a carefree boy with no worries about his studies. After reconciling with his father, he became a changed teenager and aimed to work as a prosecutor. It was also at this age when he acquired from Hong-joo the ability to see the future through dreams, when Hong-joo saved him from drowning in a lake while preventing police officer Choi Dam-dong, the runaway soldier’s older brother, from committing suicide.

    Despite appearing cold and lacking a sense of humor, Jae-chan is still foolish and funny in some aspects. Since the first appearance of his future-seeing dreams, he will do everything he can to prevent them from coming true. He falls in love for Hong-joo after days of going out with each other.

-   Jung Hae-in as Han Woo-tak 한우탁 [7]

    Woo-tak was destined, without him knowing, to die in a car accident that Yoo-beom will cause in a snowy Valentine’s Day. Thanks to Jae-chan, who intercepted Hong-joo’s car which Yoo-beom was driving, he was saved from his supposed death and acquired from him the ability to see future events through dreams. Together with Jae-chan and Hong-joo, they work together to keep their bad dreams from coming true. As the trio went on with their lives, Woo-tak began having an affection for Hong-joo, although he is keeping his feelings concealed, sensing that Hong-joo and Jae-chan are developing feelings for each other.

With Yoo-beom driving the new motorcycle, they get into an accident and he leaves Jae-chan behind to fend for himself, an incident which made Jae-chan to dislike him.

    As a former prosecutor, Yoo-beom dared to falsify evidences just to finish his cases.
