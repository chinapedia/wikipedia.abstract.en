JHARREL JEROME (born October 9, 1997) is a Dominican American actor. He is best known for his roles as young Kevin in Barry Jenkins' drama film _Moonlight_ (2016) and as Korey Wise in Ava DuVernay's Netflix miniseries _When They See Us_ (2019).[1] For the latter, he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.


Life and career

Jerome was born in 1997 and raised in the Bronx, New York.[2][3] He grew up in a close-knit family with parents who he described as "loving".[4] His mother suggested he pursue acting when he was in eighth grade, after which he joined the Riverdale Children's Theatre, a local youth theatre organization. He attended and graduated from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, commuting to Manhattan each day by train.[5][6]

Shortly after Jerome enrolled as an undergraduate at Ithaca College, he was cast in his first professional acting role in the 2016 independent film _Moonlight_, as young Kevin.[7] A.O. Scott wrote in the _New York Times_ that he was "excellent" in the role.[8] Director Barry Jenkins said about Jerome, in an interview with the _Los Angeles Times,_ "When you watch Jharrel in that movie, he’s not a guy who’s been over-rehearsing. That’s a dude learning by doing. It’s amazing.”[9]

Since 2017, Jerome has appeared in the Audience series _Mr. Mercedes_.[10] He auditioned for the role of young Korey Wise in the 2019 Netflix miniseries _When They See Us,_ based on the Central Park jogger case.[11] After his audition the series' director, Ava DuVernay, asked him to read the lines for adult Korey Wise, and he was subsequently cast in both roles.[12] Jerome grew close to Wise throughout filming, and said in a _Los Angeles Times_ interview, "He's my brother now. I look up to him. I look up to his courage. He's taught me so much on how to be strong.”[13]
