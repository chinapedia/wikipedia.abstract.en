CARROWREAGH COURT TOMB is a court cairn and National Monument located in County Sligo, Ireland.[1]


Location

Carrowreagh Court Tomb is located northwest of Aclare, high in the Slieve Gamph Mountains in the middle of a peat bog.


History

Carrowreagh Court Tomb was constructed in the Neolithic, c. 4000–2500 BC. A cist was found nearby, 30 m (33 yd) to the SW.[2]

The court was located in the northwest. The gallery is kite-shaped with an entrance 2 m (6½ ft) wide. This widens to over 3 m (10 ft) at the jambs. There may have been three or four terminal chambers, an unusually high number – it is hard to be exact as the stones are in disarray.[3][4]
