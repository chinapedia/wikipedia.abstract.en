_PRODUCT OF ISOLATION_ is the first solo studio album by American alternative rock musician Sean Danielsen. It was released independently on January 13, 2017.[1][2][3]


Background

During October 2016, Danielsen mentioned on his Facebook wall, that in January 2017, he planned to release his first solo studio album.[4] In early November, the vocalist stated that 13 January 2017 would be the planned release date.[5] This album was the first time that Danielsen used a home studio while engineering and producing completely on his own.[6]


Critical reception

Regarding the album, Robin Ervolina of Shockwave Magazine stated that Danielsen's "music has a truthful ring that seems to be absent in the current music scene, and there's a "heart and soul" to it, that makes me root for him in his pursuit to make music for real people."[7]

Scott Langevin of Shockwave Magazine wrote that the album "stays true to his solo career's successes thus far", and went on to say: "With stunning lyrical subtleties, long and powerful breaths, and the long-held keys, this album is one of the key components that I feel any musician needs to be a success", showing "true talent, and just raw emotion throughout".[8]
