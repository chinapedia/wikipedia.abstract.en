DOMENICO ROSSETTI (c. 1650â€“1736) was an Italian painter and engraver active mainly in Verona. He was known for his wood engravings and acquaforte paintings.


Biography

He was born in Venice. He worked for years as _Maestro della Stampe_ of the Zecca of Venice. He was patronized by then Bishop Giovanni Francesco Barbarigo, who brought him to Verona, from where he traveled to Munich in Bavaria, and then to Dusseldorf, to work for over a decade as an engraver. Among his engravings is _il Pugilato_, based on a painting by Pietro Liberi.[1]

He designed the decorations for a room in the bishopric of Verona in which St Charles Borromeo had stayed. He designed an altar in the Oratory of the Concezione, next to Santa Maria in Chiavica.[2] He made a series of engravings of works of Tintoretto.[3]
