The AZAD KASHMIRI DIASPORA is the people who migrated out of Azad Kashmir to other areas and countries as well as their descendants.


Pakistan

Many Azad Kashmiris have moved to Pakistan, chiefly to Punjab, Sindh (particularly Karachi) and Islamabad Capital Territory.[1][2][3]


United Kingdom

The United Kingdom is home to one of the largest Mirpuri diasporic populations. Towards the end of the 19th century, Mirpuris started taking jobs as stokers on ships of the British Merchant Navy and acquired an understanding of global employment opportunities. When Britain faced labour shortages after World War II, the Mirpuri seamen settled down to work in Britain, starting a process of chain migration.[4]

A second impetus to immigration came with the construction of the Mangla Dam in the Mirpur district, in the 1960s. The dam submerged Mirpur's most fertile land as well as the city of Mirpur and hundreds of villages. The displaced people used their connections with the Mirpuris in Britain to find employment and emigrate.[5] The Pakistani government also helped the immigration of 5,000 people.[6]

Before the 1990s, most British Mirpuris called themselves "Mirpuris" or "Pakistanis". Scholar Alexander Evans states that Pakistanis tended to look down upon Mirpuris as being hill people, with little culture. In the 1990s, activists belonging to the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front launched a _Kashmir National Identity Campaign_ and successfully lobbied the British Parliament to get their "Kashmiri" ethnicity officially recognised. The Valley Kashmiris in Britain maintain that they are "Kashmiris" and that the Mirpuris are "_nouveaux_ Kashmiris".[7]
