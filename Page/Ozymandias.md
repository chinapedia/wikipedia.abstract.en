"OZYMANDIAS" ( )[1] is the title of two related sonnets published in 1818.

The first was written by English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) and published in the 11 January 1818 issue of _The Examiner_[2] in London. It was included the following year in Shelley's collection _Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems_ (1819)[3] and in a posthumous compilation of his poems published in 1826.[4] "Ozymandias" is Shelley's most famous work and is frequently anthologised.

Shelley wrote the poem in friendly competition with his friend and fellow poet Horace Smith (1779–1849), who also wrote a sonnet on the same topic with the same title. Smith's poem was published in _The Examiner_ a few weeks after Shelley's sonnet. Both poems explore the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion.

In antiquity, Ozymandias () was a Greek name for the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II. Shelley began writing his poem in 1817, soon after the announcement of the British Museum's acquisition of a large fragment of a statue of Ramesses II from the thirteenth century BC, leading some scholars to believe that Shelley was inspired by this. The 7.25-ton fragment of the statue's head and torso had been removed in 1816 from the mortuary temple of Ramesses (the Ramesseum) at Thebes by Italian adventurer Giovanni Battista Belzoni. It was expected to arrive in London in 1818, but did not arrive until 1821.[5][6]

Publication history

The banker and political writer Horace Smith spent the Christmas season of 1817–1818 with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. At this time, members of Shelley's literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, John Keats and Leigh Hunt wrote competing sonnets on the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: "King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work." In the poem Diodorus becomes "a traveller from an antique land."[7]

The two poems were later published in Leigh Hunt's _The Examiner,_[8] published by Leigh's brother John Hunt in London. (Hunt was already planning to publish a long excerpt from Shelley's new epic, _The Revolt of Islam,_ later the same month.)

Shelley's poem

Ozymandias_Shelley_draft_c1817.gif Shelley's poem was published on 11 January 1818 under the pen name Glirastes. It appeared on page 24 in the yearly collection, under Original Poetry. Shelley's poem was later republished under the title "Sonnet. Ozymandias" in his 1819 collection _Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems_ by Charles and James OllierReprinted in

and in the 1826 _Miscellaneous and Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley_ by William Benbow, both in London.[9]

Smith's poem

Smith's poem was published, along with a note signed with the initials H.S., on 1 February 1818.[10] It takes the same subject, tells the same story, and makes a similar moral point, but one related more directly to modernity, ending by imagining a hunter of the future looking in wonder on the ruins of a forgotten London. It was originally published under the same title as Shelley's verse; but in later collections Smith retitled it "On A Stupendous Leg of Granite, Discovered Standing by Itself in the Deserts of Egypt, with the Inscription Inserted Below".[11]

Comparison of the two poems

PERCY SHELLEY'S "OZYMANDIAS"

I met a traveller from an antique land Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert... near them, on the sand, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal these words appear: 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings; Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.[12] HORACE SMITH'S "OZYMANDIAS"

In Egypt's sandy silence, all alone, Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws The only shadow that the Desert knows:— "I am great OZYMANDIAS," saith the stone, "The King of Kings; this mighty City shows "The wonders of my hand."— The City's gone,— Naught but the Leg remaining to disclose The site of this forgotten Babylon.

We wonder,—and some Hunter may express Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace, He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess What powerful but unrecorded race Once dwelt in that annihilated place.[13]


Analysis and interpretation

Ozymandias.jpg]]

Form

Shelley's "Ozymandias" is a sonnet, written in loose iambic pentameter, but with an atypical rhyme scheme (ABABA CDCEDEFEF) when compared to other English-language sonnets, and without the characteristic octave-and-sestet structure.

Hubris

A central theme of the "Ozymandias" poems is the inevitable decline of rulers with their pretensions to greatness.[14] The name "Ozymandias" is a rendering in Greek of a part of Ramesses II's throne name, _User-maat-re Setep-en-re_. The poems paraphrase the inscription on the base of the statue, given by Diodorus Siculus in his _Bibliotheca historica_ as

  "King of Kings am I, Ozymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass one of my works."[15][16][17]

Although the poems were written and published before the statue arrived in Britain,[18] they may have been inspired by the impending arrival in London in 1821 of a colossal statue of Ramesses II, acquired for the British Museum by the Italian adventurer Giovanni Belzoni in 1816.[19] The statue's repute in Western Europe preceded its actual arrival in Britain, and Napoleon, who at the time of the two poems was imprisoned on St Helena (although the impact of his own rise and fall was still fresh), had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire it for France.
