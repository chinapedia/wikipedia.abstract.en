SHARON BELL MATHIS (born 1937) is an American librarian and author who has written books mainly for children and young adults.[1][2]


Early life

Mathis was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey.[3] She started writing at an early age, and her love of reading was fostered by her parents. Her mother, a poet, encouraged her to write.[4][5] In 1958, she earned a degree in Sociology from Morgan State College and, in 1975, went on to earn a master's in Library Science from the Catholic University of America.[6]


Career

Mathis has written many books for children and young adults, and has received many accolades in her career. Her book _Ray Charles_, a nonfiction biography of Ray Charles, received the Coretta Scott King Award.[7][8] _The Hundred Penny Box_ received a Newbery Honor Award and is a recipient of the Boston Globeâ€“Horn Book Award and also an American Library Association Notable Children's Book.[9][10] _English Journal_ placed Mathis alongside writers such as Toni Cade Bambara and Nikki Giovanni, characterizing them as "describing a black consciousness of self- celebration rather like that which flowered during the Harlem Renaissance and was somehow lost, at least in literature, in the intervening years of social upheaval."[11] _Teacup Full of Roses_ was a New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year.[12] It was described, also in _English Journal_, as "a celebration of black family life, not of the stereotypical enduring parents, but of the children who find their strength in giving to each other."[13]
