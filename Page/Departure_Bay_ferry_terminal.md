DEPARTURE BAY is a major ferry terminal owned and operated by BC Ferries that provides ferry service across the Strait of Georgia to Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.

Unlike Nanaimo's other major ferry terminal (Duke Point), Departure Bay does have public transit connections.


History

Beginning in 1951, the Black Ball Line originally ran their ferry service from Departure Bay to Horseshoe Bay. In November 1961, BC Ferries took over service by acquiring Black Ball Line.[1]

Prior to the opening of the Duke Point ferry terminal in 1997, Departure Bay had regular ferry service to Tsawwassen. This change occurred to alleviated traffic flow in Nanaimo.
