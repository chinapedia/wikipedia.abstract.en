CASE is a special grammatical category of a noun, pronoun, adjective, participle or numeral whose value reflects the grammatical function performed by that word in a phrase, clause or sentence. In some languages, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, determiners, participles, prepositions, numerals, articles and their modifiers take different inflected forms, depending on their case. As a language evolves, cases can merge (for instance, in Ancient Greek, the locative case merged with the dative case), a phenomenon formally called syncretism.

English has largely lost its inflected case system although personal pronouns still have three cases, which are simplified forms of the nominative, accusative and genitive cases. They are used with personal pronouns: subjective case (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who, whoever), objective case (me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, whomever) and possessive case (my, mine; your, yours; his; her, hers; its; our, ours; their, theirs; whose; whosever[1]). Forms such as _I_, _he_ and _we_ are used for the subject ("I kicked the ball"), and forms such as _me_, _him_ and _us_ are used for the object ("John kicked ME").

Languages such as Ancient Greek, Armenian, Assamese, most Balto-Slavic languages, Basque, most Caucasian languages, German, Icelandic, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Sanskrit, Tamil, Tibetan (one of a few tonal languages), the Turkic languages and the Uralic languages have extensive case systems, with nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and determiners all inflecting (usually by means of different suffixes) to indicate their case. The number of cases differs between languages: Esperanto has two; modern English has three but for pronouns only; German and Icelandic have four; Romanian has five; Latin, Russian and Turkish each have at least six; Armenian, Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian have seven; Sanskrit and Tamil have eight; Estonian has 14; Finnish has 15; Hungarian has 18 and Tsez has 64 cases.

Commonly encountered cases include nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. A role that one of those languages marks by case is often marked in English with a preposition. For example, the English prepositional phrase _with (his) foot_ (as in "John kicked the ball with his foot") might be rendered in Russian using a single noun in the instrumental case or in Ancient Greek as (, meaning "the foot") with both words (the definite article, and the noun () "foot") changing to dative form.

More formally, case has been defined as "a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads".[2] Cases should be distinguished from thematic roles such as _agent_ and _patient_. They are often closely related, and in languages such as Latin, several thematic roles have an associated case, but cases are a morphological notion, and thematic roles a semantic one. Languages having cases often exhibit free word order, as thematic roles are not required to be marked by position in the sentence.


History

It is widely accepted that the Ancient Greeks had a certain idea of the forms of a name in their own language. A fragment of Anacreon seems to prove this. Nevertheless, it cannot be inferred that the Ancient Greeks really knew what grammatical cases were. Grammatical cases were first recognized by the Stoics and from some philosophers of the Peripatetic school.[3][4] The advancements of those philosophers were later employed by the philologists of the Alexandrian school.[5][6]


Etymology

The English word _case_ used in this sense comes from the Latin , which is derived from the verb , "to fall", from the Proto-Indo-European root _{{PIE_.[7] The Latin word is a calque of the Greek , , lit. "falling, fall".[8] The sense is that all other cases are considered to have "fallen" away from the nominative. This picture is also reflected in the word _declension_, from Latin , "to lean", from the PIE root ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/ḱley-|

Taken as a whole, English personal pronouns are typically said to have three morphological cases:

-   The _nominative case_ (_subjective pronouns_ such as _I_, _he_, _she_, _we_), used for the subject of a finite verb and sometimes for the complement of a copula.
-   The _oblique case_ (_object pronouns_ such as _me_, _him_, _her_, _us_), used for the direct or indirect object of a verb, for the object of a preposition, for an absolute disjunct, and sometimes for the complement of a copula.
-   The _genitive case_ (_possessive pronouns_ such as _my/mine_, _his_, _her/hers_, _our/ours_), used for a grammatical possessor. This is not always considered to be a case; see .

Most English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a _determiner_ form (such as _my_, _our_) and a distinct _independent_ form (such as _mine_, _ours_) (with two exceptions: the third person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter _it_, which use the same form for both determiner and independent [_his car_, _it is his_]), and a distinct _reflexive_ or _intensive_ form (such as _myself_, _ourselves_). The interrogative personal pronoun _who_ exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (_who_, _whom_, _whose_) and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (_whoever_, _whomever_, and _whosever_).

Though English _pronouns_ can have subject and object forms (he/him, she/her), _nouns_ show only a singular/plural and a possessive/non-possessive distinction (e.g. _chair_, _chairs_, _chair's_, _chairs_'). Note that _chair_ does not change form between "the chair is here" (subject) and "I saw the chair" (direct object), a distinction made by word order and context.


Hierarchy of cases

Cases can be ranked in the following hierarchy, where a language that does not have a given case will tend not to have any cases to the right of the missing case:[9]

    nominative → accusative _or_ ergative → genitive → dative → locative _or_ prepositional → ablative _and/or_ instrumental → _others_.

This is, however, only a general tendency. Many forms of Central German, such as Colognian and Luxembourgish, have a dative case but lack a genitive. In Irish nouns, the nominative and accusative have fallen together, whereas the dative–locative has remained separate in some paradigms; Irish also has genitive and vocative cases. In Punjabi, the accusative, genitive, and dative have merged to an oblique case, but the language still retains vocative, locative, and ablative cases. Old English had an instrumental case, but not a locative or prepositional.


Case order

The traditional case order (nom-gen-dat-acc) was expressed for the first time in _The Art of Grammar_ in the 2nd century BC: The Russian language uses a similar case order.1

Latin grammars, such as _Ars grammatica_, followed the Greek tradition, but added the ablative case of Latin. Later other European languages also followed that Graeco-Roman tradition.

However, for some languages, such as Latin, due to case syncretism the order may be changed for convenience, where the accusative or the vocative cases are placed after the nominative and before the genitive. For example:

+--+------------------------------------+
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | |            | water  | war      | |
|  | +============+========+==========+ |
|  | | Singular   | Plural | Singular | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Nominative | aqua   | aquae    | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Vocative   |        |          | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Accusative | aquam  | aquās    | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Genitive   | aquae  | aquārum  | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Dative     | aquīs  | bellō    | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  | | Ablative   | aquā   |          | |
|  | +------------+--------+----------+ |
|  |                                    |
|  | : Latin                            |

Case concord systems

In the most common[10] case concord system, only the head-word (the noun) in a phrase is marked for case. This system appears in many Papuan languages as well as in Turkic, Mongolian, Quechua, Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, and other languages. In Basque and various Amazonian and Australian languages, only the phrase-final word (not necessarily the noun) is marked for case. In many Indo-European, Finnic, and Semitic languages, case is marked on the noun, the determiner, and usually the adjective. Other systems are less common. In some languages, there is double-marking of a word as both genitive (to indicate semantic role) and another case such as accusative (to establish concord with the head noun).[11]


Declension paradigms

Declension is the process or result of altering nouns to the correct grammatical cases. Languages with rich nominal inflection (use grammatical cases for many purposes) typically have a number of identifiable declension classes, or groups of nouns with a similar pattern of case inflection or declension. Sanskrit has six declension classes, whereas Latin is traditionally considered to have five, and Ancient Greek three declension classes.[12] For example, Slovak has fifteen noun declension classes, five for each gender (the number may vary depending on which paradigms are counted or omitted, this mainly concerns those that modify declension of foreign words; refer to article).

In Indo-European languages, declension patterns may depend on a variety of factors, such as gender, number, phonological environment, and irregular historical factors. Pronouns sometimes have separate paradigms. In some languages, particularly Slavic languages, a case may contain different groups of endings depending on whether the word is a noun or an adjective. A single case may contain many different endings, some of which may even be derived from different roots. For example, in Polish, the genitive case has _-a, -u, -ów, -i/-y, -e-_ for nouns, and _-ego, -ej, -ich/-ych_ for adjectives. To a lesser extent, a noun's animacy or humanness may add another layer of complexity. For example, in Russian:

-   (NOM, animate, zero ending) ((The) cat catches mice)

-   (NOM, inanimate, zero ending) ((The) pillar holds a/the roof)

vs.

-   (ACC, animate, -a ending). (Peter strokes a/the cat)

and

-   (ACC, inanimate, zero ending). (Peter breaks a/the pillar)


Examples

Belarusian

An example of a Belarusian case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Belarusian term for "country," which belongs to Belarusian's first declension class.

-   (nominative) "[the] country" [as a subject] (e.g. – this country is located in Europe)

-   (genitive) "[the] country's / [of the] country" (e.g. – the Dutch government is situated in The Hague, but the country's capital is Amsterdam)

-   (dative) "[to/for the] country" [as an indirect object] (e.g. – there were no natural resources left for the new country)

-   (accusative) "country" [as a direct object] (e.g. – I often visit this country)

-   (instrumental) "[with the] country/[by the] country/[be a] country" (e.g. – Singapore was a poor country)

-   (locative) "[in the] country" [as a direct object] (e.g. – There is not enough food in the country)

German

In German, grammatical case is largely preserved in the articles and adjectives, but nouns have lost many of their original endings. Below is an example of case inflection in German using the masculine definite article and one of the German words for "sailor".

-   (nominative) "the sailor" [as a subject] (e.g. _Der Seemann steht da_ – the sailor is standing there)

-   (genitive) "the sailor's / [of] the sailor" (e.g. – the name of the sailor is Otto)

-   (dative) "[to/for] the sailor" [as an indirect object] (e.g. – I gave a present to the sailor)

-   (accusative) "the sailor" [as a direct object] (e.g. – I saw the sailor)

An example with the feminine definite article with the German word for "woman."

-   _dIE Frau_ (nominative) "the woman" [as a subject] (e.g. _Die Frau isst_ - the woman eats)
-   _dER Frau_ (genitive) "the woman's / [of] the woman" (e.g. _Die Katze der Frau ist blau_ - the cat of the woman is blue)
-   _dER Frau_ (dative) "[to/for] the woman" [as an indirect object] (e.g. _Ich gab der Frau ein Geschenk_ - I gave a present to the woman)
-   _dIE Frau_ (accusative) "the woman" [as a direct object] (e.g. _Ich sah die Frau_ - I see the woman)

An example with the neuter definite article with the German word for "book."

-   _dAS Buch (nominative)_ "the book" [as a subject] (e.g. _Das Buch ist gut -_ the book is good)
-   _dES Buch(E)S_ (genitive) "the book's/ [of] the book" (e.g. _Die Seiten des Buchs sind grün_ - the pages of the book are green)
-   _dEM Buch_ (dative) "[to/for] the book" [as an indirect object] (e.g. _Ich gab dem Buch_ - I gave the book)
-   _dAS Buch_ (accusative) "the book" [as a direct object] (e.g. _Ich sah das Buch_ - I saw the book)

Greek

Modern Greek has four cases: nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative. For neuters and most groups of feminines and plural masculines, the genitive case differs from the other three. Below is an example of the declension of (sky), which has a different form in the singular of all four cases, together with the appropriate article in both the singular and the plural:

-   Nominative –
-   Genitive –
-   Accusative –
-   Vocative –

Ancient Greek had one additional case, the dative. At some point, it was replaced with the preposition , followed by the accusative. This became necessary when pronunciation simplified, merging the two long vowels eta and omega to short. The result was that dative did not sound much different from the accusative in the singular of the first two groups. However, the dative case is still used in many expressions.

With time, only the sigma of was left and got attached to the article, except when an article is not used and it becomes instead. Note that this is not a different case from the accusative.

Below is an example with the dative case of the word (city):

-   Nominative –
-   Genitive –
-   Dative –
-   Accusative –
-   Vocative –

Japanese

Cases in Japanese are marked by particles placed after the nouns.[13] A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases, which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the sentence topic, the other representing the subject. The most important case markers are the following:

-   Nominative - (ga) for subject, (wa) for the topic
-   Genitive - (no)
-   Dative - (ni)
-   Accusative - (wo)
-   Lative - (e), used for destination direction (like in "to some place")
-   Ablative - (kara), used for source direction (like in "from some place")
-   Instrumental - (de)

Korean

Cases in Korean are marked by particles placed after the nouns, similar to Japanese. Like Japanese, the nominative case has two distinctions, one representing the topic of a sentence and the other the subject. In informal speech, nominative (이/가, 께서, and 에서) and accusative (을/를) particles are often omitted, while dative (에게) and ablative (에서) are shortened to simply 에, if the meaning of the sentence can easily be inferred from context. Most common case markers are the following:

-   Nominative - (i/ga) for the subject, (kkeseo) for the subject with being respectful, (eseo) for the subject of multitude or organism
-   Genitive - (ui; although transliterated as ui, nowadays it is pronounced the same as 에)
-   Dative - (ege), 한테 (hante)
-   Accusative - (eul/reul)
-   Lative - (e), used for destination direction (like in "to some place")
-   Ablative - (eseo), used for source direction (like in "from some place")
-   Instrumental - (ro/uro)
-   Vocative - (a/ya)

Latin

An example of a Latin case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Latin term for "cook," which belongs to Latin's second declension class.

-   (nominative) "[the] cook" [as a subject] (e.g. – the cook is standing there)

-   (genitive) "[the] cook's / [of the] cook" (e.g. – the cook's name is Claudius)

-   (dative) "[to/for the] cook" [as an indirect object] (e.g. – I gave a present to the cook)

-   (accusative) "[the] cook" [as a direct object] (e.g. – I saw the cook)

-   (ablative) "[by/with/from/in the] cook" [in various uses not covered by the above] (e.g. – I am taller than the cook: ablative of comparison)

-   (vocative) "[you] the cook" [addressing the object] (e.g. – I thank you, cook)

Latvian

Latvian nouns have seven grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative. The instrumental case is always identical to the accusative in the singular and to the dative in the plural. It is used as a free-standing case (without a preposition) only in highly restricted contexts in modern Latvian.

An example of a Latvian case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Latvian term for "man," which belongs to the first declension class.

-   Nominative:
-   Genitive:
-   Dative:
-   Accusative:
-   Instrumental:
-   Locative:
-   Vocative:

Lithuanian

In Lithuanian, only the inflection usually changes in the seven different grammatical cases:

-   Nominative (__): – – "This is a dog."
-   Genitive (__): – – "Tom took the dog's bone."
-   Dative (__): – – "He gave the bone to another dog."
-   Accusative (__): – – "He washed the dog."
-   Instrumental (__): – – He scared the cats with (using) the dog.
-   Locative (__): – – "We'll meet at the White Dog (Cafe)."
-   Vocative (__): – – "He shouted: Hey, dog!"

Malayalam

Vocative forms are given in parentheses after the nominative, as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds[14].

                 _SINGULAR_               _PLURAL_

Hungarian

Hungarian declension is relatively simple with regular suffixes attached to the vast majority of nouns. The following table lists a few of the many cases used in Hungarian.

+----------+------------------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------+

Romanian

Romanian is the only modern major Romance language with a case system for all nouns, whereas all other Romance languages dropped the cases for nouns replacing them by prepositions. An example of Romanian case inflection is given below, using the singular form of the word "boy":

-   (nominative) "(the) boy" [as a subject] (e.g. – the boy stayed home)

-   (accusative) "(the) boy" [as a direct object] (e.g. – I saw the boy last night)

-   (genitive) "(the) boy's / of a/the boy" (e.g. – the boy's bike broke down)

-   (dative) "to a/the boy" (e.g. – I gave the boy a gift)

-   (vocative) "Boy!" (e.g. – stay at home boy!)

Russian

An example of a Russian case inflection is given below (with explicit stress marks), using the singular forms of the Russian term for "sailor," which belongs to Russian's first declension class.

-   (nominative) "[the] sailor" [as a subject] (e.g. : The sailor is standing there)

-   (genitive) "[the] sailor's / [of the] sailor" (e.g. : The sailor's son is an artist)

-   (dative) "[to/for the] sailor" [as an indirect object] (e.g. : (They/Someone) gave a present to the sailor)

-   (accusative) "[the] sailor" [as a direct object] (e.g. : (I) see the sailor)

-   (instrumental) "[with/by the] sailor" [as a direct object] (e.g. : (I) have a friendship with the sailor)

-   (prepositional) "[about/on/in the] sailor" [as a direct object] (e.g. : (I) think about the sailor)

Up to ten additional cases are identified by linguists, although today all of them are either incomplete (do not apply to all nouns or do not form full word paradigm with all combinations of gender and number) or degenerate (appear identical to one of the main six cases). The most recognized additional cases are locative (), partitive (), and two forms of vocative — old () and neo-vocative (). Sometimes, so called count-form (for some countable nouns after numerals) is considered to be a sub-case. See details.

Sanskrit

Grammatical case was analyzed extensively in Sanskrit. The grammarian Pāṇini identified six semantic roles or _kāraka_,[15] which by default are related to the following eight Sanskrit cases in order:[16]

  Order    Default thematic role   English case   Example with राम (singular, dual, plural)
  -------- ----------------------- -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  Case 1   _Kartṛ_                 Nominative     रामः (rāmaḥ), रामौ (rāmau), रामाः (rāmāḥ)
  Case 2   _Karman_                Accusative     रामम् (rāmam), रामौ (rāmau), रामान् (rāmān)
  Case 3   _Karaṇa_                Instrumental   रामेण (rāmeṇa), रामाभ्याम् (rāmābhyām), रामैः (rāmaiḥ)
  Case 4   _Sampradāna_            Dative         रामाय (rāmāya), रामाभ्याम् (rāmābhyām), रामेभ्यः (rāmebhyaḥ)
  Case 5   _Apādāna_               Ablative       रामात् (rāmāt), रामाभ्याम् (rāmābhyām), रामेभ्यः (rāmebhyaḥ)
  Case 6   _Sambandha_             Genitive       रामस्य (rāmasya), रामयोः (rāmayoḥ), रामाणाम् (rāmāṇām)
  Case 7   _Adhikaraṇa_            Locative       रामे (rāme), रामयोः (rāmayoḥ), रामेषु (rāmeṣhu)
  Case 8   _Sambodhana_            Vocative       हे राम (he rāma), हे रामौ (he rāmau), हे रामाः (he rāmāḥ)

  : Sanskrit cases

For example, in the following sentence _leaf_ is the agent (_kartā_, nominative case), _tree_ is the source (_apādāna_, ablative case), and _ground_ is the locus (_adhikaraṇa_, locative case). The declensions are reflected in the morphemes _-āt_, _-am_, and _-au_ respectively.

  --------------- ----------- --------------- ----------
  _vṛkṣ-āt_       _parṇ-am_   _bhūm-au_       _patati_
  FROM the tree   a leaf      TO the ground   falls
  --------------- ----------- --------------- ----------

However, the cases may be deployed for other than the default thematic roles. A notable example is the passive construction. In the following sentence, _Devadatta_ is the _kartā_, but appears in the instrumental case, and _rice_, the _karman_, object, is in the nominative case (as subject of the verb). The declensions are reflected in the morphemes _-ena_ and _-am_.

  ---------------- ----------- -----------
  _devadatt-ena_   _odan-am_   _pacyati_
  BY Devadatta     the rice    is cooked
  ---------------- ----------- -----------

Assamese

Assamese has ten cases.

Tamil

The Tamil case system is analyzed in native and missionary grammars as consisting of a finite number of cases.[17][18] The usual treatment of Tamil case (Arden 1942)[19] is one in which there are seven cases: nominative (first case), accusative (second case), instrumental (third), dative (fourth), ablative (fifth), genitive (sixth), and locative (seventh). In traditional analyses, there is always a clear distinction made between post-positional morphemes and case endings. The vocative is sometimes given a place in the case system as an eighth case, but vocative forms do not participate in usual morphophonemic alternations and do not govern the use of any postpositions. Modern grammarians, however, argue that this eight-case classification is coarse and artificial[20] and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.[21]

Evolution

As languages evolve, case systems change. In early Ancient Greek, for example, the genitive and ablative cases became combined, giving five cases, rather than the six retained in Latin. In modern Hindi, the Sanskrit cases have been reduced to three: a direct case (for subjects and direct objects) and oblique case, and a vocative case.[22][23] In English, apart from the pronouns discussed above, case has vanished altogether except for the possessive/non-possessive dichotomy in nouns.

The evolution of the treatment of case relationships can be circular.[24] Adpositions can become unstressed and sound like they are an unstressed syllable of a neighboring word. A postposition can thus merge into the stem of a head noun, developing various forms depending on the phonological shape of the stem. Affixes can then be subject to various phonological processes such as assimilation, vowel centering to the schwa, phoneme loss, and fusion, and these processes can reduce or even eliminate the distinctions between cases. Languages can then compensate for the resulting loss of function by creating adpositions, thus coming full circle.

Recent experiments in agent-based modeling have shown how case systems can emerge and evolve in a population of language users.[25] The experiments demonstrate that language users may introduce new case markers to reduce the cognitive effort required for semantic interpretation, hence facilitating communication through language. Case markers then become generalized through analogical reasoning and reuse.


Linguistic typology

Morphosyntactic alignment

Languages are categorized into several case systems, based on their _morphosyntactic alignment_—how they group verb agents and patients into cases:

-   _Nominative–accusative_ (or simply _accusative_): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in the same case as the agent (subject) of a transitive verb; this case is then called the _nominative case_, with the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb being in the _accusative case_.
-   _Ergative–absolutive_ (or simply _ergative_): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in the same case as the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb; this case is then called the _absolutive case_, with the agent (subject) of a transitive verb being in the _ergative case_.
-   _Ergative–accusative_ (or _tripartite_): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in its own case (the _intransitive case_), separate from that of the agent (subject) or patient (direct object) of a transitive verb (which is in the ergative case or accusative case, respectively).
-   _Active–stative_ (or simply _active_): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb can be in one of two cases; if the argument is an _agent_, as in "He ate," then it is in the same case as the agent (subject) of a transitive verb (sometimes called the _agentive case_), and if it is a _patient_, as in "He tripped," then it is in the same case as the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb (sometimes called the _patientive case_).
-   _Trigger_: One noun in a sentence is the topic or focus. This noun is in the trigger case, and information elsewhere in the sentence (for example a verb affix in Tagalog) specifies the role of the trigger. The trigger may be identified as the agent, patient, etc. Other nouns may be inflected for case, but the inflections are overloaded; for example, in Tagalog, the subject and object of a verb are both expressed in the genitive case when they are not in the trigger case.

The following are systems that some languages use to mark case instead of, or in addition to, declension:

-   POSITIONAL: Nouns are not inflected for case; the position of a noun in the sentence expresses its case.
-   Adpositional: Nouns are accompanied by words that mark case.

Language families

-   With a few exceptions, most languages in the Uralic family make extensive use of cases. Finnish has 15 cases according to the traditional description (or up to 30 depending on the interpretation).[26] However, only 12 are commonly used in speech (see Finnish noun cases and Finnish locative system). Estonian has 14 (see Estonian locative system) and Hungarian has 18, both with additional archaic cases used for some words.
-   Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages also exhibit complex case systems. Since the abovementioned languages, along with Korean and Japanese, shared certain similarities, linguists proposed an Altaic family and reconstructed its case system; although the hypothesis had been largely discredited.
-   The Tsez language, a Northeast Caucasian language, has 64 cases.
-   The original version of John Quijada's constructed language Ithkuil has 81 noun cases,[27] and its descendent Ilaksh and Ithkuil after the 2011 revision both have 96 noun cases.[28][29]

The lemma form of words, which is the form chosen by convention as the canonical form of a word, is usually the most unmarked or basic case, which is typically the nominative, trigger, or absolutive case, whichever a language may have.
