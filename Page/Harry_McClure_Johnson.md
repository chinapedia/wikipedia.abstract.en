Military life


Life as a Lawyer


Alpine Club of Canada

As a life member of the Alpine Club of Canada he climbed Mount Robson, and Mount Assiniboine in the Canadian Rockies. In 1910 Harry McClure and his cousin Myra King Ellison and her father Price Ellison (Chief Commissioner of Lands) and 20 others went on as expedition to Vancouver Island in Canada with a goal to find a potential for a park in the island centre. The team left the town of Campbell River, British Columbia and travelled inland up the Campbell River to the Upper Campbell Lake. Later a party of nine scaled the Crown Mountain (Vancouver Island, British Columbia). Following the ascent, the party continued down Butte Lake in British Columbia, up to Price Creek and wound up at the Port Alberni. This expedition led to the 1911 opening of the first park in British Columbia called Strathcona Provincial Park.[2] On 7 August 1912 he and his cousin climbed Mount Little which is on the border between Alberta and British Columbia.[3] He took many photos of these mountains. He had a very good singing tenor voice. He rode horses in Oklahoma Valley, Vernon, British Columbia, and on his Uncle Price Ellison's Ranch.


His Death

He died at the age of 46 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he was visiting his mother (Elizabeth "Gaga" Breading Mcilvaine Johnson), from a sudden attack of influenza which developed into pneumonia.[4] His five children he had when he died were Mansi (almost 8 years old.), McClure (almost 7 years old), Elizabeth (5 yrs. 3 mos.), Sarah Jane (2 1/2 yrs.), and Priscilla (4 months old). His wife Helena Modjeska Chase Johnson, (who was then only 31 1/2 years old), remained a widow for over 33 years ( from 1932 till 1965). In his personal life Mr. Johnson's outstanding traits were his unyielding Integrity and his helpful and unfailing Loyalty to his friends.[5]
