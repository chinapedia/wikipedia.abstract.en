HYDE PARK ANGELS is a venture capital group founded in 2007 and based in Chicago, IL, which focuses on angel investments.[1][2][3]


Structure and application process

The Hyde Park Angels' approach to investing is "more like a traditional venture capital firm."[4]

The process is:

-   Companies are vetted and whittled down to about 75
-   Those 75 are brought before a screening committee
-   The screening committee signs off on select few after consulting internal Hyde Park Angels (HPA) subject matter experts
-   Companies deliver pitch to subsection of HPA
-   If selected, get to pitch before HPA
-   Investment status determined with investment coming from group rather than individuals
