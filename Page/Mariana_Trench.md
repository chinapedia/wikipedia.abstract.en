The MARIANA TRENCH or MARIANAS TRENCH[1] is located in the western Pacific Ocean about east of the Mariana Islands, and has the deepest natural trench in the world. It is a crescent-shaped trough in the Earth's crust averaging about long and wide. The maximum known depth is (± ) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep.[2] However, some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at .[3] By comparison: if Mount Everest were placed into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over under water.

At the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of , more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95.27 of any unit of volume of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 of those units at the surface. The temperature at the bottom is .[4]

The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not a perfect sphere; its radius is about smaller at the poles than at the equator.[5] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.

In 2009, the Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument.[6] Xenophyophores have been found in the trench by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at a record depth of below the sea surface.[7] Data has also suggested that microbial life forms thrive within the trench.[8][9]


Names

The Mariana Trench is named after the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.


Geology

The Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.

The movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.


Research history

The trench was first sounded during the _Challenger_ expedition in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of .[10] In 1877, a map was published called _Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans_ ("Deep map of the Great Ocean") by Petermann, which showed a _Challenger Tief_ ("Challenger deep") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of .[11]

In 1951, _Challenger II_ surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the _Challenger II_ measured a depth of at , known as the Challenger Deep.[12]

In 1957, the Soviet vessel reported a depth of at a location dubbed the _Mariana Hollow_.[13]

In 1962, the surface ship M.V. _Spencer F. Baird_ recorded a maximum depth of using precision depth gauges.

In 1984, the Japanese survey vessel _Takuyō_ (拓洋) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of , also reported as ±.[14] Remotely Operated Vehicle _KAIKO_ reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of on March 24, 1995.[15]

During surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[16]

On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water, mapping aboard the _RV Kilo Moana_ (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of . The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to ± ).[17][18]

In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to resolution.[19] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[20]

The Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as beneath the surface.[21]

Descents

_Trieste_ (designed by Auguste Piccard), the first manned vehicle to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench.[22]]]

Five descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe _Trieste_ which reached the bottom at 1:06 pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[23][24] Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy.[25] The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799 ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814 ft).[26] The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[27]

This was followed by the unmanned ROVs _Kaikō_ in 1996 and _Nereus_ in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of . The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel _Deepsea Challenger,_ diving to a depth of 10,908m.[28][29][30][31]

In July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure 7 miles under.[32] Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural sounds like earthquakes, a typhoon, and baleen whales along with _and_ man-made sounds such as boats.[33] Due to the mission's success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.

In April 2019 Victor Vescovo achieved a new record descent to 10,928 metres (35,849 ft.), and became the first person to dive the Challenger Deep twice[34].

Planned descents

, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[35] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[36]


Life

The expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about long,[37] and shrimp.[38] According to Piccard, "The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze".[39] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[40][41] During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaikō collected mud samples from the seabed.[42] Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.

In July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video cameras and lights to explore this region of the deep sea.

Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than , belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[43] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.

In December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of , breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.[44]

During the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge crustaceans known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[45]

In May 2017, an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of .[46]

Pollution

In 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from the range of 7,841–10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench[47]. Further research has found that amphipods also ingest microplastics with 100% of amphipods having at least one piece of synthetic material in their stomach.[48]

Victor Vescovo reported finding a plastic bag and candy wrappers at the bottom of the trench during his record-breaking dive in 2019, confirming that human-generated waste is capable of reaching the deepest parts of the ocean.[49]

In 2019, Scientific American reported that carbon-14 from nuclear bomb testing has been found in the bodies of aquatic animals found in the trench, one of the most inaccessible regions of the earth.[50]


Possible nuclear waste disposal site

Like other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal,[51][52] in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle, the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[53][54][55] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.[56]
