The KINGSLAND SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in Northeast Florida.[1] The line begins in Jacksonville at a junction with the A Line near Moncrief Yard. From there, it heads east and then turns north near Panama Park. From Panama Park, the Kingsland Subdivision heads north to Yulee on a discontinuous piece of CSX's S Line. In Yulee, the line connects with the First Coast Railroad, which operates north to Seals, Georgia on tracks that were previously part of the Kingsland Subdivision prior to 2005 (First Coast also operates from Yulee northeast to Fernandina Beach on tracks that were previously the Fernandina Subdivision).[2][3]


History

From Jacksonville to Panama Park, the line was originally the easternmost segment of the Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad which was built in 1899. In 1904, the Jacksonville and Southwestern Railroad became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which would merge with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1967.[4]

From Panama Park north, the line was built by the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, which was organized in 1874 and opened in 1881. The Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad would later became part of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (FC&P). FC&P would charter the Florida Northern Railroad to extend the line north of Yulee to Savannah, Georgia in 1894 to connect with the South Bound Railroad (which was absorbed by the FC&P in 1893). In 1900, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the line became Seaboard's main line.[5]

Seaboard Air Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad after merging with the Atlantic Coast Line in 1967. The merged company became the CSX Corporation in the 1980s. CSX designated the former Seaboard Air Line mainline as the S Line and initially designated this segment of the S Line as the EVERETT SUBDIVISION. CSX abandoned the line from Riceboro, Georgia to Seals, Georgia gradually from 1985 to 1986 and redesignated the remaining track as the Kingsland Subdivision.[6] CSX then leased the line from Yulee north to Seals (and the former Fernandina Subdivision) to the First Coast Railroad in 2005.[7]
