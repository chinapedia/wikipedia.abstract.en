Early life and background

Leigh v Macaulay

The case of _Leigh v Macaulay_ (20 February 1835) in which James Leigh, a son of William Henry Leigh, brought an action against Zachary Macaulay was a case in relation to equity and trusts and specifically to the estate of William Henry Leigh. James Leigh was represented by Mr. Simpkinson and the case reached the court of the Lord Chief Baron.[4]

Kenneth Macaulay, the executor of William Leigh's estate died indebted to Macaulay and Babington and this mercantile firm used the monies received from the goods from William Leigh's estate sent by Kenneth Macaulay towards the clearance of Kenneth Macaulay's debt. Macaulay and Babington also mixed the produce received from Kenneth Macaulay for their business with the produce sent by Kenneth Macaulay to be realised for William Henry Leigh's estate. It was ruled by the courts that Macaulay and Babington owed James Leigh the amount due from the proceeds of the estate and it was held that the money should be paid into court.


Descendants

William Henry Leigh had several children with his Nova Scotian Settler mistress and among his descendants are Leslie William Leigh and John Ernest Leigh, the former Sierra Leonean ambassador to the United States.
