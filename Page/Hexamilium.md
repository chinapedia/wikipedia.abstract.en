HEXAMILIUM was a Roman and Byzantine-era bishopric[1][2] possibly centered on Lysimachia, on the Gallipoli Peninsula in modern Turkey.[3][4][5]

It was located in the Roman province of Europa.[6] and was mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus[7] and was known in the Late Roman Empire.[8]

No bishops are known. It remains a vacant and titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.
