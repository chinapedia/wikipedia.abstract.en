VLADIMIR IGOREVICH GUREVICH (Russian: Владимир Игоревич Гуревич) is a prominent scientist, inventor and author in the field of Electrical Engineering with 15 books,[1] more than 200 journal papers[2] and over 100 patents[3] on the topic of relays.

V. I. Gurevich was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, in 1956. He received an M.S.E.E. degree (1978) at the Kharkiv Petro Vasylenko National Technical University of Agriculture, and a Candidate of Sciences (Ph.D.) degree, 1986, at the National Technical University Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute. His academic and professional career includes: assistant, associate, and full (honorary) professor at the Petro Vasylenko University, as well as the chief engineer and the director of Inventor, Ltd. He is currently employed as a Senior Electrical Engineering Expert by the Israel Electric Corporation.

V. I. Gurevich is the founder of a new kind of electrical relays called gerkotrones, also known as high voltage interface relays, which are used in control and protection circuits of high voltage (10-100 kV) high power equipment. He personally developed and supervised R&D of electrical and electronic devices for many military applications and also developed and organized production of many kinds of automatic devices and systems for industrial and power applications.

A significant part of Dr. Gurevich's work is also devoted to the problem of reliability of digital protective relays. In recent years, he has published dozens of papers and two books, wherein he discusses protection means of the electronic equipment of power plants and substations against intended destructive electromagnetic impacts (including electromagnetic pulse).

Dr. V. Gurevich is Expert of Technical Committee SC77C (High Power Transient Phenomena) with International Electrotechnical Commission - IEC (Standardization for protection civilian equipment, systems and installations from High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse - HEMP at nuclear detonations and from sources of Intentional Electromagnetic Interference - IEMI), Full Member of CIGRE WG C4.54 (Protection of high voltage power network control electronics from the High-altitude Electromagnetic Pulse - HEMP)
