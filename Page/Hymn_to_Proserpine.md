“HYMN TO PROSERPINE” is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in _Poems and Ballads_ in 1866. The poem is addressed to the goddess Proserpina, the Roman equivalent of Persephone, but laments the rise of Christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.[1]

The epigraph at the beginning of the poem is the phrase _Vicisti, Galilaee_, Latin for "You have conquered, O Galilean", the apocryphal dying words of the Emperor Julian. He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of Christianity by the Roman Empire. The poem is cast in the form of a lament by a person professing the paganism of classical antiquity and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of Christianity.[2] Lines 35 and 36 express this best:

  _Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;_ _We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death._

The line "Time and the Gods are at strife" inspired the title of Lord Dunsany's _Time and the Gods_.

The poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in Thomas Hardy's 1895 novel, _Jude the Obscure_ and also by Edward Ashburnham in Ford Madox Ford's _The Good Soldier_.
