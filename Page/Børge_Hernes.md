BØRGE HERNES (born 11 December 1976) is a retired Norwegian football defender.

He played youth football for Astor FK and SK Nationalkameratene before coming through the junior ranks of Rosenborg BK. He made his debut for the senior team in 1997, played in the Champions League and was touted as the next Vegard Heggem. However, when Nils Arne Eggen re-assumed the managerial position at Rosenborg in 1999, Hernes fell out of favour and was loaned to Vålerenga as a part-exchange with John Carew. Ahead of the 2001 season he joined another Oslo club, Skeid, but amid a financial meltdown in Skeid and his own injury problems, he retired in 2002.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
