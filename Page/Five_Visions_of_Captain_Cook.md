"FIVE VISIONS OF CAPTAIN COOK" (1931) is a poem by Australian poet Kenneth Slessor. It was originally published in the author's collection _Trio : A Book of Poems_, and later appeared in numerous poetry anthologies.[1]


Outline

The poem "builds the character of Captain James Cook from the reactions of those who sailed with him on his three major voyages."[2]


Reviews

In the essay "Kenneth Slessor : An Essay in Interpretation" (1997) A. K. Thompson noted: "The more carefully we read Cook's Journals the more impressive and convincing Slessor's reconstruction becomes and also the more unlikely it appears that Slessor was attempting to depict himself. Slessor also displays his great skill in marshalling the material that seems to him significant and it must be pointed out, especially in Slessor's case, that this marshalling and handling of significant material needs both skill and intelligence."[3]

_The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature_ stated that the poem was "Full of memorable lines that attest to Slessor's delight in language..and demonstrates that men who change the face of the world inevitably change the lives of those who associate with them."[4]
