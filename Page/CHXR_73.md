CHXR 73 is a star in the constellation Chamaeleon, about 620 light-years away from Earth.[1][2]

The star is located within Cha I, a molecular cloud.[3] It has a low temperature of 3,490 K typical of red dwarfs, but unlike typical red dwarfs it has an unusually large radius of â€”this is because of its young age, only 8 million years.[4] A companion, CHXR 73 b, has been found via direct imaging. CHXR 73 has a mass of about 12 Jupiters.[5] This is close to the upper mass limit for planets, making its classification difficult.
