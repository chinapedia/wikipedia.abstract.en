NICHOLAS BENTON (born 29 June 1991) is an Australian cricketer.[1] He made his List A debut for South Australia in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup on 2 October 2016.[2]


Career

Benton made his first-class debut for South Australia in the final match of the 2014–15 Sheffield Shield season, taking four wickets and scoring 33 not out against Queensland. This earned him his first SACA contract, officially joining the South Australian squad for the 2015–16 season.[3] He played three Sheffield Shield matches in the 2015–16 season, across which he took six wickets,[4] and the highlight of his season came in a match against Western Australia. Benton dislocated his shoulder in a fielding mishap on the first day of the match, meaning he was unable to bowl for the rest of the match,[5] with later scans showing the damage was severe enough that he couldn't play for the rest of the season.[6] In the last innings South Australia needed seven runs to win and keep their season alive when the ninth wicket fell, and Benton was the only player yet to bat. Benton fought through his injury and scored the winning runs with a mishit through the slips.[7]

Benton was in South Australia's one-day squad for the first time in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, making his List A debut against Western Australia.[8]
