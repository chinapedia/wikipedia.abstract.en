Career

Writer

Amy is a native of Toronto.[10] She has written for The Daily Beast, National Geographic, Discovery News, Scientific American, Ars Technica, and Al Jazeera English.[11][12]

Her first book which was based on her research for her master's degree thesis, _Breaking the Chains of Gravity_ (Bloomsbury 2015), tells the story of America's nascent space program.[13][14] It was her debut book and _Kirkus Reviews_ called it a "must-read for anyone interested in the early history of space exploration."[15] _Booklist_ called it a "fine authorial debut."[16] The book describes the early pioneers of rockets in the late 1920s, up to the formation of NASA.[17]

As a Jewish writer, she says she came into a difficult problem writing about her childhood hero Wernher von Braun, who was a Nazi and a member of the SS, stating: "This was a matter of getting history right, which is something I'm very passionate about, but I also had to be careful not to incur the wrath of my family."[18]

Video and other media

She is a co-host for the Discovery Channel's online DNews channel.[19] According to _The Sydney Morning Herald_, the popularity of her YouTube channel "has also resulted in her becoming something of a go-to girl for science shows on mainstream television."[20] She also hosts a weekly show on her own YouTube channel, _Vintage Space_, as well as hosting a weekly podcast of the same name, both of which delve into the history of space flight around the world.
