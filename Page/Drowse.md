DROWSE is the musical project of American musician and producer Kyle Bates. Based in Portland, Oregon, Bates founded the project in 2013 and released the debut album, _Soon Asleep_, in 2015.

Bates collaborates with other musicians during his home recordings and live shows.


History

Before forming Drowse, Bates played in local bands and recorded music on his laptop.[1] In 2011 Bates experienced a dissociative mental breakdown that would inform the first few Drowse releases.[2] In 2013 he released an EP, _Songs to Sleep On_ through Television Records and began performing live with help from various Portland musicians.[3][4]

Drowse released its debut album _Soon Asleep_ through Apneic Void Sounds in 2015.[5] The album featured Portland based singer Tuesday Faust.[6] Following the release of _Soon Asleep_, Drowse recorded music that was contributed to Miserable's 2016 album, _Uncontrollable_.[7]

In 2016 Drowse released an EP titled _Memory Bed_ through New York based label The Native Sound.[8] _Memory Bed_ featured vocal and lyrical collaborations with Maya Stoner.[9]

Drowse signed to The Flenser to release sophomore album _Cold Air_ in 2018.[10] Directly after the release Bates became an artist in residence in Skagaströnd, Iceland, resulting in new work including _Fog Storm pts. 1-4_, released as a split with Planning For Burial.[11]

_Light Mirror_, Drowse's second album for The Flenser, was announced for release in 2019–it features material recorded in Iceland and at home[12]. Drowse has shared the stage with a wide range of musical acts, including Planning for Burial and King Woman.[13]


Musical style

Drowse derives influence from multiple genres and has been labeled "drone-pop",[14] "shoegaze/drone",[15] and "dream pop."[16] Vice described the project's sound as "the aural equivalent of blood rushing back to a sleeping limb"[17] and likened it to a "post-black metal take on" English shoegazing band Slowdive and Texas post-rock band Explosions in the Sky.[18] Spin writer Matt Malone noted that "Drowse prioritizes music over lyrics, using vocals not to tell a story as much as add an instrumental layer to the music's soothing fog."[19] A.V. Club critic Brian Shultz characterized the project's sound as "breathy, entrancing, and certainly a little bit eerie."[20] Cris Lankenau, writing for Willamette Week, compared Drowse to other Pacific Northwest musical acts Mount Eerie and Grouper.[21] Lars Gotrich from NPR reinforced the comparison, saying "Drowse [...] sounds like an intimate Mount Eerie home recording overdubbed with a worn-out cassette of The Cure's _Disintegration_."[22]
