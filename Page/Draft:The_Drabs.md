THE DRABS is an American rock band from San Diego, California led by composer, guitarist, and lead vocalist David Bernat. The band was formalized in 2005 when Bernat met drummer Scotty Myers in Carlsbad California, thus comprising the 2 founding members. The band self describes as playing "slack rock/clandestine pop".

The Drabs have officially released two commercial recordings, a full length debut LP entitled _PONTO_ in 2012, and a holiday themed EP entitled _HERE COMES THE JOY_ in 2015.

The band remains active playing live shows as of 2018, and has hinted that a new full length LP is projected for release in 2020. Recording projected to begin mid-2019.


History

Formation

Bernat's catalog of original compositions were worked up during practice sessions at Myers' home in Carlsbad, California, with the duo utilizing friends as available on bass guitar including Noah Sugarman of the band 500 Miles to Memphis and Chris Torres of The Grass Heat. Demo tracks were recorded by Bernat, Myers, and Torres in 2006 at Sven Erik Seaholm's Kitsch & Sync Production home based studio in San Diego with CD-R hand labeled and numbered copies (rumored to 100) dispersed. The 4 demo tracks would later be re-recorded for inclusion on the band's official debut LP. Myers re-located to join family in Michigan in 2008, prior to the founding duo ever formally performing the band's earliest compositions live to a general public audience.

_Ponto_

With the departure of drummer Myers in 2008, Myers' brother-in-law Michael C. Stone (of The Grass Heat) joined on drums, and live shows began shortly thereafter with a line-up of Bernat, Torres, and Stone. Nine songs, inclusive of re-recordings of the 4 original demos, were tracked in 2010 at Big Fish Recording Studio in Encinitas, California and eventually released in March 2012 as the band's debut LP under the title _Ponto_. The debut LP received favorable local reviews, including within the San Diego CityBeat.[1]

_Here Comes the Joy_

Bernat and Stone continued when Torres' participation with The Drabs paused in 2010 due to other music pursuits and commitments inclusive of joining the touring band of American Idol winner Kris Allen. Steve Clark joined as bassist after responding to one of the band's Craig's List advertisements. The band entered Signature Sound recording studio towards the end of 2014 and initiated recordings for a Christmas themed EP. Additional recording was completed at Singing Serpent Studios located in the Kensington, San Diego neighborhood. Entitled _Here Comes the Joy_, the holiday EP was released in November 2015, features 4 original songs, plus contributions from guest musicians A.J. Croce, and 3 time San Diego Music Awards winner Gayle Skidmore. Compared to the local coverage received on the band's debut LP _ponto_, _Here Comes the Joy_ drew positive coverage from across the U.S. and within Europe.[2][3][4][5][6]
