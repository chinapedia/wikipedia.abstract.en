The Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum.[6] The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017.[7][8] The I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria,[9][10] and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018.[11]

Some of the electric drive technology has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme,[12] and the concentric motors were developed by JLR engineer Dr. Alex Michaelides.[13]
