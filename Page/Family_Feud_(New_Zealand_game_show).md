_FAMILY FEUD_ was a New Zealand game show based on the American show of the same name. It began airing on Three on 15 February 2016. It is hosted by comedian Dai Henwood, and aired Mondays to Fridays at 5:30pm. The set and logo is almost identical to the 2014 Australian version; it is filmed in Epsom. The winning family plays Fast Money for $5,000, and winners of five nights in a row win a brand new car.

On _All-Star Family Feud_, six rounds would be played with the fourth and fifth questions being worth double points and the last question being worth triple points. Each team's charity or charities would receive a donation of $2,000. Each Fast Money point donated $10 and scoring 200 points still added $5,000 to any money won.

On 8 December 2017 it was announced the show had been cancelled as the host, Dai Henwood, would be too busy hosting a renewed season of _Dancing with the Stars_ in 2018.[1][2]
