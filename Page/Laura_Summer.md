Regarding her role in _The Real Ghostbusters_, she was interviewed concerning the role, and the interview was included in the DVD set put out by Time/Life, _The Real Ghostbusters: Complete Collection_.[3][4] She was replaced on _The Real Ghostbusters_ due to some groups complaining that her characterization was too edgy and sexy for young girls.[5]

In 2007, Summers was part of the creative team, along with Jim Vallely and Maggie Row, who created the "The Hollywood Father/Daughter Purity Ball", a parity of a purity ball.[6] From 2008 through 2013, Summers had a recurring role on the animated _The Garfield Show_, where she played the dual roles of twins Druisilla and Minerva.
