is a 2014 Japanese black comedy supernatural horror film directed by Takashi Miike. It is based on the first arc of the manga series of the same name by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and Akeji Fujimura. Funimation will release the film in the United States.[1]


Plot

High school student Shun Takahata spends much of his time playing violent video games. One morning at school he whines that his life is completely boring but then he suddenly finds himself forced to participate in a game of Daruma-san ga koronda with death as the penalty for losing. When the Daruma doll turns toward the blackboard it exposes a button on its back that the students can attempt to press to end the game but if the doll spins back around and sees anyone moving then those students' heads will explode. Everyone in the class except Shun dies in this first game.

After the game, Shun finds his childhood friend Ichika Akimoto and they make their way to the school gym. There they play a Maneki Neko, where students dressed as mice attempt to throw a ball into a hoop attached to the collar of a giant cat doll, while trying not to be eaten or crushed by the cat doll. The game was won with the aid of Takeru Amaya, a troubled classmate who seems to revel in the opportunity to see so many deaths, and who kills all the other survivors except Shun and Ichika after winning the game. The three of them are then put out of consciousness by the sleeping gas released by the giant cat doll. They wake up to find themselves with other students in a room inside a giant cube hovering Tokyo, facing the next test: students all over Japan and elsewhere in the world face similar tests, and the handful of survivor are being brought inside other cubes.

The next game is Kokeshi, where the students have to be blindfolded and guess which of four floating Kokeshi wooden dolls is behind them within 10 seconds after the end of a short song. If they fail to do so, they will be hit with a red laser and the dolls will use telekinesis to destroy their bodies. If the Kokeshi lose, they will explode and one of them releases an answer key which opens the doors and frees the students to the next level. Shun meets and saves Shoko Takase by winning the game, and they reunite with Ichika and another student, whom they save from being killed by a fifth Kokeshi by holding their hands.

The four join two other students to the next level, where they have to use their keys to unlock a giant smiling head. Amaya brings in three more keys and kills a prisoner that he brought into the room. The seven survivors use their keys, and the giant head rolls away to dig a tunnel into the next room. Meanwhile, each player is displayed on television screens for the others to see.

The next game is Shirokuma, a white bear that appears to them inside a frozen room. The students have to all answer the white bear's questions honestly, otherwise they will be forced to single out the one that they suspect to be lying to be killed. Shoko and another friend get killed, and Shun soon realizes that it is the bear who is the liar and that its real color is black, therefore winning the game and surviving with the other four students.

The final game, presented by a Matryoshka doll, is a game of kick the can that must be completed before sundown. The remaining five each pick a stick, and who gets the red one plays the ″Devil″. Whoever gets the face shown or seen by the Devil, is caught and thrown into a cell. Kicking the can in the middle will make it explode, killing nearby players. Takeru got the red stick and soon three students are caught while Shun find armor to conceal his face. Shun falls into the sea while chaining Takeru to the armor: as Takeru fights to pull the armor up to avoid being pulled down, Shun climbs back up, having freed himself from the armor. Both race towards the can, and Shun succeeds in kicking the can first, thereby winning the game. The Matryoshka doll reveals that in fact the explosion is a lie and that none of them will be killed by losing the game. They have an popsicle party, where they learn their fates on the wooden stick, and that the intention of the last game were simply for entertainment. Shun and Takeru live while Ichika and the other two are killed by a Matryoshka doll with lasers that disintegrated them. Shun and Takeru emerge to the top of the cube, where they see crowds cheer for them, while a hikikomori, who have been watching them from his room, goes out of his house, possibly to find the real identity of "God".

Takeru celebrates while Shun kneels in despair from all of his losses, stating that "there is no God". One of the Matryoshka dolls corrects him and suggests that those deadly games were to lead them to "God", as it shows him a vagrant who was also an observer of those games.
