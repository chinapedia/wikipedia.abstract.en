The FIELD ELM cultivar _ULMUS MINOR_ 'MONUMENTALIS', THE TOMB ELM (GRABMAL-RÜSTER),[1] was raised as a sucker of _U. suberosa_ by Sebastian Rinz, the city gardener of Frankfurt, and described as _U. campestris_ var. _monumentalis_ Rinz, 'Pyramid Field Elm', by Kirchner (1864), who said it had only recently been propagated by Rinz and established in the nursery.[2] It was distributed from the 1880s by the Baudriller nursery, Angers,[3] and by the Späth nursery, Berlin, as _U. campestris monumentalis_ Rinz., appearing separately in their catalogues from _U. minor_ 'Sarniensis', the Guernsey or Wheatley Elm,[4][5][6] with which, according to Henry, it was confused on the continent.[7] Krüssmann, for example, gives 'Monumentalis' as a synonym of 'Sarniensis'.[8] 'Sarniensis' is known as _monumentaaliep_ [:monumental elm] in The Netherlands.[9][10] Springer noted that the Dutch _monumentaaliep_ was "not the actual _monumentaaliep_ (_U. glabra_ Mill var. _monumentalis_ Rinz) but _U. glabra_ Mill. _var._ Wheatleyi Sim. Louis", and that it "should be renamed _U. glabra_ Mill. var. _monumentalis_ Hort. (non Rinz)".[11] In England, Smith's of Worcester listed _Ulmus monumentalis_ separately from _Ulmus_ 'Wheatley' in the 1880s.[12]

Rinz gave his tree the name 'Monumentalis' for its columnar form,[13] and (according to Beissner) because the parent tree stood near the Monument of the Landgrave of Hesse (Hessenmonument) on the former glacis, which is now (1889) located in the city at Frankfurt.[14] The German name 'Tomb Elm' may have arisen from the tree's similarity in form to cypress, a burial-ground tree in parts of Europe.


Description

Kirchner (1864) described 'Monumentalis' as a pyramidal field elm with a few upright main branches and numerous weak, short side-branches. The small, very rough leaves form a dark green foliage "that appears to hug the trunk".[15] 'Monumentalis' was described by Beissner (1904) as a columnar form of suberose field elm with short, crowded, contorted branches and dense, often twisted black-green leaves, a tree of "a very peculiar monstrous appearance".[16] Rinz reported that tree did not grow tall.[17] Henry described it as "a columnar tree with a few upright main branches and numerous short twigs bearing dense crowded dark green leaves".[18][19] Späth's catalogue likewise described the tree as having a dense upright shape.[20]

Heike in _Die Gartenkunst_ (1908) described 'Monumentalis' as "strictly pyramidal", and 'Wheatleyi' ('Sarniensis') as "similar, but [with] a wider, loose crown and pale green foliage." [21]


Pests and diseases

Field Elm cultivars are susceptible to Dutch elm disease, but, if not grafted, often survive through root-sucker regrowth. Chevalier noted (1942) that 'Monumentalis' Rinz was one of four European cultivars found by researchers in The Netherlands to have significant resistance to the earlier strain of Dutch elm disease prevalent in the 1920s and '30s, the others being 'Exoniensis', 'Berardii' and 'Vegeta'. The four were rated less resistant than _U. foliacea_ clone 23, from Spain, later cultivated as 'Christine Buisman'.[22]


Cultivation

No examples are known, but a non-grafted field elm cultivar would be expected to survive through root-suckering. One tree was planted in 1893 as _U. campestris monumentalis_ at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada.[23] Three specimens were supplied by Späth to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) in 1902 as _U. campestris monumentalis_. One was planted in the garden proper (see 'Putative specimens'); the other two, or regrowth from them, may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm);[24] the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden _per se_ does not list the plant.[25]

_U. campestris monumentalis_ appeared separately from _U. campestris sarniensis_ in the early 20th-century catalogue of the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk.[26] Introduced to the USA, it appeared in the 1904 catalogue of Kelsey's, New York, and in the 1909 catalogue of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey, in separate entries from Wheatley Elm, as _U. monumentalis_, 'Monumental Elm', "a small variety, slow and dense of growth".[27][28]

Putative specimens

A suckering, narrow-pyramidal or columnar elm resembling a wild cypress (about 11 m), with dense upright branching and small dark-green leaves, that stood on the azalea lawn in RBGE till the 1990s,[29] may have been one of Späth's three 1902 'Monumentalis'. Melville renamed it _U. carpinifolia_ × _U. plotii_ × _U. glabra_ in 1958.[30]

The leaves were pilose above and rather distorted, the lower surface with a zone of dense hair towards the base of the midrib.[31] The tree was one of the first RBGE elms into leaf.

A stand of young, narrow, dense-foliaged suckering field elm, with 'Monumentalis'-like leaves, below the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill, Edinburgh (2018), may be regrowth from one of the specimens from Späth. Calton Hill was described by Robert Louis Stevenson as "a hill of monuments", a sobriquet perhaps relevant to the planting-location of this cultivar.[32]
