SANTA MARIA DEL SOCCORSO is a Roman Catholic church located in Via della Croce #8 the historic center of the town of Petriolo, province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.


History

The church with a decorative brick façade was originally called _Santa Maria e San Basso_, because it encompassed two earlier churches. The church was rebuilt between the 13th and 18th centuries. It houses a 15th-century fresco of an _Enthroned Madonna and Child_ attributed to Lorenzo d’Alessandro. A 17th-century canvas depicting a _Madonna del Suffragio_ was painted for the church of that name.[1]
