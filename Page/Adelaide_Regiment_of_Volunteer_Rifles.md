The ADELAIDE REGIMENT OF VOLUNTEER RIFLES was formed in 1860 after the formation of a number of volunteer rifle companies in 1859. These companies were raised for the same reasons and in the same fashion as the Volunteer Force in Great Britain, but with a South Australian twist. The initial Act upon which formation of the Regiment was based was Act No. 2 of 1854, entitled "An Act to organize and establish a Volunteer Military Force in South Australia".

In May 1860, the Regiment was raised, to consist of the following 20 individual rifle companies:

-   - Port Adelaide Rifles
-   - First Adelaide Rifles
-   - Glenelg Rifles
-   - Glen Osmond Rifles
-   - Mitcham Rifles
-   - Adelaide Rifles
-   - Adelaide Marksmen
-   - West Adelaide Rifles
-   - Sturt and Brighton Rifles
-   - Edward's Town Rifles
-   - Eastern Suburban Rifles
-   - Kent Rifles
-   - Alberton and Queenstown Rifles
-   - Kensington and Norwood Rifles
-   - Brighton Rifles
-   - Munno Para East Rifles
-   - First Gawler Rifles
-   - Second Gawler Rifles
-   - Salisbury Rifles and
-   - Smithfield Rifles[1]

In February 1865 the Hindmarsh Rifle company was added to the Regiment.[2]

Under Act No. 18 of 1865, the "Volunteer Act 1865-66", the Regiment was re-organised. Companies, although still organised by location, were numbered.
