_THE BEST MAN_ is the third mini-album by South Korean recording artist Wheesung. It was released on May 12, 2014, under YMC Entertainment and distributed by KT Music. The record is the first release following the completion of his military service.

Following a series of photo and video teasers, _The Best Man_ and the lead single "Night and Day" were simultaneously released; the mini-album debuted and peaked at number four on the Gaon Album Chart. Wheesung promoted the record on music chart programs across television networks by performing the single, which earned him one music show win on MBC Music's _Show Champion_.


Background

Wheesung was subject to conscription in South Korea and enlisted for military service on November 7, 2011.[1] As 2012 came to a close, it was reported that he became subject to an investigation for abusing propofol. The Chuncheon District Prosecutor`s Office denied summoning Wheesung to investigate any substance abuse.[2] Shortly before completing his service, Wheesung was hospitalized after sustaining spinal disc herniation and developing alopecia areata. In midst of his stay, he utilized his mobile phone without permission; he spent three days in military prison for breaching regulations.[3] He completed his service and discharged on August 9, 2013.[4]


Music structure

Musically, _The Best Man_ is an R&B record.[5] It opens with "Best Man", a "rhythmical" track where he sings his desires as a man as opposed to a singer. "I Like the Song" begins with the tune of a "tranquil" piano.[6] "Night and Day" is an R&B and pop song accompanied by an electric guitar.[7][8] "Lying Beside You" describes the "fluttering" feeling of loving a woman. Previously released two years prior, "A Masterpiece Called You" was remastered for inclusion on the mini-album; Wheesung creates a "romantic atmosphere" and utilizes a figure of speech to describe the "masterpiece" of loving a person. A breakup song, "I Don't Want to Know" details the feeling of loneliness. "I Need to Make Money" is a slow-tempo track where Wheesung reveals his concern of earning profit as a musician.[9]


Release and promotion

On March 31, 2014, it was revealed that Wheesung was scheduled to release a mini-album in May.[10] The release date announced was May 12, two years and five months since _They Are Coming_ (2011).[11] It was unclear if Wheesung would pursue a promotional cycle for _The Best Man_ in light of the sinking of MV _Sewol_ the previous month.[12]

A "night version" photo teaser for _The Best Man_ was revealed on May 8.[13] A "day version" was posted on the following day.[14] The music video teaser for "Night and Day", which features cameos by Yura of Girl's Day and C.A.P of Teen Top, was uploaded on the next day.[15] The mini-album and the music video for the lead single were simultaneously released on May 12.[16]

Wheesung began promoting "Night and Day" by performing the song on weekly music chart shows upon release.[17] He first performed on MBC Music's _Show Champion_, the program's first episode to resume regular broadcasting following the _Sewol_ incident.[18] He followed up with a performance on Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) _Inkigayo_.[19] The following week, Wheesung ranked first on _Show Champion_, which earned the single its first and only music show win.[20] He continued performing the following days on Mnet's _M Countdown_[21] and Arirang's _Simply K-Pop_.[22]


Critical reception

Writing for online magazine _IZM_, Kim Ban-ya rated _The Best Man_ three and a half stars out of five, complimenting "Night and Day" for its "grandeur" and "dramatic" rise in scale.[23] Also rating the mini-album three stars out of five, Oh Lee of Rhythmer felt that Wheesung accomplished to "upgrade" himself, describing the album as a reflection of the singer due to the "personal sensitivity" of the lyrics.[24] Jung Hae-wook of News Tomtato gave the musicality of the record a full five stars, while awarding it three for its appeal and experimentation. He named "I Need to Make Money" the best track on the record aside from the lead single.[25]


Commercial performance

On the chart dated May 11â€“17, 2014, _The Best Man_ debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart.[26] By the end of the month, the mini-album sold 6,102 copies in South Korea.[27]
