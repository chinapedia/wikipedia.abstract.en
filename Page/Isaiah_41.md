Verse 2

    _"Who has stirred up one from the east ...?"_[2]

J. Skinner, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, describes this reference as "unquestionably" pointing to Cyrus.[3] The Amplified Bible and the Jerusalem Bible both specify Cyrus here.[4] However, some Jewish exegetes have applied the verse to Abraham; Reformation theologian John Calvin makes the same connection:

    _[The prophet] mentions Abraham; for he might have enumerated other works of God, but selected an example appropriate to his subject; for ... Abraham, whom God had brought out of Chaldea ..._[5]


Verse 10

    _Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God:_

        _I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness._[6]

This verse has inspired many well-known hymns, among them:[7]

-   How Firm a Foundation

-   The Right Hand of God

-   Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah

-   Just a Closer Walk with Thee


Verse 13

    _For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee._[8]

This verse has inspired many well-known hymns, among them:[9]

-   Precious Lord, Take My Hand
-   He Leadeth Me
-   Lead Me, Guide Me


Verse 14

    _Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob_ [10]

John Wycliffe's translation, "worm of Jacob", uses the appositive genitive syntax. There is no reference to the worm in the Septuagint version:

    _Fear not, Jacob, and thou Israel few in number._[11]
