VALDEMAR ANDERSEN (3 February 1875 – 15 July 1928 in Copenhagen) was a Danish painter, illustrator, graphic designer and decorative artist. He is today best known as a poster artist.

In the 1900s, he was influenced by art nouveau. He later developed a simple, clean and personal style which combined advertisement with a more artistic expression.

Illustrations, posters and stamps

Andersen began his career as illustrator by drawing portraits for a stereotype workshop working for provincial newspapers. He was associated with the magazine _Klokken 12_ from its foundation in 1902, creating its daily poster. He soon began to receive commissions from Ernst Bojesen at Gyldendalske Boghandel (Nordisk Forlag), culminating with the illustration of Carit Etlar's works (1905–06) and _Feltlægens Historier_ by Zacharias Topelius (1906–08).[1]

He also worked for magazines such as Klods-Hans, Blæksprutten, Politikens Magasin and Berlingske Tidende Sunday.

He illustrated numerous books in the 1920s and also created book covers.
