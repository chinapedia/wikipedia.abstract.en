BMW-FIZ_(Muenchen).JPG The BMW GROUP FORSCHUNGS- UND INNOVATIONSZENTRUM (BMW FIZ) is the main engineering and development campus of the BMW Group. It is located in Milbertshofen-Am Hart, a district in northern Munich.

About 20,000 engineers and workers are developing cars as well as motorcycles on a 500,000 m² area spread out across several areas and buildings.[1][2]

Since October 2017, the BMW FIZ was extended by the BMW Autonomous Driving Campus, located in Unterschleißheim about 13 km north of the main FIZ campus.[3] There, BMW intends to colocate all BMW engineers working on autonomous driving capabilities in the cooperation with Intel.
