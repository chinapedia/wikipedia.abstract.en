BENN GILBERT KAMOTO (born 14 June 1990), better known by his stage name GEMINI MAJOR, is a Malawian-born South African record producer and singer-songwriter. He was signed to Family Tree Records, a South African independent record label.[1]


Early life and career

Gemini Major finished high school in 2007 and graduated in I.T. in 2009. In the same year, he moved to Durban, South Africa to pursue his dream as an artist and record producer.[2]

He has produced for a number of artists in a variety of genres including R&B, hip-hop, house, dancehall, pop and gospel. His portfolio includes production used in TV shows such as _Gold Diggers_, _Forever Young_ and _Mo Love_.[3]

In 2013 he moved to Johannesburg. After a chance meeting with Cassper Nyovest and his team at a video shoot for a song that Major had produced, he joined the Family Tree team. After the release of Nasty C's hit single "Juice Back", Major has become the go-to producer for some of South Africa's leading hip hop artists.[4]

In 2015 Major was nominated for Producer of the Year at the South Africa Hip Hop Awards alongside South Africa's best hip hop producers such as Anatii, Riky Rick, Ganja Beats and Tweezy.[5][6]

He released a new single, "Church" on 28 September 2017.[7]
