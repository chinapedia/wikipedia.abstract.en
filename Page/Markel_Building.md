The MARKEL BUILDING is an office building commissioned by the Markel Corporation and designed by Haig Jamgochian[1][2] located on Markel Road just outside the city limits of Richmond, Virginia in Henrico County. The building was inspired by a baked potato wrapped in foil served to Jamgochian while attending an American Institute of Architects' dinner. Each floor consists of a single piece of 555-foot aluminum, they are the longest unbroken pieces of aluminum ever used as siding material.[3]

In 2009, Digital Journal declared the Markel Building to be one of "The World's 10 Ugliest Buildings"[4] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places 2017.
