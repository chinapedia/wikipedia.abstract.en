Plot

In flashback Gigi as a boy is running from the police and his own father threatens to release attack dogs on him.

Introduced to Bibi after a motor racing event Gigi pretends he works importing and exporting cars, and asks her out on a date. As their relationship continues, comments from his friends about their wild youth and his time in juvenile dentention raise her suspicions. In a private moment Bibi asks him to reveal his greatest secret and Gigi jokingly admits he robs banks. They daydream about travel and when asked if she could go anywhere Bibi suggests that should go to Buenos Aires. Gigi and his friends successfully rob a banker they met at party held by Bibi's racing group. Gigi is falling in love with Bibi and is reluctant to do any further jobs. Bibi's father has suspicions too and confronts Gigi, urging him to be honest with Bibi like a real man should do. Gigi tells him he wants to marry Bibi. Bibi has a growing realisation that Gigi isn't telling her the whole truth but they confess their love for each other.

The gang plan another more elaborate heist, and as their getaway driver Gigi is essential to their plans. The gang drop a shipping container off a road bridge, to trap a money transport van and police escort. They get away with the money but Gigi is sick with nerves. The money is booby trapped with explosives and one of the gang is badly injured. Gigi leaves the hideout to call a doctor from a nearby payphone. He also calls Bibi and she warns him that police officers were killed in the robbery and that a major manhunt was underway and for her sake he should not resist. The gang is caught and all are sent to prison. Bibi is sure of her love and wants to stay with Gigi so during brief prison visits they try to get pregnant. They turn to fertility treatment to try to conceive, but while on temporary leave from prison Gigi is bitten on the leg by a small dog. After kicking the dog in retaliation the police get involved and Gigi runs in panic. Bibi hides him temporarily but when a police manhunt begins she convinces him to give himself up and return to prison.

Medical tests reveal that instead of a baby, Bibi has cancer growing in her ovaries. Desperate she turns to gangsters to help her break Gigi out of prison. The gangsters think she is suffering from morning sickness and decline to help her. Their boss goes to meet her and sees she has been ravaged by chemotherapy, when she admits she has an aggressive cancer and wants Gigi broken out of prison only if she dies, and the boss agrees, taking her Porsche as collateral. As he leaves, Bibi collapses and is taken to hospital. Gigi has been told nothing about her plans to break him out and has been trying to break out himself. Gigi is allowed to leave prison under heavy guard and visit Bibi in hospital, but she has already fallen into a coma, and dies.

Prisoners explain to Gigi that a breakout has been arranged, and there is a plan to smuggle him to Buenos Aires. To confirm it is real they say the words "No flowers" echoing the request Bibi made on their first date. They savagely beat him, forcing the prison warden to transfer him to another prison for his protection, and during the transport they break him out. Gigi does not want to go to Buenos Aires, he only wants to be with Bibi. The gangsters don't tolerate this since their payout is tied to Gigi's arrival in Buenos Aires. As punishment, they lock him in a cage in a warehouse full of dogs. When they come back to retrieve him, he attacks with a chain and kills his kidnappers.

He finds Bibi's Porsche and drives along a route she had driven before. In voiceover, we hear the scene from earlier in the film where Bibi and Gigi discuss their biggest secrets, Bibi's reveals her secret: she is immortal. Gigi drives to a cemetery and leaves the car running as he runs in to meet her.
