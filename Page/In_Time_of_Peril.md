_IN TIME OF PERIL_ is a painting by the English painter Edmund Leighton. The subject does not appear to represent any specific historical subject, but an invented incident from the Middle Ages where a young boy and a baby are in flight with their mother, a soldier or father, and chests and bundles of treasures, and arrive at a monastery.[1][2]

_In Time of Peril_ was exhibited in the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1897. It was later bought by the Mackelvie Trust, and placed in the Auckland Art Gallery, where it quickly became one of the most popular pictures in the Gallery, copied by generations of Auckland's art students. As with many other art galleries in Australia and New Zealand founded in the later nineteenth century, Auckland's collection is particularly rich in late Victorian and Edwardian academic paintings.[3]
