The WEST INDIES YACHT CLUB is a Yacht Club located on Old Harbour, St Catherine, Jamaica. Founded in 1885.[1] The Club is home of the second largest Caribbean fleet of classic sailing vessels (built before 1939). It has about 360 members (Dec 2015).[2] It is also the home of one of the largest marine photographs collection in the world, dating from the early days of the art with 19th Century photos taken by the French Louis Daguerre, possibly the only surviving samples in the world.


History

The West Indies Yacht Club is the successor of the short-lived British West Indies Sailing Club, founded in 1885 at the time of the British West Indies, which had become almost defunct by the end of World War Two. Still, some members gathered informally and the need of a second yacht club of the island of Jamaica was felt, so the decision came to revive the former sailing club in a new structure, the West Indies Yacht Club. Recently, the revival of the Club has drawn much attention on preserving a classic fleet in the West Indies, as well some articles in books to explore the origins of the club. The Club has been shown on Imray Marine Charts since 2015.[3]


Clubhouse

The Club is currently building a new Clubhouse (to be open by mid-2017), incorporating parts of an old plantation house built in the 1860s. The plans included the restoration of the Ballroom and Library, and adding modern and convenient facilities for Members and their Guests' enjoyment.

The main building is Grade A listed and features in the bar a rare example of the 1930s interiors decoration in the West Indies, with art-deco stucco and mirrors. The other rooms of the Clubhouse are in the late 19th Century English-style.

The Clubhouse sits on a 12-acre estate with a tropical botanic garden, as well a private beach. JN.05.jpg

The WIYC Marine Photograph Collection

In December 2015, Sir Thierry Waterford-Mandeville, KLJ., acting as Commodore of the Club, presented the General Committee with over 800 vintage marine photographs, most dating from the early days of yachting. This collection features 5 works of Louis Daguerre, possibly the only marine photographs by this artist surviving today. The collection also included original menus signed by Prince Albert for suppers given on board of the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert, as well very rare photographs of the Italian Royal Family in the 1920s aboard their family's private yacht.

The collection is open to scholars and is displayed in the Club Library.


The Club Burgee

The Order of Christ Grand Cross was the same as the one displayed on Christopher Columbus sails showing the connection with the great explorers of the past and the blue color stands for the warm Caribbean sea.
