(plural _haiku_) is a very short form of Japanese poetry in three phrases, typically characterized by three qualities:

1.  The essence of haiku is "cutting" (_kiru_).[1] This is often represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a _kireji_ ("cutting word") between them,[2] a kind of verbal punctuation mark which signals the moment of separation and colours the manner in which the juxtaposed elements are related.
2.  Traditional haiku often consist of 17 _on_ (also known as morae though often loosely translated as "syllables"), in three phrases of 5, 7, and 5 _on_, respectively.[3]
3.  A _kigo_ (seasonal reference), usually drawn from a _saijiki_, an extensive but defined list of such terms.

are said by some[4] to increasingly vary from the tradition of 17 _on_ or taking nature as their subject. Despite the western influence, the use of juxtaposition continues to be honored in both traditional and modern haiku.[5] There is a common, although relatively recent, perception that the images juxtaposed must be directly observed everyday objects or occurrences.[6]

In Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed in a single vertical line while haiku in English often appear in three lines parallel to the three phrases of Japanese haiku.

Previously called _hokku_, haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.[7]


Kiru and Kireji

In Japanese haiku a _kireji_, or cutting word, typically appears at the end of one of the verse's three phrases. A _kireji_ fills a role somewhat analogous to a _caesura_ in classical western poetry or to a volta in sonnets. Depending on which cutting word is chosen, and its position within the verse, it may briefly cut the stream of thought, suggesting a parallel between the preceding and following phrases, or it may provide a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure.[8]

The fundamental aesthetic quality of both hokku and haiku is that it is internally sufficient, independent of context, and will bear consideration as a complete work. The _kireji_ lends the verse structural support,[9] allowing it to stand as an independent poem.[10][11] The use of _kireji_ distinguishes haiku and hokku from second and subsequent verses of renku; which may employ semantic and syntactic disjuncture, even to the point of occasionally end-stopping a phrase with a . However, renku typically employ _kireji_.[12]

In English, since _kireji_ have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.

The _kireji_ in the Bashō examples "old pond" and "the wind of Mt Fuji" are both "ya" (). Neither the remaining Bashō example nor the Issa example contain a _kireji_ although they do both balance a fragment in the first five _on_ against a phrase in the remaining 12 _on_ (it may not be apparent from the English translation of the Issa that the first five _on_ mean "Edo's rain").


Syllables or _on_

In comparison with English verse typically characterized by syllabic meter, Japanese verse counts sound units known as "_on_" or morae. Traditional haiku consist of 17 _on_, in three phrases of five, seven and five _on_ respectively. Among contemporary poems _teikei_ ( fixed form) haiku continue to use the 5-7-5 pattern while _jiyuritsu_ ( free form) haiku do not. One of the examples below illustrates that traditional haiku masters were not always constrained by the 5-7-5 pattern.

Although the word "_on_" is sometimes translated as "syllable", one _on_ is counted for a short syllable, two for an elongated vowel or doubled consonant, and one for an "n" at the end of a syllable. Thus, the word "haibun", though counted as two syllables in English, is counted as four _on_ in Japanese (ha-i-bu-n); and the word "_on_" itself, which English-speakers would view as a single syllable, comprises two _on_: the short vowel O and the moraic nasal {{IPA. This is illustrated by the Issa haiku below, which contains 17 _on_ but only 15 syllables. Conversely, some sounds, such as "kyo" () may look like two syllables to English speakers but are in fact a single _on_ (as well as a single syllable) in Japanese.

In 1973, the Haiku Society of America noted that the norm for writers of haiku in English was to use 17 syllables, but they also noted a trend toward shorter haiku.[13] Shorter haiku are very much more common in 21st century English haiku writing.

Some translators of Japanese poetry infer that about 12 syllables in English approximate the duration of 17 Japanese _on_.[14]


Kigo

A haiku traditionally contains a _kigo_, a word or phrase that symbolizes or implies the season of the poem and which is drawn from a _saijiki_, an extensive but prescriptive list of such words.

Kigo are often in the form of metonyms and can be difficult for those who lack Japanese cultural references to spot. The Bashō examples below include "kawazu", "frog" implying spring, and "shigure", a rain shower in late autumn or early winter. Kigo are not always included in non-Japanese haiku or by modern writers of Japanese "free-form" haiku.


Examples

The best-known Japanese haiku[15] is Bashō's "old pond":



        (transliterated into 17 hiragana)

            _furu ike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto_ (transliterated into rōmaji)

This separates into _on_ as:

    fu-ru-i-ke ya (5)
    ka-wa-zu to-bi-ko-mu (7)
    mi-zu-no-o-to (5)

Translated:[16]

    old pond
    frog leaps in
    water's sound

Another haiku by Bashō:





            _hatsu shigure saru mo komino o hoshige nari_[17]

This separates into _on_ as:

    ha-tsu shi-gu-re (5)
    sa-ru mo ko-mi-no o (7)
    ho-shi-ge na-ri (5)

Translated:

    the first cold shower
    even the monkey seems to want
    a little coat of straw

This haiku by Bashō illustrates that he was not always constrained to a 5-7-5 _on_ pattern. It contains 18 _on_ in the pattern 6-7-5 ("ō" or is treated as two _on_.)





            _Fuji no kaze ya ōgi ni nosete Edo miyage_[18]

This separates into "on" as:

    fu-ji no ka-ze ya (6)
    o-u-gi ni no-se-te (7)
    e-do mi-ya-ge (5)

Translated:

    the wind of Fuji
    I've brought on my fan
    a gift from Edo

This haiku by Issa[19] illustrates that 17 Japanese _on_ do not always equate to 17 English syllables ("nan" counts as two _on_ and "nonda" as three.)





            _Edo no ame nan goku nonda hototogisu_

This separates into "on" as,

    e-do no a-me (5)
    na-n go-ku no-n-da (7)
    ho-to-to-gi-su (5)

Translated:

    of Edo's rain
    how many gallons did you drink,
    cuckoo?


Origin and development

From renga to renku to haiku

Hokku is the opening stanza of an orthodox collaborative linked poem, or renga, and of its later derivative, renku (or _haikai no renga_). By the time of Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), the hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (a combination of prose and hokku), and haiga (a combination of painting with hokku). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) renamed the standalone hokku to haiku.[20] The latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written, and the use of the term hokku to describe a stand-alone poem is considered obsolete.[21]

Bashō

In the 17th century, two masters arose who elevated _haikai_ and gave it a new popularity. They were Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) and Uejima Onitsura (1661–1738). _Hokku_ is the first verse of the collaborative _haikai_ or _renku_, but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition. Even though _hokku_ had sometimes appeared individually, they were always understood in the context of _renku_.[22] The Bashō school promoted standalone _hokku_ by including many in their anthologies, thus giving birth to what is now called "haiku". Bashō also used his _hokku_ as torque points within his short prose sketches and longer travel diaries. This subgenre of _haikai_ is known as _haibun_. His best-known work, _Oku no Hosomichi_, or _Narrow Roads to the Interior_, is counted as one of the classics of Japanese literature[23] and has been translated into English extensively.

Bashō was deified by both the imperial government and Shinto religious headquarters one hundred years after his death because he raised the haikai genre from a playful game of wit to sublime poetry. He continues to be revered as a saint of poetry in Japan, and is the one name from classical Japanese literature that is familiar throughout the world.[24]

Buson

]] The next famous style of haikai to arise was that of Yosa Buson (1716–1783) and others such as Kitō, called the Tenmei style after the Tenmei Era (1781–1789) in which it was created.

Buson is recognized as one of the greatest masters of haiga (an art form where the painting is combined with haiku or haikai prose). His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his haiku.[25]

Issa

No new popular style followed Buson. However, a very individualistic, and at the same time humanistic, approach to writing haiku was demonstrated by the poet Kobayashi Issa (1763–1827), whose miserable childhood, poverty, sad life, and devotion to the Pure Land sect of Buddhism are evident in his poetry. Issa made the genre immediately accessible to wider audiences.

Shiki

Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) was a reformer and modernizer. A prolific writer, even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, Shiki disliked the 'stereotype' of haikai writers of the 19th century who were known by the deprecatory term _tsukinami_, meaning 'monthly', after the monthly or twice-monthly _haikai_ gatherings of the end of the 18th century (in regard to this period of _haikai_, it came to mean 'trite' and 'hackneyed'). Shiki also criticized Bashō. Like the Japanese intellectual world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly influenced by Western culture. He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of _plein-air_ painting, which he adapted to create a style of haiku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called _shasei_ (, "sketching from life"). He popularized his views by verse columns and essays in newspapers.

Hokku up to the time of Shiki, even when appearing independently, were written in the context of renku.[26] Shiki formally separated his new style of verse from the context of collaborative poetry. Being agnostic,[27] he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism. Further, he discarded the term "hokku" and proposed the term _haiku_ as an abbreviation of the phrase "_haikai no ku_" meaning a verse of _haikai_,[28] although the term predates Shiki by some two centuries, when it was used to mean _any_ verse of haikai. Since then, "haiku" has been the term usually applied in both Japanese and English to all independent haiku, irrespective of their date of composition. Shiki's revisionism dealt a severe blow to renku and surviving haikai schools. The term "hokku" is now used chiefly in its original sense of the opening verse of a renku, and rarely to distinguish haiku written before Shiki's time.

Haibun

Haibun is a combination of prose and haiku, often autobiographical or written in the form of a travel journal.

Haiga

Haiga is a style of Japanese painting based on the aesthetics of haikai, and usually including a haiku. Today, haiga artists combine haiku with paintings, photographs and other art.

Kuhi

The carving of famous haiku on natural stone to make poem monuments known as _kuhi_ () has been a popular practice for many centuries. The city of Matsuyama has more than two hundred _kuhi_.


Movement in the West

The earliest westerner known to have written haiku was the Dutchman Hendrik Doeff (1764–1837), who was the Dutch commissioner in the Dejima trading post in Nagasaki, during the first years of the 19th century.[29] One of his haiku:[30]

Although there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the "hokku" in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles. Early Western scholars such as Basil Hall Chamberlain (1850–1935) and William George Aston were mostly dismissive of hokku's poetic value. One of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi. In "A Proposal to American Poets," published in the _Reader_ magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his own English efforts, ending with the exhortation, "Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!" At about the same time the poet Sadakichi Hartmann was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.

In France, haiku was introduced by Paul-Louis Couchoud around 1906. Couchoud's articles were read by early Imagist theoretician F. S. Flint, who passed on Couchoud's ideas to other members of the proto-Imagist Poets' Club such as Ezra Pound. Amy Lowell made a trip to London to meet Pound and find out about haiku. She returned to the United States where she worked to interest others in this "new" form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by Yone Noguchi to explain "the hokku spirit", there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.

Blyth

R. H. Blyth was an Englishman who lived in Japan. He produced a series of works on Zen, haiku, senryū, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of _Haiku_, the four-volume work by Blyth, haiku were introduced to the post-war English-speaking world. This four-volume series (1949–52) described haiku from the pre-modern period up to and including Shiki. Blyth's _History of Haiku_ (1964) in two volumes is regarded as a classical study of haiku. Today Blyth is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to English speakers. His works have stimulated the writing of haiku in English.

Yasuda

The Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda published _The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples_ in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled _A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku_. In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5–7–5 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language.[31] Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a "haiku moment" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified'[32]). This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.

Henderson

In 1958, _An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bashô to Shiki_ by Harold G. Henderson was published by Doubleday Anchor Books. This book was a revision of Henderson's earlier book titled _The Bamboo Broom_ (Houghton Mifflin, 1934). After World War II, Henderson and Blyth worked for the American Occupation in Japan and for the Imperial Household, respectively, and their shared appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two.

Henderson translated every hokku and haiku into a rhymed tercet (a-ba), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that 17 syllables in English are generally longer than the 17 _on_ of a traditional Japanese haiku. Because the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual meter rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals. Nevertheless, many of Henderson's translations were in the five-seven-five pattern.

English-language haiku

The first haiku written in English was arguably by Ezra Pound, _In a Station of the Metro_, published in 1913.[33] Since then, the haiku has become a fairly popular form among English-speaking poets. English haiku can follow the traditional Japanese rules, but are frequently less strict, particularly concerning the number of syllables and subject matter.

The loosening of traditional standards has resulted in the term "haiku" being applied to brief English-language poems such as "mathemaku" and other kinds of pseudohaiku. Some sources claim that this is justified by the blurring of definitional boundaries in Japan.[34]


Romance language beginnings

Subsequent to Paul-Louis Couchoud’s popularisation of the form in France through his essays and translations,[35] the next major haiku collection to appear there was the sequence of war poems by Julien Vocance, _Cent visions de guerre_ (1916).[36] Later haiku by him were included among the work of the twelve published together in the _Nouvelle Revue Française_ (No. 84, September 1920), among whom was the young Paul Éluard.[37] This was followed by the anthology _Le Haïkaï Français_ in 1923.

In Spain, several prominent poets experimented with haiku, including Joan Alcover, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez and Luis Cernuda.[38] Federico García Lorca also experimented with and learned conciseness from the form while still a student in 1921.[39] The most persistent, however, was Isaac del Vando, whose _La Sombrilla Japonesa_ (1924) went through several editions.[40] The form was also used in Catalan by the avant-garde writers Josep Maria Junoy (1885–1955) and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, by the latter notably in his sequence _Vibracions_ (1921).[41]

The Mexican poet José Juan Tablada is credited with popularising haiku in his country, reinforced by the publication of two collections composed entirely in that form: _Un dia_ (1919),[42] and _El jarro de flores_ (1922).[43] In the introduction to the latter, Tablada noted that two young Mexicans, Rafael Lozano and Carlos Gutiérrez Cruz, had also begun writing them. They were followed soon after by Carlos Pellicer, Xavier Villaurrutia, and by Jaime Torres Bodet in his collection _Biombo_ (1925).[44] Much later, Octavio Paz included many haiku in _Piedras Sueltas_ (1955).[45]

Elsewhere the Ecuadorian poet and diplomat Jorge Carrera Andrade included haiku among the 31 poems contained in _Microgramas_ (Tokio 1940)[46] and the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges in the collection _La cifra_ (1981).[47]

In Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) Brazil, after several early false starts, including a collection of 56 by Waldomiro Siqueira Jr. (1912–?) in his _Haikais_ (São Paulo 1933), the form was popularised by Guilherme de Almeida, first through his 1937 magazine article "Os Meus Haicais" and then in his collection _Poesia Vária_ (1947).[48]. Since Modernism, several anthologies of Brazilian haikai have been published.


Worldwide

In 1992 Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz published the volume _Haiku_ in which he translated from English to Polish haiku of Japanese masters and American and Canadian contemporary haiku authors.

The former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, is a _haijin_ (, haiku poets) and known as "Haiku Herman." He published a book of haiku in April 2010.[49][50][51]

In the early 20th century, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed haiku in Bengali. He also translated some from Japanese. In Gujarati, Jhinabhai Desai 'Sneharashmi' popularized haiku[52] and remained a popular haiku writer.[53] In February 2008, the World Haiku Festival was held in Bangalore, gathering _haijin_ from all over India and Bangladesh, as well as from Europe and the United States.[54] In South Asia, some other poets also write Haiku from time to time, most notably including the Pakistani poet Omer Tarin, who is also active in the movement for global nuclear disarmament and some of his 'Hiroshima Haiku' have been read at various peace conferences in Japan and the UK.[55]
