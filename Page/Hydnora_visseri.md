_HYDNORA VISSERI_, the Visser's _Hydnora_, is a subterranean holoparasitic plant, lacking leaves and roots, and is described from southwestern Namibia and northwestern South Africa and has the longest tepal lobes of all _Hydnora_ species. The genus _Hydnora_ is composed entirely of holoparasitic plants that attach to the root of their hosts and are restricted to Africa and SW Asia.


Description

Visser's _Hydnora_, as a holoparasitic plant, lacks chlorophyll and depends entirely on its hosts, _Euphorbia gregaria_ or _Euphorbia gummifera_, for all water and nutrition. _Hydnora visseri_ lacks leaves and roots. The vegetative body of the plant is a brown warty rhizome that spreads laterally through the soil. The bumps on the rhizome of _Hydnora_ spp. can differentiate into haustoria (specialized organs for parasitizing the host plant), flower buds, or bifurcations of the rhizome. The rhizomes when broken are reddish to pink and contain high levels of tannins.[1]

The only portion of the plant that emerges from the soil surface is the large fleshy flower. The pollination of Visser's _Hydnora_ involves a trap and release mechanism where dermestid beetles are detained for several days, then released dusted with pollen.[2] The fruit is a large berry with thousands of small (< 1mm diameter) seeds, and is usually buried or just at the soil surface.[3]


Taxonomy

In South African and Namibia where _Hydnora visseri_ may be encountered, four other _Hydnora_ spp. exist, _H. abyssincia_, _H. africana,_ _H. longicollis_, and _H. triceps_.[4] Visser's _Hydnora_ can be discriminated from those taxa by its exclusive hosts _E. gummifera_ and _E. gregaria_, and by having the longest tepals of any _Hydnora_ spp. in Southern Africa, 5.5–9 cm long.[5] The family Hydnoraceae has been submerged within the Aristolochiaceae in the Piperales, based on a modern phylogenetic study that also found that the plastome of _Hydnora visseri_ is highly reduced, relative to photosynthetic plants, with only 27K base pairs.[6]


Etymology

-   Genus name: _Hydnora_ derives from the ancient greek , 'truffle',[7][8] because of the somatic structure of this root parasite.[9]
-   Species name: _Hydnora visseri_ is named after Stellenbosh University Professor Johann H. Visser (1931-1990) and author of the text _South African Parasitic Flowering Plants_.[10]


Distribution and habitat

_Hydnora visseri_ is present in Succulent-Karoo and Nama-Karoo vegetation types, and the winter rainfall and transitional rainfall areas of the Karas Region of Namibia and the Northern Cape Region of South Africa. It occurs in a limited distribution centered around the Orange River, and is only present where its hosts _Euphorbia gummifera_ and _Euphorbia gregaria_ are present.[11][12] _Hydnora visseri_ is most easily located by searching in around the base of the host _Euphorbia_ plants.


Genomics

Plastome_map_of_Hydnora_visseri.svg _Hydnora visseri_ possesses one of the smallest plastid genomes among flowering plants.[13] As compared to the chloroplast genome of its closest photosynthetic relatives, the plastome of _Hydnora visseri_ shows extreme reduction in both size (27,233 bp) and gene content (24 genes appear to be functional).[14]


Conservation

Based on the Red List of South African Plants, _H. visseri_ is considered a taxon of LEAST CONCERN due to its widespread distribution in regions with large protected areas, such as the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park and Sperrgebeit National Park.[15]


Ethnobotany

Other _Hydnora_ spp. are known to be available in Southern African herbal markets in Mozambique[16] and South Africa.[17] In South Africa the Imbola yesiXhosa are reported to use a thin paste of the powdered _Hydnora_ rhizome as a treatment for acne and other skin conditions.[18] In Uganda, the _Hydnora_ spp. are reported to be used as food (fruits) and medicine (rhizomes) for diarrhea, hypertension, and diabetes,[19] though these claims have not been confirmed.
