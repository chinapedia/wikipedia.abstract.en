Suman Pokhrel rendered the novel into a solo play in Nepali by bringing the character Yajnaseni alone in the scenes. Pokhrel has personalized the play while maintaining the basic concept of the original story.[2] The novel _Yajnaseni_ is itself based on the famous Sanskrit epic _Mahabharata_

The story revolves around Draupadi, who is also known as Yajnaseni and is one of the lead characters from the famous Sanskrit epic _Mahabharata_. The play is a neo-interpretation of _Mahabharata_ from Yajnaseni's perspective.[3][4]

Aarohan Theatre prepared _Yajnaseni_ for stage show for the first time.[5] It was first performed in Irving Arts Center in Texas, United States, on October 2, 2016, as a premiere show before its two-month long U.S. tour.[6] Sunil Pokharel has directed this play and Nisha Sharma performed the role of Yajnaseni on stage.[7]

The play was later performed at Ritwik Sadan in Kalyani, West Bengal in India on 11 January 2017 as a part of 12th Ramdhanu Nattyamela organised by Kalyani Kalamandalam.[8][9]
