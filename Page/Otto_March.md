OTTO MARCH (1845–1913) was a German architect and father of architects Werner March (1894–1976) and Walter March (1898–1969). Numerous residential and commercial buildings and churches throughout Germany were built on March's designs. He designed the Deutsches Stadion (Berlin), built for the 1916 Olympic games. March's sons Werner and Walter designed the Olympiastadion (Berlin) for the 1936 Olympic games. Otto March is credited with cultivating the interest of his young nephew Werner Hegemann in city planning. Hegemann became an influential city planner, author, critic of the Nazis, and editor of the influential architectural journal, "Wasmuths Monatshefte für Baukunst." March died in Berlin in 1913.
