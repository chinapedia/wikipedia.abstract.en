Metro_de_Paris_-_Ligne_3_-_Gambetta_02.jpg MARTIN NADAUD is a merged station, one of Paris métro's ghost stations. This station was absorbed into Gambetta following line reorganisation in 1969.[1] During the 1960s, it became evident that Porte de Bagnolet was inadequately served by public transport, although there is strong demand. It was therefore decided to extend the line 3 towards Bagnolet from the Place Gambetta. Because the flow of travelers to Porte de Bagnolet was expected to be much more important than towards the Porte des Lilas, the development of a fork was rejected. The terminus of Porte des Lilas gave way in favor of that of Bagnolet, with creation of a shuttle from Gambetta - to Porte des Lilas, which comprises the line 3a.

The Gambetta station was extensively redesigned by using the original station as the terminus of the line 3a and creating new platforms for Line 3. The Martin Nadaud station, only 232 meters from the old station was absorbed by the new station. Its access and ticketing hall have now become an entrance to the Gambetta station. This entrance is located on Place Martin Nadaud. The new Gambetta station was commissioned 23 August 1969, the line 3a was established on 27 March 1971, and the extension to Bagnolet was opened to the public on 2 April 1971.
