CAMILA DO CARMO NOBRE DE OLIVEIRA (born 10 June 1988), known as CAMILA NOBRE, is a Brazilian footballer and futsal player[1] who plays for Osasco Audax as a midfielder.

She was part of the Equatorial Guinea women's national football team at the 2012 African Women's Championship.[2]


Controversy

According to Federação Paulista de Futebol, based on her original Brazilian nationality, her full name is CAMILA DO CARMO NOBRE DE OLIVEIRA and she was born on 10 June 1988 in São Paulo.[3] These data do not match the information that Equatorial Guinea had submitted to the CAF on the occasion of the 2012 African Women's Championship. There, based on the Equatoguinean passport that African country gave her, her full name was CAMILA MARIA NOBRE DE CARMO and her date of birth was 10 July 1994.[4] Also, the list published by CAF reported that at the time she was playing for a local Equatoguinean side, E Waiso Ipola, when in reality she was signed with São José Esporte Clube in Brazil, having spent all her entire club career in her natal country. She took advantage of her false age to compete in the 2014 African U-20 Women's World Cup Qualifying Tournament.[5]

On 11 April 2016, Camila Nobre was sanctioned by FIFA with a ten-match suspension, to be served in the next matches of the representative team of Equatorial Guinea for which she would be eligible, as well as a fine of CHF 2,000, a reprimand and a warning, on the basis of art. 61 paras 1 and 2 of the FDC.[6] On 4 August 2016, her double identity case led CAF to disqualify the Equatorial Guinea national women’s team from the Women's AFCON Cameroon 2016, and the subsequent suspensions from the 2018 and 2020 editions.[7]

On October 5, 2017, FIFA determined the other ten Brazilian-born footballers who played for Equatorial Guinea at the 2015 CAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament were ineligible. The sanction came from the April's original, involving Camila Nobre.[8]
