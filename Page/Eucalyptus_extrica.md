_EUCALYPTUS EXTRICA_, commonly known as EASTERN TALLERACK,[1] is a species of mallee that is endemic in Western Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of three, whitish flowers and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus extrica_ is a spreading mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth light grey over brown bark, sometimes with rough, fibrous or ribbony bark on the lower stems. Young plants and coppice regrowth have slightly glaucous, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same dull green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arrange in leaf axils in groups of three on a flattened peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering occurs between January and April and the flowers are whitish. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near to rim level.[2][3][4]

Tallerack (_E. pleurocarpa_) has a similar habit but has noticeably shorter, wider, glaucous leaves, glaucous buds and fruit. Intergrades between the two species have been recorded.[5][6]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus extrica_ was first formally described in 2000 by Dean Nicolle from a specimen collected east of Condingup by Anthony Orchard, and the description was published in the journal _Nuytsia_.[7][8] The specific epithet is said to be from the Latin word _extrico_ meaning "disentangled" or "free" in reference to this species having been confused with _E. tetragona_ in the past.[9] In classical Latin, _extrico_ means: "I disentangle" or "I free" (first person singular of verb _extricare_).[10]


Distribution and habitat

Eastern tallerack is found in coastal areas in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia between Esperance and Cape Arid where it grows in sandy soils over limestone.[11]


Conservation status

This mallee is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[12]
