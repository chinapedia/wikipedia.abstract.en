Jim_Jones_(Jim_Jones_&_The_Righteous_Mind)_-_Festival_Relache,_Bordeaux_(2015-05-26_16.51.58_by_Patrice_CALATAYU).jpg JIM JONES AND THE RIGHTEOUS MIND are an English rock band, formed in November 2014 by Jim Jones and Gavin Jay following the break-up of The Jim Jones Revue. The current line-up also features multi-instrumentalist Mal Troon and keyboard player Matt Millership.


History

Taking their name from a book on social psychology, Jim Jones and the Righteous Mind came together following the break-up of The Jim Jones Revue in 2014.[1] The band was initially composed of Jim Jones, Henri Herbert and Gavin Jay with Phil Martini on drums. Henri left to concentrate on his burgeoning solo career[2] with Joe Glossop stepping in on keyboards. David Page joined on guitar / pedal steel and this line-up recorded the _Boil Yer Blood EP_ and _Aldecide_ for Raygun records. Due to touring commitments Joe and David were later replaced by Matt Millership and Mal Troon, who remain in the current line up.

0n 26 May 2017 the group released their debut album via their own imprint label MaSonic on Hound Gawd! Records. The critically acclaimed[3] _Super Natural_ was produced by Jim Jones and recorded in London at Space Eko East studio with Alex McGowan. French tattoo artist Jean-luc Navette designed the cover artwork for the album.

To support the release the band performed a live session for Marc Riley on BBC6 and a live televised set in Paris for _Album De La Semaine_ on Canal+.


Musical Style

Expanding on the 1950s rock n roll influences of The Jim Jones Revue, The Righteous Mind has a darker, more cinematic sound incorporating psychedelia, country, blues and gospel, garnering favourable comparisons to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Tom Waits and The Stooges.[4]

Comparing the two bands, The Quietus wrote that '...while the Jim Jones Revue swan-dived into rock & roll’s primordial ooze with an unrestrained sense of glee and abandon, Jim Jones And The Righteous Mind is an exercise in intensity, dynamics and space that, while summoning up the feral excitement of the former outfit, delivers a satisfying and continuingly intriguing payload from a great height. This is less a case of being steamrollered and more of exploration, experimentation and execution.'[5] Record Collector also noted that 'the Revue’s sleaze-billy holler isn’t abandoned so much as thickened on the riff’n’roll turmoil of his Righteous Mind debut'[6] declaring the record 'ridiculously thrilling.[7]' Vive Le Rock magazine awarded the album a 10/10 rating, writing 'There really aren't enough superlatives to describe just how good 'Super Natural' is - you'll be hard pushed to find anything near as perfect anywhere else all year'[8]
