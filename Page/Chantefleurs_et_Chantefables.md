Reception

_Chantefleurs et Chantefables_ has been praised by music critics. Andrew Clements of _The Guardian_ described the composition as "a series of tiny epigrammatic settings inhabiting a child-like surrealist world, which Lutosławski illuminates with wonderful precision."[25] Keith Potter of _BBC Music Magazine_ compared the piece to Lutosławski's _Chain 1_, observing that they are "so exquisite that they verge on the precious."[26] The composer Russell Platt similarly described it as "one of the most gracious and affecting works of Lutosławski's last years."[27]
