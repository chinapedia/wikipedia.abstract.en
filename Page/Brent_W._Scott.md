BRENT W. SCOTT currently serves as the 27th Chief of Chaplains of the United States Navy.[1] He previously served as the 19th Chaplain of the United States Marine Corps and the Deputy Chief of Navy Chaplains.

A native of Amarillo, Texas, Scott graduated from West Texas A&M University in 1976, and he received a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1980. After twelve years as a civilian pastor, he received a commission in the United States Navy and was assigned to the 3rd Marine Air Wing in Yuma, Arizona, where from 1992-1995, he served as the battalion chaplain for both the 2nd and the 1st Light Anti-aircraft Missile Battalions. His next assignment was Naval Station Rota, Spain, where from 1995-1999, he served as chaplain for Marine Security Forces and the Naval Brig. Scott subsequently served Carrier Air Wing 7 in Oceana, Virginia, as the wing chaplain where he deployed with the Ike battle group for combat in the Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, and the Persian Gulf from 1999-2001. In 2002, Scott received a Master of Theology from Duke University, and was then detailed to Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois, as a supervisory chaplain in one of the largest Religious Ministry Teams in the Navy.[2]

The appointment of Rear Admiral Scott as Chief of Chaplains of the U.S. Navy was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in April 2018 without the customary promotion to two-star rear admiral.[3] However on November 13, 2018, Scott was nominated by the President for appointment to the rank of rear admiral, while serving as Chief of Chaplains. His promotion was approved by the Senate on December 12.[4]
