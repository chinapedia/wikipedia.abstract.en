GADHKA (Hindi Name गढ़का) is a village and formerly the seat of a Rajput taluka and minor princely state, named after the village, in Western Saurashtra, presently in western India's state Gujarat.

The village is one of many in the modern Rajkot Taluka of Rajkot rural legislative constituency, in Morbi district.


History

The princely state was created as an offshoot of the Rajput Jadeja dynasty's Rajkot state for Thakur Ranmalji's second son, the first Thakur Saheb, on whose son and successor's childless death it was combined with Ranmaji's third son Akherajji's formerly received estate Makhawad.

Gadkhka State comprised five villages, covering 60 square kilometers, with a population of 1,908 in 1921.

During the British raj, it was a Fifth Class State in Halar prant, under the colonial Western Kathiawar Agency. Its jurisdictional powers were: Criminal, two years rigorous imprisonment and fines up to 2,000Rs, and Civil - to the extent of 5,000Rs.
