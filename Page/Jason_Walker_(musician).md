Biography

Born in New Zealand in 1969,[3] Jason Walker moved to Sydney at age 18.[4] In 1997 he joined Golden Rough on guitar alongside Brian Crouch on piano, David Orwell on vocals and guitar, Helen Meany on bass guitar and vocals, and Martin McDonald on drums.[5][6] That group had started two years earlier as a covers band, playing Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson and Gram Parsons material.[7] In 1998 they released their debut album of originals, _Twin Firs_.[8]

Walker's debut solo album, _Stranger to Someone_, was issued via Laughing Outlaw Records in October 2001.[9][10] _Delusions of Adequacy_{{'}}s Geoff Parks compared him with Ryan Adams and opined that Walker was "out there on the edges, pushing harder, moving quicker than Adams, who has now become a mainstream media darling."[11] Parks noticed "[Walker's] maturity and songwriting finesse shine through... But it’s on the cover versions featured here that you can hear [his] soul stretching out... [on] this country-fried, cosmic rock album."[12]

As a writer Walker published a biography of Parsons, _God's Own Singer_, in 2002.[13] He had started the project in 1996 and told Bill Beaver and Steve Wilcock of _Triste_ magazine that "it completely dominated my life. Everything I did hinged upon the availability of working computers and printers so I could work on it whenever I wanted. I even started working on it during my day job, which was really taking the piss. I almost got fired."[14]

Walker released his second album, _Ashes & Wine_ (January 2004), providing lead vocals and lead guitar, with a backing band, the Last Drinks, comprising Crouch on keyboards, Dave Keys on bass guitar, Andrew Lay on drums and Worth Wagers on rhythm guitar. His second biography was of Billy Thorpe: _Billy Thorpe's Time on Earth_ (2009). He followed with his third album, _Ceiling Sun Letters_ on 14 June 2010, which was nominated for Best Country Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010.[15] Walker's fourth album, _All-Night Ghost Town_, was issued on 12 August 2016.
