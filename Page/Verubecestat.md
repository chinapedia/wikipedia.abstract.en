VERUBECESTAT (MK-8931) is an experimental drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[1] It is an inhibitor of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1).[2][3]

In April 2012 phase I clinical results were announced.[4] Phase 1b results have also been reported.[5][6]

it was in two phase 2/3 clinical trials that have progressed to phase 3.[7][8][9] EPOCH, was to complete data collection for the primary outcome measure by June 2017.[10] However, in February 2017 Merck halted its late-stage trial of verubecestat for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease after it was reported as having "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" according to an independent panel of experts.[11] The results of Merck's trial of verubecestat on patients with prodromal (early stage) Alzheimer's were expected in February 2019. However, the trial was terminated in February 2018, after a data monitoring committee concluded it was unlikely that the drug would show a positive benefit/risk ratio.[12][13] The final conclusion was that "verubecestat did not reduce cognitive or functional decline in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease and was associated with treatment-related adverse events".[14]
