COAST is a British women's clothing retail chain.[1][2]

It was founded in 1996.[3]

Coast is owned by Aurora Fashions, as are women's fashion brands Warehouse and Oasis.[4] Aurora in turn was owned by the Icelandic Kaupthing Bank, and has been in administration for some time, with the administrators looking for potential buyers, with a possible valuation of not more than £100 million for Coast, Warehouse, and Oasis reported in November 2016.[5] In April 2017, the _Daily Telegraph_ reported that the three brands employ up to 5,000 people and were attracting interest from private equity, who would likely close some of the stores.[6] _Retail Week_ has speculated that the future for brands like Coast will be in department store concessions and online, rather than stand-alone stores.[7]

In 2016, Coast had a pre-tax profit of £1.3m, following a pre-tax loss of £10.8m in 2015.[8]

As of September 2017, they have 20 stand-alone stores in the UK, five in Ireland, two in Kuwait, and two in the UAE, as well as numerous in-house concessions in Beatties, Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis.[9]


Administration and sale

On the 11 October 2018, Coast entered administration. Karen Millen, another British retailer, bought parts of the Coast brand, such as the website and concessions in department stores (including the transfer of 600 jobs to Karen Millen). The deal left 24 stores to close, including the flagship store on Oxford Street, and 300 employees without a job.[10]
