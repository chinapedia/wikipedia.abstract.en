PAT EAMON MILLS[1] (born 1949) is a British comics writer and editor who, along with John Wagner, revitalised British boys comics in the 1970s, and has remained a leading light in British comics ever since. He has been called "the godfather of British comics".[2]

His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism.[3] He is best known for creating _2000 AD_ and playing a major part in the development of _Judge Dredd_.


Biography

Mills started his career as a sub-editor for D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd, where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go freelance, and were soon writing scripts for IPC's girls' and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched _Warlord_, a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls' comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys' department, Mills, along with Wagner and Gerry Finley-Day, worked in secret to create _Battle Picture Weekly_. _Battle_'s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC's traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated First World War series _Charley's War_, drawn by Joe Colquhoun, for the title.[4]

After launching _Battle_, Mills began developing a new boys' title, _Action_, launched in 1976. _Action_'s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than a year before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into _Battle_.

His next creation was the science fiction-themed weekly _2000 AD_, launched in 1977. As with _Battle_ and _Action_ he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of _Judge Dredd_ when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.

In 1978 IPC launched _Starlord_, a short-lived companion title for _2000 AD_. Mills contributed _Ro-Busters_, a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to _2000 AD_ when _Starlord_ was cancelled. _Ro-Busters_ was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for _2000 AD_, including _ABC Warriors_ and _Nemesis the Warlock_. Artist Kevin O'Neill was involved in the creation of all three. _Nemesis_ in particular, featuring a morally ambiguous alien hero fighting a despotic human empire, allowed Mills to work out his feelings towards religion and imperialism. Another strand of his _2000 AD_ work was _Sláine_, a barbarian fantasy based on Celtic mythology and neo-paganism, which he co-created with his then wife Angela Kincaid (with whom he also created the children's series of books, _The Butterfly Children_).

Mills also had a hand in IPC's line of Horror comics aimed at girls such as _Chiller_.

He has had little success in American comics, with the exception of Metalzoic and Marshal Law, published by DC and Epic comics respectively in the late 1980s, both drawn by O'Neill.

In 1986 he edited the short-lived comic _Diceman_, which featured characters from _2000 AD_. He wrote nearly every story.

In 1988 he was involved in the launch of _Crisis_, a politically aware _2000 AD_ spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote _Third World War_, drawn initially by Carlos Ezquerra, a polemical critique of global capitalism and the ways it exploits the developing world. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as Garth Ennis, John Smith and Sean Phillips.

In 1991 Mills launched _Toxic!_, an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy _Crisis_, and a creator-owned ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer Tony Skinner, including _Accident Man_, an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. _Toxic!_ lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as Duke Mighten and Martin Emond.

In 1995, he broke in the French market, one of his life's goals, with _Sha_, created with French artist Olivier Ledroit.

He continues to write _Sláine_, _Bill Savage_, _Black Siddha_ and _ABC Warriors_ for _2000 AD_, and also the Franco-Belgian comic _Requiem Vampire Knight_,[5] with art by Olivier Ledroit and its spin-off Claudia Chevalier Vampire, with art by Franck Tacito.

Two new series, _Greysuit_, a super-powered government agent drawn by John Higgins, and _Defoe_, a 17th-century zombie hunter drawn by Leigh Gallagher, began in _2000 AD_ prog 1540.[6]

Mills has formed Repeat Offenders with artist Clint Langley and Jeremy Davis "to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential" and the first project is a graphic novel called _American Reaper_, serialised in the _Judge Dredd Megazine_ (#316-ongoing as of October 2011). It has been optioned by Trudie Styler's Xingu Films and Mills has written the screenplay.[7]

He has also written two _Doctor Who_ audio plays, "Dead London" (2008) and "The Scapegoat" (2009) for Big Finish Productions, featuring the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller. The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the second as part of the third season. In 2010 Mills adapted a story that had been started by him and Wagner for Doctor Who in the 1980s and was produced by Big Finish as "The Song of Megaptera".

In 2017 he wrote, with Kevin O'Neill, and published two novels, _Serial Killer_ and _Goodnight, John-Boy_, part of a planned series of four books. Also in that year, he published his memoirs, _Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History_ in print and as an e-book. Mills also narrated the audiobook version himself. (The title is the catchphrase of the villain in his series _Nemesis the Warlock_.)

In 2018 the film _Accident Man_ was released, based on his comic strip for _Toxic!_
