TRADEPOINT RAIL , formerly known as the BALTIMORE INDUSTRIAL RAILROAD, is a switching and terminal railroad located on Sparrows Point, Maryland in the industrial sector of Baltimore, Maryland.


History

The railroad was originally incorporated as the Baltimore & Sparrows Point Railroad Company. Bethlehem Steel took over the railroad in the early 20th century. In 1916, the railroad was renamed the Patapsco and Back Rivers Railroad. The PBR operated until 2012 when the steel mill closed down; however, in 2014 the remainder of the railroad was bought by Sparrows Point Terminal (SPT) and named The Baltimore Industrial Railroad.[1] In January 2016 the railroad was renamed Tradepoint Rail, a part of the Tradepoint Atlantic family of companies.

All of the TPR locomotives were PBR locomotives. Steel was the main commodity hauled during the era of the steel mill, but currently most revenue comes from tank car storage.
