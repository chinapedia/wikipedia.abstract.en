KAMADHIA is a town and former princely state in the western Indian state of Gujarat.


History

The small state in Gohelwar prant of Kathiawar, was ruled by Muslim Chieftains of a Mir family. It yielded a state revenue of 5,611 rupees (mainly from land), paying 377 Rupees tribute to the British.

Kamadhia was granted as princely state by the penultimate Mughal Emperor Akbar Shah to Mir Sarfaraz Ali, an aristocratic descendant of Modud Chishti, one of the founders of the Chishti Sufi order in 1817.

The above first Darbar Sahib, Mir Sarfaraz Ali obtained a waiver of tribute to the colonial British government. This was received because of a successful rescue mission led by Mir Sarfaraz Ali commanding a garrison of 600 troops of the Gaekwad of Baroda to save the second Peshwa from a possible assassination attempt[1]. Having successfully rescued the Peshwa in Malwa, Mir Sarfaraz Ali returned to Kamadhia.[2]

The state came in the charge of the colonial Eastern Kathiawar Agency, like many tiny states in Saurashtra.

Still in his reign, the neighboring villages of Gothra (Gothda, later turned into a zamindari jagir), Walen (Vullun) and Davdi (Dvaudee) were added to the state, which thus extended to 10.4 km2 and in 1948 reached a population of 1,050.

It ceased to exist by accession to newly independent India's United State of Kathiawar on 15 February 1948. However the line of Darbars is nominally continued.
