_OOBLETS_ (previously known as _Moblets_[1]) is a life simulation game due for release on Xbox One and PC in 2019.[2][3]

The game has been in development by indie developers Rebecca Cordingley and Ben Wasser since 2016.[4] The game combines elements of games such as _Stardew Valley_ and _Pok√©mon_.[5]

Following Double Fine's acquisition by Microsoft[6], Ooblets' developers announced that they'd no longer be publishing through Double Fine, opting instead to self-publish the title[7].
