The coalition of groups addresses issues of "decriminalisation of sex work; strengthening sex worker-led leadership and organising; ensuring sex work is accepted as work; human and civil rights; access to HIV treatment and other health services; the high incidence of violence experienced by sex workers including from law enforcement officers; and ensuring the inclusion of male and transgender sex workers."[19]

In 2011, African Sex Workers Alliance documented human rights violations of sex workers in Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.[20] In 2015 it organised activities for International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers, 17 December, which included a procession in Nairobi.[21]

As of March 2018 Denis Nzioka was Programmes Manager at African Sex Workers Alliance for Kenya.[22]
