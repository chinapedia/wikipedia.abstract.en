The 1999–2000 BUSTA CUP was the 34th edition of what is now the Regional Four Day Competition, the domestic first-class cricket competition for the countries of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). It was played from 6 January to 25 February 2000.

Six teams contested the competition – Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Barbados topped the table after the round-robin,[1] but lost to the Leeward Islands in their semi-final. However, the Leeward Islands lost to Jamaica in the final, who won their fifth domestic first-class title. Jamaica's Chris Gayle was the leading run-scorer and was named player of the tournament, while Curtly Ambrose of the Leeward Islands and Guyana's Mahendra Nagamootoo were the equal leading wicket-takers.[2]
