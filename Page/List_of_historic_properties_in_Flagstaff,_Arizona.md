Flagstaff

Flagstaff,_AZ_ca._1899.jpgHenry_Fountain_Ashurst.jpg The first person, who was not a Native-American, to settle the area was Thomas F. McMillan. His cabin at the base of Mars Hill is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Santa Fe Railroad built a town nearby which they named Flagstaff and during the 1880s, the town opened its first post office. The origins of the town name of Flagstaff came about when in July 4, 1855, a surveyor for the Santa Fe Railroad by the name of Samuel Clark Hudson, accompanied by his team, climbed a tall pine tree and tied a flag.[1]

Flagstaff's early economy was based on the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. The Riordan family were a pioneering family who played an instrumental role in the development of the lumber and timber industry in the town. They founded and established the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company in 1900. The company office as well as the logging train used and the family estate are all listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[2][3]

The house of Henry F. Ashurst, built in 1892, is among the houses listed in the National Register of Historic Places. On March 27, 1912, Ashurst became one of the first two Senators from new state of Arizona to be elected to the United States Senate. Among the other historic houses listed in the NRHP of Flagstaff's early pioneers are that of Hugh E. Campbell. Campbell began his career as a sheepherder in 1885. He was one of the owners of the firm named Campbell-Francis and Co., the largest sheep ranchers in Arizona. Also listed is the home of J.C. Milligan, a former Justice of the Peace and owner of a local brickyard, is also listed.[4][5][6]

Mexicans and people of Mexican ancestry were also instrumental in the development of the new city. One of the businesses which catered to the Hispanic community of the area was the "La Cuidad de Mexico Grocery" (The City of Mexico Grocery). "La Iglesia Metodista El Divino Redentor" (The Mexican Methodist Church The Divine Redeemer), established in 1892 and the "Iglesia Nuestra Seňora de la Guadalupe" (Our Lady of Guadalupe Church) are both churches founded by the Mexican community. Segregation in schools was common in the United States at the time. Such was the case of the South Beaver Elementary School, built in 1936, which served as a segregated school for Hispanic students and later for African-American students until the 1950s.[7]

The now historic Route 66, which runs through Flagstaff, was completed in 1926. Flagstaff was incorporated as a city in 1928.[8][9] The establishment of Route 66 was one of the factors which contributed to the growth of the city. People who emigrated to the western part of the United States and tourists from different parts of the country often stopped and visited the city. As a consequence many hotels were built, among them was the Monte Vista Hotel, which was built in 1926 and is located at 100 N. San Francisco Street. The hotel was host to notable figures such as Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, Bing Crosby and President Harry S. Truman.[10]

The Lowell Observatory, an astronomical observatory founded in 1894, by astronomer Percival Lowell is also located in Flagstaff. It is among the oldest observatories in the United States. In 1965, the observatory was designated a National Historic Landmark.[11][12] The dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh the Lowell Observatory.

Flagstaff has a historical preservation agency called the Heritage Preservation Commission. The mission of this commission is to identify and preserve historical structures. The commission is also in charge of nominating those structures which are considered historical to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Heritage Preservation Commission of Flagstaff meets in the Council Chambers located in City Hall.[13] However, the fact that a property is listed in the NRHP does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner as was the case of the I.B. Koch House which was built in 1900 and was located in 7 Riordan Road. The I.B. Koch House was demolished and the area in which it was once located was converted into an automobile parking lot for a local law firm. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President:
