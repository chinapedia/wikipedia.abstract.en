TESL and Accounting Matriculation students from UPM are among the first groups of students of the institute, registered in June 1998. Following an increase in the number of students, Institut Fitra moved to an 8 hectares area in Pekan, Pahang.[1]

Following this, on September 19, 2016, Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Abdul Halim Mua'dzam Shah was installed as the first Chancellor of Widad University College in an inauguration ceremony held in Istana Negara, Kuala Lumpur.[3]
