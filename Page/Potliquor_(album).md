_POTLIQUOR_ is the fourth album by American band Potliquor. It was released in 1979 and was their first album since 1973.

With no music released and/or seeing radio play since 1973, things were not looking very positive for the new lineup of Potliquor, now a three-man group composed of drummer Jerry Amoroso, bassist Guy Schaeffer, and guitarist Mike McQuaig. Amoroso flew to New York City to attempt to get a second chance at a recording contract, but to no avail. His disappointment led to the writing of "New York City You Ain't". Armed with a new song, Amoroso successfully negotiated a record deal with Capricorn Records early in 1977. With this new record label support, Potliquor released the song as a single in March 1977, but the lack of substantive airplay and sales scuttled plans for a new album.[1]

It wasn't until 1979 when, free of their Capricorn Records contract, Potliquor went into Studio in the Country to record their fourth album, _Potliquor_. It had moderate success.

In a national feature "Pop Scene – Here's the Answer" provided by the United Feature Syndicate based in New York, New York, a newspaper reader from Santa Monica, California wrote in to inquire about Potliquor, having heard "Louisiana Lady", a single from the _Potliquor_ album. The feature responded that "Capitol is giving the group new life, and is promoting them as if they were recently formed."[2]
