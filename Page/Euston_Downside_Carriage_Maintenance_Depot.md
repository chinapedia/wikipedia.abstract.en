EUSTON DOWNSIDE CARRIAGE MAINTENANCE DEPOT was a carriage maintenance depot located in Camden, London, England. The depot was situated on the west side of the West Coast Main Line to the north of London Euston station.


History

Prior to its closure in 2004, the stabling point was used for Royal Mail trains and for storing Virgin Trains West Coast locomotives. However, the depot became obsolete when Pendolinos replaced them.[1]

In 2018 the sheds were demolished in advance of the start of tunnelling work for the High Speed 2 Euston approach tunnels and the extension of Granby Terrace Bridge.[2][3]
