HOSHI SATO , played by Korean American actress Linda Park, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series _Star Trek: Enterprise_.

Sato, born in 2129, is the communications officer aboard the starship _Enterprise (NX-01)_, and also a linguist who can speak more than forty languages (polyglotism),[1] including Klingon. She is an acknowledged linguistic genius and expert at operating the universal translator, which was a key instrument in allowing cultures from different worlds to communicate.


Biography

Relatively little of Sato's background has been explored in the series. It is known that she briefly suffered from space sickness and is also claustrophobic. The fourth season episode "Observer Effect" revealed that Sato was once dishonourably discharged from Starfleet for running a floating poker game and breaking the arm of a Starfleet instructor who tried to break it up (she has a black belt in Aikido). She was subsequently allowed to rejoin Starfleet because of her exceptional linguistic skills.

Before posting to the _Enterprise_, Sato taught linguistics in Brazil; it is not known whether she was an active Starfleet officer or was reactivated to serve under Jonathan Archer. She later (again, in "Observer Effect") expressed regret at leaving without saying goodbye to her students.

She appears to be very close to Captain Archer—he is often protective towards her and they appear to have some history that predates her posting to _Enterprise_, but the full nature of their relationship has also yet to be explored.

The series' final episode, "These Are the Voyages...", reveals that Sato remains Archer's communications officer throughout his tenure as captain, and was considering resuming her teaching career in Brazil following the ship's decommissioning. The final episode also revealed that, after serving aboard _Enterprise_ for ten years, she still wore an Ensign's insignia. As noted in the records aboard the USS _Defiant_, Sato eventually achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander.


Fate

According to a computer bio screen, barely visible in the episode "In a Mirror, Darkly", and taken from the memory banks of the USS _Defiant_, Sato was born in Kyoto, Japan. She was instrumental in the development of the universal translator. She eventually marries a man named Takashi Kimura, and retires from Starfleet with the rank of lieutenant commander.


Mirror Universe

In the Mirror Universe, Sato held the rank of Lieutenant. In addition to being the communications officer, she acted as the "Captain's Woman" (a combination yeoman/concubine) of Captain Maximillian Forrest and then Commander Jonathan Archer after Archer took control of the ISS _Enterprise_.

After Archer used the USS _Defiant_ to put down the rebellion, Sato poisoned him and took command of the ship, taking the Mirror Travis Mayweather as a new consort. Upon reaching Earth, she demanded Earth's surrender and proclaimed herself Empress.

Reception

According to author David Greven, "Ensign Hoshi Sato is an Asian American linguist and the communications officer. Prone to fearful fits and generally seen as ineffectual in any terms other than the linguistic aspects of her job, Hoshi is the resident screamer."[2]

In 2015, _Den of Geek_ noted how Hoshi showed the important of communication and the skill of her linguistic abilities.[3] They recommended the episodes “Fight or Flight” and “Vox Sola” as watches for the Hoshi character.[4]

In 2018, The Wrap ranked Hoshi as the 37th best character of _Star Trek_ overall, noting her job as translator before the days of the universal translator technology.[5] In 2016, W.I.R.E.D. magazine ranked Lt. Commander Hoshi Sato as the 27th most important character of Starfleet within the _Star Trek_ science fiction universe.[6]
