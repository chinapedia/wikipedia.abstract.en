DANIELA NIEDERER (born July 20, 1990),[1] better known by her stage name NORA EN PURE, is a South African-Swiss DJ and deep house producer.[2] She first received recognition for her 2013 single "Come With Me". Further popular releases are "Morning Dew", "Lake Arrowhead" and "Tears In Your Eyes". In July 2016, she was invited to put together a two-hour long mix for Pete Tong's radio show: "BBC's Essential Mix".[3]


Early life

Born to a South African mother and a Swiss father in Johannesburg, Niederer migrated to Switzerland during her infancy.[4] Raised in a musical environment, she learned to play musical instruments at childhood.

Before engaging in the electronic music scene, she used to listen to other musical genres including classical music, pop and rock.[5]


Background

She first found creative inspiration, weaving her influences of South African roots in combining an exotic setting accompanied by tribal percussion sounds and a melody composed by classical instrumentation, either by wind instruments and piano chords and harmonious synthesizers often integrating organic nature sounds.[6]

EDM states she got in touch with electronic music when she met some friends who had their own studios - that was around 2008. Having travelled a lot in her life, Nora En Pure music should create a sort of wanderlust. Being part of the Helvetic Nerds in Switzerland and the main force of the Enormous Tunes label, her tracks as well as the label's releases have developed a characteristic sound, that is well recognizable. Nora En Pure was one of the first artists of her kind of melodic deep house sound. Instead of following the trend towards the more commercial vocal melodic house, the productions and live sets always remained unique connecting dots between different and disparate sounds, styles and scenes with ease and in her own raw style setting her apart from the mainstream.[7]


Musical career

She gained international recognition by touring, with appearances at Coachella Festival on the Yuma stage (which hosts the best artists of deep house and techno music), at the Tomorrowland "Daybreak Session" (a 3-hour set on the mainstage of alongside Joris Voorn, Carl Cox and others), or with a whole catalogue of EPs and remixes (for artists such as Faithless, Wretch 32, Klingande, Oliver Heldens, Paul Harris and his side project Dirty Vegas).

In 2017, she released an extended play titled _Conquer Yosemite_.[10]
