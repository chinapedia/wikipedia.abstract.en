_DE SPELD_ (_The Pin_) is a Dutch news satire website. The website publishes satirical articles and videos parodying the style and content of regular news outlets. _De Speld_ was founded in 2007 by Jochem van den Berg and Melle van den Berg (no relationship). Since its inception, the website's office has been based in Amsterdam. In 2014 and 2015 De Speld was the 'most viral website' of The Netherlands.[1]

_De Speld_ has published a small number of its articles translated into English.[2]


Awards

_De Speld_ won the entertainment category of the 2011 Dutch website of the year election.[3]

In 2016, _De Speld_ won the People's Lovie Award for best Best Writing, defeating The Guardian and Vice.[4]


In other media

Since 2012, _De Speld_ publishes a column in national daily _De Volkskrant_ twice per week. From 2010 to 2012 the website had a similar column in the now defunct free newspaper _De Pers_.

In the past De Speld made radio items for WNL and Radio Veronica and from 2014 to 2015 the website had a daily segment in Pauw, a late night talkshow.

_De Speld_ has published two books: _Nederland het Boek. In vijf miljard jaar van supermacht naar wereldrijk_ ('The Netherlands the Book. In five billion years from superpower to global empire') a satirical take on Dutch history, in 2010[5] and _Reisgids Binnenhof_ ('Binnenhof Travel Guide'), a faux travel guide to the Dutch governmental district, in 2015.[6]
