PEGGY PHANGO (28 December 1928 â€“ 7 August 1998) was a South African actress and singer based in England.


Early life

Peggy Phango was born at Orlando, Transvaal. She trained as a nurse, but also sang in jazz clubs, as a young woman.[1][2]


Career

In 1959, Phango was cast to replace her cousin[3] Miriam Makeba in the female lead of the musical _King Kong_, about a South African boxer. Phango first appeared on the London stage in 1961, in the same show.[4] In 1988, she played "Bloody Mary" in a London revival of _South Pacific_.[5]

She was in a vocal group with fellow _King Kong_ cast members Patience Gowabe and Hazel Futa, called the Velvettes; they sang backup for Cyril Davies and his All-Stars in clubs in the 1960s.[6] She also recorded an album with Dudu Pukwana's band Zila.[7]

Phango also acted in non-musical roles on stage, including such shows as _You Can't Take it With You_, Arthur Miller's _The Crucible_, Lillian Hellman's _The Little Foxes_ with Elizabeth Taylor, and _Fishing_, the first play by Paulette Randall.[8] She toured as Rose in _Stepping Out_ in the 1980s, and was one of the South Africans who both appeared in and contributed their personal experiences to the show _Ekhaya_ in 1991.[9]

She appeared on British television regularly, notably in _EastEnders_ and an adaptation of _The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole_. Her appearances in television dramas about South Africa included roles in _Victims of Apartheid_ (1978), _Prisoners of Conscience_ (1981), _The Biko Inquest_ (1984), and _Death is a Part of the Process_ (1986), the last based on a novel by Hilda Bernstein.[10] Shortly before her death, she appeared in the first episode of a long-running television show, Lynda La Plante's _Trial and Retribution_.[11]
