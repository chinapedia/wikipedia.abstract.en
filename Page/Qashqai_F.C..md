History

Qashqai Football Club was established in Shiraz in 2012 with the support of Qashqai Turk people living in Fars and other neighbor provinces of Iran. Qashqai F.C. was reputed since they as a second-tier club surprisingly knocked Persepolis football team out of Iran’s 2016–17 Hazfi Cup's 1/32 round on September 30, 2016.[1] The two teams finished in a 1–1 draw after extra time and Qashqai defeated Persepolis 6–5 in penalty shootout.[2]

On 30 September 2016, Qashqai produced one of the greatest ever shocks of the Hazfi Cup. Qashqai, a third-tier team defeated Iranian giants Persepolis on penalty kicks.[3] This win advanced the club to the Round of 32 where they played New Bargh and lost 1–0.
