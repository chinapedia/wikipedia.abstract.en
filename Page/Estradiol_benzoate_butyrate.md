ESTRADIOL BENZOATE BUTYRATE (EBB) is an estrogen and estrogen ester which is used in hormonal birth control for women.[1][2] It is the C3 benzoate 17β-n-butyrate diester of estradiol. The medication is used as a combination of 10 mb EBB with 150 mg algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), a progestin, as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive under the brand names REDIMEN, SOLUNA, and UNIJAB (as well as former tentative brand name UNIMENS) in Peru and Singapore.[3][4][5] A single 10 mg intramuscular injection of EBB has a duration of approximately 3 weeks.[6][7] Its duration is shorter than that of estradiol enantate.[8]
