ROSELLE is an unincorporated community in northwest Madison County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

History

A post office called Roselle was established in 1895, and remained in operation until 1959.[3] Some say the community was named after Roselle, a circus performer who paid the town a visit, while others believe the community's name is an amalgamation of Rose and Ella, the daughters of a pioneer citizen.[4]
