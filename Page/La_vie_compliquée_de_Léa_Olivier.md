_LA VIE COMPLIQUÉE DE LÉA OLIVIER_ (_The Complicated Life of Lea Oliver_) is a series of young adult epistolary novels that are written by Catherine Girard-Audet and published through Les Malins.[1][2][3] Targeted towards teenage girls, the first three book in the series, _Perdue_, _Rumers_, and _Chantage_, were published in 2012 and the next two, Angoisses and Montagnes russes, were published the following year. Subsequent novels were released on a yearly basis. _La vie compliquée de Léa Olivier_ follows the central character of Léa Olivier, a young girl that is forced to move with her family to Greater Montreal, and is narrated through email, chat and SMS exchanges.[4][5] Girard-Audet initially planned to have the series span nine volumes,[6] but has since stated that while _Léa Olivier_ will have a definite ending, she has no set number of books planned for the series.[7] A spin-off series based on Lea's rival Maude Ménard-Bérubé, _Mini-Maude_, began publication in 2018.[8]

In the 2016 Gaspard Report on the Quebec book market the _Lea Oliver_ series, along with the release of _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ and popularity of the Pokemon franchise, was credited as being responsible for an increase in sales of children's books in 2015.[9] For the series, Girard-Audet drew upon her own childhood experiences, such as moving to Montreal from her hometown.[10]
