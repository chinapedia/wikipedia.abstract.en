The JOHN R. WHEELER JR. HOUSE, also known as IMMACULATE CONCEPTION CONVENT, is a historic building located in Dunlap, Iowa, United States. It was built in 1897 by J.R. Wheeler Sr. for his son and his new wife. Wheeler Sr. was a Civil War veteran, state legislator, local lumber merchant. The house is said to have served as an advertisement for the range of woods that Wheeler marketed.[1] When Wheeler Jr. left the community in 1910, he sold the house to neighboring St. Patrick's Catholic Church for use as a convent. As many as 45 rural students were housed here to makeup for the low church population in town. The parish sold the house in 1973, and it became a private home again.

The two-story, frame, front gabled, Colonial Revival house is symmetrical in plan, with the exception of the wrap-around porch. It features Georgian corner pilasters, pedimented dormers, wooden belt courses, an Adamesque-style cornice with dentils and decorative modillions, and an elliptical fanlight. The porch features columns in the Doric order and a plain dentilled cornice. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[2]
