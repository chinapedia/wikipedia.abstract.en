_CLOSE ENOUGH FOR LOVE_ is the second album by vocalist Fleurine.


Background

John Fordham wrote that "The pairing of the young Dutch vocalist Fleurine and American pianist Brad Mehldau (the most acclaimed jazz pianist of the last decade) seemed an unlikely one. [...] Mehldau was the quintessential contemporary jazz heavyweight, a meditative chamber musician of immense sophistication. Fleurine was the photogenic, standards-singing, multilingual, smooth-jazz singer."[1]


Music, recording and reception

The album was recorded at Sear Sound in New York City on June 24 and 25, 1999.[2] The tracks include compositions by Mehldau and Pat Metheny with lyrics by Fleurine in Portuguese and English and an original composition by Fleurine; it also features tracks by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Jimi Hendrix and Supertramp. Mehldau wrote the string arrangements that are used on 3 of the tracks.[3] Fordham wrote that the album "has plenty of unexpected diversions".[4]
