_CALADENIA ANCYLOSA_, commonly known as the GENOA SPIDER ORCHID,[1] is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single cream-coloured flower with red markings.


Description

_Caladenia ancylosa_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide.[2][3]

A single flower is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal is erect, oblong to lance-shaped, long and about wide. It tapers near the end which terminates in a glandular structure long. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance-shaped, long, wide and end in a gland similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, about wide and taper to a point. The labellum is a broad egg-shape, curves forward, long and wide when flattened. The labellum is cream-coloured at its base but red nearer the tip. There are 7 to 10 pairs of calli along the edge of the labellum, decreasing in length towards its front. There are six rows of foot-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum, also smaller towards the tip. Flowering occurs in September and October.[4]


Taxonomy and naming

The species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name _Arachnorchis ancylosa_. The description was published in _Australian Orchid Research_.[5] In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to _Caladenia ancylosa_ and the change was published in _The Victorian Naturalist_.[6] The specific epithet (ancylosa) is an Ancient Greek word meaning "a bending or stiffening of the joints",[7] referring to the stiffly spreading petals and lateral sepals.[8]


Distribution and habitat

_Caladenia ancylosa_ is only known from far east Gippsland where it grows in the shrub layer of tall open forest near Genoa.[9]


Conservation

This species is classified as "Vulnerable" by the Victorian government.[10][11]
