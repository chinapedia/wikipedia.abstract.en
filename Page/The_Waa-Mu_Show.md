Waa-Mu_Logo.png Cahn_Auditorium_Northwestern_University.jpgTHE WAA-MU SHOW (pronounced "wah mew") is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization within Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, that produces student written, orchestrated, produced, and performed original musical theatre work every year. The song lyrics, script, and music are developed in a series of classes.[1] It is the institution's longest standing theatrical tradition and is held in Cahn Auditorium on Northwestern's campus. This tradition began as a musical revue, showcasing several different student-written Northwestern-inspired vignettes connected by one single theme.[2] By 2013, the Waa-Mu show evolved into an original full-length musical.[3]


History

The first Waa-Mu show took place in 1929. A senior Northwestern student Joseph W. Miller and his classmate Darrell Ware wrote the script for and staged the college musical comedy that became "The Waa-Mu Show," the first co-educational college musical show. The Women's Athletic Association (WAA) and the Men's Union (MU) collaborated to put on the first show. The name "Waa-Mu" is derived from the synthesis of the two groups' acronyms.[4][5]

The WAA had been staging popular all-female musical comedies since 1912; the MU had presented less successful all-male comic operas for a number of years prior to 1929. Both men's and women's shows had been losing money and Miller and Ware raised $1,200 by borrowing $5 a piece from interested students to finance the first show. It also was Miller's and Ware's idea to feature both male and female students in their premiere production.[6] At first, the female WAA committee was reluctant about sharing the stage with the male Mu members, but they eventually agreed to combine talents. The premiere show that Miller and Ware collaborated on was _Good Morning Glory._[7] _The Daily Northwestern_ wrote, "Campus interest is the highest yet for any single dramatic activity in University history." This review prompted the producers to begin formulating and writing the following year's show. Walter Kerr was the principal writer for the 1936 musical revue entitled _It Goes to Show_. Kerr graduated the following year and eventually become a famous theatre critic for the _New York Times_. After graduating in 1929, Joe Miller stayed at Northwestern to do graduate work in personnel administration, and Darrell Ware went to Hollywood to write screenplays. In 1931 Northwestern president Walter Dill Scott offered Miller a position on the university's staff as Freshman Advisor and Waa-Mu Director.[8]

In 1938, Waa-Mu board members were not pleased with that year's student-written script. Instead, they staged George Gershwin's musical _Of Thee I Sing_, about a presidential candidate who promises to bring more love to the White House. Actor Tony Randall (who was then known as Leonard Rosenberg), portrayed a boisterous Texas congressman in the production.[9] Only three times in Waa-Mu's history has non-original material been presented; in 1935 with Ray Henderson's musical _Good News_, in 1938, with George Gershwin's musical _Of Thee I Sing,_ and in 1993 with Leonard Bernstein's musical _On the Town_.

Waa-Mu went on hiatus during the World War II years, but was re-launched in 1946. During the three-year break, profits from previous Waa-Mu productions were invested in war bonds. Miller directed the Waa-Mu Show until 1975; his last show was _Quick Change_. He retired on August 31, 1975 and died in 1979. Tom Roland succeeded Miller as the second director of the Waa-Mu productions in 1976. Occasionally, Waa-Mu has been performed off-campus. The show traveled to Chicago several times after its Evanston run, most notably in 1931 (at the Civic Theatre in Chicago) and 1933. And renowned orchestra leader Fred Waring played original Waa-Mu songs on the radio in 1951.

Waa-Mu performances have been presented at Cahn Auditorium since its 1941 production, _Wait A Minute_, premiering on the new stage the same year that Scott Hall was completed. Before performances began in Cahn Auditorium, Waa-Mu productions were held at and around the Evanston area, at the New Evanston Theatre and the National College of Education.

Organization

Several different positions and sub-groups with distinct responsibilities exist within the institution to ease the process of creating an original musical each year. They include:

PROGRAM HEAD: A staff member of the Theatre & Interpretation Center who leads the creation process and makes all final decisions. The Program Head is typically the director of the production as well.

CO-CHAIRS: The student leaders of the organization who work alongside the Program Head to make decisions about creative and administrative matters.

HEAD WRITERS: The student leaders who are in charge of generating and combining material to form a cohesive script for the show.

EXECUTIVE BOARD: A group of students who work under the Co-Chairs to handle all administrative, financial and organizational needs.

CREATING THE MUSICAL CLASS: A large group of students enrolled in a winter class who generate material for the show including: the script, songs, and lyrics.

ORCHESTRATING THE MUSICAL CLASS: A group of students enrolled in a winter class who generate orchestrations for the show; many of whom go on to join Team Music.

TEAM MUSIC: A group of students led by the Music Director that creates all of the orchestrations for the songs generated in the Creating the Musical class as well as the incidental music and overture.

Yet her often annoying mother constantly demands attention and tries to sabotage the reporter's efforts at the paper.

_Another Way West_

The 2016 performance was titled _Another Way West_. The story follows a female researcher, accompanied by her nieces and nephews, on the Oregon Trail searching for her late ancestor. This show merges the journeys of both the researcher and her ancestor on the Oregon Trail.[10]
