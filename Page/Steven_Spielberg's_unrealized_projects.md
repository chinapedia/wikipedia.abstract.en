The following is A LIST OF UNPRODUCED STEVEN SPIELBERG PROJECTS in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director Steven Spielberg has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell in development hell, were officially canceled, or were in development limbo.


1970s

_White Lightning_

Spielberg has confirmed that he turned down the offer to direct _White Lightning_ (1973) in favor of directing _The Sugarland Express_ (1974) instead.[1]

_Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper_

At the beginning of the 1970s, Spielberg tried to greenlight the production of _Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper_, the semi-satirical biography of Thomas Crapper, who, as the book suggested, invented the flushing toilet. Spielberg approached screenwriters Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to write the script.[2] However, the film was never made due to various problems, so Spielberg left the project to direct _The Sugarland Express_.

_Cruising_

In the early 1970s, film producer Philip D'Antoni hired Spielberg to direct a film adaptation of Gerald Walker's novel _Cruising_.[3] Spielberg was reportedly attached to the project for three years before officially dropping out.[4] According to D'Antoni, "We just couldn’t come up with a script that met with my satisfaction... So we decided to abandon the project, and figured we’d go on to do something else together some other day, and Steven went back to LA.”[5] The film adaptation was eventually directed by William Friedkin.[6]

_MacArthur_

Spielberg turned down the offer to direct _MacArthur_, a biopic about the life of Douglas MacArthur.[7][8][9][10]

_The Taking of Pelham One Two Three_

Spielberg also turned down the offer to direct _The Taking of Pelham One Two Three_ (1974).[11][12][13][14]

_The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings_

Spielberg expressed interest in directing _The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings_ (1976), but opted to direct _Jaws_ instead.[15]

_Lucky Lady_

Spielberg was considered to direct _Lucky Lady_ for 20th Century Fox. The script was written by Huyck and Katz and Paul Newman was to have starred in the film had Spielberg directed. However, Spielberg could not direct the film due to his commitment with _Jaws_.[16][17][18]

_Superman: The Movie_

Around 1975, after the success of _Jaws_, Alexander Salkind and his son Ilya wanted to hire Spielberg to direct _Superman: The Movie_, the first theatrical movie based on the Superman comic book series. However, due to Spielberg's commitment to _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, the Salkinds finally hired Richard Donner to direct the film.[19]

_The Adventures of Indiana Smith_

In May 1977, Spielberg met his colleague George Lucas in Hawaii. During that vacation, Lucas convinced Spielberg to make a film based on the film serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas previously wrote a script for the planned film, entitled _The Adventures of Indiana Smith_; in which the main character, Indiana Smith, was based on James Bond.[20] However, at the final moment, both Lucas and Spielberg made many changes to the script, whose concept was used to create _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, and subsequently, the _Indiana Jones_ film franchise.

_Close Encounters of the Third Kind 2_

In late 1977, after the successful reception of _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, Spielberg expressed interest in filming a sequel or a prequel. However, he later refused the idea, because he felt that "The army's knowledge and ensuing cover-up is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves". He also didn't want developer Columbia Pictures to make a sequel without him, which had happened with Universal Pictures' _Jaws_.[21]

_Magic_

In the late 1970s, Spielberg expressed interest in directing a film adaptation of William Goldman's novel _Magic_ and considered casting Robert De Niro for the lead role.[22][23] The film ended up being directed by Richard Attenborough and Spielberg admitted, "...I went to see the picture and realized that it was a hell of a lot better than what I would have done."[24]

_Night Skies_

After his decision not to make a sequel to _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, Spielberg started the development of his next project, a science fiction horror film entitled _Night Skies_, whose concept was pitched by him during the development of _Close Encounters_. The film was intended to be a spiritual follow-up to _Close Encounters_.[25] Lawrence Kasdan was attached to write the screenplay. However, the film wasn't made, although the main concept was the inspiration of two Spielberg's films: _Poltergeist_ and _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ (although the first wasn't directed by Spielberg).[26]


1980s

_Blackhawk_

In the early 1980s, Spielberg announced that he had plans to direct a film adaptation of the Blackhawk comic book series. Dan Aykroyd was attached to play Blackhawk.[27] However, the project never materialized and Spielberg chose to direct _Raiders of the Lost Ark_. In April 2018, new development emerged when it was announced that Spielberg will produce/direct a new film adaptation of _Blackhawk_ for Warner Bros., with the screenplay being written by David Koepp. Spielberg will co-produce the film with Kristie Macosko Krieger and Sue Kroll.[28][29]

_Reel to Reel_

Around 1980, during the filming of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, Spielberg contacted Gary David Goldberg to make a semiautobiographical musical film entitled _Reel to Reel_. The film's plot would have been surrounding a filmmaker named Stuart Moss, and his direction of a musical remake of _Invaders From Mars_.[30] The film was officially announced in production in 1983, but Spielberg finally abandoned the project and chose to direct _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_.[31]

_Three Amigos_

After he finished _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, Spielberg almost planned to direct the comedy _Three Amigos_ next, with Steve Martin, Bill Murray and Robin Williams as the leads. He chose to direct _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ instead.[32][33]

_The Talisman_

Spielberg has made several attempts to make a film adaptation of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 novel _The Talisman_ ever since he and Universal Pictures bought the film rights in 1982.[34][35] In the mid-2000s, Spielberg almost adapted _The Talisman_ into a six-hour miniseries for TNT.[36]

_E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears_

In July 1982, Spielberg hired _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ writer Melissa Mathison to write a script for a sequel film, entitled _E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears_.[37] The film's plot would have shown Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens and follow their attempts to contact E.T. for help. However, Spielberg finally decided to cancel the sequel's production, feeling it "would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity".[38] [39]

_Indiana Jones and the Monkey King_

In September 1984, after the critical and mixed reception of _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_, George Lucas wrote a script entitled _Indiana Jones and the Monkey King_ for the third installment of the film series.[40] The film had the Fountain of Youth as the MacGuffin. Spielberg was attached to direct, but at the final moment, Spielberg decided to hire Chris Columbus to rewrite the script, and the third film ended up being _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_.[41]

_Rain Man_

Spielberg was among the few filmmakers attached to direct _Rain Man_ prior to Barry Levinson's official involvement.[42][43][44][45] It was Spielberg who convinced screenwriter Ronald Bass to make the character of Raymond Babbitt as an autistic savant.[46] Spielberg dropped out as he was obligated to direct _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_.[47][48][49][50] Spielberg regrets not directing _Rain Man_.[51]

_Big_

In addition to _Rain Man_, Spielberg's commitment to _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ also caused him to turn down the offer to direct _Big_ (1988),[52] which was co-written by his sister, Anne Spielberg.[53]

_Who Discovered Roger Rabbit_

In 1989, Spielberg discussed with J.J. Abrams the possibilites of making a sequel to the successful _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ feature film.[54] The sequel's plot would have been Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and Richie Davenport traveling west to seek Roger's mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (Roger's future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts.[55] The film would also have been the first true film from Amblin Entertainment's animation division Amblimation. However, after directing _Schindler's List_, Spielberg refused to direct any films satirizing the Nazis.[56] Michael Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, "This Only Happens in the Movies", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler.[57] Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.

Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for _Who Discovered Roger Rabbit_ was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the Toons completely converted to CGI; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. "There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now."[58]

In December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still "open" to the idea,[59] and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested.[60] According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in motion capture.[61] However, in 2010, Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the Toons handle will be done digitally.[62] Also in 2010, Don Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with _Empire_. He stated, "Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy."[63] In 2010, Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant. However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a year earlier, and died from complications in 2014.[64] Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete.[65] During an interview at the premiere of _Flight_, Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.[66]

In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called _The Stooge_, based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica, his future wife. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.[67] In November 2016, while promoting his latest film _Allied_, in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel "moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s". He also stated that the sequel would feature a "digital Bob Hoskins", as Eddie Valiant would return in "ghost form". While the director went on to state that the script is "terrific" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are "slim". As he explained more in detail, "The current corporate Disney culture [the current studio management of The Walt Disney Company] has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all."[68]


1990s

_Why Can't I Be Audrey Hepburn?_

According to Ryan Murphy on his appearance on the radio program _Fresh Air with Terry Gross_, Ryan sold a script he made for Spielberg called _Why Can't I Be Audrey Hepburn?_ about a woman obsessed with famous film actress Audrey Hepburn who has left at the altar who then meets a man just as Audrey-centric as she. The film was going to star Téa Leoni and Jennifer Love Hewitt as different roles. Spielberg was interested in making it, but the film's production was canceled after nothing new came out of it and Spielberg had a lot of other projects in the 90's he was busy working on.

_Cape Fear_

In the early stages of development, Spielberg was slated to direct the remake of the 1962 film _Cape Fear_ whereas Martin Scorsese would direct _Schindler's List_ (1993).[69] Had Spielberg directed, he envisioned the roles of Max Cady and Sam Bowden to be portrayed by Bill Murray and Harrison Ford respectively.[70] Spielberg eventually decided to swap projects with Scorsese in favor of directing _Schindler's List_ instead.[71] Although he was uncredited, Spielberg did remain as a producer of the remake.[72]

_The Curious Case of Benjamin Button_

In 1991, Spielberg was slated to make a film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for Universal Pictures, with Tom Cruise playing the titular role. However, Spielberg dropped out due to his commitment with the films _Hook_ (1991), _Jurassic Park_ (1993) and _Schindler's List_ (1993).[73][74][75][76]

_Shrek_

Also in 1991, Spielberg bought the rights to William Steig's 1990 children's book _Shrek!_. Spielberg originally envisioned his adaptation as a traditional animated film from Amblin Entertainment, with Bill Murray as the voice of the titular character and Steve Martin as the voice of Donkey. Despite co-founding DreamWorks Animation—the eventual owner of the _Shrek_ franchise—in 1994, Spielberg moved on to other projects.[77][78]

_Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars_

In 1995, a time after the cancellation of _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_, Jeb Stuart wrote a script for the fourth film in the _Indiana Jones_ film series, entitled _Indiana Jones and the Saucermen from Mars_.[79] Spielberg was supposed to direct it, while George Lucas was supposed to serve as producer. Although Lucas loved the script, Spielberg and Ford had issues with it, so Spielberg hired _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ writer Jeffrey Boam to make a rewrite of Stuart's script. However, the script was finally rejected after the release of _Independence Day_, which was released one year later. The fourth film, entitled _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_, was finally released in 2008.

_Meet the Parents_

It was reported that back in 1996, Spielberg was slated to direct Jim Carrey in a remake of Greg Glienna's 1992 film _Meet the Parents_ for Universal Pictures.[80][81] However, Spielberg, along with Carrey, left the project due to schedule conflicts.[82][83] Spielberg's company DreamWorks served as a co-distributor of the 2000 remake.[84]

_Memoirs of a Geisha_

Although he served as a producer of the film, Spielberg initially wanted to direct the adaptation of Arthur Golden's novel _Memoirs of a Geisha_ following its 1997 publication.[85] He decided not to direct it when he agreed to direct _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_ instead.[86]

Early attempt of _Mozart and the Whale_

Early attempt of _The Martian Chronicles_

In 1997, Steven Spielberg and John Davis were producing the film adaptation _The Martian Chronicles,_ with Michael Tolkin and John Orloff were some of the writers who worked on a script, which failed to get off the ground for Universal Pictures. In 2011, Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights and will produce a film franchise with Davis producing through Davis Entertainment.[87]

_The Truman Show_

Spielberg was among the list of filmmakers considered to direct _The Truman Show_ (1998) before Peter Weir officially assumed the position.[88]

_Inspector Gadget_

Prior to the release of the 1999 Disney film _Inspector Gadget_, Spielberg was at one point slated to produce a film adaptation of the 1980s animated series of the same name.[89]

_The Haunting_

Stephen King recalled in the late 1990s that Spielberg attempted to direct _The Haunting_ (1999), with King serving as screenwriter. However, King left the project due to creative differences with Spielberg. As a result, Jan De Bont directed the film instead and Spielberg's studio DreamWorks distributed it.[90]

_I'll Be Home_

In 1999, Spielberg announced that he was working on an autobiographical film, entitled _I'll Be Home_, but nothing came of this project.[91]


2000s

_Harry Potter_

Prior to Chris Columbus's official involvement, Spielberg was considered to direct _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_.[92] Spielberg stated in 2012, "I was offered _Harry Potter_. I developed it for about five or six months with Steve Kloves, and then I dropped out."[93] Spielberg wanted to combine the _Harry Potter_ books into an animated film, but Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn objected.[94] Spielberg also wanted Haley Joel Osment to portray the titular character.[95] Spielberg ultimately backed out as director due to creative differences with J.K. Rowling.[96] He went on to direct _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_ instead.[97]

_The Curse of Monkey Island_

In the start of 2000, Spielberg was set to make his first animated feature film based on the Lucasarts video game series _Monkey Island_, a game series he was a fan of at the time. Spielberg was set to direct, produce and co-write the screenplay with Ted Elliott, with concept arts by the original game's designer Steve Purcell and animator Tony Stacchi, executive produced by Steven's best friend and founder of the game's developer George Lucas (making the second collaboration between Spielberg and Lucas outside the Indiana Jones series), co-production by Lucasfilm (Lucasarts' owner) and animation production by DreamWorks Animation and ILM. Despite the concept arts being released, the film's production was shut down since George was busy making _Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones_ and money problems. However some of the concepts later appeared in Ted's script to _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_ that was made by DreamWorks' rival Disney. Later in 2011, Spielberg made his first animated film with Peter Jackson called _The Adventures of Tintin_.

_Big Fish_

In August 2000, Spielberg was in talks to direct an adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel _Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions_.[98][99][100] Spielberg reportedly wanted Jack Nicholson to portray Edward Bloom.[101] However, he dropped out of the project and was replaced by Tim Burton, who ended up directing the film.[102][103]

_Indiana Jones and the City of Gods_

On May 17, 2002, IGN reported that _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_ writer Frank Darabont will write the fourth film of the film franchise of _Indiana Jones_,[104] entitled _Indiana Jones and the City of Gods_,[105] in which ex-Nazis would chase Indiana Jones. The script is very similar to the final script, including Indy's and Marion's wedding and a scene with army ants, but it didn't include Indiana Jones' son. Spielberg liked the script very much, but George Lucas disliked it, and for that reason, he hired David Koepp to write the film. The film ended up being _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ which was released in 2008, with Spielberg returning as director.

_The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_

John Goldwyn recalled in the spring of 2003 that Spielberg expressed interest in directing the remake of _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_ (1947) for Paramount Pictures on condition that Jim Carrey play the titular role.[106] However, Paramount put the project in turnaround by the end of 2003.[107] The film was eventually remade in 2013, with Ben Stiller serving as director in addition to playing the titular role.[108][109]

_The Catcher in the Rye_

It was reported in 2003 that Spielberg attempted to direct a film adaptation of J.D. Salinger's novel _The Catcher in the Rye_ but could not obtain the rights from Salinger.[110]

_The Goonies 2_

On June 6, 2005, Richard Donner stated that he and Spielberg had written a story for a film sequel of Donner's acclaimed _The Goonies_, despite the fact that the main cast did not have any interest in reprising their roles for a sequel.[111] However, in 2008, Corey Feldman stated on his personal blog that a sequel was unlikely to happen.[112] Although on April 4, 2014, Donner confirmed that a sequel was in the works,[113] it's likely that Spielberg had abandoned the project.

_Interstellar_

The premise for _Interstellar_ was conceived by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film _Contact_ (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[114][115] The two conceived of a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans," and attracted Spielberg's interest in directing.[116] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[117][118] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[119] After Spielberg moved his production studio DreamWorks from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for _Interstellar_. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher Nolan, who joined the project in 2012.[120]

_OldBoy_

Spielberg was attached to adapt the manga Oldboy in the late 2000's. Will Smith was set to star and it was reported to be based on the manga not the earlier film adaptation. The project was abandoned due to rights issues. [121] The film ended up being released on November 27, 2013 directed by Spike Lee and starring Josh Brolin. [122]

_Chocky_

In September 2008, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that Spielberg had acquired the rights of John Wyndham's novelette _Chocky_ to make a film adaptation of it.[123] However, no updates were made after this announcement.

Martin Luther King biopic

On May 19, 2009, it was reported that Spielberg was to make a film about the life of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. after buying the rights to his life story.[124][125][126][127] Spielberg said of the project in 2013, "I wouldn’t call it a biopic, it’s more a story of King and the movement and also about how his admiration for Mahatma Gandhi helped to shape his moral core."[128] As of March 15, 2018, Spielberg still holds the rights to King's story.[129]

_Harvey_

On August 2, 2009, Spielberg stated that he would direct a film adaptation of the play _Harvey_. Will Smith, Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Hanks were considered to play the lead role, while Jonathan Tropper was hired to write the screenplay. DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox would have developed the film.[130] However, Collider confirmed on December 4, 2009, that the project was cancelled due to problems with the lead role selection.[131]

_Pirate Latitudes_ film

In August 2009, Spielberg announced his intention to adapt the novel to film, reportedly having wanted to make a pirate film.[132][133] Spielberg hired David Koepp to pen the screenplay.[134] Anil Ambani's Reliance Big Entertainment and Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios will produce the film, which will be the third of Crichton's novels Spielberg has adapted, after the highly successful _Jurassic Park_ films. This project is still in development.[135]


2010s

George Gershwin biopic

On January 31, 2010, it was reported that Spielberg was going to direct a biopic about the life of composer George Gershwin with Zachary Quinto portraying him.[136][137] Principal photography for the biopic was slated to begin in April that same year,[138][139][140] but it never came to fruition. On February 20, 2013, it was reported that Spielberg was still interested in making a biopic about Gershwin's life.[141]

_Robopocalypse_

On October 22, 2010, Spielberg had signed on to direct a film adaptation of _Robopocalypse_.[142] Chris Hemsworth, Anne Hathaway, and Ben Whishaw had signed on to star in the film.[143] However, on January 9, 2013, _Robopocalypse_ was placed on hold indefinitely mainly because of its production expenses.[144] The next day, Spielberg clarified he was working on a new script that would be "more economically but also much more _personally_".[145] In July 2015, concept artwork was leaked onto the Internet.[146] On March 7, 2018, Michael Bay signed on to direct the adaptation.[147]

_Gods And Kings_

On November 15, 2011, it was reported that Spielberg was in talks with Warner Bros. to direct _Gods And Kings_, a biopic about the life of Moses.[148] On March 4, 2013, it was confirmed that Spielberg dropped out of the project.[149]
