Synopsis

Travelling across the world together, Ulysses Hooten and Lady Alexandra Lindo-Parker, two initially unwilling partners, search for answers for the world's greatest mysteries.[4] From the Amazon rainforest for Percy Fawcett's long-lost camp, to hunting across Russia for the 51st Fabergé egg, the two explore the world of the mythical and legendary. They travel from the snowy Himalayan Mountains in an attempt to track down the only scroll written by Buddha, to the catacombs of Rome to find the Libri Sibyllini, and to Alexandria on the hunt for Alexander the Great's lost tomb.[5] A continuing storyline is of Alex's mother, Lady Lindo-Parker, who attempts to organise her daughter's wedding to her fiancé Edward.
