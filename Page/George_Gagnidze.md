Early life and career

Anthony Tommasini praised his performance in _The New York Times_:[8] “The Georgian baritone George Gagnidze was an exceptionally menacing Scarpia, singing with robust, earthy power and seductive lyricism when the villain turns on the charm”.

Gagnidze made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 2009 in the title role of Giuseppe Verdi's _Rigoletto_.[9] He performed Scarpia in Luc Bondy's new production of Tosca conducted by James Levine in 2009, including a performance that was broadcast in HD in cinemas around the world.[10] He has since returned to the Met as the protagonist of Verdi's Macbeth, Alfio in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Tonio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci and Šakovlity in Modest Mussorgsky's Hovanščina.
