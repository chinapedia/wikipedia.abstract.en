Plot

In 1993 teenager Cameron Post is secretly involved in a romantic lesbian relationship with her friend, Coley Taylor. On homecoming night, Cameron’s boyfriend walks in on them having sex in Coley’s car, ultimately outing them both. Cameron's aunt Ruth, a devout Christian, sends Cameron to God's Promise, a gay conversion therapy center for teenagers. It is run by the strict Dr. Lydia Marsh and her brother, Reverend Rick, who claims that his sister’s methods cured him of his own homosexuality after two members of his church "rescued" him from a gay bar. Cameron's roommate, Erin, represses her homosexuality and earnestly believes in the camp's program.

Cameron befriends two of her fellow "disciples," Jane Fonda, who was raised in a hippie commune, and Adam Red Eagle, a Lakota two-spirit whose father has converted to Christianity. The three teenagers bond over their mutual rebelliousness and scepticism of the camp's purpose.

During a group session, Cameron admits that she thinks Coley is "perfect" and is told by Dr. Marsh that her homosexuality stems from a misplaced urge to be like Coley. She covertly phones Coley and apologizes for how things turned out. Coley says she sent Cameron a letter, but the call is interrupted. After disrupting a kitchen chore session, Cameron has her mail privileges unexpectedly granted by Dr. Marsh. She reads Coley's letter, only to find that Coley blames her for "seducing" her into sin. Jane reads the letter with Cameron and then destroys it, calling Coley weak-willed and treacherous. Crying, Cameron calls her aunt and asks to be brought home but is refused.

Cameron tries to adapt better to life at God's Promise, exercising with Erin to Christian work-out tapes. One night, while Cameron is having a sexual dream, Erin wakes her up and they have sex, which Erin is immediately ashamed of and begs Cameron not to tell anyone.

Another disciple, Mark, who has been expecting to return home shortly, is informed by letter that he must remain at the camp because his father still considers him effeminate. In a group session, Mark breaks down and begins behaving erratically until he is forcibly restrained by Dr. Marsh. That night, Cameron finds large quantities of blood in one of the bathrooms.

The next morning, Dr. Marsh and Reverend Rick call a meeting, announcing that Mark was badly injured during the night and is stable in a hospital, but do not explain what happened. Two of the "disciples" disrupt the meeting, and a series of one-to-one meetings is held instead. During their one-to-one, Rick explains to Cameron that Mark mutilated his own genitals and nearly died before Adam found him. Cameron asks why the staff wasn’t monitoring Mark more closely and asks Rick if he and Dr. Marsh have any idea what they are doing. Rick cannot answer her questions and bursts into tears.

A government inquiry is launched into Mark's self-mutilation, but the investigator is unwilling to accept Cameron's argument that God's Promise is inherently emotionally abusive. Disillusioned, Cameron, Jane and Adam decide to run away from the camp under the pretence of an early morning hike. They walk to a nearby road and hitchhike away from the camp as the film ends.
