_PANDANUS ICERYI_ ("VACOAS") is a species of plant in the Pandanaceae family.[1] It is endemic to Mauritius and critically endangered.


Description

Pandanus_iceryi_-_Monvert_arboretum_visitors_centre_-_Mauritius.jpg]] This is a tall (10m), unbranched tree - the only Mauritian _Pandanus_ species to grow as one single, tall, palm-like trunk, without any branches.

The bright-green leaves end abruptly at the tip, and are armed on the sides with small, white spines. Uniquely, the pale-coloured, oval fruit-head hangs from the main trunk of the plant. Each fruit-head is packed with c.40 drupes.[2][3][4]


Habitat

Its natural habitat is dense forest on Mauritius. It was formerly known from several localities around the island, such as Piton du Milieu, Cent Gaulettes and Fressanges. However the habitat at all these localities has been destroyed.

It is threatened by habitat loss and it was thought to be extinct. It was rediscovered in the Vall√©e de Ferney forests with _Pandanus macrostigma_ in 2004. Currently only a few individual plants remain in the wild, although it is now cultivated in Mauritius.[5]
