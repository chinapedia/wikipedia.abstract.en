UFC BANANA CATSUP is a brand of ketchup owned by Nutri-Asia, Inc. The brand was first introduced in the Philippines in 1969 by Universal Foods Corporation.


History

Banana ketchup was deemed a cheaper alternative than tomato ketchup since bananas were abundant in the Philippines.[1] Filipina food technologist Maria Y. Orosa (1893–1945) is credited with inventing the banana ketchup recipe.[2][3][4]

Coincidentally, Magdalo V. Francisco came up with his own method of making ketchup using bananas in 1938. In 1942, he began commercial production of banana ketchup under the brand name Mafran, a portmanteau derived from the first syllables of his first name and surname. He registered Mafran as a trademark with the Bureau of Patents in the Philippines.

Years later, Francisco approached Tirso T. Reyes for funding to expand his business. This led to the establishment of the Universal Foods Corporation in 1960.[5] Francisco soon left the company due to internal conflicts. Francisco established Jufran Food Industries and launched Jufran Banana Catsup. The name Jufran was derived from Francisco's son and namesake, Magdalo "Jun" Francisco Jr.

In 1969, Universal Foods Corporation launched UFC Tamis Anghang Banana Catsup, made from a unique recipe which combines the sweetness preferred by the Filipino palate with a spicy aftertaste, hence, _tamis-anghang_ (Tagalog for sweet-spicy).

In 1974, Universal Foods Corporation was acquired by Bancom Development Corporation.

In 1996, Southeast Asia Foods, Inc. (SAFI) acquired Universal Foods Corporation. SAFI had also acquired the Mafran and Jufran brands.[6] SAFI evolved into what is now Nutri-Asia, Inc.
