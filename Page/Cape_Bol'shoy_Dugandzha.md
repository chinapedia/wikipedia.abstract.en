CAPE BOL'SHOY DUGANDZHA (, _Mys Bol'shoy Dugandzha_, "Big Dugandzha Cape") is a headland in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia.


Geography

It is a steep-to cape lying in the western Sea of Okhotsk near the Shantar Islands, east of Cape Malaya Dugandzha ("Little Dugandzha Cape") and west of Ptichy Island.[1] It rises to a height of 250 m (820 ft) and forms the eastern point of Lyutsun Bay and the western point of Tugur Bay.[2]


History

American whaleships cruised for bowhead whales off the cape between 1855 and 1889. They called it EAGLE POINT, because it was "inhabited only by eagles, which are very numerous".[3] They often passed between the cape and Ptichy Island when sailing to and from Uda Gulf and Tugur Bay;[4] they also anchored under it to obtain shelter from gales and strong winds.[5]
