RENNY PIERS SMITH (born 3 October 1996), is an English-born Austrian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for FC Dordrecht. He has also represented Austria internationally at under-18 and under-19 level.[1]


Career

Smith was born in Epsom, Surrey, and attended the Whitgift School in South Croydon.[2] He started his career in the youth team at Chelsea where he stayed until early 2013, before he made the decision to leave following a difference in opinion over his playing position.[3] He subsequently joined London rivals Arsenal on a two-year scholarship, a move which followed him being on trial at clubs Liverpool and Manchester City.[4] He featured regularly for Arsenal's youth team over various competitions including the UEFA Youth League, but he failed to make the breakthrough to the first team. He failed to earn a professional deal and was released in the summer of 2015 following the end of his scholarship.[5]

In August 2015, he signed for Championship side Burnley on a three-year contract, following a successful trial against Sheffield.[6] He was placed immediately into the Development Squad. In February 2016 he joined Swedish Superettan side GAIS on a season-long loan, following a successful two-week trial.[7] During his time with the club he made ten league appearances, however, he was predominately used as a substitute or remained on the bench.[8]

In August 2016, he was recalled early from his loan with GAIS and was sold to Italian Serie B side Vicenza for a nominal fee.[9] He made his professional debut for the side in November 2016, replacing Francesco Signori as a substitute in the 1–0 league win over Trapani Calcio.[10] On 31 January 2017, Smith joined Lega Pro side Mantova on loan.[11][12]

On 5 July 2018, Smith joined Dutch side Dordrecht on a three-year deal.[13]


International career

Despite being born in England, Smith qualifies to represent Austria through his maternal grandfather.[14] His father, Renny Sr., alerted the Austrian Football Association of his eligibility, and in April 2014 he received his first call-up to the under-18 side for a friendly against Denmark, after the Association had scouted him in Arsenal youth team fixtures.[15] He made his debut in the 2–1 win.[16]
