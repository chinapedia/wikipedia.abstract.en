Samoa_Cram_Map_1896.jpg The Samoan Islands were first settled some 3,500 years ago as part of the Austronesian expansion. Samoa's early and more current history is strongly connected with the histories of Tonga and Fiji, which are in the same region, and with whom it shares historical, genealogical, and cultural traditions.

European exploration first reached the islands in the early 18th century. Louis-Antoine de Bougainville named them _Navigator Islands_ in 1768. The United States Exploring Expedition (1838–42) under Charles Wilkes reached Samoa in 1839. In 1855 J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn expanded its trading business into the archipelago. The Samoan Civil War of 1886–1894 devolved into the Samoan crisis between colonial powers, followed by the Second Samoan Civil War of 1898/9, which was resolved by partition of the islands in the Tripartite Convention, between the United States, Great Britain and Germany

After World War I, German Samoa became a Trust Territory and eventually became independent as Samoa in 1962. American Samoa remains an unincorporated territory of the United States.


Early History

Archeologists place the earliest human settlement of the Samoan archipelago at around 2850 years before present. This date is based upon the ancient lapita pottery shards found throughout the islands; The oldest evidence being in Mulifanua.[1] This area of Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga, contains evidence from dates of similar times, suggesting the area was settled during the same period. Samoan oral history, however, extends only as far back as AD 1000 Whatever occurred between 750 BC and AD 1000 remains a mystery, though this may have been the period of great migrations that led to the settlement of present-day Polynesia. Another mystery is that the making of pottery suddenly stopped; there is no oral tradition among the people of Samoa that explains this but some theories suggest the lack of available pottery-making materials in Polynesia meant the majority of pottery was imported during migration and not locally sourced or made.

Tagaloa was a Dynasty that ruled a Pacific Empire around Fiji Tonga Samoa, before the emergence of the Tui Manu'a.

Ancient Samoan oral traditions known only by direct descendants ( and hidden for thousands of years) speak of Lumatagi, 'Lu of the winds' who discovered New Zealand, and saw icebergs in the south. He named New Zealand Savai'i laulau. Stretched out Savai'i as they often named volcanic islands after Savai'i. He had a gigantic canoe called 'blink of an eye' because it was so fast. He was also Lufasiaitu, 'Lu the ghost slayer', who defeated Tagaloa and finally ended his power. His grandfather had discovered Hawai'i.

Sketch_map_Samoa_in_the_Pacific.jpg in the Pacific.]] Linguistically, the Samoan language belongs to the Polynesian sub-branch of the Austronesian language family, whose origin is thought to be in Taiwan.

According to oral tradition, Samoa shares the common Polynesian ancestor of Tagaloa.[2] The very earliest history of Samoa concerns a political center in the easternmost Samoan islands of Manu'a, under the rule of the Tui Manu'a. In the Cook Islands to the east, the tradition is that Karika, or Tui Manu'a 'Ali'a, came to the Cook Islands from Manu'a; suggesting that it was from Manu'a and Samoa that the rest of Polynesia developed.

The Tui Manu'a gained his name when he first defeated Tagaloa in a battle over the Faleula , and in doing so was injured gaining the name Tui Manu'a approximately 2,000 years ago. Also there are oral traditions that the name of Samoa based upon Sa Moa 'sacred hen', where Lu ( Lufasiaitu) finally defeated Tagaloa and took all his power and married his daughter. The TuiAtua was one of Tagaloa's titles. Moa was also the family name of the Tui Manu'a so another interpretation is that SaMoa is the family of Moa, the Tui Manu'a. Tui Manu'a and Leifi TuiAtua Faanonofo (son of Lu) ruled Samoa. Tui Manu'a was the elder brother and there are still 2 posts in the meeting house of the Tui Manu'a where only two kings are allowed to sit. The Tui Manu'a and Leifi. The Tui Manu'a controlled a pacific empire, extending over Tonga Fiji, cook islands etc, and Leifi was his war leader. He also fought internal wars. The Red fish of Manu'a went to war and destroyed the Shark of Savai'i.

Leifi also would bestow another TuiAtua title. The TuiAtiua title has always been bestowed by Leifi, mostly in the last 1,000 years at his malae of Kings at Lufilufi. Various families and people would competeeg sons of the TuiManu'a and Leifi would decide who he would give it to. In more modern times, it was mainly the Tama Aiga that Leifi/Fuataga would bestow the TuiAtua on, eg Salamasina. The Papa or 4 titles were all originally created by Leifi, but were later brought together by the Tama Aiga as an important collection of titles. Leifi bestowed the Tui Atua and created the Tui A'ana. He had originally made the Vaetamasoalii and the Ngailetoatele which the people of A'ana and Tuamasaga had asked for, as he would not give them a Tui title. However he had destroyed these lesser titles when he created the TuiA'ana title at his malae, at the last Tofiga of Kings with the Tui Manu'a present. This was the last Samoan Tui created.

This was for services rendered to him by the people of A'aana in a war against Tu'amasaga. This was over the theft of the Pu'a tree (originally Leifi had brought it to Samoa) and the people of A'ana had located it with the Tuamasaga, and killed many to return it. They had piled the bodies of the Tuamasaga warriors as high as a tree, so the saying goes, piled as high as a tree. Then they returned it to Foga'a. Thereby the saying , take all good things to FGoga'a.

Later the 2 lesser titls were used as womens names and these similar ones were passed off as the ancient original ones. These are the Natoitele, and Tamasoali'i.

The Tui Manu'a was ended by the US govt. The bestowed TuiAtua ruled Samoa, but part of Samoa was taken over during the Tongan invasion.

Originally Samoans and Tongans were one people, but as numbers increased, Fiji and Tonga became separate and then made their own Tui titles, Tuifiti and TuiTonga. One of Leifi's titles was Defender of Manu'a, and his island was Tutuila. Leifi fought off many waves of invasion from Fiji and Tonga. Leifi became Fuataga ( now about 76 generations of title holders), TuiAtua Faanofonofo ( The TuiAtua that remains), the Matua, (the Father). Leifi also created and bestowed the Tui A'ana title and gave the people of A'ana control and right to bestow it. There is an ancient saying " All honours of Samoa come from Leifi". However in modern historic times, the Govt and the Tama Aiga ( children of the family) now control Samoa.

Samoa's history early was interwoven with that of certain chiefdoms of Fiji as well as the history of the kingdom of Tonga. The oral history of Samoa preserves the memories of many battles fought between Samoa and neighboring islands. Too, intermarriage of Tongan and Fijian royalty to Samoan nobility has helped build close relationships between these island nations that exist to the present; these royal blood ties are acknowledged at special events and cultural gatherings. Other Samoan folklore tells of the arrival of two maidens from Fiji who brought the tools necessary to create the art of tatau, or in English tattoo, whence came the traditional Samoan _malofie_ (also known as _pe'a_ for men and as _malu_ for women).

The foundation of the cultural tradition of Samoa, or the fa'asamoa came with the rise of the warrior queen Nafanua. Her rule instituted traditions of the fa'amatai or local family and village and regional chiefly systems, a decentralized system. Her niece Salamasina continued under this system and their time is considered a golden age of Samoan cultural traditions.

For a long period, a Tongan aristocracy ruled in Samoa. However they did not defeat all of Samoa. They conquered Upolu, not where the Tui Manu'a was. The highly reverential title "Malietoa" refers to the parting words of Tongan warriors, "Malie toa, malie tau" (literally, "Brave warrior, bravely fought"). This was given by The Tongan King after having finally been driven out of Samoa. The title was amended as part of the more ancient royal courts and titles of Tui A'ana, Tui Atua.


After European Contact

18th century

Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century but did not intensify until the arrival of the British missionaries. In 1722, Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen was the first European to see the islands. This visit was followed by the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), the man who named them the _Navigator Islands_ in 1768. In 1787 Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse visited Samoa, where at Tutuila Island, in what is now American Samoa, there was a conflict leading to deaths on both sides, including the deaths of twelve Frenchmen.

19th century

European and Tahitian and Cook Islander Missionaries and traders, led by John Williams (missionary) began arriving around 1830. Coming via Tahiti, they were known in Samoa as the Lotu Taiti. The Rev. John Williams was helped by the Ali'i Malietoa Vainu'upo to establish the Lotu Taiti, which became the Christian Congregational Church of Samoa.

The United States Exploring Expedition (1838–42) under Charles Wilkes reached Samoa in 1839 and appointed an Englishman, John C. Williams, son of the missionary, as acting U.S. consul.[3] However this appointment was never confirmed by the U.S. State Department; John C. Williams was merely recognized as "Commercial Agent of the United States".[4] A British consul was already residing at Apia.

In 1855 J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn expanded its trading business into the Samoan Islands, which were then known as the Navigator Islands. During the second half of the 19th century German influence in Samoa expanded with large plantation operations being introduced for coconut, cacao and hevea rubber cultivation, especially on the island of 'Upolu where German firms monopolized copra and cocoa bean processing. British business enterprises, harbour rights, and consulate office were the basis on which Britain had cause to intervene in Samoa. The United States began operations at the harbor of Pago Pago on Tutuila in 1877 and formed alliances with local native chieftains, most conspicuously on the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a (which were later formally annexed as American Samoa).

In the 1880s Great Britain, Germany and the United States all claimed parts of the kingdom of Samoa, and established trade posts. The rivalry between these powers exacerbated the indigenous factions that were struggling to preserve their ancient political system. The islands were divided among the three powers in the 1890s, And between the United States and Germany in 1899.[5]

The First Samoan Civil War and the Samoan crisis

Samoan_Crisis_wrecks_2.jpg SMS_Adler_1889_1.jpg The First Samoan Civil War was fought roughly between 1886 and 1894, primarily between rival Samoan factions, although the rival powers intervened on several occasions with military forces. There followed an eight-year civil war, where each of the three powers supplied arms, training, and in some cases, combat troops to the warring Samoan parties.[6] The Samoan crisis came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent, until a massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.[7]

Robert Louis Stevenson arrived in Samoa in 1889 and built a house at Vailima. He quickly became passionately involved in the attendant political machinations. His influence spread to the Samoans, who consulted him for advice, and he soon became involved in local politics. These involved the three colonial powers battling for control of Samoa - America, Germany and Britain - and the indigenous factions struggling to preserve their ancient political system. He was convinced that the European officials appointed to rule the Samoans were incompetent, and after many futile attempts to resolve the matter, he published _A Footnote to History_. The book covers the period from 1882 to 1892.[8] This was such a stinging protest against existing conditions that it resulted in the recall of two officials, and Stevenson feared for a time it would result in his own deportation.[9]

The Second Samoan Civil War and the Siege of Apia

German,_British,_American_warships_in_Apia_harbour,_Samoa_1899.jpg harbour, 1899 (Alfred John Tattersall)]] The Second Samoan Civil War reached a head in 1898 when Germany, Great Britain and the United States disputed over who should control the Samoan Islands.

The BATTLE OF APIA occurred in March 1899. Samoan forces loyal to Prince Tanu were besieged by a larger force of Samoan rebels loyal to powerful chief Mata'afa Iosefo. Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and American warships. Over several days of fighting, the Samoan rebels were defeated.[10]

American and British warships shelled Apia on 15 March 1899; including the USS _Philadelphia_. Following the initial defeat at Apia, Mata'afa's rebels defeated a combined American, British and Tanu allied force at Vailele on 1 April 1899, with the allies in retreat.[11] According to a war correspondent associated with the Auckland Star newspaper, the aftermath saw Mata'afa's warriors leaving American and British corpses on the field being severed of their heads.[12] Germany, Britain and the United States quickly resolved to end the hostilities by partitioning the island chain at the Tripartite Convention of 1899.[13] With Tanu and his American and British allies' inability to defeat him in war, the Tripartite resulted in Mata'afa being promoted to Ali'i Si'i, the high chief of Samoa.[14]


Division of islands

The Samoa Tripartite Convention of 1899, a joint commission of three members composed of Bartlett Tripp for the United States, C. N. E. Eliot, C.B. for Great Britain, and Freiherr Speck von Sternburg for Germany, agreed to divide the islands.

The Tripartite Convention gave control of the islands west of 171 degrees west longitude to Germany, (later known as Western Samoa), containing Upolu and Savaii (the current Samoa) and other adjoining islands. These islands became known as German Samoa. The United States was given control the eastern islands of Tutuila and Manu'a, (present-day American Samoa).[15] In exchange for Britain ceding claims in Samoa, Germany transferred their protectorates in the North Solomon Islands and other territories in West Africa. It does not appear that any Samoans were consulted about the partition and the monarchy was also abolished.


Independence

The Mau movement began in 1908 with the ‘Mau a Pule' resistance on Savai'i, led by orator chief Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe. Lauaki and Mau a Pule chiefs, wives and children were exiled to Saipan in 1909. Many died in exile.[16]

World War I broke out in August 1914, and soon after, New Zealand sent an expeditionary force to seize and occupy German Samoa. Although Germany refused to officially surrender the islands, no resistance was offered and the occupation took place without any fighting. New Zealand continued the occupation of Western Samoa throughout World War I. Under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Germany relinquished its claims to the islands.

In November 1918, the Spanish flu strongly hit the territory. 90% of the 38,302 native inhabitants were infected and 20% died. The American Samoa population was largely spared this devastation, due to vigorous efforts of its Governor. This led to some Samoan citizens petitioning in January 1919 for transfer to U.S administration, or at least general British administration. The petition was recalled a few days later.

The Mau movement gained momentum with Samoa's royal leaders becoming more visible in supporting the movement but opposing violence. On 28 December 1929 Tupua Tamasese was shot along with eleven others during an otherwise peaceful demonstration in Apia. Tupua Tamasese died the following day; his final words included a plea that no more blood be shed.

New Zealand administered Western Samoa, or Samoa i Sisifo in the Samoan language, first as a League of Nations Mandate and then as a United Nations Trust Territory until the country received its independence on 1 January 1962 (from New Zealand) as Western Samoa.[17] Samoa's first prime minister following independence was paramount chief Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II.

Samoa i Sisifo was the first Polynesian people to be recognized as a sovereign nation in the 20th century. Samoa became one of the Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations on 28 August 1970. In 1977, Queen Elizabeth II visited Samoa during her tour of the Commonwealth.

A conflict briefly emerged between Samoa and American Samoa following Samoa's decision to drop the adjective "Western" from its name. The change was made by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Western Samoa adopted on 4 July 1997.[18] The step caused "surprise and uproar" in neighboring American Samoa, as for some American Samoans the change of name implied a claim to be the "real" Samoa and implied that American Samoa was just an American appendix.[19] Some in the American territory said it implied that there was only one Samoa. Two members of American Samoa's legislature traveled to Apia in September 1997 to meet with Samoan head of State Malietoa Tanumafili II, and lobbied to have the name change reversed in order to maintain peace and good relations.[20] An American Samoan petition to the United Nations for a ban on Samoa's using the name Samoa was seriously discussed and ten American Samoan representatives sponsored an unsuccessful bill aimed at preventing American Samoa from recognizing independent Samoa's new name.[21] The proposed American Samoan bill was criticized by independent Samoa's Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana who called the bill "rash and irresponsible".[22]

In 2002, New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark formally apologized for two incidents during the period of New Zealand's administration: a failure in 1918 to quarantine the , which carried the 'Spanish 'flu' to Samoa, leading to an epidemic which devastated the Samoan population, and the shooting of leaders of the non-violent Mau movement during a ceremonial procession in 1929.

In 2007, Samoa's first head of state, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, died at age 95. He held this title jointly with Tupua Tamasese Lealofi until the latter's death in 1963. Malietoa Tanumafili II was Samoa's Head of State for 45 years. He was the son of Malietoa Tanumafili I, who was the last Samoan king recognized by Europe and the Western World.

Samoa's current head of state is His Highness Tui-Atua Tupua Tamasese Tupuola Efi, who was anointed the head of state title with the unanimous endorsement of Samoa's Parliament, a symbol of traditional Samoan protocol in alignment with Samoan decision-making stressing the importance of consensus in the 21st century.


Calendar usage in Samoa

As European traders began commercial (and later domination) activities in the Samoan Islands, they imposed their datekeeping system on their transactions. Thus by the 19th century, Samoan calendars were aligned with those of the other Asiatic countries to the west and south. However, in 1892, American traders convinced the king to alter the country's dating system to align with the United States; thus the country lived through 4 July 1892, twice. But 119 years later, the economic geography of the island had changed, and most business was being done with Australia and New Zealand. To make the jump back to the Asian date Samoa and Tokelau skipped 30 December 2011.[23]
