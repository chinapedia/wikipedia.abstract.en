Early life

Ezekiel Saleh Manasseh was born in Calcutta, the son of Saleh Manasseh, the founder and owner of S. Menasseh & Company (Gunny Rice and Opium Merchants), which was founded in Calcutta in 1883.[1]

In 1885, his father at S. Menasseh & Company was in partnership with Saul Jacob Nathan, and after his death, was replaced by his widow Mrs S Manasseh, and Maurice Saleh Manasseh, Ezekiel Saleh Manasseh, and Reuben Manasseh all joined the partnership.[2]


Career

Manasseh, a rice and opium merchant, had Eden Hall built for him in 1904 to a design by R. A. J. Bidwell, who also designed the Raffles Hotel and the Goodwood Park Hotel.[3] It is now the official residence of the British High Commissioner in Singapore.[4]

In 1918, after the end of World War One and the defeat of Germany, the British government sold what had been the _Teutonia Club_ by public auction to the Manasseh brothers (Morris, Ezekiel and Ellis), who renamed it _Goodwood Hall_ and converted it into the Goodwood Park Hotel. Manasseh continued to be a third owner until his death.[5][6][7]

In 1924â€“1925, Manasseh built numbers 1, 3 and 5 Club Street.[8] In the 1930s, he was the chairman of the Singapore Turf Club.[9] He was a trustee of the Maghain Aboth Synagogue.[10]


Personal life

Manasseh was married and had two stepchildren, Vivian and Molly Bath.[11] His stepson Vivian went to a labour camp on the Japanese island of Hokkaido.[12]

When Singapore was taken by the Japanese in 1942, Manasseh was sent to Changi Prison, and died there on 19 May 1944 in the prison hospital on Sime Road.[13][14][15]

His nephew is the architect Leonard Manasseh, who was born in Eden Hall in 1916.[16]
