Background

The Seekers had been a successful group in the 1960s, disbanding in July 1968 when lead singer Judith Durham left the group. In 1972, the band planned to reform, but needed a suitable female vocalist to replace Durham. Band member Athol Guy asked his friend Buddy England for assistance who said; "After some time looking and listening I came across Louisa Wisseling at a restaurant/club called The Swagman ... took Athol to have a listen ... made Louisa an offer and there you are. I was also asked to vet material for the group to record... I signed them to the Astor label, then went to England to work on the production with the rest of the guys. The album was a success." [2]
