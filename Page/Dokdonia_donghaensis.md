_DOKDONIA DONGHAENSIS_ is a strictly aerobic, gram-negative, phototrophic bacterium that thrives in marine environments. The organism can grow at a broad range of temperatures on seawater media. It has the ability to form biofilms, which increases the organism’s resistance to antimicrobial agents, such as tetracycline.


Discovery and isolation

_Dokdonia donghaensis_ was discovered and isolated from the East Sea in Korea from an island called Dokdo;[1] the date of isolation is not specified. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of the organism revealed two closely related strains, DSW-1T and DSW-21. These strains are classified in _Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides_ (CFB) group, which are dominant genera in marine environments.[2][3] Winogradsky first described _Cytophaga_-like bacteria as unicellular, gliding, non-spore-formers, and Gram-negative rods, although the shape varies. Many _Cytophaga_-like bacterial colonies have pigment due to flexirubin-type pigments that are only found in these bacteria and flavobacteria. _Cytophaga–Flavobacteria_ are chemoorganotrophs and are able to degrade biopolymers like chitin and cellulose.[4]


Morphology and genome

_D. donghaensis_ is a gram-negative bacterium that is rod-shaped, nonmotile, and a non-spore-former. The bacteria are able to grow on seawater media with agar, in which the colonies appear circular, slightly convex, glistening, smooth, yellow, and 1–2 mm in diameter. The DSW-1T strain of _D. donghaensis_ has about 3,923,666 base pairs in its genome.[5] The DNA G+C content for _D. donghaensis_ is 38%.

Pathology

_D. donghaensis_ has not been identified as a human pathogen.


Metabolism

_D. donghaensis_ performs light-driven sodium ion transport. This light-driven proton pump is called a proteorhodopsin, which increases the organism’s survival rate because it can convert light into energy that the organism needs to grow.[6] Since the organism uses light for energy, it is a phototroph. _D. donghaensis_ is able to secrete enzymes such as catalase and oxidase.[7] Since the organism is a strict aerobe, it used oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. The organism can grow on peptone and tryptone as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. _D. donghaensis_ cannot grow in the absence of NaCl or when it is greater than 7% (w/v); growth is optimal at 2% (w/v) NaCl. The organism is susceptible to the antibiotics tetracycline and carbenicillin,[8] although the organism's ability to form biofilms makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the viscous layers.


Habitat

_D. donghaensis_ lives in halophilic marine environments. The organism can grow as low as 4 °C and as high as 35 °C, although the optimum temperature for growth is 30 °C. The optimal pH for growth is 7-8, although growth can be observed at a pH as low as 5.5.[9]


Biofilm formation

_D. donghaensis_ is able to form biofilms in marine habitats, which is a survival strategy that allows the organism to grow while being protected from environmental stresses. Biofilm formation serves a purpose for marine bacteria in that it increases their resistance to antimicrobial agents, desiccation, and grazing.[10][11][12][13] Biofilms allow the microbes to attach to surfaces by excreting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Marine bacteria that adhere to surfaces form host-specific and spatially structured communities that are fairly stable.[14][15][16]
