In 1372, Trần Nghệ Tông has abdicated in favour of his crown prince, so Kính became new emperor. At one Trần Duệ Tông preferred his first wife hereditary title CONSORT HIỂN TRINH (顯貞宸妃). So in 1373, she became EMPRESS HIỂN TRINH (顯貞皇后).

In 1377, Trần Duệ Tông was killed at the Battle of Vijjaya. Empress Hiển Trinh was very heart-broken and she became buddhist nun. After the death of emperor, retired emperor Nghệ Tông in May 1377 passed the throne to Duệ Tông's eldest prince Trần Hiện. So empress Hiển Trinh became DOWAGER EMPRESS GIA TỪ (嘉慈皇太后). By _Dream memoir of Southern Man_, she opposed the accession of her son because she felt its dangers.[1]
