The HARDWARE BUILDING was a historic building located in Wadena, Iowa, United States. Completed in 1873, this two-story gabled structure was completely composed of limestone.[1] At some point the second floor of the main facade was covered with brick and it had a patterned brick cornice. The first floor sat high off the ground and was accessed by a double exterior staircase. Originally, the building housed a hardware store on the main floor, a storeroom on the second floor, and a saloon in the basement. In later years it housed the post office and the local telephone exchange. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[2] It has subsequently been torn down.
