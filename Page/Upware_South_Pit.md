UPWARE SOUTH PIT is a 1.1 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) north of Upware in Cambridgeshire.[1][2] It is a Geological Conservation Review site.[3]

This site has rocks dating to the Oxfordian stage, around 160 million years ago. It was then a coral reef, and has fossils of bivalves and ammonites, as well as corals, which show affinities with the fauna of the Tethys Ocean. It is described by Natural England as a key site in study of the Oxfordian.[4]

There is access to the site from the Fen Rivers Way north of Upware. A small area of pasture in the north of the site, which is not open to the public, is also part of the Cam Washes biological SSSI.
