PLACENTIA is a planned Metrolink rail station located in the city of the same name. It will be served by Metrolink's 91 Line.

Orange County Transportation Authority started discussing the station as early as 2012.[1] A station planned for neighboring Yorba Linda was rejected by its local city council in 2004.[2]The project was approved by the city in 2016, with construction planned to begin in 2018. Construction of the station and parking structure is planned to conclude in 2021,[3] whereupon it is expected to enter revenue service. A former packing house was demolished on the site to make way for the station.[4][5] , construction has been delayed owing to negotiations between Metrolink and the track's owners, BNSF.[6]

The cost of the project is due at $34.8 million,[7] of which the city pledged $5.4 million.[8] In 2014, the project was pegged at an estimated $23.42 million,[9] while a 2012 estimate was between $7.5â€“9 million.[10]
