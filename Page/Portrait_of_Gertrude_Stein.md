Reception

In _The Guardian_, Jonathan Jones argued, “Ever since the Renaissance, the portrayal of women had been shaped by ideals of beauty and constrained social roles. Picasso’s _Portrait of Gertrude Stein_ turns all that upside down. Stein has escaped from the confining categories with which western art previously ensnared women. She is neither old nor young, sexual nor submissive – her stone face makes her something new on Earth. She is in command of her identity.”[3]
