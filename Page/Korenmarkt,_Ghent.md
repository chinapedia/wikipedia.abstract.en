Gent_Koren_002.JPG 20110410_Gent_(0039).jpg KORENMARKT (; ) is a city square in the historic center of Ghent, Belgium. Located between the Leie river and St. Nicholas' Church, it is one of the city's most important and famous tourist locations. The square is surrounded with several historic buildings, which today house bars, restaurants and terraces.[1] It is a pivotal location of the annual Gentse Feesten cultural festival.


Locale

The Korenmarkt connects Ghent's two busiest shopping streets, Veldstraat and Kortemunt, from south to north. From west to east it connects St. Michael's Bridge over the Leie river with St. Nicholas' Church. The western side gives access to the Leie waterfront, notably the Graslei.


History

The square's name _()_ is derived from the cereal trade which dates back to the 10th/11th century when Ghent was the center of the cereal trade in the County of Flanders. Cereal that was brought into the city via the nearby Graslei and Korenlei by the Leie river, was sold on the market place.
