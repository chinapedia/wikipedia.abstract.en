_CHABERTIA OVINA_, the large-mouthed bowel worm, is a species of parasitic roundworms that infects sheep, goats (occasionally cattle) and other wild ruminants. Infection of pigs are very infrequent. It is not known to be contagious to humans.

The disease caused by _Chabertia_ worms is called chabertiasis or chabertiosis.

It is found worldwide but is more frequent in temperate regions.
