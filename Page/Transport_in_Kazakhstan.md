The vast territory of Kazakhstan spans across . The population density is low in Kazakhstan, and the centers of industry and agriculture are spread out and remote from world markets. Therefore, the need for efficient transportation in Kazakhstan is great.

Kazakhstan is committed to regional infrastructure development.[1] According to the Kazakhstan Ambassador to the U.S., Kairat Umarov, Kazakhstan invested $18 billion in construction of airports, highways, and railroads in 2014.[2]


Railways

_Total:_ Railways provide 68% of all cargo and passenger traffic to over 57% of the country. There are in common carrier service, excluding industrial lines.[3]

_Broad Gauge:_ of gauge, electrified, in 2012.[4]

Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) is the national railway company. KTZ cooperates with French loco manufacturer Alstom in developing Kazakhstan's railway infrastructure. Alstom has more than 600 staff and two joint ventures with KTZ and its subsidiary in Kazakhstan.[5] In July 2017, Alstom opened its first locomotive repairing center in Kazakhstan. It is the only repairing center in Central Asia and the Caucasus.[6]

As the Kazakhstani rail system was designed during the Soviet era, rail routes were designed ignoring inter-Soviet borders, based on the needs of Soviet planning. This has caused anomalies, such as the route from Oral to Aktobe passing briefly through Russian territory. It also means that routes might not suit modern-day Kazakhstani needs.[7]

Astana Nurly Zhol railway station, the most modern railway station in Kazakhstan, was opened in Nur-Sultan on 31 May 2017. The opening of the station coincided with the start of the Expo 2017 international exhibition. According to Kazakhstan Railways (KTZ), the station is expected to be used by 54 trains a day and has capacity to handle 35,000 passengers a day.[8]

Railway links with adjacent countries

-   Russia - same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system)

-   China - break of gauge /;

    -   Border station at Druzhba, KZ - Alashankou, CN, connection between the Turkestan–Siberia Railway and the Northern Xinjiang Railway (no electrification on them).
    -   Another connection is from Altynkol Railway Station near Khorgas to the Jinghe–Yining–Khorgos Railway towards Ürümqi.

-   Kyrgyzstan - same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system)

-   Uzbekistan - same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system)

-   Turkmenistan - same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system) (railway link opened in 2013, presently for freight)

-   Caspian Sea - railhead

The strategy of transport development in Kazakhstan until 2015 is to build of new electrified and of existing railway stations.

The Khorgos Gateway dry port is one of Kazakhstan's primary dry ports for handling trans-Eurasian trains, which travel more than 9,000 km between China and Europe. The Khorgos Gateway dry port is surrounded by Khorgos Eastern Gate SEZ that officially commenced operations in December 2016.[9]

Rapid transit and tram systems

Almaty

There is a small metro system in Almaty. Second and third metro lines are planned in the future. The second line would intersect with the first line at Alatau and Zhibek Zholy stations.[12]

In May 2011, the construction of the second phase of the Almaty Metro line 1 began. The general contractor is Almatymetrokurylys. Currently more than of tunnels on the extension project have been excavated. The extension includes five new stations, and will connect the downtown area of Almaty with Kalkaman in the suburbs. Its length will be .[13]

The construction is divided into three phases. The first phase (the current phase) will be the addition of two stations: Sairan and Moscow, a length of .[14] For more details see: Almaty Metro.

There was a tram system of 10 lines which operated from 1937 to 2015.[15]

Nur-Sultan

The Astana Metro system is under construction.

It's been a long time coming and the project was abandoned at one point in 2013,[16] but an agreement was signed on 7 May 2015 for the project to go ahead.[17]

Oskemen

The system was opened between 1959 and 1978, and the tram was a popular form of transport in Oskemen/Ust-Kamenogorsk until its closure in 2018.[18] At its peak it had six routes, but in the end it had four routes in operation. It had a fleet of 50 working tram cars.[19]

Pavlodar

There is an tram network, which began service in 1965 with, , 20 regular and three special routes. The network has a 60% share of the local public transport market. Its fleet of 115 trams are due to be replaced and in 2012, the city announced plans to purchase 100 new trams.[20]

Temirtau

There are two tram lines in this city.[21]


Highways

alfarabi3.jpg Kazakhstan has a road network stretching over , most of which is in need of modernization and repair. It is, however, notable for containing the easterly terminus of European route E40, which contains the most easterly section of the Euro Route network.

-   _Total:_ (2002)[22]
-   _Paved:_  (2002)
-   _Unpaved:_  (2002)

It is stated in the _CIA Factbook_ that Kazakhstan has a total road network of which is made up of: paved, and unpaved, (2008).[23]

, there were 3,264,400 registered cars.[24]

, there were 3 845 301 registered cars, total 4 425 770 unit of autotransport by information «Казинформ»(Kazinform 1).[25]

Five international routes pass through Kazakhstan, totaling . These highways are:

-   M-36 Highway: Almaty – Nur-Sultan – Kostanay (continues to Chelyabinsk)
-   Almaty – Petropavl to Omsk with the release of

-   M-39 Highway: Almaty - Shymkent (continues to Tashkent)
-   M-32 Highway: Shymkent - Aktobe - Oral (continues to Samara)

In 2009, the country began the construction of the "Western Europe - Western China" highway, which will be completed . The total length of the road will be , of which will be in Kazakhstan, (Aktobe, Kyzylorda, South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl and Almaty oblasts). The thickness of the asphalt and concrete pavement will be , and the expected lifespan of the highway will be 25 years, without a major overhaul, and the maximum speed limit . The project includes a number of bridges over rivers, road maintenance facilities, bus stop areas, _avtopavilony_, cattle trails, and electronic signage. Simultaneously with the construction of this highway, roads will be repaired and built in areas along its route.[26][27][28]

Motorways

The motorway network in Kazakhstan is rather underdeveloped, mainly due to the low population density in the country, which doesn't require wider roads on long distances. The following are the only existing multi-lane, double carriage roads in Kazakhstan:

-   A1 - Runs from Nur-Sultan to Shchuchinsk. It further continues as the A1 two-lane highway to Kokshetau. Motorway length: .
-   A2 - Runs from Almaty to a point past Uzynagash. It further continues as the A2 two-lane highway to Shymkent. Motorway length: .
-   A2 - Other four-lane portion runs from Shymkent to Zhibek Zholy, on the border with Uzbekistan. Length: .
-   A3 - Runs from Almaty to Kapshagay. It further continues as the A3 two-lane highway to Oskemen. Motorway length: .

Total: 490 km

Airlines

P4-PAS.JPG aircraft at Aktau Airport.]] European Commission blacklisted all Kazakh carriers in 2009, with a sole exception of Air Astana. Since then, Kazakhstan was consistently taking measures to modernize and revamp its air safety oversight. Thus, in 2016 the European air safety authorities removed all Kazakh airlines from blacklist and there was “sufficient evidence of compliance” with international standards by Kazakh airlines and the Civil Aviation Committee.[37]

AIR ASTANA - most popular Kazakhstani Air operator Air Astana (Эйр Астана) is the principal airline and the flag carrier of the Republic of Kazakhstan, based in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[38] It operates scheduled domestic and international services on 56 routes from its main hub, Almaty International Airport, and from its 2 secondary hubs, Astana International Airport and Atyrau Airport. It is a joint venture between Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna (51%), and BAE Systems PLC (49%). It was incorporated in October 2001, and started commercial flights on 15 May 2002. At the 2012 World Airline Awards held at Farnborough Airshow in the UK, Air Astana was named the _Best Airline in Central Asia & India_.[39]

QAZAQ AIR - New airline Qazaq Air was founded in 2015.
