The Hungarians won the battles of Hatvan (2nd of April), Tápióbicske (4th of April), Isaszeg (6th of April), Vác (10th of April), Nagysalló (19th of April), in 26 April relieved the fortress of Komárom from a long Austrian siege, than at 21 May 1849 liberated the Castle of Buda, concluding the Spring Campaign.

On the other theaters of operations, the Hungarians also scored victories against the enemies of the revolution.

In Transylvania, the Hungarian army led by Józef Bem, after the victory against the Austro-Russian forces in the Battle of Nagyszeben, liberated most of the provinces territory (excepting the fortresses of Gyulafehérvár, Déva, with imperial garrison and the Erdélyi-középhegység mountains, held by the Romanian insurgents).

In southern Hungary the Hungarians led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem defeated the Serbian insurgents and Austrian troops, liberating the provinces of Bácska and Bánság, except the fortress of Temesvár and Titel.

In southern Dunántúl, the popular uprising led by Gáspár Noszlopy, also led to the liberation of this region from imperial occupation.

During the Spring Campaign, the Hungarians liberated much of their country from the Habsburg rule. The Habsburg armies and their allies, besides the fortresses and mountains mentioned above, remained only in the Westernmost territory strip of Hungary, Croatia and the fortress of Arad. Also the result of the victories of the Spring Campaign was the Hungarian Declaration of Independence on 14th of April 1849, resulting the Hungarian total independence for some months before the Russian intervention brought the defeat, in the Summer Campaign of the Hungarian revolution and liberty.
