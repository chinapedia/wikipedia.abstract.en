TIAGO VENÂNCIO ALVES PIRES (born 20 October 1991), known as TIAGO PORTUGA or simply TIAGO, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Spanish club CD Ebro as a left back.


Football career

Brazil

Born in Braga, Minho Province, Portuga started his senior career in Brazil after moving to that country at 8 months of age. He competed solely in the lower leagues or amateur football during his spell there, being part of Grêmio Barueri Futebol's Série B roster in 2012 but failing to appear in any matches.[1]

Portugal

Portuga returned to his homeland midway through 2013–14, signing a short-term contract with Segunda Liga club C.D. Trofense.[2] He made his professional debut on 16 February, starting and playing 61 minutes in a 1–3 home loss against C.D. Aves;[3] he made 18 appearances in his only full season, which ended in relegation.

For the 2015–16 campaign, Portuga joined third division side AD Oliveirense.

Spain

Portuga moved to Spain in the summer of 2016, representing in quick succession Segunda División B teams CF Rayo Majadahonda,[4] CCD Cerceda[5] and CD Ebro.[6] On 30 October 2018, he was sent off midway through the first half of the Copa del Rey tie against Valencia CF at La Romareda, but the La Liga club could only win 2–1 eventually.[7]
