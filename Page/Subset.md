In mathematics, a set _A_ is a SUBSET of a set _B_, or equivalently _B_ is a SUPERSET of _A_, if _A_ is "contained" inside _B_, that is, all elements of _A_ are also elements of _B_. _A_ and _B_ may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called INCLUSION or sometimes CONTAINMENT. _A_ is a subset of _B_ may also be expressed as _B_ includes _A_; or _A_ is included in _B_.

The subset relation defines a partial order on sets.

The algebra of subsets forms a Boolean algebra in which the subset relation is called inclusion.


Definitions

If _A_ and _B_ are sets and every element of _A_ is also an element of _B_, then:

:* _A_ is a SUBSET of _B_, denoted by A ⊆ B,

    or equivalently
    -   _B_ is a SUPERSET of _A_, denoted by B ⊇ A.

If _A_ is a subset of _B_, but _A_ is not equal to _B_ (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of _A_), then

:* _A_ is also a PROPER (or STRICT) SUBSET of _B_; this is written as A ⊊ B.

    or equivalently
    -   _B_ is a PROPER SUPERSET of _A_; this is written as B ⊋ A.

For any set _S_, the inclusion relation ⊆ is a partial order on the set 𝒫(S) of all subsets of _S_ (the power set of _S_) defined by A ≤ B ⇔ A ⊆ B. We may also partially order 𝒫(S) by reverse set inclusion by defining A ≤ B ⇔ B ⊆ A.

When quantified, is represented as: }.[1]


Properties

-   A set _A_ is a SUBSET of _B_ if and only if their intersection is equal to A.

    Formally:
    A ⊆ B ⇔ A ∩ B = A.

-   A set _A_ is a SUBSET of _B_ if and only if their union is equal to B.

    Formally:
    A ⊆ B ⇔ A ∪ B = B.

-   A FINITE set _A_ is a SUBSET of _B_ if and only if the cardinality of their intersection is equal to the cardinality of A.

    Formally:
    A ⊆ B ⇔ |A ∩ B| = |A|.


⊂ and ⊃ symbols

Venn_A_subset_B.svg showing
_A_ is a proper subset of _B_,  _A_⊂_B_,  and conversely _B_ is a proper superset of _A_.]] Some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate _subset_ and _superset_ respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊆ and ⊇.[2] So for example, for these authors, it is true of every set _A_ that .

Other authors prefer to use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate _proper_ (also called strict) subset and _proper_ superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊊ and ⊋.[3] This usage makes ⊆ and ⊂ analogous to the inequality symbols ≤ and <. For example, if then _x_ may or may not equal _y_, but if , then _x_ definitely does not equal _y_, and _is_ less than _y_. Similarly, using the convention that ⊂ is proper subset, if , then _A_ may or may not equal _B_, but if , then _A_ definitely does not equal _B_.


Examples

PolygonsSet_EN.svg

-   The set A = {1, 2} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3}, thus both expressions A ⊆ B and A ⊊ B are true.
-   The set D = {1, 2, 3} is a subset (but _not_ a proper subset) of E = {1, 2, 3}, thus D ⊆ E is true, and D ⊊ E is not true (false).
-   Any set is a subset of itself, but not a proper subset. (X ⊆ X is true, and X ⊊ X is false for any set X.)
-   The empty set { }, denoted by ∅, is also a subset of any given set _X_. It is also always a proper subset of any set except itself.
-   The set {_x_: _x_ is a prime number greater than 10} is a proper subset of {_x_: _x_ is an odd number greater than 10}
-   The set of natural numbers is a proper subset of the set of rational numbers; likewise, the set of points in a line segment is a proper subset of the set of points in a line. These are two examples in which both the subset and the whole set are infinite, and the subset has the same cardinality (the concept that corresponds to size, that is, the number of elements, of a finite set) as the whole; such cases can run counter to one's initial intuition.
-   The set of rational numbers is a proper subset of the set of real numbers. In this example, both sets are infinite but the latter set has a larger cardinality (or _power_) than the former set.

Other properties of inclusion

Subset_with_expansion.svg Inclusion is the canonical partial order in the sense that every partially ordered set (_X_, ≼) is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The ordinal numbers are a simple example—if each ordinal _n_ is identified with the set [_n_] of all ordinals less than or equal to _n_, then _a_ ≤ _b_ if and only if [_a_] ⊆ [_b_].

For the power set 𝒫(S) of a set _S_, the inclusion partial order is (up to an order isomorphism) the Cartesian product of _k_ = |_S_| (the cardinality of _S_) copies of the partial order on {0,1} for which 0 < 1. This can be illustrated by enumerating _S_ = {_s_₁, _s_₂, ..., _s__(_k_)} and associating with each subset _T_ ⊆ _S_ (which is to say with each element of 2^(_S_)) the _k_-tuple from {0,1}^(_k_) of which the _i_th coordinate is 1 if and only if _s__(_i_) is a member of _T_.
