Taruffi-Dusio-Savonuzzi.jpg, Piero Dusio and Giovanni.]] GIOVANNI SAVONUZZI (Ferrara 28 January 1911 –– Ferrara 18 February 1988) was an Italian automobile designer.

Savonuzzi received a degree in Mechanical engineering from Politecnico di Torino in 1939 and worked for Fiat Aviazione and taught in Aeronautics at the _politecnico_. During World War II he served in Albania. In August 1945[1] he succeeded Dante Giacosa as technical director of the Cisitalia carmaker, first completing Giacosa's Cisitalia D46 cigarshaped racing car. Before he left for in 1948 due to a disagreement, he had sketched out the Spider Nuvolari and the 202 CMM Aerodinamica Savonuzzi (to be built by Pininfarina).[2]

He designed the SVA Midget racer while with _Società Valdostano Automotori_ (SVA) 1948–49, lectured at _politecnico_ and had some freelance work, including for Cisitalia in 1951 under Carlo Dusio, leading to a short collaboration with Ford led to his chassis design for the 808X prototype.

As the technical director for Carrozzeria Ghia under Luigi Segre from 1953 to 1957, Savonuzzi developed the "Supersonic" series inspired by gas turbines (as a result of his access to wind tunnels at the _politecnico_). First one-off car was an Alfa Romeo 1900 tuned by Conrero for Mille Miglia race. He then applied this to Fiat 8V (14 chassises), DeSoto Adventurer II, Jaguar XK120 (three chassises) and Aston Martin DB2/4.[3]

Even more futuristic and bold styling saw the 1955 Ghia "Gilda" (named after Rita Hayworth),[4] and a less radical Ferrari 410 Gilda Superamerica.

From 1957 to 1969 Savonuzzi worked under research director George J. Huebner (1910–96) for the turbine department of Chrysler in Detroit, being chief engineer for automotive research from 1962.[5] The resulting Chrysler Turbine Car 1962–64 were not designed by Savonuzzi, but bodied by Carrozzeria Ghia. He also studied crash-proof cars.[6] Following some time as Director of R&D under Gianni Agnelli at Fiat, he devoted himself to teaching at the _politecnico_ until retirement in 1977.[7]
