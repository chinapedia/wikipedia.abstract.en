At the request of the consultative council, the park was renamed the Campina do Encantado State Park on 26 May 1999. The management plan was prepared by the São Paulo State Foundation for Forest Conservation and Production (Fundação para a Conservação e a Produção Florestal do Estado de São Paulo).

Archaeology

There are several archaeological sites, middens containing fragments of shells, bones and other objects. Two of them are in diameter and high. The shell mounds are between 5,870 and 4,974 years old. At present they are from the sea shore, and above sea level. The sea was higher when the mounds were formed, and there was an extensive network of lagoons in the area that reached its maximum extent about 5,100 year ago.


Environment

The environment has been preserved because 50% is subject to periodic flooding and 25% is permanently flooded, cutting off access to the 25% that is higher arable land. The park holds a peat bog over thick. The name "Campina do Encantado" (Enchanted Field) is due to the peat generating methane gas which can burn with a flame shooting from the ground up to high. Vegetation is dominated by _restinga_ forest, swamp forest and _várzea_ forest. The flora is rich in _Bromeliaceaes_ and _Araceaes_. The park has diverse fauna, including the endangered red-tailed amazon (_Amazona brasiliensis_).
