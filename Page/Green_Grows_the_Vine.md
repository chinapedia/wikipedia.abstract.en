_GREEN GROWS THE VINE_ (1960) is a novel by Australian writer Nancy Cato.[1]


Story outline

The novel follows the story of three women - Mandy, Mitch and Maria - who travel from Adelaide to pick grapes in the fictional South Australian wine-growing district of Vindura. All are escaping disappointments - death and broken relationships - and the time spent in the country offers them all a chance of renewal.


Critical reception

A short review in _The Canberra Times_ described the novel as "Another pleasantly earthy though quite undistinguished love story."[2]


Notes

-   First written as 'The Budding Leaf' (unpublished). Cato threw this first version into the Thames while she was in London, and later re-wrote it.[3]
