A NIGHTCLUB ACT is a production, usually of NIGHTCLUB MUSIC or COMEDY, designed for performance at a nightclub, a type of drinking establishment, by a NIGHTCLUB PERFORMER such as a NIGHTCLUB SINGER or NIGHTCLUB DANCER, whose performance may also be referred to as a _nightclub act_. A scheduled performance, such as a wedding gig, is a CLUB DATE.[1]

Acts may resemble revues and, "a good part of the music heard in nightclubs is standard popular song (jazz standards and the so-called Great American Songbook) and theater music repertoire...comedy songs, novelty songs, and the occasional torch song."[2] "Cabaret, literally, is a subset of nightclub performance...In actual modern usage the terms 'nightclub' and 'cabaret' are virtually interchangeable."[3]

The role of the female nightclub singer occurs frequently in fiction: books, movies, television, and even songs; she may serve as temptress, kidnapping or abuse victim, femme fatale, gangster moll, prostitute, or as a double agent. Due to censorship, nightclub singer was and is often used to replace a prostitute's character in adaptations of books to movies.

Nightclub acts were more common in the past, as modern nightclubs have moved towards dance music, DJs, and rave like environments. However, musicians such as David Bowie and Madonna have played nightclub singers in music videos and live performances. In New York City, since 1985, successful, enduring, or innovative cabaret acts have been honored by the annual Bistro Awards.[4]
