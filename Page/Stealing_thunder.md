The taking of the idea for such a mechanism is the origin of the concept.]] STEALING THUNDER is to take someone else's idea, using it for one's own advantage or to pre-empt the other party.


Origin

The idiom comes from the peevish dramatist John Dennis early in the 18th century, after he had conceived a novel idea for a thunder machine.[1] There is an account of it in _The lives of the poets of Great Britain and Ireland_ by Robert Shiels and Theophilus Cibber:[2]


Rhetorical use

In a contentious situation, such as a court case, political debate or public relations crisis, it is a tactic used to weaken the force of an adverse point.[3] By introducing the point first and being open about it or rebutting it, the force of the opposition's argument is diminished â€“ their thunder is stolen.[4]
