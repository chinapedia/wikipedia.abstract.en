In 2006, she was part of the Daz Sampson's group in the 2003 UK entry to Eurovision in "Teenage Life", as one of the girl backing vocalists to Sampson, joining Holly, Leeanne, Ashlee and Gabriella. The other backing vocalists were just amateurs applying for the song. Emily Reed the only one with singing experience in the five was replacing Jessica, an original qualifying amateur girl. Management had decided Jessica could not take part for various considerations, including her age and decided to take in Reed herself. The song finished 19th out of the 24 acts.

In 2009, she was featured vocalist on Insight's single "Heaven Help Me Now".
