GREGORY BROUSSARD (born August 31, 1963 in Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name EGYPTIAN LOVER, is an American musician, vocalist, producer and DJ, and was an important part of the L.A. dance music and rap scene in the early 1980s.[1]


History

The Egyptian Lover started out as a DJ in Los Angeles with Uncle Jamm's Army, DJing dances as large as the L.A. Sports Arena with 10,000 people.[2] He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, as well as Uncle Jamm's Army.

Most of the Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12" singles. He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular than his singles. On the strength of an alternate mix of his most popular single "Egypt, Egypt", 1984's _On the Nile_ was moderately successful. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with _Back from the Tomb_, his first full-length album in over ten years.

The Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as Rodney O & Joe Cooley 2 Oclock & Te & Joezee.

His 2015 release, _1984_, continues his tradition of using all analog equipment, including his famed Roland TR-808 (which he is widely known as "the king of"), along with much of the same gear used on his recordings of the 1980s. The name "1984" refers to his earlier albums. The album was recorded at Skip Saylor, Encore Studios, and at RUSK Studios, the same studio where _On The Nile_ was recorded in 1984. It is widely available on double gatefold LP, CD and cassette tape.
