The 1974 BOSTON UNIVERSITY TERRIERS FOOTBALL TEAM represented Boston University as a member of the Yankee Conference during the 1974 NCAA Division II football season. In its second season under head coach Paul Kemp, the team compiled a 5–4–1 record (3–3 against conference opponents), placed in a four-way tie for third in the Yankee Conference, and outscored opponents by a total of 145 to 129.[1]

When coach Paul Kemp took over at Boston University in 1973, he inherited a team that finished 2–8 in 1972. The team improved to 3–8 in 1973. Kemp termed the 1974 season "Project Turnabout", and the team opened with three wins and one loss.[2] The team went 2–3–1 in its final four games, but still wound up with the program's first winning season since 1970.[3] Near the end of the season, coach Kemp said: "We're happy with our winning season. I think we're a pretty good team and we've been getting better in each game."[4]

Several Boston University players received post-season honors in 1974. Five were named to the All-Yankee Conference football team selected by the conference coaches: offensive tackle Jim Roderick, offensive guard Kevin Brooks, center Don Chrisos, linebacker Gary Dziama, and cornerback Rick Porter.[5][6] Two (Chrisos and Dziama) were also named first-team players on the All-New England team.[7]

Boston University played its home games on Nickerson Field, which was part of the Case Sports Complex and was formerly known as Braves Field, the home of the Boston Braves.[8]
