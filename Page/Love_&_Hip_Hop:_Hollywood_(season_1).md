Production

On August 18, 2014, VH1 announced _Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood_, the Los Angeles-based spin-off of _Love & Hip Hop_, would make its series premiere on September 15, 2014.[1] On September 8, 2014, a 4 minute "super-trailer" was released, along with _Meet the Cast of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood_, an 11-minute promo video featuring interviews with the cast. The series would star Ray J, Soulja Boy, Omarion and his girlfriend Apryl Jones, Lil' Fizz and his ex-girlfriend Moniece Slaughter, Teairra Marí and former celebrity publicist Hazel-E, with Ray's assistant Morgan Hardman, Teddy Riley's daughter Nia Riley, Fizz's girlfriend Amanda Secor, Yung Berg, radio personality Yesi Ortiz, club promoter Sincere Show, socialite Nikki Mudarris and video vixen Masika Kaylsha as supporting cast members.[2] Although not mentioned in the initial cast announcement, Omarion's mother Leslie Burrell would also appear as a supporting cast member.

On November 5, 2014, Yung Berg was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and fellow cast member Masika, several hours after the taping of the reunion special. VH1 released a statement that he had been terminated from the show effective immediately.[3][4] On December 8, 2014, series creator Mona Scott-Young expressed regret for the firing, saying it was a network decision.[5] The two-part reunion aired with a public service announcement about domestic violence, along with a statement by VH1 condemning Berg's actions.
