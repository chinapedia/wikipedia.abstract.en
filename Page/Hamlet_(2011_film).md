Reception

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 0% of five surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 2/10.[3] Joe Leydon of _Variety_ wrote that the film "seldom rises above the level of a good try" but may intrigue fans and scholars with the decisions made in compressing the narrative to 90 minutes.[4] Nicolas Rapold of _The New York Times_ wrote, "While Mr. Ramsay accomplishes some kind of a trick in streamlining the play, his trimming of corners feels more like a taking away of the center."[5] Annlee Ellingson of the _Los Angeles Times_ negatively compared its creativity to _Much Ado About Nothing_ and called it "a focused, if at times melodramatic, take on the play's beating heart".[6]
