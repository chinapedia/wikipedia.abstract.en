SHAH TURAB UL HAQ Qadri (15 September 1944 - 6 October 2016) (Urdu: شاہ تراب الحق قادری) was a Hyderabadi-origin Sunni Muslim scholar and preacher representing the Barelvi Sufi sect in Karachi.

SHAH TURAB UL HAQ was born in 1944 in Hyderabad, India, and his family migrated to Pakistan after the Partition. He got his religious education from Darul Uloom Amjadia in Karachi and later began his political career by contesting the local government elections for the seat of councillor and later served as member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 1985 to 1988.[1]

He was the direct Khalifa of Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri (the son of Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi) and therefore lead the Jamaat Ahle Sunnat as its Amir.[2]

He was also the Khalifa of his father-in-law, Muhammad Muslehuddin Siddiqui and was buried in the same tomb beside him in the Jama Memon Masjid, Muslehuddin Garden.
