Beneath them is the well Urðarbrunnr with the two swans that have engendered all the swans in the world.]] Die_Nornen_(1889)_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg.]] The NORNS (, plural: __) in Norse mythology[1] are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men. They roughly correspond to other controllers of humans' destiny, such as the Fates, elsewhere in European mythology.

In Snorri Sturluson's interpretation of the _Völuspá_, Urðr (Wyrd), Verðandi and Skuld, the three most important of the Norns, come out from a hall standing at the Well of Urðr or Well of Fate. They draw water from the well and take sand that lies around it, which they pour over the Yggdrasill tree so that its branches will not rot.[2] These three Norns are described as powerful maiden giantesses (Jotuns) whose arrival from Jötunheimr ended the golden age of the gods.[3] They may be the same as the maidens of Mögþrasir who are described in _Vafþrúðnismál_ (see below).[4]

Beside these three famous Norns, there are many others who appear at a person's birth in order to determine his or her future.[5] In the pre-Christian Norse societies, Norns were thought to have visited newborn children.[6] There were both malevolent and benevolent Norns: the former caused all the malevolent and tragic events in the world while the latter were kind and protective goddesses.[7]


Etymology

The origin of the name _norn_ is uncertain, it may derive from a word meaning "to twine" and which would refer to their twining the thread of fate.[8] Bek-Pedersen suggests that the word _norn_ has relation to the Swedish dialect word _norna (nyrna)_, a verb that means "secretly communicate". This relates to the perception of norns as shadowy, background figures who only really ever reveal their fateful secrets to men as their fates come to pass.[9]

The name _Urðr_ (Old English Wyrd, Weird) means "fate". _Wyrd_ and _urðr_ are etymological cognates, which does not guarantee that _wyrd_ and _urðr_ share the same semantic quality of "fate" over time.[10] Both _Urðr_ and _Verðandi_ are derived from the Old Norse verb _verða_, "to be".[11] It is commonly asserted that while _Urðr_ derives from the past tense ("that which became or happened"), _Verðandi_ derives from the present tense of _verða_ ("that which is happening"). _Skuld_ is derived from the Old Norse verb _skulu_, "need/ought to be/shall be";[12][13] its meaning is "that which should become, or that needs to occur".[14] Due to this, it has often been inferred that the three norns are in some way connected with the past, present and future respectively, but it has been disputed that their names really imply a temporal distinction[15] and it has been emphasised that the words do not in themselves denote chronological periods in Old Norse.[16]


Relation to other Germanic female deities

Berlin_Neues_Museum_vaterlaendischer_Saal_Nornen_restored.jpg, Berlin]] There is no clear distinction between norns, fylgjas, hamingjas and valkyries, nor with the generic term dísir. Moreover, artistic license permitted such terms to be used for mortal women in Old Norse poetry. To quote Snorri Sturluson's _Skáldskaparmál_ on the various names used for women:

    Woman is also metaphorically called by the names of the Asynjur or the Valkyrs or Norns or women of supernatural kind.[17]

These unclear distinctions among norns and other Germanic female deities are discussed in Bek-Pedersen's book _Norns in Old Norse Mythology._


Attestations

Mímer_and_Balder_Consulting_the_Norns_(1821-1822)_by_H._E._Freund.jpg.]] There are a number of surviving Old Norse sources that relate to the norns. The most important sources are the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda. The latter contains pagan poetry where the norns are frequently referred to, while the former contains, in addition to pagan poetry, retellings, descriptions and commentaries by the 12th and 13th century Icelandic chieftain and scholar Snorri Sturluson.

Skaldic poetry

A skaldic reference to the norns appears in Hvini's poem in _Ynglingatal_ 24 found in _Ynglingasaga_ 47, where King Halfdan is put to rest by his men at Borró. This reference brings in the phrase "_norna dómr_" which means "judgment of the nornir". In most cases, when the norns pass judgment, it means death to those who have been judged - in this case, Halfdan.[18] Along with being associated with being bringers of death, Bek-Pedersen suggests that this phrase brings in a quasi-legal aspect to the nature of the norns. This legal association is employed quite frequently within skaldic and eddic sources. This phrase can also be seen as a threat, as death is the final and inevitable decision that the norns can make with regard to human life.[19]

+---------------------+---------------------------------+--+

Poetic Edda

The Poetic Edda is valuable in representing older material in poetry from which Snorri tapped information in the _Prose Edda_. Like _Gylfaginning_, the _Poetic Edda_ mentions the existence of many lesser norns beside the three main norns. Moreover, it also agrees with _Gylfaginning_ by telling that they were of several races and that the dwarven norns were the daughters of Dvalin. It also suggests that the three main norns were giantesses (female Jotuns).[22]

_Fáfnismál_ contains a discussion between the hero Sigurd and the dragon Fafnir who is dying from a mortal wound from Sigurd. The hero asks Fafnir of many things, among them the nature of the norns. Fafnir explains that they are many and from several races:

+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+--+
|     Sigurðr kvað:             |     _Sigurth spake_:                     |  |
|     12. "Segðu mér, Fáfnir,   |     12. "Tell me then, Fafnir,           |  |
|     alls þik fróðan kveða     |     for wise thou art famed,             |  |
|     ok vel margt vita,        |     And much thou knowest now:           |  |
|     hverjar ro þær nornir,    |     Who are the Norns                    |  |
|     er nauðgönglar ro         |     who are helpful in need,             |  |
|     ok kjósa mæðr frá mögum." |     And the babe from the mother bring?" |  |
|     -                         |     -                                    |  |
|     Fáfnir kvað:              |     _Fafnir spake_:                      |  |
|     13. "Sundrbornar mjök     |     13. "Of many births                  |  |
|     segi ek nornir vera,      |     the Norns must be,                   |  |
|     eigu-t þær ætt saman;     |     Nor one in race they were;           |  |
|     sumar eru áskunngar,      |     Some to gods, others                 |  |
|     sumar alfkunngar,         |     to elves are kin,                    |  |
|     sumar dætr Dvalins."[23]  |     And Dvalin's daughters some."[24]    |  |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+--+

It appears from _Völuspá_ and _Vafþrúðnismál_ that the three main norns were not originally goddesses but giantesses (Jotuns), and that their arrival ended the early days of bliss for the gods, but that they come for the good of mankind.

_Völuspá_ relates that three giantesses of huge might are reported to have arrived to the gods from Jotunheim: Nornsweaving.jpg.]]

+-------------------------+------------------------------------+--+
|     8. Tefldu í túni,   |     8. In their dwellings at peace |  |
|     teitir váru,        |     they played at tables,         |  |
|     var þeim vettergis  |     Of gold no lack                |  |
|     vant ór gulli,      |     did the gods then know,--      |  |
|     uns þrjár kvámu     |     Till thither came              |  |
|     þursa meyjar        |     up giant-maids three,          |  |
|     ámáttkar mjök       |     Huge of might,                 |  |
|     ór Jötunheimum.[25] |     out of Jotunheim.[26]          |  |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------+--+

_Vafþrúðnismál_ probably refers to the norns when it talks of maiden giantesses who arrive to protect the people of earth as protective spirits (hamingjas):[27][28]

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+
|     49. "Þríar þjóðár             |     49. O’er people’s dwellings        |  |
|     falla þorp yfir               |     three descend                      |  |
|     meyja Mögþrasis;              |     of Mögthrasir’s maidens,           |  |
|     hamingjur einar               |     the sole Hamingiur                 |  |
|     þær er í heimi eru,           |     who are in the world,              |  |
|     þó þær með jötnum alask."[29] |     although with Jötuns nurtured.[30] |  |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+

The _Völuspá_ contains the names of the three main Norns referring to them as maidens like _Vafþrúðnismál_ probably does:

+---------------------------+---------------------------------+--+
|     20. Þaðan koma meyjar |     20. Thence come the maidens |  |
|     margs vitandi         |     mighty in wisdom,           |  |
|     þrjár ór þeim sæ,     |     Three from the dwelling     |  |
|     er und þolli stendr;  |     down 'neath the tree;       |  |

|     aðra Verðandi,        |     Verthandi the next,--       |  |
|     - skáru á skíði, -    |     On the wood they scored,--  |  |
|     Skuld ina þriðju;     |     and Skuld the third.        |  |
|     þær lög lögðu,        |     Laws they made there,       |  |
|     þær líf kuru          |     and life allotted           |  |
|     alda börnum,          |     To the sons of men,         |  |
|     örlög seggja.[31]     |     and set their fates.[32]    |  |

_Helgakviða Hundingsbana I_

Norns1.jpg.]] Die_Nornen_Urd,_Werdanda,_Skuld,_unter_der_Welteiche_Yggdrasil_by_Ludwig_Burger.jpg.]] The norns visited each newly born child to allot his or her future, and in _Helgakviða Hundingsbana I_, the hero Helgi Hundingsbane has just been born and norns arrive at the homestead:

+---------------------------+-------------------------------------+--+
|     2. Nótt varð í bæ,    |     2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, |  |

+---------------------------+-------------------------------------+--+

_Helgakviða Hundingsbana II_

In _Helgakviða Hundingsbana II_, Helgi Hundingsbane blames the norns for the fact that he had to kill Sigrún's father Högni and brother Bragi in order to wed her:

+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--+
|     26 "Er-at þér at öllu,  |     "Maid, not fair        |  |

|     varð ek bani þeira.[35] |     beneath my hand.[37]   |  |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--+

Norns4.jpg.]]

_Reginsmál_

Like Snorri Sturluson stated in _Gylfaginning_, people's fate depended on the benevolence or the malevolence of particular norns. In _Reginsmál_, the water dwelling dwarf Andvari blames his plight on an evil norn, presumably one of the daughters of Dvalin:

+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+
|     2. "Andvari ek heiti,           |     2. "Andvari am I,                  |  |
|     Óinn hét minn faðir,            |     and Oin my father,                 |  |
|     margan hef ek fors of farit;    |     In many a fall have I fared;       |  |

|     at ek skylda í vatni vaða."[38] |     Doomed me In waters to dwell."[39] |  |
+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+

_Sigurðarkviða hin skamma_

Another instance of Norns being blamed for an undesirable situation appears in _Sigurðarkviða hin skamma_, where the valkyrie Brynhild blames malevolent norns for her long yearning for the embrace of Sigurd:

+-------------------------------+---------------------------------+--+
|     7. Orð mæltak nú,         |     7. "The word I have spoken; |  |
|     iðrumk eftir þess:        |     soon shall I rue it,        |  |

|     en ek Gunnars;            |     and Gunnar's am I;          |  |
|     ljótar nornir             |     Ill Norns set for me        |  |
|     skópu oss langa þrá."[40] |     long desire."[41]           |  |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------+--+

_Guðrúnarkviða II_

Norns_(1832)_from_Die_Helden_und_Götter_des_Nordens,_oder_Das_Buch_der_sagen.jpg, (1832)]]

Brynhild's solution was to have Gunnarr and his brothers, the lords of the Burgundians, kill Sigurd and afterwards to commit suicide in order to join Sigurd in the afterlife. Her brother Atli (Attila the Hun) avenged her death by killing the lords of the Burgundians, but since he was married to their sister Guðrún, Atli would soon be killed by her. In _Guðrúnarkviða II_, the Norns actively enter the series of events by informing Atli in a dream that his wife would kill him. The description of the dream begins with this stanza:

+-------------------------------+--------------------------------+--+
|     "Svá mik nýliga           |     39. "Now from sleep        |  |
|     nornir vekja," -          |     the Norns have waked me    |  |
|     vílsinnis spá             |     With visions of terror,--  |  |
|     vildi, at ek réða, -      |     To thee will I tell them;  |  |
|     "hugða ek þik, Guðrún     |     Methought thou, Guthrun,   |  |
|     Gjúka dóttir,             |     Gjuki's daughter,          |  |
|     læblöndnum hjör           |     With poisoned blade        |  |
|     leggja mik í gögnum."[42] |     didst pierce my body."[43] |  |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------+--+

_Guðrúnarhvöt_

After having killed both her husband Atli and their sons, Guðrún blames the Norns for her misfortunes, as in _Guðrúnarhvöt_, where Guðrún talks of trying to escaping the wrath of the norns by trying to kill herself:

+-------------------------------+--------------------------------+--+
|     13. Gekk ek til strandar, |     13. "To the sea I went,    |  |
|     gröm vark nornum,         |     my heart full sore         |  |
|     vilda ek hrinda           |     For the Norns, whose wrath |  |
|     stríð grið þeira;         |     I would now escape;        |  |
|     hófu mik, né drekkðu,     |     But the lofty billows      |  |
|     hávar bárur,              |     bore me undrowned,         |  |
|     því ek land of sték,      |     Till to land I came,       |  |
|     at lifa skyldak.[44]      |     so I longer must live.[45] |  |
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------+--+

_Hamðismál_

St_Stephens_Green_german_Gift.JPG, _The Tree Faites_, donated by the German government in thanks for Operation Shamrock.]]

_Guðrúnarhvöt_ deals with how Guðrún incited her sons to avenge the cruel death of their sister Svanhild. In _Hamðismál_, her sons' expedition to the Gothic king Ermanaric to exact vengeance is fateful. Knowing that he is about to die at the hands of the Goths, her son Sörli talks of the cruelty of the norns:

+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+--+
|     29. "Ekki hygg ek okkr          |     29. "In fashion of wolves         |  |

|     þá er gráðug eru                |     that nourished were               |  |

_Prose Edda_

In the part of Snorri Sturluson's _Prose Edda_ which is called _Gylfaginning_, Gylfi, the king of Sweden, has arrived at Valhalla calling himself Gangleri. There, he receives an education in Norse mythology from what is Odin in the shape of three men. They explain to Gylfi that there are three main norns, but also many others of various races, æsir, elves and dwarves:



        A hall stands there, fair, under the ash by the well, and out of that hall come three maids, who are called thus: Urdr, Verdandi, Skuld; these maids determine the period of men's lives: we call them Norns; but there are many norns: those who come to each child that is born, to appoint his life; these are of the race of the gods, but the second are of the Elf-people, and the third are of the kindred of the dwarves, as it is said here:



        Most sundered in birth
        I say the Norns are;
        They claim no common kin:
        Some are of Æsir-kin,
        some are of Elf-kind,
        Some are Dvalinn's daughters.



        Then said Gangleri: "If the Norns determine the weirds of men, then they apportion exceeding unevenly, seeing that some have a pleasant and luxurious life, but others have little worldly goods or fame; some have long life, others short." Hárr said: "Good norns and of honorable race appoint good life; but those men that suffer evil fortunes are governed by evil norns."[51]

The three main norns take water out of the well of Urd and water Yggdrasil:



        It is further said that these Norns who dwell by the Well of Urdr take water of the well every day, and with it that clay which lies about the well, and sprinkle it over the Ash, to the end that its limbs shall not wither nor rot; for that water is so holy that all things which come there into the well become as white as the film which lies within the egg-shell,--as is here said:

            I know an Ash standing
            called Yggdrasill,
            A high tree sprinkled
            with snow-white clay;
            Thence come the dews
            in the dale that fall--
            It stands ever green
            above Urdr's Well.

        That dew which falls from it onto the earth is called by men honey-dew, and thereon are bees nourished. Two fowls are fed in Urdr's Well: they are called Swans, and from those fowls has come the race of birds which is so called."[52]

        These are called Valkyrs: them Odin sends to every battle; they determine men's feyness and award victory. Gudr and Róta and the youngest Norn, she who is called Skuld, ride ever to take the slain and decide fights.[53]

Legendary sagas

Some of the legendary sagas also contain references to the norns. The _Hervarar saga_ contains a poem named _Hlöðskviða_, where the Gothic king Angantýr defeats a Hunnish invasion led by his Hunnish half-brother Hlöðr. Knowing that his sister, the shieldmaiden Hervör, is one of the casualties, Angantýr looks at his dead brother and laments the cruelty of the norns:

+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--+
|     32. Bölvat er okkr, bróðir, |     "We are cursed, kinsman,      |  |
|     bani em ek þinn orðinn;     |     your killer am I!             |  |
|     þat mun æ uppi;             |     It will never be forgotten;   |  |
|     illr er dómr norna."[54]    |     the Norns' doom is evil."[55] |  |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--+

In younger legendary sagas, such as _Norna-Gests þáttr_ and _Hrólfs saga kraka_, the norns appear to have been synonymous with völvas (witches, female shamans). In _Norna-Gests þáttr_, where they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny, the norns are not described as weaving the web of fate, instead _Norna_ appears to be interchangeable and possibly a synonym of _vala_ (völva).

One of the last legendary sagas to be written down, the _Hrólfs saga kraka_ talks of the norns simply as evil witches. When the evil half-elven princess Skuld assembles her army to attack Hrólfr Kraki, it contains in addition to undead warriors, elves and norns.

Runic inscription N 351 M

The belief in the norns as bringers of both gain and loss would last beyond Christianization, as testifies the runic inscription N 351 M from the Borgund stave church:

    Þórir carved these runes on the eve of Olaus-mass, when he travelled past here. The norns did both good and evil, great toil ... they created for me.[56]

Franks Casket

Three women carved on the right panel of Franks Casket, an Anglo-Saxon whalebone chest from the eighth century, have been identified by some scholars as being three norns.


Theories

A number of theories have been proposed regarding the norns.[57]

Matres and Matrones

The Germanic Matres and Matrones, female deities venerated in North-West Europe from the 1st to the 5th century AD depicted on votive objects and altars almost entirely in groups of three from the first to the fifth century AD have been proposed as connected with the later Germanic dísir, valkyries, and norns,[58] potentially stemming from them.[59]

Three norns

Theories have been proposed that there is no foundation in Norse mythology for the notion that the three main norns should each be associated exclusively with the past, the present, and the future;[60] rather, all three represent _destiny_ as it is twined with the flow of time.[61] Moreoever, theories have been proposed that the idea that there are three main norns may be due to a late influence from Greek and Roman mythology, where there are also spinning fate goddesses (Moirai and Parcae).[62]
