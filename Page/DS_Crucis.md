DS CRUCIS (HR 4876, HD 111613) is a variable star near the open cluster NGC 4755, which is also known as the Kappa Crucis Cluster or Jewel Box Cluster. It is in the constellation Crux.

DS Crucis and NGC 4755 lie just to the south-east of β Crucis, the lefthand star of the famous Southern Cross.


Variability

DS Crucis is a variable star with an amplitude of about 0.05 magnitudes. It was found to be variable from the photometry performed by the Hipparcos satellite. The variability type is unclear but it is assumed to be an α Cygni variable.[3]


Properties

DS Crucis is an A1 bright supergiant (luminosity class Ia), although it has also been classified as A2 Iabe. It is nearly 80,000 times the luminosity of the sun, partly due to its higher temperature of 9,000 K, and partly to being over a hundred times larger than the sun. The κ Crucis cluster has a calculated age of 11.2 million years, and DS Crucis an age of seven million years.[4]
