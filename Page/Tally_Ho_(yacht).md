_TALLY HO_[1][2] is a 48Â ft/14.6m (LOA) by 44ft6/13.5 (LWL) by 12ft10/4m (beam) by 7ft6/2.3m (draft) [3][4] gaff cutter yacht designed by the renowned artist and yacht designer Albert Strange. She was also later named _Escape_, but is now again known as _Tally Ho_.

_Tally Ho_, originally named _Betty_, was built in Shoreham-by-Sea (Sussex, England) by Stow and Son for Charles Hellyer of Brixham (Devon, England) for relaxed cruising and some deep sea fishing. In 1913, Charles Hellyer commissioned the larger Betty II and sold _Betty_, ownership of which passed in 1927 to the then Lord Stalbridge, who renamed her _Tally Ho_.[5]

Albert Strange is best known for the canoe yawl with a Double-ended or canoe-stern hull and the two masts of the yawl rig. Unusually for him, _Tally Ho_ was designed with a transom stern and a cutter rig.

_Tally Ho_ was one of only two yachts from the fifteen starters[6] to complete the 1927 Fastnet Race,[7][8] under _heavy conditions_ finishing second, 52 minutes after the John G. Alden designed 30 ton schooner La Goleta, but winning on corrected time.

Until 2017 the Albert Strange Association owned the boat, and planned to move, repair, restore, and refit her. The effort was urgent, as the ship had to be moved from its shipyard, which was going to become part of an expanded sewage treatment facility. The hope was to eventually facilitate her return to the British Isles.[9]

However, in June 2017, the Albert Strange Association sold Tally Ho to English boatbuilder and sailor Leo Sampson Goolden for $1. He moved her to Sequim, Washington where restoration is progressing well, and he plans eventually to return her to England. By the end of 2017, she had been placed in a temporary boat shed and stripped down to the basic hull structure in preparation for restoration, including complete removal of the deck. Leo's intention is to replace most or all of the ribs, much of the planking, and the keel timber, but to retain as much of the original removed woodwork and fittings as possible.[10]

Leo is now well known on the web through his useful, entertaining and informative videos of the restoration in progress.
