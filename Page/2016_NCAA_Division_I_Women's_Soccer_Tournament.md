The 2016 NCAA DIVISION I WOMEN'S SOCCER TOURNAMENT (also known as the 2016 WOMEN'S COLLEGE CUP) was the 35th annual single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion of NCAA Division I women's collegiate soccer. The semi-finals and championship game were played at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, California from December 2–4, 2016 while the preceding rounds were played at various sites across the country during November 2016.[1]


Qualification

All Division I women's soccer programs were eligible to qualify for the tournament. The tournament field remains fixed at 64 teams. 28 teams received automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments, 3 teams received automatic bids by claiming the conference regular season crown (Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference don't hold conference tournaments) and an additional 33 teams earned at-large bids based on their regular season records.
