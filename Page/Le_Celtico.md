LE CELTICO is a football match contested between French clubs Guingamp and Rennes. The name of the derby derives from the fact that Guingamp and Rennes are the two major clubs that are situated in Brittany, a land emotionally attached to the Celtic culture.

The rivalry began in the mid-90s when Guingamp first joined the top division of French football. Guingamp players were welcomed by a banner _Bienvenue en ville_ (Welcome in the city) in Stade de la Route de Lorient. Even if being judged as arrogant teasing from Rennes fans, Guingamp fans later replied with a _Bienvenue chez les paysans_ (Welcome to farmers land) banner in Stade de Roudourou.

On 9 May 2009, Guingamp, in second league at this time, and Rennes were competing for the Coupe de France title in Stade de France. Despite the level difference, Guingamp won its first title thanks to Eduardo, who scored two goals.

Five years later, on 3 May 2014, the two rivals came back to Stade de France for another Coupe de France final. Guingamp won again, this time with goals from Jonathan Martins Pereira and Mustapha Yatabar√©, the latter of whom won his second Coupe de France.
