NADYA OKAMOTO is a social entrepreneur and activist, known as the Founder and Executive Director of the non-profit organization PERIOD.[1] She is the author of _Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement,_ which came out in October 2018 (published by Simon & Schuster).[2] In 2017, Nadya launched an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the Cambridge City Council.[3]


Early life

Nadya Okamoto was born in New York City before moving to Portland, Oregon where she attended an independent private school Catlin Gabel.[4]

Her mother, Sophia Tzeng, also graduated from Harvard in 1995 and later Columbia Law School. She was previously a visiting instructor of social impact management at the University of Portland.[5][6]


PERIOD.

In December 2014, Okamoto founded PERIOD with Vincent Forand, a classmate from Catlin Gabel High School and current undergraduate student at Cornell University. The organization distributes period products (tampons, pads, menstrual cups, reusable pads, etc.) to people in need, involves youth leaders through campus chapters at universities and high schools around the United States, and works toward social and legal change around menstrual equity.[7]


Civic Engagement and Politics

On the night of the 2016 Presidential Election, Okamoto launched the #ElectionReaction series through her platform on Huffington Post and social media. After seeing the success of that campaign, she engaged a few other Harvard students and together they launched a nonprofit and post-partisan media platform, E Pluribus. After several months, the media platform is no longer active.[8][9]

Okamoto moved to Cambridge, MA in August 2016. Less than 7 months later, Okamoto announced her candidacy for Cambridge City Council, running on a progressive platform with a youth-led campaign team. She was the youngest candidate in the race, and focused her campaign on issues of affordable housing, education equity, sustainable living, climate change, worker’s rights, civil liberties, government accountability, and human rights. She eventually lost the election, taking 15th place out of 26 candidates.[10][11][12][13]


Education

In her senior year of high school at Catlin Gabel High School, Nadya was awarded numerous scholarships. She is a 2016 Coca-Cola Scholar, Gates Millennium Scholar, PEO Star Scholarship, and Most Valuable Student Scholar of the Elks National Foundation.[14][15]

Okamoto is currently an undergraduate student at Harvard College.[16]
