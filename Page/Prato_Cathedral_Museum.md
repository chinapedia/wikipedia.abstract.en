The CATHEDRAL MUSEUM OF PRATO, ITALY was founded in 1967 in a few rooms of the Bishop's residence and in 1976 grew to include items from both the Cathedral of Saint Stephen and the diocesan territory.


History

The small courtyard that precedes the bishop's residence provides the entrance to the museum which opened in 1967 in the first two rooms. In 1976 the museum was enlarged to accommodate works from the entire diocese including the prestigious reliefs from the pulpit of Donatello. The collection is set up as a diocesan museum.

In 1980 the vaults under the cathedral's transept were added to the museum's space, and other areas were included between 1993-1996, beginning work, only recently concluded, to reconnect the various sections into one single itinerary that passes through a few rooms in the old Palazo dei Proposti, around the harmonious Romanesque cloister, and concluding under the cathedral. A reorganization of the museum space began in 2007, and plans include the preparation of the Renaissance rooms.[1]


Museum itinerary and works

An established itinerary guides the visitor through six rooms containing numerous and varied works of art, passes through an archeological section and the Romaesque cloister, and finishes with the _Antiquarium_ and the _vaults_.

Room 3: the Sacred Belt (in Italian _Sacra Cintola_)

Niccolò_di_Cecco_del_Mercia,_Assunta_che_dà_la_Cintola_a_San_Tommaso.JPG This room is dedicated to works associated with devotion to a precious Marian relic, the Sacred Belt (also known as the _Sacred Girdle_ or the _Girdle of Thomas_), venerated in Prato from the 12th century:

-   _The Virgin Mary, assumed into heaven, giving her belt to Saint Thomas the apostole who then passes the belt to a priest (_1358-1360), a relief in white marble made for a publit, by the Sienese artist Niccolò del Mercia;
-   garment for the statue of the _Madonna of the Belt_ (18th century), with semiprecious stones and embroidery in gold, made in Florence;
-   sacred liturgical items (17th - 18th centuries), in silver, belonging to the patrimony of the Chapel of the Belt;
-   _Dormitio Virginis_ (1983), plaster model of the antependium, made for the Altar of the Belt by Emilio Greco, after the theft of the 18th century antependium

Archaeological excavations

Museo_dell'opera_del_duomo,_prato,_resti_ceramici.jpg From the room of the Sacred Belt the visitor can descend to an area partly underground, reaching the archeological section, made to connect the first section of the museum with the rooms along the cloister. The excavation allowed for the recovery of various archeological items, which attest to the habitation of the area from the Etruscans to the Lombards. Of great historical interest:

-   fragments of Etruscan ceramics _(4th secolo BC), in particular urns, bowls, and jars;_
-   a burial site (11th century);
-   two ovens, maybe for breadmaking (9th-10th centuries).

Room 4: the Renaissance

Museo_dell'opera_del_duomo,_prato,_Filippo_Lippi,_Esequie_di_San_Girolamo.jpg From the archaeological area the visitor can go up into a 15th-century structure, which contains works from the 15th and 16th centuries. Of particular interest:

-   _Trinity_ (1435-1440), wood with pinnacles and a background of gold, by Andrea di Giusto Manzini;
-   Altar panel depicting a _Sacred Conversation_ showing the _Madonna with child with Saints Giusto and Clement_ (1449), by the Master of the Castello Nativity, perhaps Piero di Lorenzo, in close collaboration with Filippo Lippi;
-   Altar panel with the _Funeralof Saint Jerome_(1453), a masterpiece by Filippo Lippi, commissioned by Geminiano Inghirami for the cathedral;
-   _Crucifixion_ (late 15th century), wood painted on both sides, attributed to Sandro Botticelli;

Room 5: the Pulpit

Pulpito_di_donatello_(prato).JPG The room takes its name from the celebrated balcony pulpit made by Donatello for an outside corner of the facade of the cathedral for the solemn showing of the relic of the Sacred Belt: Museo_dell'operta_del_duomo,_prato,_paliotto_(XVI_secolo).jpg

-   the parapet of the external pulpit of the cathedral (1434-1438), made by Donatello and his school. Because of the degradation suffered during their five centuries outside, the reliefs were removed from the pulpit in 1967 and were substituted with replicas. A laborious restoration and cleaning (finished in 1999) directed by the Opificio delle pietre dure of Florence recreated a more unified and legible work. The imposing parapet takes the form of a small round temple with double pilasters that divide it into seven carved sections, each displaying a group of dancing figures which seem to move with joyous and vivacious steps, pictorically rendered thanks to the “stiacciato” (or very low relief) and the reflection of the tessera in the background.

In addition, this room houses:

-   the container of the Sacred Belt (1446-1447), made by goldsmith Maso di Bartolomeo, a student of Donatello, in gold-plated copper and bone and reelaborating the donatellan motif of the little angels dancing between the columns of the little temple; this box contained the relic up to 1633 at which time the present silver altar was constructed.

Room 6: the 17th to the 19th centuries

The Romanesque cloister

Chiostrino_dell'opera_del_duomo_di_prato_01.JPG From the 16th century room the visitor can go up to the Romanesque cloister (late 12th century), in white marble and green serpentine, characterized by original zoomorphic capitals created by the Master of Cabestany.

The Antiquarium and the "vaults"

Cappella_della_compagnia_di_Santo_Stefano.JPG From the cloister can be reached:

-   the burial chapel of the Migliorati (12th century);
-   the _Antiquarium_, in which are found tomb slabs, decorative fragments of the mosaic pavement of the early church (11th and 12th centuries), pieces of capitals, and architectonic fragments of the cloister.

The corridor exits into the "vaults", an underground area proceeding under the transept of the cathedral, used from 1326 to the end of the 18th century for burials from which remain various coats of arms (in stone and painted) and burial insignia.

Contiguous with the "vaults" is the chapel of Saint Stephen (beginning of the 15th century), containing painted murals:

-   on the vaults: evangelists and saints (beginning of the 15th century), frescoes, by an anonymous Tuscan painter;
-   in the lunettes: _The Stoning of Saint Stephen_ and _The Madonna with Saint Stephen and Saint Lorenzo_ (c.1420), monochrome frescoes, by Pietro and Antonio di Miniato.

Also in the chapel are preserved important relics of the cathedral:

-   _Reliquary of the torso of Saint Anne_ (1490), in silver, made by Antonio di Salvi;
-   _Reliquary of the holy cross_ (1590), by Egidio Leggi;
-   _Reliquiario of Saint Stephen_ (XIX secolo), realizzato su disegno di Alessandro Franchi.
