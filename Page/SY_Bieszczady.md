SY _BIESZCZADY_ was a Polish sailing yacht (built in 1974[1][2]) belonging to the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association[3][4] that sank in the North Sea in the night of 10 September 2000 after a collision with the Hongkong tanker .[5] Of eight crew members on board, only one survived.[6]

On 20 September 2001 the Polish Maritime Court (_Izba Morska_) ruled the disaster was caused in 70% by SY _Bieszczady_ and in 30% by MV _Lady Elena_. The court explained SY _Bieszczady_ was holding radar reflector which did not meet maritime safety standards and was not showing port and starboard lights. Nevertheless, the court stated MV _Lady Elena_ did not notice _Bieszczady_{{'}}s stern light about 10 minutes before the accident, although it should have done it. In the result of the collision seven sailors died.[7]

In June 2002 the Polish Appellate Maritime Court (_Odwoławcza Izba Morska_) set aside the judgement of September 2001 and sent case to be heard again.[8]

On 5 December 2016, the Maritime Court made a final judgement stating the reason of the tragedy was a failure of "last-moment maneuvers" on both ships caused by "not taking adequate actions to avoid excessive approach". Court found MV _Lady Elena_ behavior after the collision to be "highly inappropriate", as the ship did not start rescue action immediately after the accident.[9]

The wreckage of the yacht is stored in the National Maritime Museum in Gdańsk.[10]

The crew of SY Bieszczady has been tributed in a song "Requiem for stranger friends of SY Bieszczady" (_Requiem dla nieznajomych przyjaciół z s/y Bieszczady_) by Banana Boat. The band renounced any profits from the song because of band's connection to SY Bieszczady (two members of the band have previously sailed on SY Bieszczady).
