The '''International Art Books and Films Festival ''' (in French, FESTIVAL INTERNATIONAL DU LIVRE D'ART ET DU FILM) or FILAF, is an international festival about artbooks and films which takes place annually in Perpignan (South of France) since 2011. Its goal is to promote and award the best books and films about art produced each year in the world.


History and goals

FILAF_2012_-_Barcelo_et_Régnier.jpg - FILAF 2012]] Noting the world absence of a real event only interested in the art book, and similarly in the field of art film, the Cogito Association and its president Sébastien Planas created the international artbooks and films festival in Perpignan, whose first edition took place in June 2011[1]

The aim of the festival is to present to the general public a selection of the best books and films on art published or produced during the past year on an international scale. Authors, editors, directors, producers and selected artists are invited to Perpignan to present their work. A week of conferences, screenings, readings, signatures, workshops for children, professional round tables, thematic evenings, allows the world of art to meet and present its most important productions.[2]

The Festival relies on a scientific professional committee, recognized in each of their disciplines, responsible for selection throughout the year. It also mobilizes an annually renewed jury which, at the end of the festival, awards the Gold FILAF, the Silver FILAF and the Special Jury Prize (categories "book" and « film »).[3]


Scientific committee

Between 2011 and 2016, many must-have celebrities participated to the scientific committee for the selection of books and films: Xavier Canonne (Director, Museum of Photography in Charleroi), Hélène Joubert (Curator, Musée du Quai Branly, Paris), Philippe Régnier (Editor-in-Chief, Daily Art), Guillaume Faroult (Louvre Museum), Pierre Jaubert (RMN Library, Louvre Museum), Florence Viguier (Director, Ingres Museum in Montauban), Eberhard Hinkel (Distributor, Interart, Paris), Hervé Lœvenbruck (Galerie Lœvenbruck, Paris), Chantal Herrmann (Editor-in-Chief, Paris Mômes), André Delpuech (Director Museum of Man, Paris), Bernard Benoliel[4] (Cinémathèque française) or Laurence Des Cars (Director, Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris).

In 2018 the scientific committee is composed of : Didier Brousse (Founder and Director Galerie Camera Obscura), Didier Ottinger (Director Centre Pompidou Paris), Alexandre Curnier (Director Noto Magazine), Samuel Hoppe (Director Volume artbook shop Paris), Pierre Samoyault (Director Interart Paris), Stéphane Corréard (Director at the Parisian art fair Galeristes), Alba Zamolo (Director youth artbook shop in Louvre Museum Paris), Patricia Falguières (Teacher at EHESS)

FILAF Artbook Fair

In 2016, the festival created the _FILAF Artbook Fair_. The first edition of this show was held from the 24th to 26 June 2016 in the Dominican church in Perpignan.

FILAF_Artbook_Fair.jpg

Les_revues_proposées_au_FILAF.jpg

The _FILAF Artbook Fair_ is a real meeting place for publishers and the general public. It offers an unprecedented panorama of contemporary editorial practices linking art and print: a book on art, a book of art, multiples, fanzines, catalogs, posters and unpublished projects.

The fair is a place of experimentation and freedom. Conferences, performances, signatures, readings, debates punctuate this new meeting in the presence of artists, public collection managers, printers, collectors, publishers, graphic designers and booksellers.


Publications: _filaf annual_ review

_filaf annual_ is an annual magazine about artbooks and films. Richly illustrated, it develops an exploration of art through the prism of books and films. Starting from the attention paid by artists, historians, curators and the general public, the review is constructed as a representation of the mechanisms of production and the reception of these. Because in quantity as in quality, we know infinitely more works of art through our library and films than by their direct attendance. The world of art lives by the mechanism of the representation of art and by its actors and commentators. Deconstructing the ambiguous and fascinating link between art and modes of representation of art, the journal develops an approach to the history and actuality of books and films on the scholarly and in-depth art.

The journal consists in a selection of articles, interviews and original portfolios. At a time when the book becomes an instrument of determining power for artists, making or undoing careers, playing a significant economic role in exhibitions, remaining an unparalleled object of knowledge, the review witnesses its deep issues.

At a time when movies, television and the internet are producing video streaming and films that build the common representation of art, the magazine seeks to deconstruct the issues of the animated image dealing with art: Why? How? Who? Looking mainly at the margins of an international production sometimes formatted, it reflects the many and superb efforts that filmmakers still make to make sense to works of art.

_filaf annual_ develops well-founded choices in the face of the worldwide production of books and films on art. It relies on critics, publishers, historians, professionals in the field and partners forming a drafting committee. The review presents a rigorous and informed selection.

FILAF_Gallery_Perpignan.jpg


The FILAF Gallery / Art Library

Continuing its effort in favor of the written word, the FILAF inaugurated in June 2014, during the fourth edition of the festival, a space both gallery and art bookstore. Open year-round, it completes the regional offer by presenting temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It invites selected artists to produce works combining literature, cinema and drawing. Through exhibitions, artist residencies and the production of associated micro-editions, the FILAF Gallery seeks to highlight the closed links that living artists have with literature and cinema. As exhibitions evolve, the exploration of a universe is constructed.

Continuing its effort in favor of writing, the bookstore offers magazines such as _Artpress_, _The British Journal of Photography_, _ArtReview_, _Artforum_, _The Drawer_, _The Plat_, _Tapas_ or _Etudes Photographiques_.
