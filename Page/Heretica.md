History and profile

_Heretica_ was established in 1948.[2] One of the founders was Thorkild Bjørnvig.[3] It was largely inspired by the British periodical _The Criterion_ by T. S. Eliot.[4] The magazine adopted an anti-ideological humanism approach.[5]

_Heretica_ was produced by the poets who looked for new reality and challenged the conventional ideas of Christianity, humanism and communism.[6] The magazine also covered the poems and writings of promising authors.[7] The contributors of the magazine were called the Heretica School members, who had conservative existentialist views.[8] The magazine was edited by the following Danish writers and poets: Thorkild Bjørnvig (volumes 1-2), Martin A. Hansen and Ole Wivel (volumes 3-4) and Frank Jæger and Tage Skou-Hansen (volumes 5-6).[9] Some of the contributors were Jørgen Gustava Brandt, Benny Andersen, Per Højholt,[10] Paul la Cour and Erik Knudsen.[11] The magazine ended publication in 1953[12] and was succeeded by another magazine, _Vindrosen_.[13]
