Research Works

His research works focus on marine renewable energy with computational application. Lam promoted PhD research and shared views in his book 1st Lesson of PhD Research.[4] He proposed the Lam-Chen equations used to predict the wake behind the turbine based on the continuous works of ship's propeller research in Queen's University Belfast and axial momentum theory. Lam now pushes forward the marine renewable energy with a combination of solar power and wind power for small scale usage to solve the electricity problems in islands and promoted his invention of folding tidal turbine (FTT) for simple transportation and installation to save cost and time.[5]
