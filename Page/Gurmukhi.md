GURMUKHĪ (, ) is a Sikh script modified, standardized and used by the second Sikh guru, Guru Angad (1504–1552).[1][2][3] Gurmukhi is used in the state of Punjab as the official script of the Punjabi language,[4] a language that is also written in Perso-Arabic Shahmukhi script.[5][6]

The primary scripture of Sikhism, Guru Granth Sahib is written in Gurmukhī, in various dialects often subsumed under the generic title _Sant Bhasha_,[7] or _saint language_.

Modern Gurmukhī has thirty-five original letters plus six additional consonants, nine vowel diacritics, two diacritics for nasal sounds, one diacritic that geminates consonants, and three subscript characters.


History and development

Proposed_Gurmukhi_evolution_1.png In current scholarship, the Gurmukhī script is generally believed to have roots in the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet[8] by way of the Brahmi script,[9] which developed further into the Northwestern group (Sharada, or Śāradā, and its descendants, including Landa and Takri), the Central group (Nagari and its descendants, including Devanagari, Gujarati and Modi) and the Eastern group (evolved from Siddhaṃ, including Bangla, Tibetan, and some Nepali scripts),[10] as well as several prominent writing systems of Southeast Asia and Sinhala in Sri Lanka, in addition to scripts used historically in Central Asia for extinct languages like Saka and Tocharian.[11] Gurmukhi is derived from Sharada in the Northwestern group, of which is the only major surviving member,[12] with full modern currency.[13] Notable features:

-   It is an abugida in which all consonants have an inherent vowel, /ə/. Diacritics, which can appear above, below, before or after the consonant they are applied to, are used to change the inherent vowel.
-   When they appear at the beginning of a syllable, vowels are written as independent letters.
-   To form consonant clusters, Gurmukhi uniquely affixes subscript letters at the bottom of standard characters, rather than using the true conjunct symbols used by other scripts,[14] which merge parts of each letter into a distinct character of its own.
-   Punjabi is a tonal language with three tones. These are indicated in writing using the formerly voiced aspirated consonants (gh, dh, bh, etc.) and the intervocalic h.[15]

Gurmukhi evolved in cultural and historical circumstances notably different to other scripts,[16] for the purpose of recording scriptures of Sikhism, a far less Sanskritized cultural tradition than others of the subcontinent.[17] This independence from the Sanskritic model allowed it the freedom to evolve unique orthographical features.[18] These include:

-   Three basic carrier vowels, integrated into the traditional Gurmukhi character set, using the vowel markers to write independent vowels, instead of distinctly separate characters for each of these vowels as in other scripts;[19]
-   a drastic reduction in the number and importance of conjunct characters[20] (similar to Brahmi, and characteristic of Northwestern abugidas as opposed to others);[21]
-   a unique standard ordering of characters that somewhat diverges from the traditional _vargiya_, or Sanskritic, ordering of characters;[22]
-   the omission of consonants representing sounds found in Sanskrit (e.g. sibilants like /ʃ/ and /ʂ/), but naturally lost in most modern Indo-Aryan languages, though such characters were often retained in their respective consonant inventories as placeholders and archaisms,[23] and the sounds frequently reintroduced through later circumstances;
-   the development of distinct new letters for sounds better reflecting the vernacular language spoken during the time of its development (e.g. like for /ɽ/, and the sound shift that merged Sanskrit /ʂ/ and /kʰ/ to Punjabi /kʰ/);
-   a gemination diacritic, a unique feature among native subcontinental scripts,[24] which help to illustrate the preserved Middle Indo-Aryan geminates distinctive of Punjabi;[25]

Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) writes that the Gurmukhī script developed in the 10-14th centuries from the _Devasesha_ stage of the Śāradā script, the intermediate phase being Siddha Matrika, before the final evolution into Gurmukhī. His argument is that from the 10th century, regional differences started to appear between the Śāradā script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. The regional Śāradā script evolved from this stage until the 14th century, when it starts to appear in the form of Gurmukhī. Indian epigraphists call this stage _Devasesha_, while Bedi prefers the name _Pritham Gurmukhī_ or Proto-Gurmukhī.

The Sikh gurus adopted proto-Gurmukhī to write the Guru Granth Sahib, the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. Other contemporary scripts used in the Punjab were Takri and the Laṇḍā scripts. The Takri alphabet developed through the _Devasesha_ stage of the Śāradā script and is found mainly in the Hill States such as Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, where it is called _Chambyali_, and in Jammu Division, where it is known as _Dogri_. The local Takri variants got the status of official scripts in some of the Punjab Hill States, and were used for both administrative and literary purposes until the 19th century. After 1948, when Himachal Pradesh was established as an administrative unit, the local _Takri_ variants were replaced by Devanagari.

Example_of_a_Multani_variant_of_Landa_script,_a_mercantile_shorthand_script_of_Punjab,_from_1880.png variant of Landa script, a mercantile shorthand script of Punjab, from 1880[27]]] Meanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the Laṇḍā scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. _Landa_ means alphabet "without tail",[28] implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as Laṇḍā, Mahajani being the most popular. The Laṇḍā scripts were used for household and trade purposes. Compared to the Laṇḍā, Sikh Gurus favored the use of _Proto-Gurmukhī_, because of the difficulties involved in pronouncing words without vowel signs.

The usage of Gurmukhī letters in the Guru Granth Sahib meant that the script developed its own orthographical rules. In the following epochs, Gurmukhī became the prime script applied for the literary writings of the Sikhs. The Singh Sabha Movement of the late 1800s, a movement to revitalize Sikh institutions which had declined during colonial rule after the fall of the Sikh Empire, also advocated for the usage of the Gurmukhi script for mass media, with print media publications and Punjabi-language newspapers established in the 1880s.[29] Later in the 20th century, after the struggle of the Punjabi Suba movement, from the founding of modern India in the 1940s to the 1960s, the script was given the authority as the official script of the Punjab, India.[30][31]

The term _Gurmukhī_

The prevalent view among Punjabi linguists is that as in the early stages the Gurmukhī letters were primarily used by the Guru's followers, Gurmukhs (literally, those who face, or follow, the Guru, as opposed to a Manmukh); the script thus came to be known as _Gurmukhī_, "the script of those guided by the Guru."[32] Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the creation and standardization of Gurmukhi script from earlier Śāradā-descended scripts native to the region. It is now the standard writing script for the Punjabi language in India.[33] The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.[34]

Although the word Gurmukhī has been commonly translated as "from the Mouth of the Guru," the term used for the Punjabi script has somewhat different connotations. The opinion traditional scholars for this is that as the Sikh holy writings, before they were written down, were uttered by the Gurus, they came to be known as Gurmukhī or the "Utterance of the Guru". Consequently, the script that was used for scribing the utterance was also given the same name. The term that would mean "by the Guru's mouth" would be "Gurmū̃hī̃," which sounds considerably different but looks similar in Latin script.


Alphabet

Consonants

Gurmukhi_phonetic_chart.png The Gurmukhī alphabet contains thirty-five letters (_akkhar_, plural _akkharā̃_). The first three are distinct because they form the basis for vowels and are not consonants (_vianjan_) like the remaining letters are, and except for the second letter _ɛṛa_ are never used on their own. See the section on vowels for further details.

[TABLE]

The letters ਙ /ŋəŋːaː/ and ਞ /ɲəɲːaː / are not used in modern Gurmukhi. They cannot begin a syllable or be placed between two consonants, and the sounds they represent occur most often as allophones of [] before specific consonant phonemes.

The pronunciation of ਵ can vary allophonically between // and //.

-   à – grave accent = tonal consonant.

:*To differentiate between consonants, the Punjabi tonal consonants kà, chà, ṭà, tà, and pà are often transliterated in the way of the Hindi voiced aspirate consonants gha, jha, ḍha, dha, and bha respectively, although Punjabi does not have these sounds.

:*Tones in Punjabi can be either rising or falling; in the pronunciation of Gurmukhī letters they are falling, hence the grave accent as opposed to the acute.

In addition to these, there are six consonants created by placing a dot (_bindi_) at the foot (_pair_) of the consonant (these are not present in Sri Guru Granth Sahib). These are used most often for loanwords, though not exclusively:

  Name   Pron.(IPA)
  ------ -----------------------
  ਸ਼     səsːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː
  ਖ਼     kʰəkʰːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː
  ਗ਼     gəgːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː
  ਜ਼     d͡ʒəd͡ʒːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː
  ਫ਼     pʰəpʰːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː
  ਲ਼     ləlːaː pɛ:ɾᵊ bɪnd̪iː

|ləlːɑ pɛɾ bɪnd̪iː| was only recently added to the Gurmukhī alphabet. It was not a part of the traditional orthography, the phonological difference between 'l' and 'ɭ' was not reflected in the script. Some sources do not consider it a separate letter.

Subscript letters

Three "subscript" letters, called _pairī̃ akkhar_, or "letters at the foot" are utilised in Gurmukhī: forms of ਹ(h), ਰ(r), and ਵ(v).

The subscript ਰ(r) and ਵ(v) are used to make consonant clusters and behave similarly; subjoined ਹ(h) raises tone.

| ੍ਰ               | Subjoined /ɾ/ ਰ→ ੍ਰ | For example, the letter ਪ(p) with a regular ਰ(r) following it would yield the word ਪਰ /pəɾᵊ/ ("but"), but with a subjoined ਰ would appear as ਪ੍ਰ- (/prə-/), resulting in a consonant cluster, as in the word ਪ੍ਰਬੰਧਕ (/PɾƏbə́nd̪əkᵊ/, "managerial, administrative"), as opposed to ਪਰਬੰਧਕ /PƏɾᵊbə́nd̪əkᵊ/, the Punjabi form of the word used in natural speech in less formal settings (the Punjabi reflex for Sanskrit /pɾə-/ is /pəɾ-/) . This subscript letter is commonly used in Punjabi,[35] not just for Sanskritized words, but also for personal names, some native dialectal words, loanwords from other languages like English, etc. |

| ੍ਵ               | Subjoined /ʋ/ ਵ→ ੍ਵ | Used occasionally in Gurbani (Sikh religious scriptures) but rare in modern usage, it is largely confined to creating the cluster /sʋə-/[36] in words borrowed from Sanskrit, the reflex of which in Punjabi is /sʊ-/, e.g. Sanskrit ਸ੍ਵਪ੍ ਨ /s̪ʋɐ́p.n̪ɐ/→Punjabi ਸੁਪਨਾ /'sʊpᵊna:/, "dream," cf.

|                  |                     | For example, ਸ with a subjoined ਵ would produce ਸ੍ਵ (_sʋə-_) as in the Sanskrit word ਸ੍ਵਰਗ (/SVƏɾəgə/, "heaven"), but followed by a regular ਵ would yield ਸਵ- (_səv-_) as in the common word ਸਵਰਗ (/SƏƲəɾəgᵊ/, "heaven"), borrowed earlier from Sanskrit but subsequently changed. The natural Punjabi reflex, ਸੁਰਗ /sʊɾəgᵊ/, is also used in everyday speech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| ੍ਹ               | Subjoined /ɦ/ ਹ→ ੍ਹ | The most common subscript,[37] this character does not create consonant clusters, but serves as part of Punjabi's characteristic tone system, indicating a raised tone. It behaves the same way in its use as the regular ਹ(h) does in non-word-initial positions. The regular ਹ(h) is pronounced at the beginning of words but not in other positions, where it instead raises the tone. The difference in usage is that the regular ਹ is used after vowels and the subscript version when there is no vowel, and is attached to consonants.                                                                                               |

|                  |                     | For example, the regular ਹ is used after vowels as in ਮੀਹ (transliterated as _mih_, to show tonality, _MĪ́_, "rain"). The subjoined ਹ(h) acts the same way but instead is used under consonants: ਚ(ch) followed by ੜ(ṛ) yields ਚੜ (_chəṛ_), but not until the rising tone is introduced via a subscript ਹ(h) does it properly spell the word ਚੜ੍ਹ (_chə́ṛ_, "climb").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In addition to the three subjoined letters, there is a half-form of the letter Yayya, /j/ ਯ→੍ਯ, also used exclusively for Sanskrit borrowings, and even then rarely. Use of the subjoined /ʋ/ and conjunct /j/, already rare, is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.[38]

Vowel diacritics

To express vowels, Gurmukhī, as an abugida, makes use of obligatory diacritics called _lagā mātarā_ (plural _lagē matarē_). Gurmukhī is similar to Brahmi scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent 'a' sound (unless at the end of a word when the 'a' is usually dropped). This inherent vowel sound can be changed by using dependent vowel signs which attach to a bearing consonant. In some cases, dependent vowel signs cannot be used – at the beginning of a word or syllable for instance – and so an independent vowel character is used instead.

Independent vowels are constructed using three bearer characters: Ura (ੳ), Aira (ਅ) and Iri (ੲ). With the exception of Aira (which represents the vowel 'a') they are never used without additional vowel signs.

Dotted circles represent the bearer consonant. Vowels are always pronounced after the consonant they are attached to. Thus, Sihari is always written to the left, but pronounced after the character on the right.

Other signs

Nasalisation

_Ṭippī_ ( ੰ ) and _bindī_ ( ਂ ) are used for producing a nasal phoneme depending on the following obstruent or a nasal vowel at the end of a word. All short vowels are nasalized using _ṭippī_ and all long vowels are nasalized using _bindī_ except for _Dulenkar_ ( ੂ ), which uses _ṭippi_ instead.

Older texts may follow other conventions.

Gemination

The use of _addhak_ ( ੱ ) () indicates that the following consonant is geminate, meaning that the subsequent consonant is doubled or reinforced. Consonant length is distinctive in the Punjabi language and the use of this diacritic can change the meaning of a word, for example:

  Without _addhak_   Transliteration   Meaning                  With _addhak_   Transliteration   Meaning
  ------------------ ----------------- ------------------------ --------------- ----------------- -------------------------
  ਦਸ                 das               'ten'                    ਦੱਸ             dass              'tell' (verb)
  ਪਤਾ                patā              'aware' (of something)   ਪੱਤਾ            pattā             'leaf'
  ਸਤ                 sat               'essence'                ਸੱਤ             satt              'seven'
  ਕਲਾ                kalā              'art'                    ਕੱਲਾ            kallā             'alone' (colloquialism)

_Halant_

Southall_station_sign.jpg and Gurmukhī scripts in , UK]]

The _halant_ ( ੍ ) character is not used when writing Punjabi in Gurmukhī. However, it may occasionally be used in Sanskritised text or in dictionaries for extra phonetic information. When it is used, it represents the suppression of the inherent vowel.

The effect of this is shown below:

    ਕ – kə

    ਕ੍ – k

_Danda_

The _danda_ (।) is used in Gurmukhi to mark the end of a sentence. A doubled _danda_ (॥) marks the end of a verse.[39]

_Visarg_

The _visarg_ symbol (ਃ U+0A03) is used very occasionally in Gurmukhī. It can represent an abbreviation, as the period is used in English, though the period for abbreviation, like commas, exclamation points, and other Western punctuation, is freely used in modern Gurmukhi.[40]

_Udāt_

The _udāt_ symbol (ੑ U+0A51) occurs in older texts and indicates a high tone.

Numerals

Gurmukhī has its own set of digits, used exactly as in other versions of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. These are used extensively in older texts. In modern contexts, they are sometimes replaced by standard Western Arabic numerals.

  Numeral   Name, IPA   Simple Transliteration   Number
  --------- ----------- ------------------------ --------
  ੦         ਸਿਫ਼ਰ       sifar                    zero
  ੧         ਇੱਕ         ikk                      one
  ੨         ਦੋ          do                       two
  ੩         ਤਿੰਨ        tinn*                    three
  ੪         ਚਾਰ         chār                     four
  ੫         ਪੰਜ         panj                     five
  ੬         ਛੇ          chhe                     six
  ੭         ਸੱਤ         satt                     seven
  ੮         ਅੱਠ         aṭṭh                     eight
  ੯         ਨੌਂ         nauṃ                     nine
  ੧੦        ਦਸ          das                      ten

*In some Punjabi dialects, the word for three is _trai_,[41] () spelled ਤ੍ਰੈ in Gurmukhī.


Unicode

Gurmukhī script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0. Many sites still use proprietary fonts that convert Latin ASCII codes to Gurmukhī glyphs.

The Unicode block for Gurmukhī is U+0A00–U+0A7F:


Digitization of Gurmukhī manuscripts

Рукопись_гурмукхи.PNG Panjab Digital Library[42] has taken up digitization of all available manuscripts of Gurmukhī Script. The script has been in formal use since the 1500s, and a lot of literature written within this time period is still traceable. Panjab Digital Library has digitized over 5 million pages from different manuscripts and most of them are available online.
