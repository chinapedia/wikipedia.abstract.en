C.M. WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL was a primary and secondary school for black people in Thibodaux, Louisiana. A part of Lafourche Parish Public Schools, it was the only K-12 school in Lafourche Parish for black people, and it had the first high school program for black people in Thibodaux.[1]


History

Cordelia Matthews Washington established the Negro Corporation School in the early 1900s. She died in 1937, and Washington High School was renamed in her honor circa 1942 .[2]

The final school building received its dedication on December 8, 1950. It served grades 1-12. Leola A. Washington was the initial principal of the school's elementary division and Professor Robert M. Harris was the initial principal of the high school division.[3]

In 1968 the school building was re-purposed as South Thibodaux Elementary School due to racial integration.[4] Black students moved to previously all-white high schools: Thibodaux High School, Central Lafourche High School, and South Lafourche High School.

In 2008 members of the C.M. Washington alumni association proposed renaming South Thibodaux Elementary after Cordelia Matthews Washington.[5] Allen Chapel AME Church pastor Rev. Nelson Dan Taylor Sr., also proposed this renaming in 2013.[6]
