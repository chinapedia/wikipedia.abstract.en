JÁNOS RADOKI (born 7 March 1972) is a German-Hungarian former footballer.[1]

Radoki was born in Hungary, but emigrated to Germany with his parents as a child. He holds German citizenship.[2] He played his whole career in various German leagues, spending one season in the top division with SSV Ulm.[3]

On 21 November 2016, Radoki was announced as the interim replacement for Stefan Ruthenbeck at Greuther Fürth, as the club was playing a disappointing season.[4] He was sacked on 28 August 2017.[5]


International career

Radoki was called up to the Hungarian national team in 2000 by captain Bertalan Bicskei. On 15 November 2000, he was nominated as a reserve player for the game against Macedonia, and he was already warming up to be substituted in when the game was abandoned due to the foggy weather.[6] He was eventually never capped for Hungary.


Managing career

On 29 December 2018, he was appointed as the manager of the Nemzeti Bajnokság I club Puskás Akadémia FC.[7] He was released from his contract on 7 April following a 0-4 home loss against Kisvárda FC.[8]
