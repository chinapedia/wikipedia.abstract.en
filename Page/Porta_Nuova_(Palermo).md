La_Porta_Nuova_(Palerme)_(6881310634).jpg PORTA NUOVA is a monumental city gate of Palermo. It represents the entrance of the Cassaro (the main and most ancient street of the city) from Corso Calatafimi (the way to Monreale) and is located beside Palazzo dei Normanni, royal palace of Palermo. The gate was built to celebrate the Charles V's conquest of Tunis (1535) and his visit to the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily.[1]


History

According to the historian Tommaso Fazello the original gate was built in the 15th century.[2] The building was initially called "_Porta dell'Aquila_" ("_Gate of the Eagle_"), but the people of Palermo got used to call it "_Porta Nuova_" ("_New Gate_").[3]

After the Charles V's conquest of Tunis, the Emperor came to Sicily. He entered in Palermo through this gate on 5 September 1535.[4] In order to commemorate this event, the Senate of Palermo decreed to rebuild the gate in a more sumptuous style.[5] The Viceroy of Sicily Marcantonio Colonna set off the construction in 1583.[6] The gate was completed in 1584.[7] The Viceroy renamed it "_Porta Austriaca_" ("_Austrian Gate_").[8] For this reason the building was also called "_Porta Imperiale_" ("_Imperial Gate_").[9] But nevertheless, the name "_Porta Nuova_" continues to be used.

The gate was destroyed in 1667 because of a fire erupted inside the warehouse of the building.[10] The Senate of Palermo commissioned the architect Gaspare Guercio to rebuild the gate. The work was completed in 1669.[11]


Description

The facade leading to the Cassaro has the typical style of the triumphal arches. The facade leading to the Corso Calatifimi and Piazza Indipendenza presents four big telamones depicting the Moors defeated by Charles V.
