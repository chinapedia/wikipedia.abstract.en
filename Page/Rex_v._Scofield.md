_REX V. SCOFIELD_, Cald. 397 (1784), is a British criminal law case that made attempt part of the common law, emphasizing the intent of an actor over the incomplete criminal act.[1] Scofield lit a candle and placed it into flammable material in a house with the intent to burn it down, but the larger fire never happened.[2] Finding crime in the incomplete but intended act of arson, Lord Mansfield held that "completion of an act, criminal in itself, [was not] necessary to constitute criminality", and "The intent may make an act, innocent in itself, criminal..."[3]
