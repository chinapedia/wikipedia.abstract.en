4RGL is an Australian community radio station located in Gladstone, Queensland.[1]

The station is currently broadcasting as Fresh FM and transmits to the Gladstone Region on 91.9 FM.[2]

Prior to June 2013, the station was known as Rhema FM due to a former affiliation with the United Christian Broadcasters network of Rhema FM stations, but its name was changed to Fresh FM when it underwent a relaunch.[3]

After struggling to find a permanent location for the radio station,[4] the station purchased land from the Uniting Church and constructed studio facilities on the site which the radio station moved into on 25 May 2013.[5]

On 7 November 2016, the station announced that after reaching an agreement with Seven Queensland, it would commence simulcasting the Central Queensland edition of _Seven News_ at 6pm each weeknight from 11 November 2016.[6]
