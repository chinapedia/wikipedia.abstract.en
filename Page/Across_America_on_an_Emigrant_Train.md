Reception

_Booklist_, in a review of _Across America_, wrote "Murphy's style is plain" and concluded "The experience of ordinary people revitalizes the myths of the West." _School Library Journal_ wrote "Murphy has drawn from the writer's (Stevenson) journal to provide a fresh, primary-source account of transcontinental train travel at that time." and "has woven meticulously researched, absorbing accounts of the building of the railroad and its effect on the territory it crossed .. it is a readable and valuable contribution to literature concerning expansion into the American West"[1] [2] _Kirkus Reviews_ called it "A fascinating, imaginatively structured account that brings the experience vividly to life in all its detail: history at its best."[3]

The Cooperative Children's Book Center found it a "fascinating documentary of westward expansion".[4] and Horn Book Guide a "vivid account" and an "inviting volume".[5]
