STARS ON PARADE is the parade for Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris for their 25th Anniversary celebrations.[1]

It debuted on March 25, 2017 along with other entertainment.[2]


Background

Stars on Parade replaces Disney Magic On Parade! (previously Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade) which ran in Disneyland Park from 2007 until March 2017.

It is being worked on by Jody Daily who previously worked on Disney's Happiness is Here in Tokyo Disneyland and Soundsational Parade in Disneyland.


Content

The main piece of Stars on Parade is a big steampunk dragon based on Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, a float previously seen in Magic Kingdom's Festival of Fantasy parade, this dragon breathes fire.[3]

Two floats, featuring the films of Peter Pan, The Lion King and The Jungle Book, come from Tokyo Disney Resort's Jubilation parade.[4]

Other films featured on the parade include Frozen, Toy Story and Finding Dory.

The floats have a similar style from the happiness is here parade.


Parade Units

-   Discover the Magic: The parade opens with Tinker Bell, who escapes from the pages of an enormous storybook. This is followed by an amazing float featuring Mickey Mouse and Friends dressed as explorers of the future… “A future in which technology retains a magical aspect” according to Olivier Dusautoir, the Set Designer.
-   Discover Friendship: Based on the Disney and Pixar film Toy Story. The second highlight pays a dazzling tribute to children’s games. Buzz Lightyear’s rocket pulls an oversized truck in which Andy Daly has placed all his toys in carefree disarray. Woody, Jessie and the other toys celebrate true friendship and take us to infinity and beyond!
-   Discover Adventure: Who better than Simba and Nala form 1994 animated film The Lion King or Baloo and Mowgli form 1967 animated film The Jungle Book to embody the spirit of adventure? A high rock overlooks the exuberant jungle flora, while the percussion and shimmering colours release the wild instincts of an exotic world where it takes very little to be happy. The float is the original float from Tokyo Disneyland's former daytime parade Jubilation!.
-   Discover Imagination: Based on the 1953 animated film Peter Pan. From Skull Rock to another, this one is in the shape of a skull and serves as the throne of Captain Hook. Peter Pan is close by, at the helm of a ship suspended beneath an immense, dreamlike moon. “After all, Disneyland Paris is – quite literally – the Land of Imagination!”, Emmanuel Lenormand reminds us. The float is the original float from Tokyo Disneyland's former daytime parade Jubilation!.
-   Discover A New World: Based on the 2003 Disney and Pixar film Finding Nemo. Crush swims above a majestic float, covered with coral. Dory, Nemo and Martin remind the guests of their philosophy: “Just keep swimming!” and leave guests starry-eyed. Sea stars, of course.
-   Discover Enchantment: Based on the 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Water is followed by fire, in hot pursuit. The story would not be complete without an epic battle starring Prince Phillip and the three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather against an evil dragon as the wicked Maleficent, described by Olivier Dusautoir as “mechanical, made entirely of copper with visible mechanisms, as if it has been taken straight out of Jules Verne’s imagination”. Faced with a fire-breathing monster, will good win out? The Dragon float was a rumored to receive a twin for Magic Kingdom's daytime parade Festival of Fantasy Parade[5].
-   Discover Romance: In fairy tales, good… and love always triumph in the end. Contrasting beautifully with the impressive floats that precede them, Rapunzel, Cinderella and Snow White with their respective Prince Charmings make their entrance on three graceful carriages from its former daytime parade Disney Magic on Parade. A romantic moment which will melt the hearts of little girls… of all ages.
-   Discover Wonder: Based on the 2013 Academy Award-winning hit animated film Frozen. The great Disney storybook will close with a flourish with Anna and Elsa the Snow Queen, on the balcony of the ice palace, accompanied by a few friends who are particularly popular with guests. Like Elsa’s silvery blue cape floating in her wake, a sense of wonder fills the air and remains long after the last float of Disney Stars on Parade has passed by.
