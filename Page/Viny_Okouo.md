VINY PIERROT MARCEL OKOUO (born April 10, 1997) is a Congolese professional basketball player who currently plays for Spanish club Unicaja in the Liga ACB.


Professional career

Unicaja Málaga (2012–present)

A native of the Republic of the Congo,[1] Okouo started playing basketball when he was 15 years old[2] and left home only shortly after to join the youth set-up of Unicaja Málaga in Spain. Okouo had been recommended by his fellow countryman Romaric Belemene. The Unicaja coaches had only seen some footage of Okouo practicing and were intrigued by his physical gifts, while his skills were underdeveloped.[3] At Unicaja, he learned to play the game and improved vastly.

Between 2014 and 2016, he spent time on loan at Instituto de Fertilidad Clínicas Rincón of the LEB Plata,[4] the third tier of Spanish basketball, while also seeing action for Unicaja’s development team in the EBA. Okouo made his ACB debut for Malaga during the 2015-16 campaign[5] and saw his first minutes in the EuroCup the following season.[6] In the 2016–17 season, Okouo won the EuroCup with Unicaja after beating Valencia BC in the Finals.[7]
