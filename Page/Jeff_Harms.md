As an actor and performer he is known for his collaboration with long-time collaborator and playwright Brian Torrey Scott.[8]


Music

Jeff's first album was made in 2002 during a workshop at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago run by the performance group Goat Island. Spencer Matern and Emily Evans developed some of the songs further at ESS in Chicago and released the album on their label Naivete Records in 2004 as Big Amazing Songs.[9] After graduating from SAIC Jeff toured the US opening for Jason Webley. Since he has released three more records. _The Myth of Heroics_, was produced by Emmett Kelly in 2008, _He Said She Said That's What She Said_, produced by LeRoy Bach in 2012[10] and _Pretty Girls Don't Just Talk to Me_ in 2013, produced by Sam Wagster. In all three cases, these producers both produced and played extensively on the records. _Pretty Girls_ is an album of duets also featuring singers Gillian Lisée, Rachel Ries, Nora O'Connor, Dan Mohr, and Angela James.[11] In 2015 he provided rhythm guitar and backing vocals for The Cairo Gang's tour of the US and Canada.[12] His music appears in the movie _Elephant Medicine_ by Julian Wayser.


Performance

Jeff received his MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004 with a focus on performance art and sculpture. There he met writer-director Brian Torrey Scott and began a decade long friendship making experimental theater and video in Chicago. Brian directed and occasionally played opposite Jeff in over a dozen plays and movies. In 2008 Brian joined the group Every House Has a Door (the current evolution of Goat Island) and in 2009 Jeff took his place in the role of Benny Goodman for Every House's production _They're Mending the Forest Highway_. Jeff was in the company for two years.[13]

In 2007 Jeff produced and starred in _A Thing as Big as the Ocean_, written and directed by Joseph Cashiola, shot by Daniel Mejia. They cast Thai Tyler opposite Jeff and drove New Orleans for a few weeks before continuing to Las Vegas, shooting guerilla-style along the way. The film was invited to the IFP Narrative Film Lab and won the coveted Narrative Lab Finishing Grant of $50,000. It premiered at the Woods Hole Film Festival the following year.[14]

Brian Torrey Scott and Jeff made three films together, _The Objects of Living_, _Isthmus_ and _Ganzfeld_. _Objects_ was shot on a grant Scott received from The School of the Art Institute at the Catwalk Artist Residency in upstate New York. _Ganzfeld_ was shot in the mountains of Montana and in Chicago in a year long collaboration with Scott and long-time friend and cameraman Daniel Mejia. _Ganzfeld_ features an original soundtrack of songs written by LeRoy Bach performed by Azita Youssefi and Marvin Tate. The song that plays over the credits was written by Harms and arranged by Bach.[15]

Jeff also has small roles in _Elephant Medicine_, directed by Julian Wayser and _Oh My Soul_, directed by Nicholas Monsour. He also created an ongoing animated series about dating called _Jeff Hobbs the Cartoon_.

Jeff currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He's an actor in TV, film and commercials. He has been on True Nightmares (ID), Cry Wolfe (ID), an unnamed documentary for PBS as Hunter S. Thompson, as well as music videos for Billy Idol, Metallica, Coheed and Cambria, and Death From Above 1979.[16] He's also an extra in the new _Twin Peaks_.
