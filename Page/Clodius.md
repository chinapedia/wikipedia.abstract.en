issued for the anti-Neronian rebel Clodius Macer in 68 AD]] CLODIUS is an alternate form of the Roman _nomen_ Claudius, a patrician _gens_ that was traditionally regarded as Sabine in origin. The alternation of _o_ and _au_ is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The feminine form is CLODIA.


Republican era

Publius Clodius Pulcher

During the Late Republic, the spelling _Clodius_ is most prominently associated with Publius Clodius Pulcher, a popularis politician who gave up his patrician status through an order in order to qualify for the office of tribune of the _plebs_. Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban _plebs_, supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (_collegia_); because of this individual's ideology, _Clodius_ has often been taken as a more "plebeian" spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodius's two elder brothers, the Appius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 54 BC and the C. Claudius Pulcher who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.

The view that _Clodius_ represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodius's chief modern-era biographer. In _The Patrician Tribune_, W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodius's sisters and that "the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong." A plebeian branch of the _gens_, the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some inscriptional evidence that the _-o-_ form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the "patrician tribune" Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of _-o-_ by the "chic" Clodia Metelli was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The linguistic variation of _o_ for _au_ was characteristic of the Umbrian language, of which Sabine was a branch. Forms using _o_ were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of _Clodius_ would have been either a whimsical gesture of pastoral fantasy, or a trendy assertion of antiquarian authenticity.[1]

Other Clodii of the Republic

In addition to Clodius, Clodii from the Republican era include:

-   Clodia Metelli. sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher
-   Clodius Aesopus, a tragic actor in the 50s BC who may have been a freedman of one of the Clodii Pulchri.
-   Clodia Pulchra, daughter of Clodius Pulcher and Fulvia, the first wife of imperator August.
-   Clodia Pulchra, daughter of Appius Clodius Pulcher, sometimes identified in Catullus' poems as "Lesbia".
