FINAGLE'S LAW OF DYNAMIC NEGATIVES (also known as MELODY'S LAW or FINAGLE'S COROLLARY TO MURPHY'S LAW) is usually rendered as "Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment."

The term "Finagle's law" was first used by John W. Campbell Jr., the influential editor of _Astounding Science Fiction_ (later _Analog_). He used it frequently in his editorials for many years in the 1940s to 1960s,[1] but it never came into general usage the way Murphy's law has.


Variants

One variant (known as O'Toole's corollary of Finagle's law) favored among hackers is a takeoff on the second law of thermodynamics (related to the augmentation of entropy):

In the _Star Trek_ episode "The Ultimate Computer", Dr. McCoy refers to an alcoholic drink known as the "Finagle's Folly", apparently a reference to "Finagle's law". In Season 2 episode "Amok Time" (written by Theodore Sturgeon, 1967), Captain Kirk tells Spock, "As one of Finagle's laws puts it: 'Any home port the ship makes will be somebody else's, not mine.'"

The term "Finagle's law" was popularized by science fiction author Larry Niven in several stories depicting a frontier culture of asteroid miners; this "Belter" culture professed a religion or running joke involving the worship of the dread god Finagle and his mad prophet Murphy.[2][3]

"Finagle's law" can also be the related belief "Inanimate objects are out to get us", also known as Resistentialism.[4][5] Similar to Finagle's law is the verbless phrase of the German novelist Friedrich Theodor Vischer: "_die Tücke des Objekts_" (the perfidy of inanimate objects).

A related concept, the "Finagle factor", is an _ad hoc_ multiplicative or additive term in an equation, which can only be justified by the fact that it gives more correct results. Also known as Finagle's variable constant, it is sometimes defined as the correct answer divided by your answer.
