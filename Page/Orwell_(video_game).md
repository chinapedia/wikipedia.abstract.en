_ORWELL_ is a series of episodic simulation video games by German indie developer OSMOTIC STUDIOS in which the player assumes the role of a state operative and monitors surveillance sources to find national security threats. It is named after George Orwell, the author of the dystopian novel _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, references to which can be found in the game. The first game in the series, subtitled "Keeping an Eye on You", was released as a weekly, five-part serial for Windows beginning on October 20, 2016.[1]


Plot

Setting

Orwell_video_game_screenshot_7.png Orwell_video_game_screenshot_2.png _Orwell_ takes place in a country called the Nation, led by a modern-day authoritarian government known as The Party in the capital of Bonton. In 2012, the Party passed the Safety Bill, a law expanding the government's ability to spy on its citizens in the name of national security. As part of the bill the Ministry of Security, led by Secretary of Security Catherine Delacroix, commissioned a covert surveillance system codenamed Demiurge (later renamed Orwell).

Orwell allows investigations into the private communications of people of interest, but doesn't allow any one person full access. Instead, Orwell's operation is run by two groups; Investigators, persons outside of the Nation working for the government who search through the communication of target persons and upload items of interest (represented as "datachunks"), and Advisors, people inside of the Nation who use the received datachunks to determine the course of action and to recommend actions to the authorities.

The player takes the role of an Orwell investigator, who has just been selected to use the system.
