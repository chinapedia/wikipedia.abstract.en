The KOREA INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY (KIAS) is an advanced research institute in Korea. It is located on a campus in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul.[1]

KIAS was founded in 1996, aiming to become a world's leading research institute where international elite scholars gather and dedicate to fundamental research in basic sciences.[2] Currently, there are three schools in the institute: mathematics, physics, and computational sciences. As of 2016, the institute has 3 distinguished professors, 26 professors, and 133 research fellows.[3]

As its name suggests, this institute was founded modeled on IAS in Princeton, New Jersey (USA), although unlike its original, KIAS is funded by the government. KIAS is a subordinate institute of KAIST.[4]
