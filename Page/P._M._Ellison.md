P. M. ELLISON was a county commissioner and member of the Nevada Assembly between 1874 and 1876.

He became one of the three county commissioners of Nye County after he was elected to that office on November 5, 1872. Ellison resigned a year later, and was replaced by Joseph Stowe.[1] He was elected to the Assembly, where he represented Nye County alongside John B. McGee, on November 3, 1874 as a Democrat.[2][3]

Ellison's term started the next day, and he served during one session.[4][5] His mandate ended in November 1876, when Ellison and McGee were succeeded by T. J. Bell and J.A. Caldwell.[6]
