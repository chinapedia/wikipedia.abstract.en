Production

Pre-production

According to director Joel Lamangan, Nathalie Hart was initially hesitant for the lead role when told that she is required to do full-frontal nudity for the film, but said that "she did not have second thoughts doing it (...) It was a project she simply could not pass up."[7]

Hart had to be on a diet and workout in preparation for the role.[8] She claimed that her recent breast enlargement surgery was crucial for the film.[9][10]

Filming

During principal photography, Hart said that the first scenes they had to film were those that required her to do nudity, particularly a shower scene where her bare back is revealed. The following day, after filming a sex scene with co-star Luis Alandy, she said she "went in the bathroom and cried", and almost prompted to abandon the project as she felt she was doing pornography. Lamangan then reassured her that he is a "proper director" and he does not do porn. But despite being distraught having to do the scenes, Hart chose to remain involved in the project.[11][12][13]

Joem Bascon confirmed in a separate interview that Hart performed her nude scenes genuinely and without the use of nipple tapes.[14]

Filming concluded in early April 2016.[15]

_Siphayo_ is produced by producer Baby Go's production company BG Productions International.[16] Although the film's original release date was on 5 October 2016, it was pushed the following day; a red carpet premiere was held at SM Megamall on 3 October.[17]

The film premiered in the 2016 International Film Festival Manhattan in New York City on 22 October.[18]
