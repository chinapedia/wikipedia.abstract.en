Biography

Consort Trương Thị Trong had courtesy name NGỌC TRONG (玉𤄯), was born at Lê village, Như Quỳnh commune, Văn Lâm district, Hải Đông town (now Hưng Yên province). She was third daughter of military official Trương Đôn Hậu and his wife Nguyễn Thị (posthumous name Lady Thục Tiết). Essentially Lê village's Trương clan was the distaff-side relations of Trịnh lords, so lady Trương Thị Trong has entered Trịnh's palace to become the consort _Nội-thị cung-tần_ (內侍宮嬪) of lord Trịnh Cương (1686–1729) when she grew up. She always spent free and boring times in composing verse.[1]
