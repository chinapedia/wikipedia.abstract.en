VEDI ALCO (), is one of the leading producers of alcoholic drinks in Armenia, located in the village of Ginevet of Ararat Province.[1] It was founded in 1956 as the _Vedi Wine Factory_ by the government of the Armenian SSR, named after the _Vedi raion_ of Soviet Armenia. The grapes processed by Vedi Alco are mainly from the Ararat plain as well as the Areni and Getap region of Vayots Dzor.


History

The construction of the Vedi Wine Factory was launched in 1952 and completed in 1956[2] as a state-owned enterprise. With the establishment of the factory, 2 villages around the winery have been quickly developed. First, the settlement located to the south of the winery was formed and named Nor Ughi (meaning _new way_ in Armenian), and later another settlement was developed around the factory itself which became to be known as "Vedu ginu gortsaranin kits" (translates as _Vedi wine factory settlement_). However, the factory settlement was eventually incorporated into a separate village and renamed Ginevet under the independent government of Armenia, during the 2000s.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Vedi Wine Factory was privatized in 1994 to become a closed joint-stock company.

The products of the factory are constantly exported to Russia, United States, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, France, Lithuania, etc.[3]

The Getap Wine Factory operating since 1938 in the village of Getap in Vayots Dzor is also owned by the "Vedi Alco" CJSC since its privatization in 1994.[4]
