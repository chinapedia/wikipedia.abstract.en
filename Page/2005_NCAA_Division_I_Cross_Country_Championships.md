The 2005 NCAA DIVISION I CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS were the 67th annual NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship and the 25th annual NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship to determine the team and individual national champions of NCAA Division I men's and women's collegiate cross country running in the United States. In all, four different titles were contested: men's and women's individual and team championships.[1][2]

Held on November 21, 2005, the combined meet was the second of eight consecutive meets hosted by Indiana State University at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Indiana. The distance for the men's race was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) while the distance for the women's race was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles).

The men's team championship was won by Wisconsin (37 points), the Badgers' fourth. The women's team championship was won by Stanford (146 points), the Cardinal's third (and second in three years).

The two individual champions were, for the men, Simon Bairu (Wisconsin, 29:15.9) and, for the women, Johanna Nilsson (Northern Arizona, 19:33.9). It was the second consecutive title for Bairu.[3][4]
