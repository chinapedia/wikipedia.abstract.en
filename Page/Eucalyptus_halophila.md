_EUCALYPTUS HALOPHILA_, also known as SALT LAKE MALLEE,[1] is a eucalypt that is native to Western Australia.[2]

The shrubby mallee typically grows to a height of and as high as , has rough box-type bark[3] and a dense crown.[4] The bark is persistent over the length of the tree and is a grey-brown colour. The dull, green, thin, concolorous adult leaves have a disjunct arrnagement. The leaf blade has an elliptic shape and is basally tapered. The leaves are supported by narrowly flattened or channelled petioles.[5] The plant blooms between January to May and produces conflorescences with white-cream flowers.[6] Each simple, axillary conflorescence is made up of three to seven flowered umbellasters on narrowly flattened or angular peduncles. Buds are pyriform with calyx calyptrate that sheds early. The fruits that form later have a globose or ovoid shape with a depressed disc and rim-level or exserted valves.[7]

It is found growing in sandy clay soils on flat areas adjacent to salt lakes and had a limited range near Esperance in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.[8]

It is available commercially in seed form or as tubestock and is grown as an ornamental or low shelter plant. It is tolerant of frost, salt and drought and has a moderately fast growth rate.[9]
