Biography

Early years

Deda-i-ja,-1961.jpg Sasha Savic was born in Zemun, city of Belgrade, Serbia, as a single child of Milorad Savic and Draginja née Jankovic. Father was a Civil engineer and mother worked as a Medical laboratory manager. Savic spent his childhood in New Belgrade, where he finished elementary school and Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium. He also completed an advanced English language course at _The Institute for Foreign Languages_. His earliest contact with performing and visual arts, at the age of 16, was through the actor Stanislav Terzin, who created his roles but also his own costumes and masks.

The Art World

After the grammar school, Savic was admitted at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Economics in 1975. He studied with a lot of success, especially in mathematics, statistics and accounting, but after seeing an exhibition of Salvador Dalí's prints in 1977 in Belgrade and Peter Watkins's series, _Portrait of Edvard Munch_, shown on a local TV, he decided to continue his career in Arts.
The first Art education Savic got at the Artists’ colony, in Kosutnjak Hills. The distinguished Serbian artists Matija Vukovic, Sinisa Vukovic (founder of MEDIALA) and Vladislav Todorovic Silja were his first mentors, but Sergije Jovanovic[1] at his Art School, got him ready for further studies.
Prof._Miodrag_Rogic.jpg In 1979, Savic enrolled in the _Academy of Fine Arts[2]_ (Fakultet Likovnih Umetnosti), University of Arts in Belgrade, Serbia. During the 5+2 years of regular studies at the Academy, his teachers ware: Miodrag Rogic[3], from the graphics department and painters Slavoljub Cvorovic and Zivojin Turinski.[4]
In 1983. Savic founded the Art magazine _FLU_ and was the first editor in chief. The magazine was financed exclusively by _AKADEMIA_, the Art Student's Club, situated at the School's underground venue, later famed for being a top discotheque in town and gathering place of Belgrade avant-garde artists. _AKADEMIA_ was also known for organizing and fully financing Art excursions, both domestic and foreign for 100+ students of the final two years. Savic served as the president of the Club from 1984-1986.
While studying Art, Savic visited numerous Museums and exhibitions in Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Venice, Florence, Basel, Bern and Barcelona.
During his freshman year, Savic did two stage design projects for the hard rock band _Atomic Shelter_ (Atomsko sklonište), for their concerts in Belgrade and Ljubljana (with Bosko Obradovic[5] and Goran Desancic[6]).
Savic graduated in 1984, with BFA and after completing Postgraduate studies got his Master of Arts degree in painting, 1986. His first solo show followed at the Academy's own gallery, in Knez Mihailova Street in Belgrade.
In 1987-1988, Savic spent several months in Denmark, painting and exploring contemporary Nordic art (in Århus and Copenhagen) and learning Danish language. At the _Aarhus University_, upon the invitation by professor Henning Mørk[7] and fellow artist Ann Dorte Nielsen[8], Sasha gave a lecture on Yugoslav Modern Art.
In 1989, Savic was awarded the Norwegian Government scholarship to further develop as an Artist and to study the art of Edvard Munch (whom he considers as a spiritual father). Savic then, preparing for the trip, studies Norwegian language at the _Faculty of Philology_[9] in Belgrade for two semesters.
In January 1990, Savic travels to Norway. He was hosted by the Ministry of Foreign affairs and based in _The Munch Museum_ in Oslo. There he studied Munch's paintings, drawings and prints in the main gallery and in the Museum's archives with curator Mr Eggum[10] and conservator Mr Thurmann-Moe[11]. _The National Gallery_ in Oslo served as an excellent source for the comparative studies of Munch's works and his contemporaries. The city of Bergen was the next hub with its _Rasmus Meyer's_ huge collection of Munch's paintings. Savic also collaborated with Svein Christiansen[12] of _Bergen's KunstForeningen_, handling the artworks, preparing the exhibitions and putting the shows in the main gallery. While exploring Munch, being an artist, Savic was granted a special permission to use all the facilities and premises of Bergen's _Vestlandets KunstAkademi_ to create his own artworks. He had tight collaboration with the visiting teachers and School's professors, especially with the Director, painter Morten Krogh[13].

Byzantine Era

Grabovac_1988.jpg 1988, Savic and his fellow artists Lazar Lecic[14], Goran Desancic[15] and Misha Obrenovic were commissioned by the Abbott of _Grabovac[16][17] monastery_ (near Belgrade) to paint frescoes on the walls of the interior of the entire church. The work was done in Byzantine fresco-secco technique and it lasted for three full years. The monastery wasn't just a sacred place, but a unique fresco painting School and a workshop, where the young Artists developed their skills, pictorial taste, theoretical knowledge and monastic spirituality. The Abbott, archimandrite Damaskin, was a spiritual father and professor Todic[18], an expert in Byzantine Art, provided them with subtle details from the history of the profession.
In his work Savic was greatly influenced by Andrei Rublev's icons and 12th - 14th century frescoes from Greece, Serbia and the Middle East.
Savic was baptized in 1989, at the age of 33, in his native Zemun, in the Serbian Orthodox church of St George. The Godfather was a lifelong friend, Misha Devic.
In January 1991, Savic met fellow artist Iskra Bravo[19] in her studio in Belgrade and by March they were married. In April, the same year, Savic travels to Bosnia to join his team in Velika Obarska, for a new fresco painting project. Soon after they started, the civil war broke out in neighboring Croatia. The team went on painting despite the ongoing gunfire just a few miles away. Artists managed to complete their work by the end of September and shortly after, Savic and Bravo went into self-imposed exile by leaving the country.

Holy Land

Iskra_and_Sasha_in_Jerusalem,_1991.jpg Savic and his wife docked at the Israeli port of Haifa in November 1991. They were hosted by the legendary artist Avram Omri, who lived and worked in Sha'ar HaAmakim kibbutz in Galilee. The second stop for the couple was the Artists' colony in Safed, close to the Lebanese border. Courtesy to the Colony's President, they got the studio to work on their art. In the beginning of 1992, they moved to Jerusalem, where they met renowned Serbian journalist, Borivoj Erdeljan, _Politika's_ foreign correspondent. Savic would be greatly influenced by journalist's vast experience and open mindedness. In February, _The Association of Jerusalem Artists_[20]provided a three months residence for the couple in _Hilai_ (The Israeli Center for the Creative Arts) in upper Galilee. Savic and Bravo had tight links with local Artists and with the mixed Arab-Jewish community, working with children on their pictorial education. Savic also gave a lecture on Byzantine Art in _Ma'alot's Cultural Center_. In April the couple moves to Cana of Galilee, a small town near Nazareth. The Abbott of the Greek Orthodox monastery, later the Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem,[21] commissioned Savic to paint several scenes in a true fresco technique in the church famous for the Christ's first Miracle. Savic did ten huge compositions including The Wedding at Cana, while his wife was helping with the preparation of the cartons for the frescoes.

Cyprus

Sasha_and_Dasa,_Tsada,_Cyprus,_1998.jpg By the end of 1992, the couple moves to Cyprus, an island in eastern Mediterranean. Savic was quickly engaged by the Bishop of Paphos (later the Archbishop of Cyprus), to paint a number of icons for the church of _St Spyridon_ and for the _Synodicon_ of the Holy Paphos Bishopric. Famous _St Lazarus church_ in Larnaca, _Center for Cultural Heritage of Cyprus_ in Nicosia, _St Demetrios church_ of Aliathon Resort and _The Church St Cosma and Damianos_ in Paphos, commissioned him to paint icons of various sizes.
Despite working mainly for the church, Savic did more than two hundred icons, now being in numerous private collections around the world.
In 1996, Serbian Patriarch Pavle[22] was in his official visit to Cyprus. Savic was introduced to the Patriarch and got engaged in long conversations with him on several occasions during his journey through Cyprus. "Talking with his Beatitude was a great honor and very inspiring, especially on the topics concerning Byzantine Art, history and life in general" said Savic.
Monagri_(2002).jpg In 1996, Savic met Richard Sale, the director of _The Monagri Foundation[23]_ in Cyprus and they became close friends. The foundation provided residences for artists from all over the world. Through Sale and his wife Alison, Sasha met most of the visiting artists personally, collaborating with them on various joint projects. Savic was the last Guest artist to work at the Foundation, before its closure in 2003 (formal in 2007). Being the top Art Center in Cyprus, in its peak years (1993 - 2003), _Monagri Foundation_, its artists and its spirit, influenced Savic significantly. The result was a creation of new _Praxis_, the Art group with a strong statement in Nature Art.
New_York_1999.jpg In 1998, through a Cypriot book publisher Ruth Keshishian, Savic met American artist Elizabeth Hoak Doering, who was in Cyprus on a Fulbright grant. They joined forces with Cypriot artists Rinos Stefani and Susan Vargas (of Colombia) to form an Art group. In June that year they made the first joint project _The Sphere_ in Nature resort of Akamas in Cyprus. As Glyn Hughes, famous Welsh painter and art critic, wrote in _The Cyprus Weekly_..."Praxis" struck again for the sake of art and in the footsteps of Die Brücke, Blue Reiter and Cobra, with its natural reaction to alienation, amateurism and primitivism of modern societies".
The second joint venture happened in the Millennium year of 2000. "The four artists masterfully crafted huge triangle net and stretched it over a small bay in the Akamas, National Park of Cyprus. The sea@net is a triangular net, placed where the sea meets the land... it is parallel to the horizon line, where the sea touches the sky. The triangle references sails, fishermen's nets and structural stability. The triangle is hope for the stable future of nature. And in the title, a recognition of the communication among a particular generation of people who will be responsible for the preservation of land, sea and sky. The sea@net puts forward questions about the future.

American Tour

In 1999, upon the invitation by _Georgia College&State University_, Savic came to the United States[24] as Artist in residence. Together with Ms Bessie Tina Yarborough,[25] Professor of Art History & Interdisciplinary Studies at GS&SU, Savic organized and conducted a Master class in Byzantine Art and an advanced icon workshop. During that visit Savic explored the American modern art in Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.

2005 - 2015

In the year 2005, Savic becomes a Permanent citizen of Cyprus and the next five years are going to be the most fruitful in his career. Painting in Panagia Pantanassa church in Paphos was one of many fresco projects that he has been commissioned to undertake in recent years, among which were St. Demetrios church of Aliathon Holiday Resort, as well as St. Cosma and Damianos church in Kato Pafos, St George by the Sea and Panagia Therapeftria church of Paphos General Hospital. The increase in demand for his expertise in the fresco technique speaks much about his use of innovative and traditional techniques, which has placed him at the forefront of contemporary fresco painting.
Tatiana_and_Sasha_in_Lille_2014.jpg In 2006 Savic partnered with the Cypriot artist of Armenian descent, Tatiana Ferahian.[26] The couple traveled the world installing Tatiana's Nature Art works at the world-famous Art venues, exhibitions and Symposiums: Forth Beijing Art Biennale 2008, China; Second SHINGLE22j, Anzio & Nettuno Biennale of Contemporary Art 2009, Italy; OUT of SPACE,[27] Art in Nature Symposium 2010, Holland; LITTLE LAND FISH 2010, Sanat Liman, Istanbul, Turkey; YATOO, Geumgang Nature Art Biennale 2012, Gongju, South Korea; Fifth Beijing Art Biennale 2012, China; I-Park Foundation 2013 Environmental Art Biennale,[28] Connecticut, USA; ENTRE-LAC, Nature Art Symposium 2014, Lille, France; SHINGLE22j, 2015 Biennale d'Arte Contemporanea di Anzio e Nettuno,[29] Italy...
