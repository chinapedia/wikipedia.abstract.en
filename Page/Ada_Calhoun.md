She has also been a critic, serving as a frequent contributor to The New York Times Book Review.[1] a co-author and ghostwriter, having collaborated on three books by Tim Gunn;[2] and a freelance essayist and reporter. A Village Voice profile in 2015 said: “Her CV can seem as though it were cobbled together from the résumés of three ambitious journalists.” [3] She has been collected by libraries worldwide.[4]


Early life

Calhoun grew up on St. Marks Place in East Village, Manhattan. She is the only child of art critic Peter Schjeldahl and actress Brooke Alderson.[5] They appear as characters in her book _St. Marks Is Dead_, which she dedicates to them. She has written in The New York Times Magazine about a childhood fascination with the suburbs.[6] As a teenager, she traveled through India and met Mother Teresa.[7] She changed her name in 1998 to avoid comparison to her father.[8]


Writing

As a reporter, she has written about imprisoned women in Alabama,[9] the rap star Bobby Shmurda,[10] and the rise of DIY abortions.[11] She has also written personal essays, including three for the New York Times Modern Love column, and four for the New York Times Magazine’s “Lives” column. The New York Times named her essay “The Wedding Toast I’ll Never Give” its 41st most read story of 2015.[12] In fall 2016, W.W. Norton announced that it would publish a collection of related essays in spring 2017, called Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give.[13] In October 2017, Oprah.com published her article "The New Midlife Crisis." [14] Chartbeat named the article the internet's 55th-most-read story of 2017.[15]

_St. Marks Is Dead_

Her book _St. Marks Is Dead_ was published by W.W. Norton & Company in 2015. She wrote an op-ed that fall that explained her anti-nostalgic feelings about cities and change:[16]

_St. Marks Is Dead_ was a _New York Times Editors_’ Pick, Amazon Book of the Month, and named one of the best books of the year by _Kirkus Reviews_,[17] the _Boston Globe_,[18] _Orlando Weekly_,[19] the _New York Post_. The Village Voice called it, “The Best Nonfiction Book About New York, 2015,” and said, “With _St. Marks Is Dead_, Ada Calhoun just became the most important new voice on old New York."[20]

The Atlantic wrote: “Timely, provocative, and stylishly written …Calhoun’s book serves as a welcome corrective to that rallying cry [that gentrification is bad], and to the tendency to romanticize New York City in the 1970s, when the city was far more riotous and permissive than it is now. … Her aplomb, in fact, is precisely what the discussion needs. Her portrait of neighborhood resilience might suggest more temperate proposals for an increasingly polarized debate.[21]”

The New York Times Book Review said, “Calhoun, who grew up on St. Mark’s Place, is careful not to romanticize any one era of the East Village (which serves as a suitable proxy for much of New York City during the past century). _St. Marks Is Dead_ is an ecstatic roll call."[22]

_Weddings Toasts I'll Never Give_

_Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give_ is a memoir by Calhoun about marriage. It was inspired by the success of her New York Times “Modern Love” column, “The Wedding Toast I’ll Never Give,”[23] which the paper named one of its most-read stories of 2015.[24] The book was released on May 16, 2017 by W. W. Norton & Company.[25]

In the book, Calhoun presents seven personal essays, framed as “toasts”, that discuss topics such as infidelity, existential anxiety, fighting in rental cars, and the “soul mates” ideal.

_Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give_ was praised in pre-publication reviews. _Publishers Weekly_ calls it “A humorous, realistic, and loving look at marriage....Each essay mixes components of memoir and self-help, drawing on insight from Calhoun’s own marriage as well as the wise thoughts of clergymen and lessons learned from long-married couples.” _Library Journal_ said “Alternating between hilarious personal anecdote and sobering professional insight, this memoir conveys perhaps the simplest lesson ever given about learning to make a marriage last: just don’t get divorced. Her other great contribution to the literature on marital happiness might be her explanation of why fights in cars are the worst: you cannot storm off.”[26] The book received blurbs from Molly Ringwald, Susannah Cahalan, Karen Abbott, Phillip Lopate, Carlene Bauer, Davy Rothbart, Leah Carroll, Kathryn Hahn, Gretchen Rubin, Emma Straub, and Rebecca Traister.[27]

Reviews in the _New York Times Book Review_, _Washington Post_, and elsewhere, were overall positive.[28] The _New York Times_ “Modern Love” column published the first serial excerpt on April 23, 2017 as “To Stay Married, Embrace Change.”[29] The book was featured on the TODAY Show.[30] In the "By the Book" column of the _New York Times Book Review_, Tom Hanks replied to the question "What was the last book that made you laugh?" with: "Ada Calhoun’s 'Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give.' I mean, underlining and yellow marker bust-out laughs." [31]


Awards

Calhoun won the 2016 Independent Publisher Book Award gold medal in U.S. History,[32] 2015 USC-Annenberg National Health Journalism Fellowship,[33] 2014 Kiplinger fellowship,[34] 2013 Council on Contemporary Families Media Award,[35] and 2014 Alicia Patterson Foundation fellowship;[36] one of her Patterson stories won the 2015 Croly Award.[37]


Personal life

In 2004, Calhoun married Jerry Neal Medlin,[38] who performs as Neal Medlyn and Champagne Jerry, whom she met when she was sent to interview him for an Austin Chronicle profile.[39] They have one son together, Oliver.[40] She is an advocate for libraries.[41] She majored in Plan II Honors at the University of Texas at Austin, where for her senior thesis she translated part of the Sanskrit Atharvaveda.[42]

Calhoun is the granddaughter of Gilmore Schjeldahl, the inventor of the plastic-lined airsickness bag.
