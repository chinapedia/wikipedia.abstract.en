Plot

The Belchers have sole responsibility for "Donations 4 Carnations" for Valentine's Day at Wagstaff Elementary: Tina collects the money at the booth and Bob provides the flowers.Phlegmy Ms. Labonz hocks through the announcements; Gene and Courtney poke fun at her and get their big break.


Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode an A and wrote, "The climactic visit to the flower wholesalers market is a wonderful bit of Bob’s Burgers silliness, with a setup that feels simultaneously ridiculously and deeply plausible, if only because the whole thing works because all those flower sellers take the whole black-market carnation-selling thing so seriously. It even all culminates in the perfect little romantic note, as Bob and Linda admit they have been far too busy helping the kids to get anything for each other. But hey, they can always just go make out. And if that’s not a Valentine’s Day sentiment for all to get behind, I don’t know what is."[1] Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a positive review by saying, "Those perks, coupled with the tiny advances in Gene's maturation and Tina's love life, made "The Gene & Courtney Show" another triumph in this series' already-strong repertoire of holiday material. And for what it's worth, after Gene pours his heart out to Courtney, he's also rewarded with a kiss — a strategically placed wrench in their story line."[2]

The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.05 million people.[3]
