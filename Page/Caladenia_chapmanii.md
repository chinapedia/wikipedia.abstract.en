Description

_Caladenia chapmanii_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which often grows in large groups. It has an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with up to three flowers, each flower long and wide. The flowers are either maroon, yellow or cream-coloured with lateral sepals, and petals that are long, tapering and drooping. The labellum is relatively large, compared to other caladenias, white with red stripes and has serrated or toothed edges. There are two rows of red or white calli along the centre line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to mid-October.[1][2]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia chapmanii_ was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected near Boyup Brook. The description was published in Nuytsia.[3] Herman Rupp recognised this orchid as a new species in about 1940 but did not publish a description. The specific epithet (_chapmanii_) honours Mr Eric Chapman, an amateur orchid enthusiast who has a population of this orchid growing on his property.[4]


Distribution and habitat

Chapman's spider orchid occurs in scattered populations between Yallingup and Waroona in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions where it grows in woodland.[5][6][7]


Conservation

_Caladenia chapmanii_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[8]
