Kwok was born on 6 December 1938 to Kwok Lam-po and Sylvia Li Yuet-sheung.[1] His grandfather, Kwok Chuen, was the founder of the Wing On Company, one of the major Chinese department stores, while his mother, Sylvia Li, was the daughter of Li Shek-pang, the founder of the Li family, one of the four big families of Hong Kong.

He returned to Hong Kong to help his family business at Wing On in 1970 and became the chairman of the company in 1983.

He formed the Group of 89, a conservative faction consisting of businessmen and professionals who advocated for a slower pace of democratisation in the committee.

He first joined the New Hong Kong Alliance headed by Lo Tak-shing in 1989 but soon quit the party over the controversy of the political model of the SAR government after 1997.[3] In 1990, he co-founded the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong, a conservative pro-business party with other Group of 89 members including Hu Fa-kuang where he became the founding vice-chairman. He was appointed Hong Kong Affairs Adviser in 1993.
