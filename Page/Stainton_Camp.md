STAINTON CAMP is a military installation at Stainton, County Durham.


History

The camp was built in 1941 during the Second World War[1] and served as part of the Battle School[2] before the school moved to Warminster in 1945.[3] Another section of the site was allocated as Blackbeck Prisoner of War Camp during the war.[4] After the war married quarters were built on that part of the site now known as Stainton Grove.[5] The camp went on to be used as a holding facility for units about to deploy on operations and, notably, the Green Howards prepared there for the Suez Crisis.[6] Most of the camp closed in 1972 but parts of it remain in use as a cadet training centre.[7]

Other military installations in the local area were Barford Camp (used as military accommodation into the 1960s[8] but now a motor sports racing track),[9] Deerbolt Camp (used as military accommodation into the 1960s,[10] decommissioned in the early 1970s and now HM Prison Deerbolt),[11] Humbleton Camp (also part of the Battle School during the Second World War,[12] decommissioned in 1960[13] and now a chalet development)[14] Streatlam Camp (used as military accommodation until 1970, when 6 Armoured Brigade returned to Germany,[15] and now demolished) and Westwick Camp (used as military accommodation into the late 1950s,[16] decommissioned in 1960[17] and now demolished).[18]
