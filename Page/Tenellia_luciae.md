_TENELLIA LUCIAE_ is a species of sea slugs, an aeolid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Fionidae.


Etymology

The specific name _luciae_ is in honour of Lucı́a Valdés, the daughter of malacologist Ángel Valdés.[1] The type specimens are stored in the Museo de Malacologı́a, University of Panama and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.[2]


Distribution

The type locality of this species is Crawl Cay, Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama.[3] The distribution includes the area from Florida to Panama.[4] It may possibly also live in Brazil.[5]


Description

The body length is up to 12 mm. It has yellow cerata. Each ceras has one blue band. The oral tentacles are orange and there is a blue band on the head. The reproductive system contains a penial stylet.[6]

_Tenellia caerulea_ is a similar species. They differ in the radula, jaw and reproductive system.[7] _Tenellia herrerai_ is another similar species. It differs in the radula and in coloration. _Tenellia herrerai_ has no orange oral tentacles and it has no blue band on the head.[8] _Tenellia iris_ is also similar to _Tenellia luciae_.[9]


Ecology

_Cuthona luciae_ was found on unidentified hydroids. These may be its prey, because hydroids are also the prey of other _Cuthona_ species. It was recorded from a depth of 1 m.[10]
