KING CRIMSON are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968, that now is more international in membership. King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and many contemporary artists. Although the band has undergone numerous formations throughout its history, Robert Fripp is the only consistent member of the group and is considered the band's leader and driving force. The band has earned a large cult following.[1] They were ranked No. 87 on VH1's _100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock_.[2] Although considered to be a seminal progressive rock band (a genre characterised by extended instrumental sections and complex song structures), they have often distanced themselves from the genre: as well as influencing several generations of progressive and psychedelic rock bands, they have also been an influence on subsequent alternative metal, hardcore and experimental/noise musicians.

Developed from the unsuccessful psychedelic pop trio Giles, Giles and Fripp, the initial King Crimson were key to the formation of early progressive rock, strongly influencing and altering the music of contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis.[3] Their debut album, _In the Court of the Crimson King_ (1969), remains their most successful and influential release, with its elements of jazz, classical and experimental music.[4] Their success increased following an opening act performance for the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park, London, in 1969. Following _In the Wake of Poseidon_ (1970) and the less successful chamber jazz-inspired _Lizard_ (1970), and _Islands_ (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_ (1973), _Starless and Bible Black_ (1974) and _Red_ (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.

In 1981, King Crimson reformed with another change in musical direction and instrumentation (incorporating, for the first time, a mixture of British and American personnel plus doubled guitar and influences taken from gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism). This lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums _Discipline_ (1981), _Beat_ (1982) and _Three of a Perfect Pair_ (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group as an expanded "Double Trio" sextet in 1994, mingling its mid-‘70s and 1980s approaches with new creative options available via MIDI technology. This resulted in another three-year cycle of activity including the release of _Thrak_ (1995). King Crimson reunited again in 2000 as a more alternative metal-oriented quartet (or "Double Duo"), releasing _The Construkction of Light_ in 2000 and _The Power to Believe_ in 2003: after further personnel shuffles, the band expanded to a double-drummer quintet for a 2008 tour celebrating their 40th anniversary.

Following another hiatus between 2009 and 2012, King Crimson reformed once again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline and the return of saxophone/flute to the lineup for the first time since 1971. This current version of King Crimson has continued to tour and to release live albums, significantly rearranging and reinterpreting music from across the band's entire previous career.

Since 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as ProjeKcts.


History

Formation

In August 1967, brothers Michael Giles (drums) and Peter Giles (bass), who had been professional musicians in various jobbing bands since their mid-teens in Dorset, England, advertised for a singing organist to join their new group.[5][6] Fellow Dorset musician Robert Fripp – a guitarist who did not sing – responded and the trio formed the band Giles, Giles and Fripp. Based on a format of eccentric pop songs and complex instrumentals, the band recorded several unsuccessful singles and one album, _The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp_.[7] The band hovered on the edge of success, with several radio sessions and a television appearance, but never scored the hit that would have been crucial for a commercial breakthrough. The album was no more of a success than the singles and was even disparaged by Keith Moon of the Who in a magazine review.[8]

Attempting to expand their sound, the three recruited Ian McDonald on keyboards, reeds and woodwinds. McDonald brought along his then-girlfriend, former Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble, whose brief tenure with the group ended when the two split.[9][10] McDonald brought in lyricist, roadie, and art strategist Peter Sinfield, with whom he had been writing songs – a partnership initiated when McDonald had said to Sinfield, regarding his 1968 band Creation, "Peter, I have to tell you that your band is hopeless, but you write some great words. Would you like to get together on a couple of songs?"[11] Fripp, meanwhile, saw Clouds perform at the Marquee Club in London which inspired him to incorporate classical melodies and jazz-like improvisation in his song writing.[12] No longer interested in pursuing Peter Giles' more whimsical pop style, Fripp recommended his friend, singer and guitarist Greg Lake, join and replace either Peter Giles or Fripp himself.[13] Peter Giles later called it one of Fripp's "cute political moves".[14] But he had become disillusioned with the band's lack of success and departed, leaving Lake to become bassist and singer.[15]

1968–1969: _In the Court of the Crimson King_

The first incarnation of King Crimson was formed in London on 30 November 1968 and first rehearsed on 13 January 1969.[16][17] The band's name was coined by Sinfield, though it is not meant to be a synonym for Beelzebub, prince of demons.[18] (According to Fripp, Beelzebub would be an anglicised form of the Arabic phrase "B'il Sabab", meaning "the man with an aim".[19]) Historically and etymologically, a "crimson king" was any monarch during whose reign there was civil unrest and copious bloodshed; the album debuted at the height of worldwide opposition to the military involvement of the United States in Southeast Asia. At this point, McDonald was the group's main composer, albeit with contributions from Lake and Fripp, while Sinfield wrote the lyrics, designed and operated the band's stage lighting, being credited with "sounds and visions." McDonald suggested the band purchase a Mellotron, and they began using it to create an orchestral rock sound, inspired by the Moody Blues.[20] Sinfield described Crimson thus: "If it sounded at all popular, it was out. So it had to be complicated, it had to be more expansive chords, it had to have strange influences. If it sounded, like, too simple, we'd make it more complicated, we'd play it in 7/8 or 5/8, just to show off".[21]

King Crimson made their breakthrough live debut on 5 July 1969[22] by playing the Rolling Stones free concert at Hyde Park, London in July 1969 before an estimated 500,000 people.[23] The debut album, _In the Court of the Crimson King_, was released in October 1969 on Island Records. Fripp would later describe it as having been "an instant smash" and "New York's acid album of 1970" (notwithstanding Fripp and Giles' assertion that the band never used psychedelic drugs).[24] The album received public compliments from Pete Townshend, the Who's guitarist, who called the album "an uncanny masterpiece."[25] The album's sound, including its opening track "21st Century Schizoid Man", was described as setting the precedent for alternative rock and grunge, whilst the softer tracks are described as having an "ethereal" and "almost sacred" feel.[26] In contrast to the blues-based hard rock of the contemporary British and American scenes, King Crimson presented a more Europeanised approach that blended antiquity and modernity. The band's music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included romantic- and modernist-era classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by Jimi Hendrix, folk, jazz, military music (partially inspired by McDonald's stint as an army musician), ambient improvisation, Victoriana and British pop.

After playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. While their original sound astounded contemporary audiences and critics,[27] creative tensions were already developing within the band. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson's rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with the band's direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer in the band nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the band's driving force and spokesman, leading King Crimson into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more romantic style of music, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned from the band during the US tour. To salvage what he saw as the most important elements of King Crimson, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald and Giles declared that the band was "more (him) than them" and that they should therefore be the ones to leave.[28] The line-up played their last show at the Fillmore West in San Francisco on 16 December 1969.[29] Live recordings of the tour were released in 1997 on _Epitaph_.

1970–1971: the "interregnum" – _In the Wake of Poseidon_ and _Lizard_

After their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction. This period has subsequently been referred to as the "interregnum" – a nickname implying that the "King" (King Crimson) was not properly in place during this time.[30] Fripp became the only remaining musician in the band, with Sinfield expanding his creative role to playing synthesizers.

Fripp and Sinfield recorded the second King Crimson album, _In the Wake of Poseidon_, in 1970 with the Giles brothers hired back as the session rhythm section, and with jazz pianist Keith Tippett and Circus saxophonist Mel Collins as guest musicians. The group considered hiring Elton John to be the singer, but decided against the idea.[31] Lake then agreed to sing on the album in exchange for receiving King Crimson's PA equipment,[32] except on "Cadence and Cascade", which is sung by Fripp's friend Gordon Haskell. Though Tippett was offered band membership, he preferred to remain as a studio collaborator, performing with the band for a single gig.[33] Upon its release in May 1970, _In the Wake of Poseidon_ reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album.[34] With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited Andy McCulloch as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player.[35]

During the writing sessions for the third album, _Lizard_,[36] Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, Mark Charig on cornet, Nick Evans on trombone, and Robin Miller on oboe and cor anglais as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. Jon Anderson of Yes was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, "Prince Rupert Awakes",[37] which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style.[38] _Lizard_ featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the EMS VCS 3 synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of the Beatles, with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, _Lizard_ reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an "acquired taste",[39] _Lizard_ was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed,[40][41] leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more.

1971–1972: the _Islands_ band

After a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and Ian Wallace on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from Bryan Ferry[42] and John Gaydon, the band's manager. The position went to Raymond "Boz" Burrell.[43] Bassist John Wetton was invited to join, but declined (at the time) in order to play with Family.[44] Rick Kemp also declined an offer to join,[45][46] leaving Fripp and Wallace teaching Burrell to play bass rather than continue auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument.[47][48] With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.[49]

In 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded _Islands_. Loosely influenced by Miles Davis's orchestral collaborations with Gil Evans and Homer's _Odyssey_, the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental "Sailor's Tale", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). _Islands_ also featured the band's one-and-only experiment with a string ensemble on "Prelude: Song of the Gulls" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired "Ladies of the Road". A hint of trouble to come came when one member of the band allegedly described the more delicate and meditative parts of _Islands_ as "airy-fairy shit".[50] Released in December 1971, _Islands_ charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a period of touring _Islands_, Fripp asked Sinfield to leave the band,[51] citing musical differences and a loss of faith in his partner's ideas.[52] The remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals shortly afterward, owing to Fripp's refusal to incorporate other members' compositions into the band's repertoire. He later cited this as "quality control", with the idea that King Crimson would perform the "right kind" of music.[53]

King Crimson reformed to fulfil touring commitments in 1972, with the intention of disbanding afterwards.[54] Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as _Earthbound_ in June 1972,[55] noted and criticised for its sub-par sound quality and playing style that occasionally veered towards funk, with scat singing on the improvised pieces.[56][57] By this time, a definite musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band existed, since Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured a more rhythm-and-blues style.[58] Though personal relations improved during the 1972 tour (to the point where most of the band wished to continue), Fripp opted to part company with the existing band and to restructure King Crimson with new members, since he felt the current members wouldn't be able to play the new material he had in mind.[59]

1972–1975: the "European improvisers" – _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_, _Starless and Bible Black_, _Red_, and hiatus

The third major line-up of King Crimson was radically different from the previous two. Fripp's four new recruits were free-improvising percussionist Jamie Muir,[60] drummer Bill Bruford,[61] who left Yes at a new commercial peak in their career in favour of the "darker" King Crimson,[62] bassist and singer John Wetton, and violinist and keyboardist David Cross whom Fripp had encountered through work with music colleagues.[63] Most of the musical compositions were collaborations between Fripp and Wetton, who each composed segments independently and fitted together those which they found compatible.[64] With Sinfield gone, the band recruited Wetton's friend Richard Palmer-James as their new lyricist.[65] Unlike Sinfield, Palmer-James played no part in artistic, visual, or sonic direction; his sole contributions were his lyrics, sent to Wetton by post from his home in Germany. Following a period of rehearsals, King Crimson resumed touring on 13 October 1972 at the Zoom Club in Frankfurt, with the band's penchant for improvisation and Muir's startling stage presence gaining them renewed press attention.

In January and February 1973, King Crimson recorded _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_ in London which was released that March.[66][67] The band's new sound was exemplified by the album's two-part title track – a significant change from what King Crimson had done before,[68] emphasising instrumentals and drawing influences from classical, free, and heavy metal music.[69] The record displayed Muir's free approach to percussion, which included using a drum kit, bicycle parts, toys, a bullroarer, hitting a gong with chains, and a joke laughing bag. The album reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 61 in the US. After a period of further touring, Muir departed in 1973, quitting the music industry altogether. Though this was initially thought to have been motivated by an onstage injury caused by a gong landing on his foot,[70] it was later revealed that Muir had gone through a personal spiritual crisis, and had withdrawn to become a monk.[71]

With Muir gone, the remaining members reconvened in January 1974 to produce _Starless and Bible Black_, released in March 1974[72][73] and earned them a positive _Rolling Stone_ review.[74] Though most of the album is formed of live performances from the band's late 1973 tour,[75] the recordings were painstakingly edited to sound like a studio record, with "The Great Deceiver" and "Lament" the only tracks recorded in the studio.[76] The album reached No. 28 in the UK and No. 64 in the US. Following the album's release, the band began to divide once more, this time over performance. Musically, Fripp found himself positioned between Bruford and Wetton, who played with such force and increasing volume that Fripp once compared them to "a flying brick wall",[77] and Cross, whose amplified acoustic violin was increasingly being drowned out by the rhythm section, leading him to concentrate more on keyboards. An increasingly frustrated Cross began to withdraw musically and personally, with the result that he was voted out of the group following the band's 1974 tour of Europe and America.[78]

In July 1974 Fripp, Bruford, and Wetton began recording _Red_.[79] Before recording began, Fripp, now increasingly disillusioned with the music business, turned his attention to the works of Russian mystic George Gurdjieff[80] and experienced a spiritual crisis-cum-awakening; he later described it as if "the top of my head blew off".[81] Though most of the album was already written, Fripp retreated into himself in the studio and "withdrew his opinion", leaving Bruford and Wetton to direct most of the recording sessions. The album contains studio recorded material with one live track, "Providence", recorded on 30 June 1974 with Cross in the group. Several musicians, including some from past King Crimson line-ups, contribute to the album. Released in October 1974, _Red_ went to No. 45 in the UK and No. 66 in the US. AllMusic called it "an impressive achievement" for a group about to disband, with "intensely dynamic" musical chemistry between the band members.[82]

Two months before the release of _Red_, King Crimson's future looked bright (with talks regarding founder member Ian McDonald rejoining the group).[83] However, Fripp wished not to tour as he felt increasingly disenchanted by the group and the music industry. He also felt the world was going to end in 1981 and that he had to prepare for it.[84][85] Despite a band meeting while touring the US in which Fripp expressed a desire to end the band,[86] the group formally disbanded on 25 September 1974 when Fripp announced that King Crimson had "ceased to exist" and was "completely over for ever and ever".[87][88][89] It was later revealed that Fripp had attempted to interest his managers in a King Crimson without him, but the idea was turned down.[90][91] Following the band's disbanding, the live album _USA_ was released in May 1975, formed of recordings from their 1974 North American tour. It received some positive reviews,[92] including "a must" for fans of the band and "insanity you're better off having".[93][94] Issues with some of the tapes rendered some of Cross' violin inaudible, so Eddie Jobson was hired to perform overdubs of violin and keyboards in a studio; further edits were also made to allow the music to fit on a single LP.[95] Between 1975 and 1980, King Crimson were inactive.

1981–1984: the "rock gamelan" – _Discipline_, _Beat_, _Three of a Perfect Pair_, and second hiatus

In 1981, having spent seven years in spiritual pursuits and smaller projects (from playing guitar for David Bowie, Peter Gabriel and Daryl Hall to pursuing an experimental solo career to leading the instrumental band The League of Gentlemen, which included members of various post-punk groups) Fripp decided to form a new "first division" rock group but had no intentions of reforming King Crimson.[96] Having recruited Bill Bruford as drummer,[97] Fripp asked singer and guitarist Adrian Belew,[98] the first time Fripp was in a band with another guitarist and therefore indicative of Fripp's desire to create a sound unlike any of his previous work.[99] After touring with Talking Heads, Belew agreed to join and also become the band's lyricist. Bruford's suggestion of Jeff Berlin as bassist was rejected as his playing was "too busy",[100] so auditions were held in New York: on the third day, Fripp left after roughly three auditions, only to return several hours later with Tony Levin (who got the job after playing a single chorus of "Red").[101] Fripp later confessed that, had he initially known that Levin was available and interested, he would have selected him as first-choice bass player without holding auditions. Fripp named the new quartet Discipline, and the band went to England to rehearse and write new material. They made their live debut at Moles Club in Bath, Somerset on 30 April 1981, and completed a UK tour[102] supported by the Lounge Lizards.[103] By October 1981, the band had opted to change their name to King Crimson.[104]

In 1981, King Crimson recorded _Discipline_ with producer Rhett Davies. The album displayed a very different version of the band, with newer influences including post-punk, new wave, latterday funk and go-go and African-styled polyrhythms.[105] With a sound described in _The New Rolling Stone Album Guide_ as having a "jaw-dropping technique" of "knottily rhythmic, harmonically demanding workouts",[106] Fripp intended to create the sound of a "rock gamelan", with an interlocking rhythmic quality to the paired guitars that he found similar to Indonesian gamelan ensembles.[107] Fripp concentrated on playing complex picked arpeggios, while Belew provided an arsenal of guitar sounds including animal noises, industrial textures, and guitar screams with a range of electronic effects pedals. In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the Chapman Stick, a ten-string polyphonic two-handed tapping guitar instrument that has a bass and treble range and which he played in an "utterly original style".[108] Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a Simmons SDS-V electronic drum kit. The band's songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew's pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band's previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental ("The Sheltering Sky") emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted "Indiscipline" was a partially-written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album and to play against the beat in any way that he could.[109] Released in September 1981, _Discipline_ reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.

In June 1982, King Crimson followed _Discipline_ with _Beat_ (the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band line-up as the album preceding it).[110] None of the members of the group produced the record; Davies undertook production duties himself.[111] The album had a loosely linked theme of the Beat Generation and its writings,[112] reflected in song titles such as "Neal and Jack and Me" (inspired by Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac), "The Howler" (inspired by Allan Ginsberg's "Howl") and "Sartori in Tangier" (inspired by Paul Bowles). Fripp asked Belew to read Kerouac's novel _On the Road_[113] for inspiration, and the album contained themes of travel, disorientation and loneliness. While the album was noticeably poppier than _Discipline_, it featured the harsh, atonal and improvised "Requiem".

Recording _Beat_ was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio.[114][115] After differences were resolved, and while _Beat_ reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring. "Heartbeat" was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the _Billboard_ Mainstream Rock chart. Around this time the band released the VHS-only '"The Noise: Live in Frejus" (DGMVC2), a record of a show played at the Arena, Frejus, France on 27 August 1982. (This video is now on DVD as part of the compilation Neal and Jack and Me.)

King Crimson's next album, _Three of a Perfect Pair_, was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and sequence it as a "left side" — four of the band's poppier songs plus an instrumental — and a "right side" (experimental work including extended and atonal improvisations in the tradition of the mid-1970s band, plus as the third part of "Larks' Tongues in Aspic"). _Three of a Perfect Pair_ peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with "Three of a Perfect Pair" and "Sleepless" being released as singles. The 2001 remaster of the album included "the other side", a collection of remixes and improvisation out-takes plus Levin's tongue-in-cheek vocal piece, "The King Crimson Barbershop". The last concert of the _Three of a Perfect Pair_ tour, at the Spectrum in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as _Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal_.

Following the 1984 tour, Fripp dissolved King Crimson for the second time, having become dissatisfied with its working methods. Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in _Musician_ magazine. Despite these circumstances, the musicians remained on fairly amicable terms. Belew would later refer to the band "taking a break" that ultimately lasted for ten years.

1994–1999: the Double Trio – _Vroooom_, _THRAK_, and the ProjeKcts

In the early 1990s, Belew met with Fripp in England with an interest in a reformed King Crimson. Two years later, in 1992, Fripp established the Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) record label with producer David Singleton: this would subsequently be the main home for Fripp's work, with main album releases distributed to larger record companies, affording Fripp and his associates greater freedom and more control over their work.

After a tour with David Sylvian in 1993 (who declined an offer to join Crimson), Fripp began to assemble a new version of the band, an union between the band's previous incarnation and the Sylvian & Fripp group: he was joined with Belew, Levin, Bruford, Chapman Stick player Trey Gunn (a Guitar Craft alumnus), and drummer Pat Mastelotto (who replaced the first choice, Jerry Marotta). Fripp explained the six-member formation was to be a "Double Trio" with two guitarists, two bassists, and two drummers, to explore a different style of music. Bruford later said he lobbied his own way into the band, believing that King Crimson was very much "his gig", and that Fripp had come up with the philosophical explanation later. One of the conditions Fripp had imposed on Bruford regarding his return was to give up all creative control to Fripp.[116]

Following rehearsals in Woodstock, New York, the group released the extended play _Vrooom_ in October 1994. This revealed the new King Crimson sound, which featured elements of the interlocking guitars on _Discipline_ and the heavy rock feel of _Red_,[117] but also involved a greater use of ambient electronic sound and ideas from industrial music. In contrast, many of the actual songs – mostly written or finalised by Belew – displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before – in particular, a Beatles influence (although Bruford would also refer to the band as sounding like "a dissonant Shadows on steroids"[118]). As with previous line-ups, new technology was used including MIDI and the Warr tap guitar with which Gunn replaced the Stick. King Crimson toured the album from 28 September 1994 in Buenos Aires, Argentina; following concerts were released on the double live _B'Boom: Live in Argentina_ in 1995.

In October and December 1994, King Crimson recorded their eleventh studio album, _Thrak_. Formed of revised versions of most of the tracks on _Vrooom_, plus new tracks, the album was described by _Q_ magazine as having "jazz-scented rock structures, characterised by noisy, angular, exquisite guitar interplay" and an "athletic, ever-inventive rhythm section,"[119] while being in tune with the sound of alternative rock of the mid-1990s.[120] Examples of the band's efforts to integrate their multiple elements could be heard on the complex post-prog songs "Dinosaur" and "Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream" as well as the more straightforward "One Time" and the funk-pop inspired "People".

King Crimson resumed touring in 1995 and 1996; dates from October and November 1995 were recorded and released on the live album _Thrakattak_ in May 1996, consisting of improvisations from performances of "THRAK" and Fripp's DGM partner David Singleton into an hour-long extended improvisation.[121] A more conventional live recording from the period was later made available on the 2001 double CD release _Vrooom Vrooom_, as was a 1995 concert on the 2003 _Déjà Vrooom_ DVD.

When fresh writing rehearsals began in mid-1997 in Nashville, Tennessee, Fripp was dissatisfied with the quality of the new music being developed by the band; developing friction and disagreements between himself and Bruford led to the latter deciding to leave King Crimson.[122][123] The resulting atmosphere and the lack of workable band material almost broke the band up altogether. Instead, the six members (including Bruford) opted to work in four smaller groups (or "fraKctalisations", according to Fripp) known as the ProjeKcts. This enabled the group to continue developing musical ideas and searching for Crimson's next direction without the practical difficulty and expense of convening all six members at once. In 1998 and 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the US, Japan, and the UK and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation.[124] These have been collectively described by music critic J. D. Considine as "frequently astonishing" but lacking in melody, and perhaps too difficult for a casual listener.[125]

2000–2010: the Double Duo and the second quintet – _The Construkction of Light_, _The Power to Believe_, 40th Anniversary tour, third hiatus

At the end of the four ProjeKct runs, Bruford left King Crimson altogether to resume his work in jazz. At the same time, Levin's commitments as a session and touring musician forced him to take an indefinite break from the band. The remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) reconvened as a "Double Duo" to write and record _The Construkction of Light_[126] in Belew's basement and garage near Nashville. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. All of the pieces were metallic and harsh in sound, similar to the work of contemporary alternative metal. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavy processed drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn continuing on Warr Guitar but now taking over the bass role, and a different take on the interlocked guitar sound that the band had used since the 1980s. With the exception of a parodic industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of "Hooter J. Johnson"), the songs were unrelentingly complex and challenging to the listener, with plenty of rhythmic displacement to add to the harsh textures. The album contains the fourth instalment of "Larks' Tongues in Aspic". It received a negative reception for lacking new ideas.[127] The band recorded an album at the same time, under the name of ProjeKct X, called _Heaven and Earth_.[128] Conceived and led by Mastelotto and Gunn, with Fripp and Belew playing subsidiary roles, it was a further development of the polyrhythmic/dance music approach adopted in the ProjeKcts.[129]

King Crimson toured to support both albums, including double bill shows with Tool. The tour was documented in the triple live album _Heavy Construkction_, released in December 2000. This showed the band constantly switching between the structured album pieces and ferocious ProjeKct-style Soundscape-and-percussion improvisations.[130] Bassist John Paul Jones supported the band on some live shows.[131]

On 9 November 2001, King Crimson released a limited edition live extended play called _Level Five_,[132] featuring three new pieces: Previously unrecorded new tracks "Dangerous Curves", "Level Five" title track and "Virtuous Circle", plus versions of "The Construkction of Light" and 1998 ProjeKct Two's "Deception of the Thrush" followed by the unlisted track "ProjeKct 12th and X" after one silent minute.[133] A second EP followed in October 2002, _Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With_.[134] This featured eleven tracks including a live version of "Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part IV". Half of the tracks were brief processed vocal snippets sung by Belew, and the songs themselves varied between gamelan pop, Soundscapes, and slightly parodic takes on heavy metal and blues.

King Crimson released their thirteenth album, _The Power to Believe_, in October 2003.[135] Fripp described it as "the culmination of three years of Crimsonising". The album incorporated reworked and/or retitled versions of "Deception of the Thrush", tracks from their previous two EPs, and a 1997 track with added instrumentation and vocals. _The Power to Believe_ reached No. 162 in the UK and No. 150 in the US. King Crimson toured in 2003 to support the album; recordings from it were used for the live album _EleKtrik: Live in Japan_. 2003 also saw the release of the DVD _Eyes Wide Open_, a compilation of the band's shows Live at the Shepherds Bush Empire (London, 3 July 2000) and Live in Japan (Tokyo, 16 April 2003).

In November 2003, Gunn left the group to pursue solo projects and was replaced by the returning Tony Levin. The band reconvened in early 2004 for rehearsals, but nothing developed from the sessions. At this point, Fripp was publicly reassessing his desire to work with King Crimson and within the music industry, often citing the unsympathetic aspects of the life of a touring musician.

Despite this, a new King Crimson formation was announced in 2007:[136] Fripp, Belew, Levin, Mastelotto, and a new second drummer, Gavin Harrison,[137][138] the first new member from the UK since 1972. In August 2008, after a period of rehearsals,[139] the five completed the band's 40th Anniversary Tour. The setlists featured no new material, drawing instead from the existing _Discipline_-era/Double Trio/Double Duo repertoire, although several pieces received striking new percussion-heavy arrangements. Additional shows were planned for 2009, but were cancelled due to scheduling clashes.

King Crimson began another hiatus after the 40th Anniversary Tour.[140] Belew continued to lobby for reviving the band, and discussed it with Fripp several times in 2009 and 2010. Among Belew's suggestions was a temporary reunion of the 1980s line-up for a thirtieth anniversary tour: an idea declined by both Fripp and Bruford, the latter commenting "I would be highly unlikely to try to recreate the same thing, a mission I fear destined to failure."[141][142][143][144][145] In December 2010, Fripp wrote that the King Crimson "switch" had been set to "off", citing several reasons for this decision.[146]

2011–present: the "Seven-Headed Beast" lineup and the Double Quartet

In 2011, a band called Jakszyk Fripp Collins (and subtitled "A King Crimson ProjeKct") released an album called _A Scarcity of Miracles_. The band featured Jakko Jakszyk, Robert Fripp and Mel Collins as main players and composers, with Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison covering bass guitar/Chapman Stick and drums respectively. At one point, Fripp referred to the band as "P7".[147] Unusually for a ProjeKct, it was based around fully finished and carefully crafted original songs (initially derived from improvisations). For a while, King Crimson fans debated whether this was a new line-up of the main band under another name, but the project did not tour or release another album. In August 2012, Fripp announced his retirement from the music industry, leaving the future of King Crimson uncertain.[148][149][150]

In September 2013, Fripp suddenly and unexpectedly announced King Crimson's return to activity with a "very different reformation to what has gone before: seven players, four English and three American, with three drummers".[151] He cited several reasons to make a comeback, varying from the practical[152] to the whimsical: "I was becoming too happy. Time for a pointed stick."[153] The new line-up drew from both the previous lineup (retaining Fripp, Levin, Harrison and Mastelotto) and the _Scarcity of Miracles_ project (adding Jakszyk and Collins), with Guitar Craft alumnus and former R.E.M./Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin as the seventh member. Adrian Belew was not asked to take part, thus ending his 32-year tenure in King Crimson: Jakszyk took his place as singer and second guitarist.[154] This version of the group took on the nickname of "the Seven-Headed Beast".[155]

In early 2014, King Crimson had no plans to record in the studio, instead playing "reconfigured" versions of past material[156] For the first time since 1974, the band's repertoire included songs from the run of albums between _In The Court of the Crimson King_ and _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_, as well as including instrumentals from _THRAK_ and _The Power to Believe_ (although Adrian Belew's songs were conspicuously absent). After rehearsing in England,[157][158] they toured North America from 9 September 2014 across 20 dates.[159][160] Recordings from the Los Angeles dates were released as _Live at the Orpheum_.

Tours across Europe, Canada, and Japan followed[161] in the later half of 2015. A live recording from the Canadian leg of the tour was released as _Live In Toronto_. A European tour was planned for 2016. Following Rieflin's decision to take a break from music[162] after the three dates of March, April and June in Salisbury, drummer Jeremy Stacey of Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds was called in place for dates from September, building-up the now so-called 2016-SOND line-up.

On 7 December 2016, founding King Crimson member Greg Lake died of cancer.

On 3 January 2017, Robert Fripp announced Bill Rieflin's return to King Crimson.[163] Since the band liked and wished to retain Jeremy Stacey, Rieflin shifted his group role and became King Crimson's full-time keyboard player. Consequently, King Crimson became an octet, referred to by Fripp as the "Double Quartet Formation".[164][165][166]

On 31 January 2017, another former King Crimson member, John Wetton, died of colon cancer.[167][168][169]

On 27 April 2017, King Crimson announced a new live EP named "Heroes" after the David Bowie song, as a tribute to both the artist and the album featuring the song in question (both of which featured distinctive Robert Fripp guitar contributions throughout).[170] The video to the song won "Video of the Year" at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards.[171] Shortly afterwards, King Crimson embarked on an extensive tour of North America beginning on 11 June 2017 in Seattle, Washington and ending on 26 November 2017 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

On 3 September 2017, Robert Fripp announced that his differences with Adrian Belew had been resolved and that Belew was now King Crimson's "Ninth Man Inactive"; meaning that there were "no current plans for (him) to come out with the current formation; but (he) has rejoined the larger family - hooray! - and doors to the future are open." Belew confirmed this, adding "it means I may be back in the band in the future at some point. It leaves the door open for Crimson to evolve as necessary."[172]

On 13 October 2017, it was announced that Bill Rieflin would be unable to join the Double Quartet Formation on the 2017 Autumn tour in the U.S. He was temporarily replaced by Seattle-based Crafty Guitarist Chris Gibson.[173]

During 2018, King Crimson performed the extensive 33-date Uncertain Times tour through the UK and Europe between 13 June and 16 November, visiting Poland, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK and France.[174]

On 6 April 2019, it was announced at a press conference that Rieflin would take another break from King Crimson to attend to family matters, and that his place on keyboards for the 2019 50th anniversary tour would be taken by Theo Travis, better known as a jazz saxophonist, Soft Machine member and occasional duo collaborator with Robert Fripp.[175] Although Travis joined the band for rehearsals, Fripp announced on 2 May that the band had decided that it was no longer possible to have other musicians deputising for Rieflin and for this reason were "proceed(ing) as a Seven-Headed Beast" without Travis.[176][177] Rieflin's parts were divided among other band members, with Jakszyk and Collins adding keyboards to their on-stage rigs, and Levin once again using the synthesizer he used during the 1980s tours.[178]


King Crimson members' bands devoted to playing King Crimson's music

Since the early 2000s, several bands containing former, recent or current King Crimson members have toured and recorded, performing King Crimson music.

Active between 2002 and 2004, the 21st Century Schizoid Band reunited several former King Crimson members who had played on the band's first four albums. The band featured Ian McDonald, Mel Collins, Peter Giles and Michael Giles (the latter subsequently replaced by Ian Wallace), and was fronted by guitarist/singer Jakko Jakszyk (a decade prior to his own recruitment into King Crimson proper). The band engaged in several tours, played material from the band's 1960s and 1970s catalogue, and recorded several live albums.[179]

Since 2007, Tony Levin has led the trio Stick Men, which also features Pat Mastelotto (the band was initially completed by Chapman Stick player Michael Bernier, replaced in 2010 by touch guitarist and former Fripp student Markus Reuter). This band includes and interprets King Crimson compositions from the band's entire career in their live sets. Reuter and Mastelotto also play together as a duo (originally called Tuner), for which they have been known to rework the mid-1980s King Crimson instrumental "Industry" live.

Between 2011 and 2014, Stick Men and Adrian Belew's Power Trio band (Belew plus drummer Tobias Ralph and bass player Julie Slick) joined forces to play and tour as The Crimson ProjeKCt, covering the music made during Belew's tenure as King Crimson frontman and principal songwriter.

During his solo career (including performance with the Power Trio), Adrian Belew has performed versions of certain King Crimson songs written predominantly by himself, such as "Dinosaur," as well as ensemble pieces like "Frame by Frame" and "Neurotica,". Post-Crimson, he has also performed live versions of King Crimson songs which he neither wrote nor composed (in particular when he has played with Eddie Jobson), such as "Red" or "Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Pt. II".


Musical style

The band's music was initially grounded in the rock of the 1960s, especially the acid rock and psychedelic rock movements. The band played Donovan's "Get Thy Bearings" in concert,[180] and were known to play the Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" in their rehearsals.[181] However, for their own compositions, King Crimson (unlike the rock bands that had come before them) largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and replaced them with influences derived from classical composers. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the _Mars_ section of Gustav Holst's suite _The Planets_ as a regular part of their live set[182] and Fripp has frequently cited the influence of Béla Bartók.[183] As a result of this influence, _In the Court of the Crimson King_ is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the progressive rock movements.[184] King Crimson also initially displayed strong jazz influences, most obviously on its signature track "21st Century Schizoid Man".[185][186] The band also drew on English folk music for compositions such as "Moonchild"[187] and "I Talk to the Wind."[188][189]

The 1981 reunion of the band brought in even more elements, displaying the influence of gamelan music[190] and of late 20th century classical composers such as Philip Glass,[191] Steve Reich,[192] and Terry Riley.[193] For its 1994 reunion, King Crimson reassessed both the mid-1970s and 1980s approaches in the light of new technology, intervening music forms such as grunge, and further developments in industrial music, as well as expanding the band's ambient textural content via Fripp's Soundscapes looping approach.

Compositional approaches

Several King Crimson compositional approaches have remained constant from the earliest versions of the band to the present. These include:

-   The use of a gradually building rhythmic motif.[194] These include "The Devil's Triangle" (an adaptation and variation on the Gustav Holst piece _Mars_ played by the original King Crimson, based on a complex pulse in time over which a skirling melody is played on a Mellotron), 1973's "The Talking Drum" (from _Larks' Tongues in Aspic_), 1984's "Industry" (from _Three of a Perfect Pair_) and 2003's "Dangerous Curves" (from _The Power to Believe_).[195]
-   An instrumental piece (often embedded as a break in a song) in which the band plays an ensemble passage of considerable rhythmic and polyrhythmic complexity.[196] An early example is the band's initial signature tune "21st Century Schizoid Man", but the "Larks' Tongues in Aspic" series of compositions (as well as pieces of similar intent such as "THRAK" and "Level Five") go deeper into polyrhythmic complexity, delving into rhythms that wander into and out of general synchronisation with each other, but that all 'finish' together through polyrhythmic synchronisation. These polyrhythms were particularly abundant in the band's 1980s work, which contained gamelan-like rhythmic layers and continual overlaid staccato patterns in counterpoint.
-   The composition of difficult solo passages for individual instruments, such as the guitar break on "Fracture" on _Starless and Bible Black_.[197]
-   The juxtaposition of ornate tunes and ballads with unusual, often dissonant noises (such as "Cirkus" from _Lizard_, "Ladies of the Road" from _Islands_ and "Eyes Wide Open" from _The Power to Believe_).[198]
-   The use of improvisation.
-   Ascending note structure (e.g. "Facts of Life" and "THRAK").[199]

Improvisation

King Crimson have incorporated improvisation into their performances and studio recordings from the beginning, some of which has been embedded into loosely composed pieces such as "Moonchild" or "THRaK".[200] Most of the band's performances over the years have included at least one stand-alone improvisation where the band simply started playing and took the music wherever it went, sometimes including passages of restrained silence, as with Bill Bruford's contribution to the improvised "Trio". The earliest example of King Crimson unambiguously improvising is the spacious, oft-criticised extended coda of "Moonchild" from _In the Court of the Crimson King_.[201][202]

Rather than using the standard jazz or blues "jamming" format for improvisation (in which one soloist at a time takes centre stage while the rest of the band lies back and plays along with established rhythm and chord changes), King Crimson improvisation is a group affair in which each member of the band is able to make creative decisions and contributions as the music is being played.[203] Individual soloing is largely eschewed; each musician is to listen to each other and to the group sound, to be able to react creatively within the group dynamic. A slightly similar method of continuous improvisation ("everybody solos and nobody solos") was initially used by King Crimson's jazz-fusion contemporaries Weather Report. Fripp has used the metaphor of "white magic" to describe this process, in particular when the method works particularly well.[204]

Similarly, King Crimson's improvised music is rarely jazz or blues-based, and varies so much in sound that the band has been able to release several albums consisting entirely of improvised music, such as the _Thrakattak_ album. Occasionally, particular improvised pieces will be recalled and reworked in different forms at different shows, becoming more and more refined and eventually appearing on official studio releases (the most recent example being "Power to Believe III", which originally existed as the stage improvisation "Deception of the Thrush", a piece played on stage for a long time before appearing on record).[205]


Influence

King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists. Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's initial style of symphonic Mellotron rock,[206] and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer, (some of whose songs can be regarded stylistically as Lake's attempt to continue the early work of King Crimson); McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in UK and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush cites King Crimson as a strong early influence on their sound; drummer Neil Peart credits the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles on his own approach to percussion.[207]

King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson,[208][209][210][211] with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: "Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson."[212] Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta,[213][214] Porcupine Tree,[215] Primus,[216][217] Mystery Jets,[218][219] Fanfarlo,[220] and Anekdoten, who first practised together playing King Crimson songs.[221] Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums.[222] In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of _In the Court of the Crimson King_ entitled _Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn_.[223] Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply.[224] The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s.[225] Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords.[226][227] Bad Religion cites the lyrics of "21st Century Schizoid Man" on their single "21st Century (Digital Boy)" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name of Crimson's debut album.[228]

King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Mastodon,[229][230] Between the Buried and Me,[231][232] Leprous,[233][234] Haken,[235] the Ocean,[236] Caligula's Horse,[237] Last Chance to Reason,[238] and Indukti.[239] Members of metal bands Mudvayne,[240] Voivod,[241] Enslaved,[242][243] Yob,[244] Pyrrhon,[245] and Pallbearer[246] have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan,[247] Neurosis,[248] Zeni Geva,[249] Ancestors,[250] and Oranssi Pazuzu[251] all cite King Crimson's influence.

Other artists affected by King Crimson include noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow,[252] jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land,[253] folktronica exponent Juana Molina,[254] hip hop producer RJD2,[255] hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge,[256] film director Hal Hartley,[257] and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.[258]

In addition to their influence regarding the music industry, the band has also influenced various parts of popular culture. One example can be identified through the name of the Stand for the character, Diavolo, in the Japanese anime and manga, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures; which was created by Hirohiko Araki.

[187]  "'Moonchild', along with 'I Talk to the Wind', was the clearest link to the folk influences borne by King Crimson on its first album, the only one that included Ian McDonald and Michael Giles among the personnel. The first three minutes or so of 'Moonchild' – really, the three minutes that are all that most listeners remember well – comprise a delicate, folky poetic ballad."

[188]  "King Crimson, it is not often noted, had some folk and folk-rock influences in their very early days (and the Giles, Giles & Fripp collaborations predating King Crimson). 'I Talk to the Wind' is the track that most reflects these folk influences and the influence of co-songwriter Ian McDonald (only a bandmember for the first album) in particular. Coming right after the assaultive jazz-prog rock of '21st Century Schizoid Man', the first track on their debut album in the Court of the Crimson King: An Observation by King Crimson, this gentle, subdued folky ballad was quite a contrast and served notice that King Crimson was more versatile than your average new band."
