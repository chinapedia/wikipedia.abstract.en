CHUVASH STATE ACADEMIC SONG AND DANCE ENSEMBLE is a Russian art collective, originally named the Chuvash National Choir.


History

The team was founded in 1924 by Chuvash professional music composers and choral conductors F.P. Pavlov (1892–1931) and V.P. Vorobyov (1887–1954) as the Chuvash National Choir.

Its leaders began to gather and process Chuvash folk songs, performing them for the public in Chuvashia and throughout Russia.

The group followed an ethnographic interest in choir performances and a high performing culture.

In the 1920s the choir toured in Moscow, Leningrad and Gorky. Chuvash State Choir was the winner of the All-Union Choir Olympiad peoples of the USSR. It was awarded the Prize of the All-Union Radiofestival and performed in the Kremlin. In 1994 he was awarded the title of "Academic". During these years, the repertoire of the Choir added classical and contemporary music, as well as the music of the peoples of the USSR.

Ensemble

In 1939 the Chuvash National Choir was renamed the Chuvash State Song and Dance Ensemble. In the late 1930s, ensembles of song and dance emerged across the country. The first artistic director was a young composer and conductor A.G. Orlov-Shuzm (1914–1996). Under his leadership the ensemble successfully performed in Moscow, music and dance of the RSFSR peoples. Later the ensemble was led by conductor Kazatchkov S.A. (1909–2005).

The Ensemble performed in many countries.
