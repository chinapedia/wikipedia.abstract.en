is a song by Japanese singer-songwriter Utada Hikaru, featuring guest vocals by Sheena Ringo. A corresponding music video was released on September 16, 2016[1] and the song was sent to radio stations as well, to promote the release of the album _Fantôme_.[2]


Background and composition

The two singers had previously collaborated on Ringo's 2003 album Utaite Myōri: Sono Ichi, singing The Carpenters' classic "I Won't Last a Day Without You".

Written and composed by Utada, it is a J-pop song with influences from 1970's Italian pop music. "A Two Hour Vacation", as it translates, talks about the singers' need to escape every once in a while from daily life ("I love the sweet, everyday life / But the thrills are looking for me"). They admit that it is even best to escape just for a short time ("It's fine if it isn't enough / Fun is best a little at a time"), meet more regularly ("Greed will ruin you / Tell me, when is next time?") and how it is healthy to even "skip class" sometimes to "walk together in the park" instead.[3]
