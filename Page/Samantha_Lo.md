SAMANTHA LO, also known by the moniker SKL0, is a Singaporean contemporary artist. Dubbed the "Sticker Lady", Lo became a household name in Singapore after she was arrested for spray painting on public road in 2012. Her arrest sparked an outcry online on whether it was a work of art or vandalism.[1][2][3][4][5][6]


Personal life

Samantha Lo was a former CHIJ Katong Convent student.

Dubbed the "Sticker Lady" for pasting stickers, including "Press Until Shiok" and "Anyhow Paste Kena Fine", at traffic-light junctions and public spaces, Lo was arrested for spray painting the words "My Grandfather Road" on Maxwell Road and Robinson Road in 2012. Her arrest by the police for vandalism sparked an outcry online on whether it was a work of art or vandalism.[7][8] She was later charged for mischief and sentenced to 240 hours of community service in 2013.[9]


Career

In 2009, Lo founded online magazine RCGNTN as a way to recognize local artists and talent. She was also a content curator for the National Gallery Singapore's Canvas project.[10]

In 2012, Lo was arrested for vandalism for pasting satirical stickers on traffic light buttons such as _Press Once Can Already_ and _Press Until Shiok_ as well as spray painting the words _My Grandfather Road_ on several roads in the Central Business District. She was motivated to "take back the streets to make Singapore feel like Singapore again", a response to the fast-changing cityscape of the city. Netizens took to the internet to weigh in their views and started a petition to lessen her sentence, in the process birthing the identity "sticker lady". Lo was then charged in 2013 for Mischief instead of Vandalism which carried a heavier sentence.

She then proceeded to work with numerous brands and agencies, notably Sentosa's _The People's Republic_ showing satirical signs currently on display on the island. Lo made her debut at Affordable Art Fair in 2013 with a series of Yakult-inspired paintings and art collectibles that served as a statement on the commodification of art as a sign of status- each painting bore the words "More cultured than you will ever be!", a witty take on the cultured milk drink. This collection was reflective of Lo's _post-sticker lady_ state as she questioned her identity as an artist.

In 2015, she held her first solo exhibition, the _LIMPEH Show_, at The Substation. It comprises works from her LIMPEH portrait series of the late Lee Kuan Yew which began in the streets in 2011 as wheatpaste art on A4-sized papers and stickers, and later commissioned by collectors into collage paintings.[11]

On November 5, 2016, Lo painted the largest _My Grandfather Road_ in chalk for Circular Spectacular. The chalk painting measured 170 metres long, the biggest the artist has attempted as yet.

Lo held her second exhibition, _Greetings From Singapore_ in January 2017. On display were photographs of socially satirical stickers pasted in public spaces together that served as 'photographic evidence' of her work on the streets, leading viewers and those who are familiar with her work to question the need to document these social interruptions in a city notorious for its cleanliness. These photographs were accompanied by newspaper clippings and old photographs of the original stickers and spray paint she was arrested for in 2012. At the exhibition, she also launched a photography book of the same title chronicling her work on the streets from 2012.[12]
