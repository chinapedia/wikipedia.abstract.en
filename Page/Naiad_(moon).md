NAIAD ( or ; ), also known as NEPTUNE III, is the innermost satellite of Neptune, named after the Naiads of Greek legend.[1]


History

Naiad was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the _Voyager 2_ probe. The last moon to be discovered during the flyby, it was designated S/1989 N 6.[2] The discovery was announced on 29 September 1989, in the IAU Circular No. 4867, and mentions "25 frames taken over 11 days", implying a discovery date of sometime before September 18. The name was given on 16 September 1991.[3]


Physical characteristics

It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.[4]


Exploration

Since the _Voyager 2_ flyby, the Neptune system has been extensively studied from ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope as well. In 2002–03 the Keck telescope observed the system using adaptive optics and detected easily the largest four inner satellites. Thalassa was found with some image processing, but Naiad was not located.[5] Hubble has the ability to detect all the known satellites and possible new satellites even dimmer than those found by _Voyager 2_. On October 8, 2013 the SETI Institute announced that Naiad had been located in archived Hubble imagery from 2004.[6] The suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in Naiad's ephemeris[7] proved correct as Naiad was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position.
