The EASTERN WASHINGTON GATEWAY RAILROAD (reporting mark EWG) was a shortline freight railroad that leased track from the Washington State Department of Transportation.


History

The Eastern Washington Gateway Railroad was established on June 1, 2007, after the purchase of the CW branch of the Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad (PCC) by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).[1][2] The branch, which saw low traffic and high deferred maintenance costs, was slated to be abandoned by the railroad. The state purchased the line in February 2007 for $5.6 million, after lobbying from grain growers in the region.[3][4]

The Inland Northwest Rail Museum was constructed in 2016 in Reardan, Washington, adjacent to trackage owned by EWG. The museum is home to several pieces of historic railroad equipment from Eastern Washington.[5]

EWG went out of business on November 4, 2018, with operations assumed by Washington Eastern Railroad LLC.[6] The last EWG train ran on November 3, 2018.


Route

EWG ran roughly parallel to U.S. Route 2 on the CW branch over former PCC trackage in Eastern Washington, beginning in Coulee City and traveling east through Almira, Govan, Wilbur, Creston, Davenport, Reardan, Medical Lake, Four Lakes and Cheney. It terminated in Cheney, where it connected to the BNSF railway.[7][8]
