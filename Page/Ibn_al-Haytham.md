ḤASAN IBN AL-HAYTHAM (Latinized as ALHAZEN[1] ;[2] full name ; ) was an Arab[3][4][5][6][7] mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age.[8] Sometimes called "the father of modern optics",[9][10] he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular, his most influential work being his _Kitāb al-Manāẓir_ (, "Book of Optics"), written during 1011–1021, which survived in the Latin edition.[11] A polymath, he also wrote on philosophy, theology and medicine.[12]

Ibn al-Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one's eyes.[13] And he was the first to point out that vision occurs in the brain, rather than in the eyes.[14] He was also an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence—hence understanding the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists.[15][16][17][18][19][20]

Born in Basra, he spent most of his productive period in the Fatimid capital of Cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities.[21] Ibn al-Haytham is sometimes given the byname _al-Baṣrī_ after his birthplace,[22] or _al-Miṣrī_ ("of Egypt").[23][24] Ibn al-Haytham was nicknamed the "SECOND PTOLEMY" by Abu'l-Hasan BayhaqiNoted by Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi (ca. 1097 – 1169), and by

[25], and the "THE PHYSICIST" by John Peckham.[26] Ibn al-Haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics.[27]


Biography

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 to an Arab[28][29] family in Basra, Iraq, which was at the time part of the Buyid emirate. He held a position with the title _vizier_ in his native Basra, and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics. As he claimed to be able to regulate the flooding of the Nile, he was invited to by Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim in order to realise a hydraulic project at Aswan. However, Ibn al-Haytham was forced to concede the impracticability of his project.[30] Upon his return to Cairo, he was given an administrative post. After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well, he contracted the ire of the caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah,[31] and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph's death in 1021, after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him.[32] Legend has it that Alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest during this period.[33] During this time, he wrote his influential _Book of Optics_. Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous University of al-Azhar, and lived from the proceeds of his literary production[34] until his death in c. 1040.[35] (A copy of Apollonius' _Conics_, written in Ibn al-Haytham's own handwriting exists in Aya Sofya: (MS Aya Sofya 2762, 307 fob., dated Safar 415 a.h. [1024]).)[36]

Among his students were Sorkhab (Sohrab), a Persian from Semnan, and Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek, an Egyptian prince.[37]


_Book of Optics_

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on optics _Kitab al-Manazir_ (_Book of Optics_), written from 1011 to 1021.[38]

_Optics_ was translated into Latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.[39]{{ efn| A. Mark Smith has determined that there were at least two translators, based on their facility with Arabic; the first, more experienced scholar began the translation at the beginning of Book One, and handed it off in the middle of Chapter Three of Book Three. 91 Volume 1: Commentary and Latin text pp.xx-xxi. See also his 2006, 2008, 2010 translations.}} It was printed by Friedrich Risner in 1572, with the title _Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus_ (English: Treasury of Optics: seven books by the Arab Alhazen, first edition; by the same, on twilight and the height of clouds).[40] Risner is also the author of the name variant "Alhazen"; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen.[41] This work enjoyed a great reputation during the Middle Ages. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and one in the library of Bruges.[42]

Theory of optics

Two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity. The first theory, the emission theory, was supported by such thinkers as Euclid and Ptolemy, who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by Aristotle and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as al-Kindi) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the _Book of Optics_ was from Ptolemy's _Optics_, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.[43] Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of Galen, and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that "from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point".[44] This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.[45] He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.[46] He later asserted (in book seven of the _Optics_) that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived _as if_ perpendicular.[47]

His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why _only_ perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?[48] His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.[49] However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his _De Aspectibus_ (Book of Optics) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.[50] Kepler's later theory of the retinal image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.[51]

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with lenses, mirrors, refraction, and reflection.[52] His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.[53]

The camera obscura was known to the ancient Chinese, and was described by the Han Chinese polymathic genius Shen Kuo in his scientific book _Dream Pool Essays_, published in the year 1088 C.E. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his _Problems_, but Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of China, of camera obscura in the areas of the middle east, Europe, Africa and India.[54] and early analysis[55] of the device.

Alhazen used his camera obscura to observe the eclipse. In his essay "On the Form of the Eclipse" he writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction to his essay reads as follows: The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle. His findings solidified the importance in the history of the camera obscura.[56]

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the visual system. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 _Perception_ article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century Hering's law of equal innervation. He wrote a description of vertical horopters 600 years before Aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by Panum in 1858.[57] Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from Ptolemy, with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.[58] In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.[59] In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune[60] and Sabra,[61] Raynaud[62] showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

according to Ibn al-Haytham. Note the depiction of the optic chiasm. —Manuscript copy of his Kitāb al-Manāẓir (MS Fatih 3212, vol. 1, fol. 81b, Süleymaniye Mosque Library, Istanbul)]] Alhazen's most original contribution was that, after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.[63] His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,[64] which he sought to avoid.[65] He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.[66] He followed Galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved.[67]

Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.[68]

Scientific method

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (_i'tibar_)(Arabic: إعتبار) and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (_ilm tabi'i_) with mathematics (_ta'alim_; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in _Kitab al-Manazir_ (_The Optics_; _De aspectibus_ or _Perspectivae_)[69] and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).[70]

According to Matthias Schramm,[71] Alhazen "was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."[72] G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,[73] arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his _Book of Optics_ had not yet been fully translated from Arabic. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.[74] Toomer does concede that "Schramm sums up [Alhazen's] achievement in the development of scientific method."[75] Toomer 1964 lists, as a precondition, what is needed for historians to investigate Schramm's claim (1963) that Ibn al-Haytham was the true founder of modern physics,[76] is translations of Ibn al-Haytham.[77]

Mark Smith recounts Alhazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in double vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's _Optics_ book influenced the Perspectivists in Europe, Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Peckham. _The Optics_ was incorporated into Risner's 1572 printing of _Opticae Thesaurus_, through which Kepler[78] finally resolved the contradictions inherent in Witelo's explanation of the imaging chain, from external object to the retina of the eye.[79]

Alhazen's problem

]] His work on catoptrics in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by Ptolemy in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an equation of the fourth degree.[80] This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[81] Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used Descartes' analytical methods to analyse the problem.[82] An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M. Elkin, an actuarian.[83] Other solutions were discovered in 1989, by Harald Riede[84] and in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician Peter M. Neumann.[85][86] Recently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) researchers solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.[87]

Other contributions

's _Selenographia_, showing Alhasen representing reason, and Galileo representing the senses.]] The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.[88] He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.[89]

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of experimental psychology, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusions.[90] Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of psychophysics", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.[91] Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.[92]

Alhazen offered an explanation of the Moon illusion, an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.[93] Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by Roger Bacon, John Pecham and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.[94] Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. Cleomedes ( 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to Posidonius ( 135–50 BC).[95] Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his _Optics_, but the text is obscure.[96] Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.


Other works on physics

Optical treatises

Besides the _Book of Optics_, Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his _Risala fi l-Daw’_ (_Treatise on Light_). He investigated the properties of luminance, the rainbow, eclipses, twilight, and moonlight. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on catoptrics.[97]

Celestial physics

Alhazen discussed the physics of the celestial region in his _Epitome of Astronomy_, arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred Ptolemaic model "greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the laws of physics", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.[98]

He also wrote _Maqala fi daw al-qamar_ (_On the Light of the Moon_).

Mechanics

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body.[99] In his _Treatise on Place_, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (_al-makan_) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[100]


Astronomical works

_On the Configuration of the World_

In his _On the Configuration of the World_ Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's Almagest, which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as Georg von Peuerbach[101] during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance.[102]

_Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_

In his _Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs_, variously translated as _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_ or _Aporias against Ptolemy_, published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized Ptolemy's _Almagest_, _Planetary Hypotheses_, and _Optics_, pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's _Almagest_ concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the _Hypotheses_ concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.[103] He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the equant, failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:[104]

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a "true configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.[105] In the _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_ Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

_Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets_

Alhazen's _The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets_ was written 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his _Doubts on Ptolemy_, Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of epicycles to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's equant. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.[106]

Other astronomical works

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as _Exact Determination of the Meridian_, a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the Milky Way; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.[107] The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the _Doubts_ and _Model of the Motions_ discussed above.[108]


Mathematical works

In mathematics, Alhazen built on the mathematical works of Euclid and Thabit ibn Qurra and worked on "the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry".[109]

He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.[110]

Geometry

Alhazen explored what is now known as the Euclidean parallel postulate, the fifth postulate in Euclid's _Elements_, using a proof by contradiction,[111] and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.[112] He formulated the Lambert quadrilateral, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral".[113]

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.[114] The two lunes formed from a right triangle by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the lunes of Alhazen; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.[115]

Number theory

Alhazen's contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers. In his _Analysis and Synthesis_, he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2^(_n_−1)(2^(_n_) − 1) where 2^(_n_) − 1 is prime, but he was not able to prove this result; Euler later proved it in the 18th century.[116]

Alhazen solved problems involving congruences using what is now called Wilson's theorem. In his _Opuscula_, Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the Chinese remainder theorem.[117]

Calculus

Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a paraboloid. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.[118]


Other works

_Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals_

Alhazen also wrote a _Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals_, although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

Engineering

In engineering, one account of his career as a civil engineer has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, to regulate the flooding of the Nile River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual inundation of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a dam, at the site of the modern-day Aswan Dam. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon feigned madness so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.[119]

Philosophy

In his _Treatise on Place_, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (_al-makan_) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[120] Abd-el-latif, a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in _Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan_ (_A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place_) for its geometrization of place.[121]

Alhazen also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his _Book of Optics_. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."[122]

Theology

Alhazen was a Muslim; it is not certain to which school of Islam he belonged. As a Sunni, he may have been either a follower of the Ash'ari school,[123] or a follower of the Mu'tazili school.[124] Sabra (1978) even suggested he might have been an adherent of Shia Islam.[125]

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.[126] He also wrote a treatise entitled _Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation_ in which he discussed finding the Qibla, where prayers (salat) are directed towards, mathematically.[127]

There are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works, e.g. in _Doubts Concerning Ptolemy_: In _The Winding Motion_:

Regarding the relation of objective truth and God:


Legacy

'']] Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.

His main work, _Kitab al-Manazir_ (_Book of Optics_), was known in the Muslim world mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī, the ''Tanqīḥ _al-Manāẓir_ li-dhawī l-abṣār wa l-baṣā'ir''.[128] In al-Andalus, it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the Banu Hud dynasty of Zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text, al-Mu'taman ibn Hūd. A Latin translation of the _Kitab al-Manazir_ was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.[129] This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: Roger Bacon,[130] Robert Grosseteste,[131] Witelo, Giambattista della Porta,[132] Leonardo Da Vinci,[133] Galileo Galilei,[134] Christiaan Huygens,[135] René Descartes,[136] and Johannes Kepler.[137] His research in catoptrics (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration. He made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant, and investigated the magnifying power of a lens. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as "Alhazen's problem".[138] Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced Averroes' writings on optics,[139] and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his _Optics_ by Persian scientist Kamal al-Din al-Farisi (died c. 1320) in the latter's _Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir_ (_The Revision of_ [Ibn al-Haytham's] _Optics_).[140] Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on cosmology were translated into Latin, Hebrew and other languages.

The impact crater Alhazen on the Moon is named in his honour,[141] as was the asteroid 59239 Alhazen.[142] In honour of Alhazen, the Aga Khan University (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology".[143] Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-dinar banknote issued in 2003,[144] and on 10-dinar notes from 1982.

The 2015 International Year of Light celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.[145]


Commemorations

In 2014, the "Hiding in the Light" episode of _Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey_, presented by Neil deGrasse Tyson, focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by Alfred Molina in the episode.

Over forty years previously, Jacob Bronowski presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), _The Ascent of Man_. In episode 5 (_The Music of the Spheres_), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was "the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.

H. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of physics wrote:

  After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.[146]

UNESCO declared 2015 the International Year of Light and its Director-General Irina Bokova dubbed Ibn al-Haytham 'the father of optics'.[147] Amongst others, this was to celebrate Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the 1001 Inventions organisation, titled _1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham_ featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work, partnering with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms.[148] The campaign also produced and released the short educational film 1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham.

has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data.[149] Ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction, in contrast.


List of works

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.[150] Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.[151]

[8] For the description of his main fields, see e.g. ("He is one of the principal Arab mathematicians and, without any doubt, the best physicist.") , ("Ibn al-Ḥaytam was an eminent eleventh-century Arab optician, geometer, arithmetician, algebraist, astronomer, and engineer."), ("Ibn al-Haytham (d. 1039), known in the West as Alhazan, was a leading Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist. His optical compendium, Kitab al-Manazir, is the greatest medieval work on optics.")

[11] : "The three most recognizable Islamic contributors to meteorology were: the Alexandrian mathematician/ astronomer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen 965-1039), the Arab-speaking Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna 980-1037), and the Spanish Moorish physician/jurist Ibn Rushd (Averroes; 1126-1198)." He has been dubbed the "father of modern optics" by the UNESCO. . . . Specifically, he was the first to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then enters an eye.
