SLOVENIA is situated at the crossroads of central and southeast Europe, touching the Alps and bordering the Adriatic Sea. The Alps—including the Julian Alps, the Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the Karawank chain, as well as the Pohorje massif—dominate northern Slovenia along its long border to Austria. Slovenia's Adriatic coastline stretches approximately [1] from Italy to Croatia. Its part south of Sava river belongs to Balkan peninsula – Balkans.

The term "Karst" originated in southwestern Slovenia's Karst Plateau (), a limestone region of underground rivers, gorges, and caves, between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean.

On the Pannonian plain to the East and Northeast, toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders, the landscape is essentially flat. However, the majority of Slovenian terrain is hilly or mountainous, with around 90% of the surface 200 meters or more above sea level.

Location

Slovenia's location is where southeastern and Central Europe meet, where the Eastern Alps border the Adriatic Sea between Austria and Croatia. The 15th meridian east almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west-east.[2]

Since 2016, the geodetic system of Slovenia with the elevation benchmark of 0 m has its origin at the Koper tide gauge station. Until then, it referred to the Sartorio mole in Trieste (see metres above the Adriatic).[3]

Regions

Historical regions

Slo_regions_marked3.png The traditional Slovenian regions, based on the former division of Slovenia into the four Habsburg crown lands of (Carniola, Carinthia, Styria, and the Littoral) and their parts, are:

-   Upper Carniola (_Gorenjska_) (denoted on the map by U.C.)
-   Styria (_Štajerska_) (S)
-   Prekmurje (P)
-   Carinthia (_Koroška_) (C)
-   Inner Carniola (_Notranjska_) (I.C.)
-   Lower Carniola (_Dolenjska_) (L.C.)
-   Gorizia (_Goriška_) (G)
-   Slovenian Istria (_Slovenska Istra_) (L)

The last two are usually considered together as the Littoral Region (_Primorska_). White Carniola (_Bela krajina_), otherwise part of Lower Carniola, is usually considered a separate region, as is the Central Sava Valley (_Zasavje_), which is otherwise a part of Upper and Lower Carniola and Styria.

Slovenian Littoral has no natural island, but there is a plan on building an artificial one.


Climate

Slovenia_Köppen.svg types of Slovenia]] Humid subtropical climate (Cfa) on the coast, oceanic climate (Cfb) in most of Slovenia, continental climate with mild to hot summers and cold winters (Dfb) in the plateaus and mountains on the north, subpolar (Dfc) and tundra (ET) climate above the treeline on the highest mountain peaks. Precipitation is high away from the coast, with the spring being particularly prone to rainfall. Slovenia's Alps have frequent snowfalls during the winter.[6] [7]


Terrain

A short coastal strip on the Adriatic Sea, an alpine mountain region adjacent to Italy and Austria, mixed mountain and valleys with numerous rivers to the east.

There is only one natural island in Slovenia: Bled Island in Lake Bled in the country's northwest. Lake Bled and Bled Island are Slovenia's most popular tourist destination.[8]

Elevation extremes

-   LOWEST POINT: Adriatic Sea 0 m (tide gauge station in Koper)[9]
-   HIGHEST POINT: Triglav


Natural resources

Lignite coal, lead, zinc, building stone, hydropower, forests

Land use

-   ARABLE LAND: 8.53%
-   PERMANENT CROPS: 1.43%
-   OTHER: 90.04% (2005)
-   IRRIGATED LAND: 100 km² (2003)
-   NATURAL HAZARDS: minor flooding and earthquakes


Environment

Current issues

The Sava River polluted with domestic and industrial waste; pollution of coastal waters with heavy metals and toxic chemicals; forest damage near Koper from air pollution (originating at metallurgical and chemical plants) and resulting acid rain.
