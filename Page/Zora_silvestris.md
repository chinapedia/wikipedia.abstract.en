_ZORA SILVESTRIS_ is a prowling spider in the family Miturgidae which is found in Europe and central Asia.[1]


Description

The females are in length, the males . The epigyne has a quite distinct groove.[2] This species and the related _Zora spinimana_ are difficult to identify from each other, _Z. silvestris_ is more grey coloured than the warm yellow colouration of _Z. spinimana_. The darker legs of _Z. silvestris_ are usually quite obvious. The two dark lateral bands on the carapace of _Z. silvestris_ are broader than those on _Z. spinimana_ and the prosoma on _Z. silvestris_ is more contrastingly marked.[3] _Z. silvestris_ has two pairs of spines on metatarsi I and II, the other species of _Zora_ in Britain have three.[4]


Biology and Habitat

In Great Britain, _Zora silvestris_ occurs on dry heathland, most commonly encountered in mature heather. A stronghold of the species is Sherwood Forest where it is found with larger numbers of _Zora spinimana_ in mixed heather and grassland where the encroaching scrub had been cleared. Adults of both sexes are found from May to July, although a female has been recorded in September.[5]


Distribution

_Zora silvestris_ is found from western Europe eastwards into central Asia.[6] In Europe this is a widespread species in western and central Europe north to Sweden, although encountered infrequently.[7] but in Great Britain it is very rare, being recorded from only five sites in southern England, the most northerly being Sherwood Forest. Its rarity may be exaggerated by the difficulty of separating it from _Zora spinimana_.[8]
