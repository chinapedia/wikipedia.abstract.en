Pastor HANS MØLLER GASMANN (January 28, 1872 – December 6, 1961)[1] was a Norwegian educator from Oslo, promoter of association football and one of Norway's first Scout leaders, who founded the Second Christiania Scout Troop at Frogner in Oslo in 1910. In spring 1911, he met with Christian Dons, who had started the First Christiania Scout Troop. They founded the Norwegian Guide and Scout Association ().[2]

The history of Vålerenga Fotball goes back to _Fotballpartiet Spark_, which he founded in May 1903. An early mission for Gasmann was to give the local youth social activity and exercise. On a larger scale, the club was part of the movement known as Muscular Christianity.[3]

In 1917, he was awarded the third _Silver Wolf_, the highest commendation of Norwegian Scouting.[4]

_Hans Møller Gasmanns vei_ in Oslo is named in his honor.
