ROSTROS OCULTOS is a Mexican rock-pop band founded in 1985, who were moderately well known in the 80s. It was part of the post-movement started by Caifanes, and it was one of the bands that followed its principles, along with Santa Sabina, , Fobia, El Tri, and Maná, among others.

Its biggest success was the 1989 single _El Final_. Its singer's voice is considered one of rock en español's most representative, along with that of Saúl Hernández of Caifanes, Enrique Bunbury and Gustavo Cerati of Soda Stereo.


History

In 1984 Cala started a punk rock band called the Pills, with himself and Pablo Martinez on guitar, Quetzalcoatl Aviles on drums, and Victor Inda on bass.[1]

Montana

In 1985 in Guadalajara, two tapatío youths, young men from Guadalajara, began to make energetic rock in Spanish. Arturo Ybarra, then guitar player of the groups Mask and TRAX and Agustín Villa (Cala), singer for the Los Clips project and Rock'n Pills, formed a group that would reflect their lives, their dreams, their loves, their heartbreaks and their disappointments as young men. This new project was named Montana, after a brand of cigars. The magic of Montana was expressed in its first disc, 1985's _Quiero más_ on the WEA label, showing a fresh style, light and enveloping, a disc with releases like _Quiero más_ and _Quisiera que estuvieras aquí_.

The music of the period can be found on the 1984 Comrock WEA album, which featured Ritmo Peligroso, , Kenny y los Eléctricos, Mask and Los Clips.

Rostros Ocultos

With a new name in 1986, the band started over as Rostros Ocultos. Alejandra_Guzmán_at_Denver_Coliseum_2.jpg They signed a contract with EMI to record _Disparado_ in 1987, from which they released the singles _Mujer desechable_ and _El último adiós_, then in 1989 put out _Abre tu corazón_. Here they covered the Los Clips single _El final_. This production had the participation of Alejandra Guzmán, Andrés Calamaro and Kenny, and they began to play across the country with much recognition. Then the group took a break and the leaders of the band decided to start separate projects. Arturo recorded a gospel disc titled ''Luz aquella, ''and Cala put out a solo project called _Con huevos y cajeta_ (1994). Aleks_Syntek.jpg Caifanes_en_Zacatecas_2012.jpg En 1997, at the request of the label, they decided to get together again as Rostros Ocultos and put out _Dame una razón_. They recorded _Disparado_, _Abre tu corazón_, _Músicos, poetas y locos_ and _Dame una razón_ on the EMI label. With these productions, they left an indelible mark on rock en español.

In 2001, its fifteenth anniversary, the group decided to record _15 Celebración_, a compilation of their best songs, for the Sony Music label. This celebration had the participation of

On this album the group had the following lineup:

-   Agustin Villa Cala – vocals
-   Arturo Ybarra – guitar and backup vocals
-   Gerardo Matuz – drums
-   Karlo Romero – percussion
-   Jorge Corrales – keyboard and
-   Alfonso Martinez – bass

The tour ended with a show in Guadalajara. They filled the Auditorio Benito Juárez with 15,000 people. Part of this celebration was the production of the video _Dame una razón_, directed by Sergio Ulloa, recognized photographer who went on to with René Castillo in the short film _Hasta los huesos_, which became a hit on the various video channels.

In 2002, based on the football career of Hugo Sánchez, they decided to compose a song titled _Hugol_ and produced a video of it, produced and directed by a member of the band Karlo Romero, as a tribute to the best Mexican football player of all time. This release included an interactive CD, with highlights from the career of Hugo Sánchez and the history of Rostros Ocultos.

In 2003 with the experience of many years, Rostros Ocultos presented their new production on the Sony Music label, _Renacer_ (to be reborn). With totally unreleased cuts, _Renacer_ began a new cycle for the band, a new image, a rebirth. Containing only four live elements the powerful and strong lineup:

-   Agustin Villa Cala (vocals)
-   Arturo Ybarra (guitar and backup vocals)
-   Karlo Romero (drum) and
-   Victor Hugo "Chumino" Guardado (bass)

the group went on a large tour in and out of the country. The primary objective of the group was a message to all their fans and the general community about the importance of organ donation, to give live after life. So they included a song in this material titled _Corazón_ about a little girl born with a very weak heart who is waiting for a heart transplant. Also, they added a sticker that promotes organ donation and an authorization card for those who are interested in becoming organ donors.

Alex González, the drummer for Maná, participated on the album, adding input to the song _Ya no quiero verte más_ as did the maestro of rock en español Miguel Ríos, on a special version of _Santo y diablo_. The first single from the soundtrack of the film _Santos diablos_. This piece speaks of the duality of being human, of the discernment of good from evil. The video for this first single was produced by Praxis, a Mexican company specializing in 3D animation. It was recorded in Guadalajara, with post-production in Miami.

Their most recent production was filmed and recorded in the legendary Teatro Diana in Guadalajara and commemorates their 25-year career and lasting popularity. Participants in this production, titled _25 Aniversario_, included their friends and musical colleagues: Jose Fors and Galileo Ochoa of (Cuca), Jaffo (Plastiko), Kenny Aviles, Jovito pantera () and the disbanded tapatio group Poetas en el Exilio.
