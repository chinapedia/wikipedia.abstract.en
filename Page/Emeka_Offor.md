EMEKA OFFOR is a Nigerian oil magnate and entrepreneur, born in Kafanchan, Nigeria.[1] The Chrome Group, founded by him in 1994, employs over 800 people and is a leading oil-based conglomerate, based in Abuja, Nigeria.

He created the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation (SEOF) "to help people in need become independent and self-sufficient".[2][3]

His title of "Sir", is from his becoming a knight of the Anglican Church, but this has since been withdrawn due to his having several wives.[4]
