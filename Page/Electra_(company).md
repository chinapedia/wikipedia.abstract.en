ELECTRA is the main electricity and water company in Cape Verde. It was founded as a public company on April 17, 1982 (under decree-law no. 37/1982) by the merger of Electricidade e Água do Mindelo (EAM - Mindelo Electricity and Water), Central Eléctrica da Praia (CEP - Praia Central Electricity) and Electricidade e Água do Sal (EAS - Sal Electricity and Water).[1] In 1998 it was converted into a public limited company. In December 1999 the majority of the stocks was sold to Portuguese companies: 30.6% to Electricidade de Portugal and 20.4% to Águas de Portugal.[2] Since 2013, the company consists of three entities:

-   the main company Electra SA, with headquarters in Mindelo[3]
-   the regional company Electra Norte, covering the islands São Vicente, Sal, Santo Antão and São Nicolau, with headquarters in Mindelo[4]
-   the regional company Electra Sul, covering the islands Santiago, Fogo, Maio and Brava, with headquarters in Praia[5]

Electra serves all islands of Cape Verde except Boa Vista, where electricity and water are produced and distributed by the public-private company _Águas e Energia de Boavista_.[6]
