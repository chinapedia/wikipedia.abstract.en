ST ERKENWALD'S CHURCH is a Church of England parish church on Levett Road, Barking in Essex. It was established as a temporary church in 1934, which was only replaced by a permanent red-brick church twenty years later – the latter was part-funded by money from a War Damage payment for Holy Trinity Church, Canning Town, destroyed in the London Blitz.[1] It is dedicated to Earconwald, one of the founders of Barking Abbey and brother to its first abbess Ethelburga.
