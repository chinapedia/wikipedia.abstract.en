EERO INC. (stylized EERO)[1] is a San Francisco-based developer of a wireless router that employs a mesh WiFi system.[2][3][4] Individual eero units can be placed throughout a home to create a mesh network that extends wireless range.[5][6] The product was made available for pre-order in February 2015 and was officially released in February 2016.[7][8]


History

eero was founded in June 2014 by Stanford University graduates, Nick Weaver (CEO), Nate Hardison (CTO), and Amos Schallich (VP of engineering).[9][10] The company was originally based in Weaver's living room in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco.[11] Its name is derived from Eero Saarinen, a Finnish-American architect who helped design the elementary school Weaver attended near Chicago.[12][13] In August 2014, the company moved to an actual office and grew to 11 employees by January 2015.[14]

The eero WiFi systems were made available for pre-order in February 2015.[15][16][17] Within two weeks, the company had accrued $2.5 million from those pre-orders.[18] In November 2015, eero secured $50 million in an early round of growth funding from investors including, Shasta Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, First Round Capital and Playground Global.[19][20] In February 2016, the company delivered 25,000 pre-ordered units and also made the product available on Amazon.com.[21][22][23]

In May 2016, eero secured $50 million in a second round of funding led by Menlo Ventures alongside Index Ventures and existing investors.[24][25] The company also announced a non-exclusive retail agreement with Best Buy.[26] By September 2016, the devices were being sold in 600 Best Buy outlets across the United States. The company is headquartered in San Francisco[27] with support team offices in Austin, Texas.[28][29]


Product

eero builds a mesh WiFi system for broader wireless coverage. The system uses multiple access points from multiple eero devices to create the mesh network in a home.[30][31][32] Each eero device is a 1.3-inch tall and 4.75-inch wide white unit. Setup and many other functions are controlled via an Android or iOS app. The first unit pairs with the mobile app via Bluetooth, which guides users through the initial set-up process. Any subsequent eero unit can be placed throughout a building, and will automatically pair with the initial unit. The cloud issues any updates, diagnostics, and fixes to the system.[33]

The eero app also allows users to name their network, set passwords, setup a guest network, name individual units, and test internet connection speeds at various locations in the house. The app will also suggest optimal locations to place the units.[34]
