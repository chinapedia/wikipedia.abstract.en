JUN LI () is a Chinese mathematician who is currently a Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University.[1] He focuses primarily on moduli problems in algebraic geometry and their applications to mathematical physics, geometry and topology. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1989, under the supervision of Shing-Tung Yau.[2]

Li was an invited speaker at the 1994 ICM. He received a Morningside Gold Medal of Mathematics in 2001 "for his contributions to the study of moduli spaces of vector bundles and to the theory of stable maps and invariants of Calabi-Yau manifolds."[3]
