3.  the enactment of a pardoning bill for all political detainees in Kuwait;
4.  the amendment of the citizenship statute to enable judicial review over executive citizenship stripping decisions;
5.  the call for a national convention addressing pertinent issues in Kuwait including economic, societal and political issues; and
6.  an elected government.[5]


Structure and composition

The KDF is directed by a bi-annually elected General Secretariat currently headed by Bandar Al-Khairan.[6]
