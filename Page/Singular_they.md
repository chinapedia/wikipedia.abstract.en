SINGULAR _THEY_ is the use in English of the pronoun _they_ or its inflected or derivative forms, _them_, _their_, _theirs_, and _themselves_ (or _themself_), as an epicene (gender-neutral) singular pronoun. It typically occurs with an unspecified antecedent, as in sentences such as:

-   "_Somebody_ left _their_ umbrella in the office. Would _they_ please collect it?"
-   "_The patient_ should be told at the outset how much _they_ will be required to pay."
-   "But _a journalist_ should not be forced to reveal _their_ sources."

The singular _they_ had emerged by the 14th century,[1] about a century after plural _they_. It has been commonly employed in everyday English ever since then, and has gained currency in official contexts, though it has been strongly criticized at least since the late-19th century.[2][3] Its use in modern standard English has become more common and accepted with the trend toward gender-neutral language,[4][5] though most style guides continue to proscribe it, considering it colloquial and less appropriate in formal writing.[6][7][8] Some recent references, however, sanction this usage as appropriate not only in conversational registers of standard English, but also in official or literary usage.[9]

In the early 21st century, use of singular _they_ with known individuals has been promoted for those who do not identify as male or female.[10][11]

-   "This is my friend, _Jay_. I met _them_ at work. _They_ are a talented artist."


Inflected forms and derivative pronouns

The "singular _they_" permits a singular antecedent, used with the same (plural) verb forms as plural they, and has the same inflected forms as plural _they_ (i.e. _them_, _their_, and _theirs_), except that in the reflexive form, "themself" is sometimes used instead of "themselves".

: Inflected forms of third-person personal pronouns

_Themself_ is attested from the 14th to 16th centuries. Its use has been increasing since the 1970s or 1980s, though it is sometimes still classified as "a minority form". In 2002, Payne and Huddleston, in _The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_, called its use in standard dialect "rare and acceptable only to a minority of speakers" but "likely to increase with the growing acceptance of _they_ as a singular pronoun". It is useful when referring to a single person of indeterminate gender, where the plural form _themselves_ might seem incongruous, as in:

-   "It is not an actor pretending to be Reagan or Thatcher, it is, in grotesque form, the person themself." — Ian Hislop (1984); quoted in Fowler's

Regional preferences

The Canadian government recommends _themselves_ as the reflexive form of singular _they_ for use in Canadian federal legislative texts and advises against using _themself_, but _themself_ is also found:

-   "Where a recipient of an allowance under section 4 absents themself from Canada ..." — _War Veterans Allowance Act_, section 14.
-   "... the following conditions are imposed on a person or group of persons in respect of whom a deposit is required: ... to present themself or themselves at the time and place that an officer or the Immigration Division requires them to appear to comply with any obligation imposed on them under the Act." — _Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations_, section 48.


Usage

_They_ with a singular antecedent goes back to the Middle English of the 14th century (slightly younger than _they_ with a plural antecedent, which was borrowed from Old Norse in the 13th century),[12] and has remained in common use for centuries in spite of its proscription by traditional grammarians beginning in the late 18th century.

Informal spoken English exhibits nearly universal use of the singular _they_. An examination by Jürgen Gerner of the British National Corpus published in 1998 found that British speakers regardless of social status, age, sex, or region used the singular _they_ overwhelmingly more often than the gender-neutral _he_ or other options.

Older usage

Singular _they_ is found in the writings of many respected authors. Here are some examples, arranged chronologically:

-   "Eche on in þer craft ys wijs." ("Each one in their craft is wise.") — Wycliffe's Bible, Ecclus. 38.35 (1382)[13]
-   "And whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame, They wol come up..." — Chaucer, "The Pardoner's Prologue" of _The Canterbury Tales_ () quoted by Jespersen and thence in _Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage_.
-   "_Eche of theym_ sholde ... make _theymselfe_ redy." — Caxton, _Sonnes of Aymon_ (c. 1489)

-   "If _a person_ is born of a ... gloomy temper ... _they_ cannot help it." — Chesterfield, Letter to his son (1759); quoted in _Fowler's_.
-   "_A person_ can't help _their_ birth." — Rosalind, in W. M. Thackeray, _Vanity Fair_ (1848); quoted from the OED by Curzan in _Gender Shifts in the History of English_.

-   "Now _nobody_ does anything well that _they_ cannot help doing" — Ruskin, _The Crown of Wild Olive_ (1866); quoted in _Fowler's_.

-   "_Nobody_ in _their_ senses would give sixpence on the strength of a promissory note of the kind." — Bagehot, _The Liberal Magazine_ (1910); quoted in _Fowler's_.

Prescription of generic _he_

Alongside _they_, it was acceptable to use the pronoun _he_ to refer to an indefinite person of any gender, as in the following:

-   "If _any one_ did not know it, it was _his_ own fault." — George Washington Cable, _Old Creole Days_ (1879); quoted by Baskervill.
-   "_Every person_ who turns this page has _his_ own little diary." — W. M. Thackeray, _On Lett's Diary_ (1869); quoted in Baskervill, _An English Grammar_.
-   "Suppose the life and fortune of _every one of us_ would depend on _his_ winning or losing a game of chess." — Thomas Huxley, _A Liberal Education_ (1868); quoted by Baskervill.
-   "_No one_ shall be arbitrarily deprived of _his_ nationality nor denied the right to change _his_ nationality." — Article 15, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

Such usage is still occasionally found but has lost acceptability in most contexts, due to not being gender-neutral.[14]

The earliest known explicit recommendation by a grammarian to use the generic _he_ rather than _they_ in formal English is Ann Fisher's mid-18th century _A New Grammar_ assertion that "The _Masculine Person_ answers to the _general Name_, which comprehends both _Male_ and _Female_; as, _any Person who knows what he says._" (Ann Fisher as quoted by Ostade)

Nineteenth-century grammarians insisted on _he_ as a gender-neutral pronoun on the grounds of number agreement, while rejecting "he or she" as clumsy, and this was widely adopted: e.g. in 1850, the British Parliament passed an act which provided that, when used in acts of Parliament "words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females". Baskervill and Sewell mention the common use of the singular _they_ in their _An English Grammar for the Use of High School, Academy and College Class_ of 1895, but prefer the generic _he_ on the basis of number agreement:

Baskervill gives a number of examples of recognized authors using the singular _they_, including:

-   "_Every one_ must judge according to _their_ own feelings." — Lord Byron, _Werner_ (1823), quoted as "_Every one_ must judge of [sic] _their_ own feelings."
-   "Had the Doctor been contented to take my dining tables as _any body_ in _their_ senses would have done ..." — Jane Austen, _Mansfield Park_ (1814);
-   "If the part deserve any comment, every considering _Christian_ will make it to _themselves_ as _they_ go ..." — Daniel Defoe, _The Family Instructor_ (1816);
-   "_Every person's_ happiness depends in part upon the respect _they_ meet in the world ..." — William Paley

It has been argued that the real motivation for promoting the "generic" _he_ was an androcentric world view, with the default sex of humans being male – and the default gender therefore being masculine. There is some evidence for this: Wilson wrote in 1560:

-   "... let us keepe a naturall order, and set the man before the woman for maners sake". — Wilson, _The arte of Rhetorique_ (1560);
-   "... the worthier is preferred and set before. As a man is set before a woman ..." — Wilson, _The arte of Rhetorique_ (1560);

and Poole wrote in 1646

-   "The Masculine gender is more worthy than the Feminine." — Poole _The English Accidence_ (1646); cited by Bodine

In spite of continuous attempts on the part of educationalists to proscribe singular _they_ in favour of _he_, this advice was largely ignored; even writers of the period continued to use _they_ (though the proscription may have been observed more by American writers). Use of the purportedly gender-neutral _he_ remained acceptable until at least the 1960s, though some uses of _he_ were later criticized as being awkward or silly, for instance when referring to:

-   indeterminate persons of both sexes:
    -   "the ideal that _every boy and girl_ should be so equipped that _he_ shall not be handicapped in _his_ struggle for social progress ..." — C. C. Fries, _American English Grammar_, (1940).
-   known persons of both sexes:
    -   "She and Louis had a game – who could find the ugliest photograph of himself." — Joseph P. Lash, _Eleanor and Franklin_ (1971)

Contemporary use of _he_ to refer to a generic or indefinite antecedent

_He_ is still sometimes found in contemporary writing when referring to a generic or indeterminate antecedent. In some cases it is clear from the situation that the persons potentially referred to are likely to be male, as in:

-   "The patient should be informed of his therapeutic options." — a text about prostate cancer (2004)

In some cases the antecedent may refer to persons who are only _probably_ male or to occupations traditionally thought of as male:

-   "It wouldn't be as if _the lone astronaut_ would be completely by _himself_." (2008)
-   "Kitchen table issues ... are ones _the next president_ can actually do something about if _he_ actually cares about it. More likely if she cares about it!" — Hillary Rodham Clinton (2008)

In other situations, the antecedent may refer to:

-   an indeterminate person of either sex:
    -   "Now, a writer is entitled to have a Roget on _his_ desk." — Barzun (1985); quoted in _Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage_
    -   "A Member of Parliament should always live in _his_ constituency."

In 2010, Choy and Clark still recommend the use of generic _he_ "in formal speech or writing":

    "... when indefinite pronouns are used as antecedents, they require _singular_ subject, object, and possessive pronouns ..."
    -   "_Everyone_ did as _he_ pleased"

    "In informal spoken English, plural pronouns are often used with indefinite pronoun antecedents. However, this construction is generally not considered appropriate in formal speech or writing.



            Informal: _Somebody_ should let you borrow _their_ book.
            Formal: _Somebody_ should let you borrow _his_ book."

         — Choy, Basic Grammar and Usage

In 2015, _Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage_ calls this "the now outmoded use of _he_ to mean 'anyone{{'"}}, stating:

In 2016, _Garner's Modern English_ calls the generic use of masculine pronouns "the traditional view, now widely assailed as sexist".

Trend toward gender-neutral language

The earliest known attempt to create gender-neutral pronouns dates back to 1792, when Scottish economist James Anderson advocated for an indeterminate pronoun "ou".[15]

In 1808, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote:[16][17]

In the second half of the 20th century, people expressed more widespread concern at the use of sexist and male-oriented language. This included criticism of the use of _man_ as a generic term to include men and women and of the use of _he_ to refer to any human, regardless of sex (social gender).

It was argued that _he_ could not sensibly be used as a generic pronoun understood to include men and women. William Safire in his _On Language_ column in _The New York Times_ approved of the use of generic _he_, mentioning the mnemonic phrase "the male embraces the female". C. Badendyck from Brooklyn wrote to the _New York Times_ in a reply:

By 1980, the movement had gained wide support, and many organizations, including most publishers, had issued guidelines on the use of gender-neutral language.

Contemporary usage

The use of masculine generic nouns and pronouns in written and spoken language has decreased since the 1970s. In a corpus of spontaneous speech collected in Australia in the 1990s, singular _they_ had become the most frequently used generic pronoun (rather than generic _he_ or _he or she_). Similarly, a study from 2002 looking at a corpus of American and British newspapers showed a preference for _they_ to be used as a singular epicene pronoun.[18]

The increased use of singular _they_ may owe in part to an increasing desire for gender-neutral language. A solution in formal writing has often been to write "_he or she"_, or something similar, but this is often considered awkward or overly politically correct, particularly when used excessively.[19] In 2016, the journal _American Speech_ published a study by Darren K. LaScotte investigating the pronouns used by native English speakers in informal written responses to questions concerning a subject of unspecified gender, finding that 68% of study participants chose singular _they_ to refer to such an antecedent. Some participants noted that they found constructions such as "he or she" inadequate as they do not include people who do not identify as either male or female.[20]

Use with a pronoun antecedent

The singular antecedent can be a pronoun such as _someone_, _anybody_, or _everybody_, or an interrogative pronoun such as _who_:

-   with _somebody_ or _someone_:
    -   "I feel that if _someone_ is not doing _their_ job it should be called to _their_ attention." — an American newspaper (1984); quoted by Fowler.
-   with _anybody_ or _anyone_:
    -   "If _anyone_ tells you that America's best days are behind her, then _they_{{'}}re looking the wrong way." President George Bush, 1991 State of the Union Address; quoted by Garner
    -   "_Anyone_ can set _themselves_ up as an acupuncturist." — Sarah Lonsdale "Sharp Practice Pricks Reputation of Acupuncture". _Observer_ 15 December 1991, as cited by Garner
    -   "If _anybody_ calls, take _their_ name and ask _them_ to call again later." Example given by Swan
-   with _nobody_ or _no one_:
    -   "_No one_ put _their_ hand up." Example given by Huddleston et al.
    -   "_No one_ felt _they_ had been misled." Example given by Huddleston et al.
-   even where the gender is known or assumed:
    -   "Under new rules to be announced tomorrow, it will be illegal for _anyone_ to donate an organ to _their_ wife." Ballantyne, "Transplant Jury to Vet Live Donors", _Sunday Times_ (London) 25 3. 1990, as cited by Garner
-   with an interrogative pronoun as antecedent:
    -   "_Who_ thinks _they_ can solve the problem?". Example given by Huddleston et al.; _The Cambridge Grammar of the English language_.
-   with _everybody_, _everyone_, etc.:
    -   "_Everyone_ promised to behave _themselves_." Example given by Huddleston et al.

Notional plurality or pairwise relationships

Although the pronouns _everybody_, _everyone_, _nobody_, and _no one_ are singular in form and are used with a singular verb, these pronouns have an "implied plurality" that is somewhat similar to the implied plurality of collective or group nouns such as _crowd_ or _team_, and in some sentences where the antecedent is one of these "implied plural" pronouns, the word _they_ cannot be replaced by generic _he_, suggesting a "notional plural" rather than a "bound variable" interpretation . This is in contrast to sentences that involve multiple pairwise relationships and singular _they_, such as:

-   "_Everyone_ loves _their_ mother."
-   {{"'}}I never did get into that football thing', she said after _everyone_ returned to _their_ seat."
-   "_Everyone_ doubts _themselves_/_themself_ at one time or another."

There are examples where the antecedent pronoun (such as _everyone_) may refer to a collective, with no necessary implication of pairwise relationships. These are examples of plural _they_:

-   "At first _everyone_ in the room was singing; then _they_ began to laugh." Example given by Kolln.
-   "_Everybody_ was crouched behind the furniture to surprise me, and _they_ tried to. But I already knew _they_ were there." Example given by Garner.
-   "_Nobody_ was late, were _they_?" Example given by Swan.

Which are apparent because they do not work with a generic _he_ or _he or she_:

-   -   "At first _everyone_ in the room was singing; then _he or she_ began to laugh." Example given by Kolln.
    -   "_Everybody_ was crouched behind the furniture to surprise me, and _he_ tried to. But I already knew _he_ was there."
    -   "_Nobody_ was late, was _he_?"

In addition, for these "notional plural" cases, it would not be appropriate to use _themself_ instead of _themselves_ as in:

-   -   "_Everybody_ was crouched behind the furniture to surprise me, but _they_ instead surprised _themself_."

Use with a generic noun as antecedent

The singular antecedent can also be a noun such as _person_, _patient_, or _student_:

-   with a noun (e.g. person, student, patient) used generically (e.g. in the sense of any member of that class or a specific member unknown to the speaker or writer)
    -   "... if _the child_ possesses the nationality or citizenship of another country, _they_ may lose this when _they_ get a British passport." From a British passport application form; quoted by Swan.
    -   "cognitive dissonance: "a concept in psychology [that] describes the condition in which _a person's_ attitudes conflict with _their_ behaviour". — _Macmillan Dictionary of Business and Management_ (1988), as cited by Garner.
    -   "A starting point would be to give more support to _the company secretary_. _They_ are, or should be, privy to the confidential deliberations and secrets of the board and the company. — Ronald Severn. "Protecting the Secretary Bird". _Financial Times_, 6 January 1992; quoted by Garner.
-   with representatives of a class previously referred to in the singular
    -   "I had to decide: Is _this person_ being irrational or is he right? Of course, _they_ were often right." — Robert Burchfield in _U.S. News & World Report_ 11 August 1986, as cited in _Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage_
-   Even when referring to a class of persons of known sex, _they_ is sometimes used.
    -   "The sizing technology works via an iPhone app. To use it, a woman must take two pictures of _themselves_ while wearing a tight fitted top in front of a mirror." Shane Hickey, "The innovators: the app promising the perfect-fitting bra", _The Guardian_ 10 January 2015, as cited by Mark Liberman on "Language Log"
    -   "I swear more when I'm talking to _a boy_, because I'm not afraid of shocking _them_". From an interview.
    -   "_No mother_ should be forced to testify against _their_ child''".
-   _They_ may also be used with antecedents of mixed genders:
    -   "Let me know if _your father or your mother_ changes _their_ mind." Example given by Huddleston et al.
    -   "Either _the husband or the wife_ has perjured _themself_." Here _themself_ might be acceptable to some, _themselves_ seems less acceptable, and _himself_ is unacceptable. Example given by Huddleston et al.
-   Even for a definite known person of known sex, _they_ may be used in order to ignore or conceal the sex.
    -   "I had _a friend_ in Paris, and _they_ had to go to hospital for a month." (definite person, not identified)
-   The word _themself_ is also sometimes used when the antecedent is known or believed to be a single person:
    -   "_Someone_ has apparently locked _themself_ in the office."[acceptability questionable]

Use for specific, known people, including non-binary people

Known individuals may be referred to as _they_ if the individual's gender is unknown to the speaker.

Known individuals may also be referred to as _they_ if the individual is non-binary or genderqueer, regards male or female pronouns as inappropriate, and prefers _they_ instead. Several social media applications permit account holders to choose to identify their gender using one of a variety of non-binary or genderqueer options,[21] such as _gender fluid_, _agender_, or _bigender_, and to designate a pronoun, including _they_/_them_, which they wish to be used when referring to them. Though "singular _they_" has long been used with antecedents such as _everybody_ or generic persons of unknown gender, this use, which may be chosen by an individual, is recent.

The singular _they_ in the meaning "gender-neutral singular pronoun for a known person, as a non-binary identifier" was chosen by the American Dialect Society as their "Word of the Year" for 2015. In 2016, the American Dialect Society wrote:

The vote followed the previous year's approval of this use by _The Washington Post_ style guide, when Bill Walsh, the _Post_{{'}}s copy editor, said that the singular _they_ is "the only sensible solution to English's lack of a gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun".

The first non-binary main character on North American television appeared on the Showtime drama series Billions in 2017, with Asia Kate Dillon playing Taylor Mason.[22][23] Both actor and character use singular they.


Acceptability and prescriptive guidance

Though both generic _he_ and generic _they_ have long histories of use, and both are still used, both are also systematically avoided by particular groups.

Style guides that avoid expressing a preference for either approach sometimes recommend recasting a problem sentence, for instance replacing generic expressions with plurals to avoid the criticisms of either party.

The use of singular _they_ may be more accepted in British English than in American English, or vice versa.

Usage guidance in American style guides

_Garner's Modern American Usage_

_Garner's Modern American Usage_ (2nd ed., 2003) recommends cautious use of singular _they_, and avoidance where possible because its use is stigmatized.

-   "Where noun–pronoun disagreement can be avoided, avoid it. Where it can't be avoided, resort to it cautiously because some people will doubt your literacy ..."

Garner suggests that use of singular _they_ is more acceptable in British English:

-   "Speakers of resist this development more than speakers of , in which the indeterminate _they_ is already more or less standard."

and apparently regrets the resistance by the American language community:

-   "That it sets many literate Americans' teeth on edge is an unfortunate obstacle to what promises to be the ultimate solution to the problem."

He regards the trend toward using singular _they_ with antecedents like _everybody_, _anyone_ and _somebody_ as inevitable:

-   "Disturbing though these developments may be to purists, they're irreversible. And nothing that a grammarian says will change them."

_The Chicago Manual of Style_ (1993–2010)

In the 14th edition (1993) of _The Chicago Manual of Style_, the University of Chicago Press explicitly recommended using singular _they_ and _their_, noting a "revival" of this usage and citing "its venerable use by such writers as Addison, Austen, Chesterfield, Fielding, Ruskin, Scott, and Shakespeare." From the 15th edition (2003), this was changed. In Chapter 5 of the 16th edition (2010), now written by Bryan A. Garner, the recommendations are:

and:

The American Heritage Book of English Usage (1996)

According to _The American Heritage Book of English Usage_ and its usage panel of selected writers, journalism professors, linguists, and other experts, many Americans avoid use of _they_ to refer to a singular antecedent out of respect for a "traditional" grammatical rule, despite use of singular _they_ by modern writers of note and mainstream publications:

_Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association_

The American Psychological Association's _Publication Manual_ rejects most use of singular _they_ and gives the following example as "incorrect" usage:

However, APA style endorses using "they" if it is someone's (for example, a non-binary person's) preferred pronoun.[24]

Strunk & White's _The Elements of Style_

William Strunk Jr. & E. B. White, the original authors of _The Elements of Style_, found use of _they_ with a singular antecedent unacceptable and advised use of the singular pronoun (_he_). In the 3rd edition (1979), the recommendation was still:

The assessment, in 1979, was:

In the 4th edition (2000), use of singular _they_ was still proscribed against, but use of generic _he_ was no longer recommended.

Joseph M. Williams's _The Basics of Clarity and Grace_ (2009)

Joseph M. Williams, who wrote a number of books on writing with "clarity and grace", discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various solutions when faced with the problem of referring to an antecedent such as _someone_, _everyone_, _no one_ or a noun that does not indicate gender and suggests that this will continue to be a problem for some time. He "suspect[s] that eventually we will accept the plural _they_ as a correct singular" but states that currently "formal usage requires a singular pronoun".

_The Little, Brown Handbook_ (1992)

According to _The Little, Brown Handbook_, most experts – and some teachers and employers – find use of singular _they_ unacceptable:

It recommends using _he or she_ or avoiding the problem by rewriting the sentence to use a plural or omit the pronoun.

_Purdue Online Writing Lab_

The _Purdue Online Writing Lab_ (_OWL_) states that the use of singular _they_ is acceptable:[25]

OWL also notes that the use of singular _they_ is more inclusive:

_The Washington Post_

_The Washington Post_'s stylebook, as of 2015 , recommends trying to "write around the problem, perhaps by changing singulars to plurals, before using the singular they as a last resort" and specifically permits use of _they_ for a "gender-nonconforming person".

_Associated Press Stylebook_

The _Associated Press Stylebook_, as of 2017 , recommends: "They/them/their is acceptable in limited cases as a singular and-or gender-neutral pronoun, when alternative wording is overly awkward or clumsy. However, rewording usually is possible and always is preferable."[26]

In _The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing_, Casey Miller and Kate Swift accept or recommend singular uses of _they_ in cases where there is an element of semantic plurality expressed by a word such as "everyone" or where an indeterminate _person_ is referred to, citing examples of such usage in formal speech. They also suggest rewriting sentences to use a plural _they_, eliminating pronouns, or recasting sentences to use "one" or (for babies) "it".

Usage guidance in British style guides

In the first edition of _A Dictionary of Modern English Usage_ (published in 1926) use of the generic _he_ is recommended. It is stated that singular _they_ is disapproved of by grammarians. Numerous examples of its use by eminent writers in the past are given, but it is stated that "few good modern writers would flout [grammarians] so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray", whose sentences are described as having an "old-fashioned sound".

The second edition, _Fowler's Modern English Usage_ (edited by Sir Ernest Gowers and published in 1965) continues to recommend use of the generic _he_; use of the singular _they_ is called "the popular solution", which "sets the literary man's teeth on edge". It is stated that singular _they_ is disapproved of by grammarians but common in colloquial speech. Numerous examples of its use by eminent writers are given, but it is stated that "few good modern writers would flout [grammarians] so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray".

According to the third edition, _The New Fowler's Modern English Usage_ (edited by Burchfield and published in 1996) singular _they_ has not only been widely used by good writers for centuries, but is now generally accepted, except by some conservative grammarians, including the Fowler of 1926, who, it is argued, ignored the evidence:

_The Complete Plain Words_ was originally written in 1948 by Ernest Gowers, a civil servant, in an attempt by the British civil service to improve "official English". A second edition, edited by Sir Bruce Fraser, was published in 1973. It refers to _they_ or _them_ as the "equivalent of a singular pronoun of common sex" as "common in speech and not unknown in serious writing " but "stigmatized by grammarians as usage grammatically indefensible. The book's advice for "official writers" (civil servants) is to avoid its use and not to be tempted by its "greater convenience", though "necessity may eventually force it into the category of accepted idiom".

A new edition of _Plain Words_, revised and updated by Gowers's great granddaughter, Rebecca Gowers, was published in 2014. It notes that singular _they_ and _them_ have become much more widespread since Gowers' original comments, but still finds it "safer" to treat a sentence like 'The reader may toss their book aside' as incorrect "in formal English", while rejecting even more strongly sentences like

-   "There must be opportunity for the individual boy or girl to go as far as his keennness and ability will take him."

_The Times Style and Usage Guide_ (first published in 2003 by _The Times_ of London) recommends avoiding sentences like

-   "If someone loves animals, they should protect them."

by using a plural construction:

-   "If people love animals, they should protect them."

_The Cambridge Guide to English Usage_ (2004, Cambridge University Press) finds singular _they_ "unremarkable":

It expresses several preferences.

-   "Generic/universal _their_ provides a gender-free pronoun, avoiding the exclusive _his_ and the clumsy _his/her_. It avoids gratuitous sexism and gives the statement broadest reference ... _They_, _them_, _their_ are now freely used in agreement with singular indefinite pronouns and determiners, those with universal implications such as any(one), every(one), no(one), as well as each and some(one), whose reference is often more individual ..."

_The Economist Style Guide_ refers to the use of _they_ in sentences like

-   "We can't afford to squander anyone's talents, whatever colour their skin is."

as "scrambled syntax that people adopt because they cannot bring themselves to use a singular pronoun".

_New Hart's Rules_ (Oxford University Press, 2012) is aimed at those engaged in copy editing, and the emphasis is on the formal elements of presentation including punctuation and typeface, rather than on linguistic style, although – like _The Chicago Manual of Style_ – it makes occasional forays into matters of usage. It advises against use of the purportedly gender-neutral _he_, and suggests cautious use of _they_ where _he or she_ presents problems.

The 2011 edition of the _New International Version Bible_ uses singular _they_ instead of the traditional _he_ when translating pronouns that apply to both genders in the original Greek or Hebrew. This decision was based on research by a commission that studied modern English usage and determined that singular _they_ (_them_/_their_) was by far the most common way that English-language speakers and writers today refer back to singular antecedents such as _whoever_, _anyone_, _somebody_, _a person_, _no one_, and the like."

The British edition of _The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing_, modified in some respects from the original US edition to conform to differences in culture and vocabulary, preserved the same recommendations, allowing singular _they_ with semantically plural terms like "everyone" and indeterminate ones like "person", but recommending a rewrite to avoid.

Australian usage guidance

The Australian _Federation Press Style Guide for Use in Preparation of Book Manuscripts_ recommends "gender-neutral language should be used", stating that use of _they_ and _their_ as singular pronouns is acceptable.

Usage guidance in English grammars

According to _A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language_ (1985):

_The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_ discusses the prescriptivist argument that _they_ is a plural pronoun and that the use of _they_ with a singular "antecedent" therefore violates the rule of agreement between antecedent and pronoun, but takes the view that _they_, though _primarily_ plural, can also be singular in a secondary _extended_ sense, comparable to the purportedly extended sense of _he_ to include female gender.

Use of singular _they_ is stated to be "particularly common", even "stylistically neutral" with antecedents such as _everyone_, _someone_, and _no one_, but more restricted when referring to common nouns as antecedents, as in

-   "_The patient_ should be told at the outset how much _they_ will be required to pay."
-   "_A friend of mine_ has asked me to go over and help _them_ ..."

Use of the pronoun _themself_ is described as being "rare" and "acceptable only to a minority of speakers", while use of the morphologically plural _themselves_ is considered problematic when referring to _someone_ rather that _everyone_ (since only the latter implies a plural set).

There are also issues of grammatical acceptability when reflexive pronouns refer to singular noun phrases joined by _or_, the following all being problematic:

-   "Either the husband or the wife has perjured _himself_." [ungrammatical]
-   "Either the husband or the wife has perjured _themselves_." [of questionable grammaticality]
-   "Either the husband or the wife has perjured _themself_." [typically used by only some speakers of Standard English].

On the motivation for using singular _they_, _A Student's Introduction to English Grammar_ states:

The alternative _he or she_ can be "far too cumbersome", as in:

-   "_Everyone_ agreed that he or she would bring his or her lunch with _him or her_.

or even "flatly ungrammatical", as in

-   "''Everyone's here, isn't _he or she_?

"Among younger speakers", use of singular _they_ even with definite noun-phrase antecedents finds increasing acceptance, "sidestepping any presumption about the sex of the person referred to", as in:

-   "You should ask _your partner_ what _they_ think."
-   "_The person_ I was with said _they_ hated the film." Example given by Huddleston et al.


Grammatical and logical analysis

Notional agreement

One explanation given for some uses of _they_ referring to a singular antecedent is _notional agreement_, when the antecedent is seen as semantically plural:

-   {{"'}}Tis meet that some more audience than _a mother_, since nature makes _them_ partial, should o'erhear the speech." — Shakespeare, _Hamlet_ (1599); quoted in _Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage_.
-   "_No man_ goes to battle to be killed." ... "But _they_ do get killed. — George Bernard Shaw, quoted in _Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage_

In other words, in the Shakespeare quotation _a mother_ is syntactically singular but stands for all mothers, and in the Shaw quotation _no man_ is syntactically singular (demonstrated by taking the singular form _goes_) but is semantically plural (_all_ go [to kill] not to be killed), hence idiomatically requiring _they_. Such use, which goes back a long way, includes examples where the sex is known, as in the above examples.

Distribution

Distributive constructions apply a _single_ idea to _multiple_ members of a group. They are typically marked in English by words like _each_, _every_ and _any_. The simplest examples are applied to groups of two, and use words like _either_ and _or_ – "Would you like tea or coffee?". Since distributive constructions apply an idea relevant to each individual in the group, rather than to the group as a whole, they are most often conceived of as singular, and a singular pronoun is used:

-   "England expects that every man will do his duty." — Nelson (1805, referring to a fleet crewed by male sailors)
-   "Every dog hath his day." – John Ray _A Collection of English Proverbs_ (1670), originally from Plutarch, _Moralia_, c. 95 AD, regarding the death of Euripides.

However, many languages, including English, show ambivalence in this regard. Because distribution also requires a group with more than one member, plural forms are sometimes used.

Referential and non-referential anaphors

The singular _they_, which uses the same verb form plurals do, is typically used to refer to an indeterminate antecedent, for example:

-   "The _person_ you mentioned, are _they_ coming?"

In some sentences, typically those including words like _every_ or _any_, the morphologically singular antecedent does not refer to a single entity but is "anaphorically linked" to the associated pronoun to indicate a set of pairwise relationships, as in the sentence:

-   "_Everyone_ returned to _their_ seats." (where each person is associated with one seat)

Linguists like Steven Pinker and Rodney Huddleston explain sentences like this (and others) in terms of bound variables, a term borrowed from logic. Pinker prefers the terms _quantifier_ and _bound variable_ to _antecedent_ and '' pronoun''. He suggests that pronouns used as "variables" in this way are more appropriately regarded as homonyms of the equivalent referential pronouns.

The following shows different types of anaphoric reference, using various pronouns, including _they_:

-   coreferential, with a definite antecedent (the antecedent and the anaphoric pronoun both refer to the same real-world entity):
    -   "Your _wife_ phoned but _she_ didn't leave a message."
-   coreferential with an indefinite antecedent:
    -   "One of your _girlfriends_ phoned, but _she_ didn't leave a message."
    -   "One of your _boyfriends_ phoned, but _he_ didn't leave a message.
    -   "One of your _friends_ phoned, but _they_ didn't leave a message."
-   reference to a hypothetical, indefinite entity
    -   "If you had an unemployed _daughter_, what would you think if _she_ wanted to accept work as a pole dancer?"
    -   "If you had an unemployed _child_, what would you think if _they_ wanted to accept work as a mercenary or a pole dancer?"
-   a bound variable pronoun is anaphorically linked to a quantifier (no single real-world or hypothetical entity is referenced; examples and explanations from Huddleston and Pullum, _The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_):
    -   "_No one_ put _their_ hand up." [approximately: "There is no person _x_ such that _x_ put _x_{{'}}s hand up."]
    -   "_Every car_ had _its_ windscreen broken." [approximately: "For every car _x_, _x_ had _x_{{'}}s windscreen broken."]


Cognitive efficiency

A study of whether "singular _they_" is more "difficult" to understand than gendered pronouns ("In Search of Gender Neutrality: Is Singular _They_ a Cognitively Efficient Substitute for Generic _He_?" by Foertsch and Gernsbacher) found that "singular _they_ is a cognitively efficient substitute for generic _he_ or _she_, particularly when the antecedent is nonreferential" (e.g. _anybody_, _a nurse_, or _a truck driver_) rather than referring to a specific person (e.g. _a runner I knew_ or _my nurse_). Clauses with singular _they_ were read "just as quickly as clauses containing a gendered pronoun that matched the stereotype of the antecedent" (e.g. _she_ for a nurse and _he_ for a truck driver) and "much more quickly than clauses containing a gendered pronoun that went against the gender stereotype of the antecedent".

On the other hand, when the pronoun _they_ was used to refer to known individuals ("referential antecedents, for which the gender was presumably known", e.g. _my nurse_, _that truck driver_, _a runner I knew_), reading was slowed when compared with use of a gendered pronoun consistent with the "stereotypic gender" (e.g. _he_ for a specific truck driver).

The study concluded that "the increased use of singular _they_ is not problematic for the majority of readers".


Comparison with other pronouns

The singular and plural use of _they_ can be compared with the pronoun _you_, which had been both a plural and polite singular, but by about 1700 replaced _thou_ for singular referents. For "you", the singular reflexive pronoun ("yourself") is different from its plural reflexive pronoun ("yourselves"); with "they" one can hear either "themself" or "themselves" for the singular reflexive pronoun.

Singular "they" has also been compared to "royal we" (also termed "editorial we"), when a single person uses first-person plural in place of first-person singular pronouns.[27] Similar to singular "you", its singular reflexive pronoun ("ourself") is different from the plural reflexive pronoun ("ourselves").

The pronoun _it_, which is typically used for inanimate objects, can also be used for infants of unspecified gender but tends to be "dehumanizing" and is therefore more likely in a clinical context; in a more personal context, the use of _it_ to refer to a person might indicate antipathy or other negative emotions. _It_ can also be used for non-human animals of unspecified gender, though _they_ is common for pets and other domesticated animals of unspecified gender, especially when referred to by a proper name (e.g. _Rags_, _Snuggles_). It is uncommon to use singular _they_ instead of _it_ for something other than a life form.
