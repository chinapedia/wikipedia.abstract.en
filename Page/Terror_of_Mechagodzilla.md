_TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA_, released in Japan as is a 1975 Japanese _kaiju_ film directed by Ishirō Honda, written by Yukiko Takayama, and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka and Henry G. Saperstein, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. The film was produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the 15th film in the _Godzilla_ franchise, serving as a direct sequel to the 1974 film _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_, and is the final film in the franchise's Shōwa period.

_Terror of Mechagodzilla_ stars Katsuhiko Sasaki, Tomoko Ai, Akihiko Hirata, and Gorō Mutsumi, and features Toru Kawai, Ise Mori, and Tatsumi Nikamoto as the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Mechagodzilla, and Titanosaurus, respectively. The film was released theatrically in Japan on March 15, 1975. It received a limited release in the United States in 1978 by Bob Conn Enterprises, under the title _The Terror of Godzilla_. The film remains the least financially successful entry in the _Godzilla_ franchise.


Plot

Continuing after the end of the events of _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_, Interpol agents, led by Inspector Kusaka, search for the pieces of Mechagodzilla at the bottom of the Okinawan Sea. Using the submarine, _Akatsuki_, they hope to gather information on the robot's builders, the alien Simeons. The _Akatsuki_ is suddenly attacked by a giant aquatic spinosaur called Titanosaurus and the crew vanishes.

Interpol starts an investigation into the incident. With the help of marine biologist Akira Ichinose, they trace Titanosaurus to a reclusive, mad scientist named Shinzô Mafune, who wants to destroy all mankind. While Ichinose is visiting his old home in the seaside forest of Manazuru, they meet Mafune's lone daughter, Katsura. She tells them that not only is her father dead, but she burned all of the notes about the giant dinosaur(at her father's request). Unknownst to them, Mafune is still alive and well. He is visited by his friend Tsuda, who is an aide to the alien leader Mugal. He is leading the project to quickly rebuild Mechagodzilla. Mugal offers their services to Mafune, so that his Titanosaurus and their Mechagodzilla 2 will be the ultimate weapons. They hope to wipe out mankind and rebuild the world for themselves, starting with Tokyo and branching out from there.

But things are complicated for both factions when Ichinose falls in love with Katsura and unwittingly gives her Interpol's information against Titanosaurus, the new Mechagodzilla and the aliens. It is also discovered that Katsura is actually a cyborg, due to undergoing surgery, and Mugal still has uses for her. Meanwhile, Mafune is desperate to unleash Titanosaurus without the aliens' permission, so he releases it on Yokosuka one night. By then, Interpol discovers that supersonic waves are Titanosaurus' weakness. They have a supersonic wave oscillator ready, but Katsura sabotages the machine before they can use it. Fortunately, Godzilla arrives to fight off Titanosaurus.

Later, when Ichinose visits Katsura, he is captured by the aliens. Tied up, Ichinose can only watch as Mafune and the aliens unleash Mechagodzilla 2 and Titanosaurus on Tokyo, while Interpol struggles to repair their supersonic wave oscillator and the Japanese armed forces struggle to keep the two monsters at bay. Katsura, while being controlled by Mugal, ignores Ichinose's pleas and controls both the dinosaur and the robot as they destroy the city.

Godzilla comes to the rescue, although it is outmatched by the two titans. While Interpol distracts Titanosaurus with the repaired supersonic wave oscillator, Godzilla is able to focus on attacking Mechagodzilla 2. Interpol agents infiltrate the aliens' hideout, rescue Ichinose, and kill Mafune and many of the aliens. The remaining aliens attempt to escape in their ships, but Godzilla shoots them down with its atomic heat ray. Katsura, while being embraced by Ichinose, shoots herself to destroy Mechagodzilla 2's control device (which had been implanted in her body by the aliens). This helps Godzilla destroy the robot. Godzilla, with the help of the oscillator, defeats Titanosaurus and heads back to sea.


Cast


Production

Development

tomg_shinto_ceremony.jpg The original screenplay that Yukiko Takayama created after winning Toho's story contest for the next establishment in the Godzilla series, was picked by assistant producer Kenji Tokoro and was submitted for approval on July 1, 1974, less than four months after _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_ (1974) was released.

The original concept is similar to the finished version of _Terror of Mechagodzilla_, with many of the changes being budgetary in nature. The most obvious alteration is the removal of the two monsters called the Titans, which merged to become Titanosaurus in the first draft. It was an interesting concept, although something that was also underexplained considering the magnitude of such an occurrence of the creatures merging. Another noticeable change to the script is that of the final battle, which doesn't move to the countryside but instead would have reduced Tokyo to rubble during the ensuing conflict between the three monsters.

After her initial draft, Takayama submitted a revised version on October 14, 1974. This went through a third revision on December 4, and then yet another on December 28 of that same year before it was met with approval and filming began.

Filming

The film is one of the only _Godzilla_ films with nudity. The scene occurs when Katsura is being operated on, at which point Katsura's breasts are exposed (although the body is actually a mannequin). This scene was cut from the US, both for the theatrical and TV versions of the film.

Director Ishiro Honda laments not being able to work with the story's writer, Yukiko Takayama, on other films, enjoying that a "woman's perspective was especially fresh" for the genre.

Kensho Yamashita was the chief assistant director on the project. He notes, though, that Ishiro Honda never actually assigned any of the shooting to him, possibly because Honda was happy to be directing again after a long gap in his career and wanted to do the work himself.


English version

TerrorofGodzilla.jpg''.[1]]]

Toho titled its English version of the film _Terror of Mechagodzilla_ and had it dubbed into English in Hong Kong. This “international version” has never seen wide release in the United States but has been issued on VHS in the United Kingdom by PolyGram Video Ltd.[2] and on DVD in Taiwan by Power Multimedia.[3]

The film was given a North American theatrical release in March 1978 by independent distributor Bob Conn Enterprises under the title _The Terror of Godzilla_. Just as Cinema Shares had done with the previous three _Godzilla_ movies, Bob Conn Enterprises chose to utilize the Toho-commissioned English dub instead of hiring a new crew to re-dub the film. _The Terror of Godzilla_ was heavily edited to obtain a "G" rating from the MPAA. Several scenes with violent content were entirely removed, disrupting the flow of the narrative.

Henry G. Saperstein, who sold the theatrical rights to Bob Conn Enterprises, also released the film to television in late 1978, this time under Toho’s international title, _Terror of Mechagodzilla_. Unlike _The Terror of Godzilla_, the television version remained mostly uncut, with only a shot of Katsura’s naked breasts excised. Saperstein’s editors also added a prologue that serves as a brief history of Godzilla, with footage from Saperstein’s English versions of _Invasion of Astro-Monster_ and _All Monsters Attack_ ( the latter of which utilized stock footage from _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_ and _Son of Godzilla_).

In the mid-1980s, the U.S. television version, _Terror of Mechagodzilla_, was replaced by the theatrical edit, _The Terror of Godzilla_, on television and home video. For some reason, the title was also changed to _Terror of Mechagodzilla_. The 1994 Paramount release of _Terror of Mechagodzilla_ listed a running time of 89 minutes on the slipcase, implying that this release would be the longer version first shown on American TV. The actual video cassette featured the edited theatrical version. In a 1995 interview with _G-Fan_ magazine, Henry Saperstein was surprised to hear about this mistake.[4] In 1997 on Channel 4 in the UK, three Godzilla movies were shown back to back late at night, starting with 'Godzilla vs Megalon', 'Godzilla vs Gigan' and then 'Terror of Mechagodzilla', all were dubbed versions. This showing was uncut including the Katsura nudity scene but it did not have the western made prologue.

In the mid-2000s, the television version showed up again on Monsters HD, and in 2007, it made its home video debut as the U.S. version on the Classic Media DVD. Although the added prologue was originally framed for fullscreen television, it was cropped and shown in widescreen on the disc. The rest of the movie featured the audio from Saperstein's television version synced to video from the Japanese version.[5]

The first article about the movie's storyline was published in a 1977 issue of _Japanese Giants_ (published by Brad Boyle) and was written by Richard H. Campbell, creator of _The Godzilla Fan News Letter_ (a.k.a. "The Gang").


Box office

In Japan, the film sold 980,000 tickets. Despite earning positive reviews, it would be the least-attended _Godzilla_ film in Japan and also one of only two _Godzilla_ films to sell less than one million tickets. This was part of a decline in attendance for monster-movies as a whole and Toho put the production of monster-movies on hold. Toho had no intention of permanently ending the _Godzilla_ series. Throughout the remainder of the decade, several new stories were submitted by writers and producers. None of these films, however, were made. It wasn't until 1984 and _Godzilla_'s 30th anniversary that Toho would start production on a new Godzilla movie.
