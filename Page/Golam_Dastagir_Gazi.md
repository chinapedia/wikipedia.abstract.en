Contribution in the Liberation War

In June 1971, Mukti Bahini's guerrilla units started entering Dhaka with the aim of unsettling the Pakistani junta by launching attacks on different establishments in the city using hit and run methods. The Crack Platoon was one of the guerrilla units created in Sector 2. Gazi was one of the members of the Crack Platoon. The very first guerrilla operation was carried out in Dhaka on 9 June 1971. On 18 July, the guerrillas attacked five power sub-stations with a view to disrupting the electricity supply in the city. Of the five targets, Ullan sub-station was blown up by the guerrilla teams led by Gazi. The Rampura area of Dhaka city was shaken by the cracking sound as Gazi and his co-fighters planted explosives at the of the sub-station. The transformer was destroyed and s part of the Dhaka city had power-cut. The plan was Gazi and his co-fighters would use a Fiat car for the operation. But, the car turned out of order right before the operation would begin. The freedom fighters waited for the car to be repaired. With no other car available, they came out from the hideout with the explosives in a rexine-bag. A house in Rampura owned by one Manjur was their RV. Right at that moment, they heard the sound of gunshots were coming from somewhere, causing people on the road to flee in panic. People were immediately turning off the lights and closing doors and windows of their houses. They hired three rickshaws. Gazi and Nilu rode on one rickshaw. They were secretly carrying Sten gun behind their legs. Their rickshaws started from Rampura D.I.T. road to Ullan. The streets were dark. On uneven paths, the rickshaws were moving forward. After going some distance Gazi and Nilu found the other two rickshaws are not following them. They got together after some events. Finally, they saw the light coming from Ullan power sub-station. Before their rickshaw journey, they planned the first rickshaw would stop the gate of the sub-station and the other two rickshaws would stop at a little further distance from the gate. The rickshaw-pullers couldn't get the clever tactic, neither could they recognize anyone. The first rickshaw reached the gate. A cop with a rifle and a security guard of the sub-station were patrolling at the gate. The duo became curious seeing the rickshaw. Gazi and Nilu swiftly jumped from the rickshaw and aimed Sten gun at the two guards in the blink of an eye. The cop silently dropped the rifle and surrendered. But, the security guard tried to flee only to be caught by Nilu. In the meantime, other co-fighters started their jobs according to the plan. Matin, from the second rickshaw, snipped the telephone wire. Gazi had got the positions of rest of the cops and security guards by interrogating the unarmed cop. It was known that 15 to 20 cops and security guards are having their dinners in a large hall room nearby. All of them were surrendered without any chaos. Nilu and Matin were guarding the unarmed guards. Gazi and Matin were moving towards the transformer. The transformer was cordoned by a barbed wire fence. It was a two-story-high transformer. One has to go through an operating room to the main chamber. Gazi, Matin and two more co-fighters entered into the chamber and set explosives(by an engineer worked on that substation Alhaj Uddin Ahmed help the fighters to set explosives)on the transformer.[12]
