VASILISA FORBES (born Moscow, 1992) is a film director and visual artist, known predominantly for the War on Diesel [1] billboard series and WAX [2][3] film and visual art series. Vasilisa started her career in photography for _Super Super Magazine_ before moving on to direct music videos[4] and short films.


Early life

Born in Moscow, Russia, Vasilisa moved to London, UK, aged 5 with her mother.[5] She grew up in Wandsworth before moving to Tower Hamlets (borough of East London) aged 16 to pursue a career in shotting and hoodratting within the vicinity of Shoreditch. Vasilisa started her career in the arts early, at age 13 with ballet at the Royal Academy of Dance and acting at LAMDA. She joined the band FrankMusik as a session synth musician at age 15, after meeting the musician through her Myspace, where she made DJ playlists with artists like Spoek Mathambo before being expelled from the group for being too young to tour. Vasilisa took an internship with _Super Super Magazine_ around this time [6] which initiated her career in photography and film. She was part of the Soho nightlife at Circus Club Soho Revue Bar where she took photographs, publishing a book[7] called In _Silence Are Shadows_ which was reported on by _Dazed & Confused_ magazine for their Teenage Takeover issue in 2009 [8]


Career

Following her start with _Super Super_ during the time of editor Alex Kazemi, Vasilisa went on to create content (photography, articles and interviews)[9] for high-end fashion publications _I-D_ magazine, _Dazed_ [10] and _Vice_ magazine.[11] Her visual arts and billboard series Waxchick,[12] commissioned originally by Annin Arts[13] went on show in London on outdoor public billboards in November 2014.[14] Her Waxchick Prints are sold through Thank You Editions. The Waxchick Film, made for the series in collaboration with director Rory Mckellar was screened at multiple festivals including East End Film Festival,[15] London Short Film Festival[16] and at the ICA.[17] The Waxchick series also featured on the cover of _Hungry Eye Journal_, selling out in stockists.

Following her success with the WAX film, Vasilisa moved to moving image.[18] She currently directs music videos[19][20] and recently directed the video for Navin Kundra's 'Tear It Up'[21] as well as other recent releases in 2016 such as The Souls 'Fighting in the Moonlight'.

As a performer, Vasilisa is represented by Simon and How.
