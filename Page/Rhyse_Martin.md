In 2015, Martin returned to North Queensland, joining the newly formed Intrust Super Cup team, the Townsville Blackhawks. On 2 May 2015, Martin played for Papua New Guinea against Fiji in the Melanesian Cup, playing at second-row in the 22-10 loss at Robina Stadium.[9] In May 2016, Martin was selected again for Papua New Guinea for the Melanesian Cup but withdrew due to personal reasons.[10] Martin again played for the Townsville Blackhawks in 2016 and was named at second-row in the 2016 Intrust Super Cup team of the year.[11] On 14 September 2016, Martin signed a two-year deal with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.[12] Martin spent 2017 playing for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team.[13] Martin played in all 4 matches for Papua New Guinea, scoring 2 tries and kicking 16 goals in their 2017 Rugby League World Cup campaign.[14]

2018

After showing good form for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team, Martin finally had the chance to make his NRL debut at 25 years old. In Round 9 of the 2018 NRL season, Martin made his NRL debut for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs against the Brisbane Broncos, starting at second-row and scoring a try with his first ever touch in the Bulldogs unlucky last second 22-20 loss at Suncorp Stadium.[15] After the mid-season departure Moses Mbye to the Wests Tigers and Martin was cementing a starting spot at second-row, Martin took over the goal kicking duties. On 23 June 2018, Martin played for Papua New Guinea against Fiji in the Melanesian Cup, playing at second-row and kicking 5 goals in the 26-14 win at Campbelltown Stadium.[16] In Round 17 against the Canberra Raiders, Martin became the first NRL player to score 24 points in a losing side. Martin scored 3 tries in the second half and kicked 6 goals in the Bulldogs heartbreaking 32-28 loss after they gave up a 28-14 with 6 minutes to fulltime at Belmore Oval.[17] On 23 July 2018, Martin re-signed with the Bulldogs for a year to the end of the 2018 season.[18] Before the Bulldogs Round 23 match against the New Zealand Warriors, Martin made a 4-second cameo for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team against the North Sydney Bears, all because Martin played in 7 matches for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team before being elevated to first-grade but needed 8 ISP appearances so he can play in the NSW Cup Finals series.[19] . Martin finished his debut year in the NRL with him playing in 14 matches, scoring 4 tries and produced the greatest goalkicking for the season, converting 36 goals from 38 attempts at an incredible 94.7 per cent and being the highest point-scorer with 88 for the Bulldogs in the 2018 NRL season.[20] As the Bulldogs first-grade squad didn’t make the finals, Martin continued to play for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team, being the Captain and helping them make it into the NSW Cup Grand Final match.

2019

After being one the Bulldogs shining lights from last season, Martin was a surprising omission from the first 2 matches of the 2019 season. It was understood that Martin has fallen foul of the coaching staff after he returned to pre-season training carrying a little too much condition and speculation of concerns with his defence.[25] Martin would return in Round 3 against the Wests Tigers for the demoted Raymond Faitala-Mariner, starting at lock and kicking 3 goals in the Bulldogs 22-8 win at Campbelltown Stadium.[26] In Round 4 against the Melbourne Storm, despite having a great record with his goal kicking, fate was against him in the final minutes of the game after Bulldogs winger Reimis Smith scored a try in the corner was made the score 18-16 and with the chance to tie up the match at fulltime but unfortunately missed the conversion and the Storm escaped with the 18-16 win at AAMI Park.[27] Rhyse Martin signed a two year deal with the Leeds Rhinos. After falling out of favour with Bulldogs coach Dean Pay.[28]
