The MOONHEARTS, also referred to as CHARLIE AND THE MOONHEARTS as well as MOONHEARTS, are a three-piece surf punk and garage rock band formed in Laguna Beach, California, in 2006.[1][2] Both drummer, Charles Moothart[3] and bassist/vocalist Mikal Cronin are known for their collaborations with Ty Segall, as well as members of Segall's backing band, The Ty Segall Band.[4] In 2009 while touring with Ty Segall, The Moonhearts signed with Trouble in Mind Records.[5] Since 2006 the group has released two EP's, _Drop in Drop Out_, and _I Think You're Swell_.[6][7] As well as three albums, _Moonhearts_, a split LP with _Teen Anger_ referred to as _Charlie and The Moonhearts / Teen Anger_, or simply _Split LP_, _Thunder Beast_ and their debut self title, _Charlie and The Moonhearts_.[8][9]

In 2016, Charlies Moothart described the dynamic of the band: "Mikal Cronin wrote most of the music for Moonhearts. I just played drums. I wrote one song - which Mikal wrote the vocal melody for and helped me finish - but I just played the drums in that band so the name is misleading. The name started as kind of a joke because we were young and didnâ€™t really think too much about it."[10]
