_SOLO (PISA) 1982_ is a live album by composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton featuring a solo performance recorded in Italy in 1982 and first released on the Golden Years of New Jazz label in 2007.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by François Couture stated: "Simply put, Braxton is on fire ... The atmosphere throughout the performance is unlike most avant-garde jazz recordings; then again, even by Braxton's standards, this album is also unlike most avant-garde jazz recordings. Highly recommended to fans, newcomers, saxophone students, and people who still think this kind of stuff appeals to no one."[4] Jazz Review's Glenn Astarita said: "Overall, this program should enthrall Braxton’s legion of admirers while residing as a significant edition to his extensive discography. (Essential.... )."[5]
