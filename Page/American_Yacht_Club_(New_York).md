The AMERICAN YACHT CLUB is a yacht club located in Rye, New York.


History

The American Yacht Club was founded on 1 May 1883. It was created to be more exclusive than the New York Yacht Club and had the particular object of promoting the development of steam yachts. One of the principal founder members was the tycoon, Jay Gould, whose 228-foot steam yacht, _Atalanta_, was built in that year. The club initially used rooms in Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue before building a large Tudor-style clubhouse on the tip of Milton Point on Long Island Sound in 1894.[1][2]
