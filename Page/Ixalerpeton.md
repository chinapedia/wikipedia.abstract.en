_IXALERPETON_ (meaning "leaping reptile") is a genus of small, bipedal dinosauromorphs in the lagerpetid family, containing one species, _I. POLESINENSIS_. It lived in the Late Triassic of Brazil alongside the sauropodomorph dinosaur _Buriolestes_.[1]


Description

_Ixalerpeton_ was similar to other lagerpetids (namely _Dromomeron_ and _Lagerpeton_) in having long hindlimbs with well-developed muscle attachments on the femur; in particular, its fourth trochanter was quite large and formed a crest (which is unlike _Dromomeron_).[2] However, the last few dorsal vertebrae of _Ixalerpeton_ do not have the forward-inclining neural spines of _Lagerpeton_ (which were associated with the latter's hopping, or saltatory, lifestyle).[3][4] In addition to the enlarged fourth trochanter, a suite of other traits differentiate _Ixalerpeton_ from all previously-described lagerpetids; there is an antitrochanter on the ilium; the end of the shaft of the ischium is tall; there is no ambiens process on the pubis; the medial condyle on the femur is relatively flat at the front end but sharply angled at the back end; and the back face of the top end of the tibia has a deep groove.

The head and forelimbs found with _Ixalerpeton_ are the first of these elements that have been found among lagerpetids.[5] Unlike dinosauriforms, the posttemporal fenestra at the back of the skull is large and unreduced; there is an extra bone, the postfrontal, bordering the eye socket; there is no supratemporal fossa, which is an indentation found on the frontal bone in dinosauriforms; and the glenoid cavity on the scapula, where the scapula-humerus joint is located, faces slightly sideways instead of backwards. On the other hand, there is an anterior tympanic recess on the braincase, and the deltopectoral crest on the humerus is long, both of which are common among basal dinosauromorphs.[6]


Discovery and naming

The holotype specimen of _Ixalerpeton_, numbered ULBRA-PVT059, consists of parts from the skull, vertebral column, and all four limbs. The specimen comes from the Carnian Santa Maria Formation of Brazil, and it was found alongside two individuals of _Buriolestes_ as well as a set of femora belonging to second individual of _Ixalerpeton_. The genus name of _Ixalerpeton_ combines the Greek words _ixalos_ ("leaping") and _erpeton_ ("reptile"), and the species name _polesinensis_ references the town of São João do Polêsine, where the dig site is located.[7]


Classification

A 2016 phylogenetic analysis found that _Ixalerpeton_ was the closest relative of _Dromomeron_. The phylogenetic tree recovered is partially reproduced below.[8]


Paleoecology

Similar to the Ischigualasto[9] and Chinle[10] Formations, the Santa Maria Formation preserves both _Ixalerpeton_ (a non-dinosaur dinosauromorph) and _Buriolestes_ (a dinosaur). This indicates that dinosaurs did not rapidly replace their dinosauromorph ancestors.[11]
