STERCOMATA are pellets of waste material accumulated in some species of foraminifera and testate amoebae. The pellets consist largely of clay minerals and are believed to be derived from ingested sediment, indicating that the stercomata-bearing foraminifera are filter-feeders, although it is possible that they may capture suspended particles[1][2]. In certain species the stercomata are enveloped in sheet-like formations of protoplasm.[3]
