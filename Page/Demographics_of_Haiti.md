Haiti-demographie.png Although Haiti averages approximately 255 people per square kilometer (650 per sq. mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. The majority of Haitians, 70%, are of predominantly African descent.[1] The remaining of the population is primarily mulattoes, Europeans, Asians and Arabs. Hispanic residents in Haiti are mostly Cuban and Dominican. About two thirds of the Haitian population live in rural areas.

Although there was a national census taken in Haiti in 2003, much of that data has not been released to the public. Several demographic studies, including those by social work researcher Athena Kolbe, have shed light on the current status of urban residents. In 2006, households averaged 4.5 members. The median age was 25 years with a mean average age of 27 years. People aged 15 and younger counted for roughly a third of the population. Overall, 52.7 percent of the population was female.[2][3]


Population in Haiti

According to the total population was in , compared to 3,221,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.2%, 59.7% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.5% was 65 years or older .[4] According to the World Bank, Haiti's dependency rate is 7.51 dependents per 100 working age persons.[5]

Vital statistics

Registration of vital events in Haiti is not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates. [7]

[TABLE]

While limited, evidence suggests that disasters can cause human populations to increase in the long term, rather than decrease. Documented fertility spikes followed the Khmer Rouge conflict and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami - potential causes may include reduced access to contraception and families desiring more children following child death.[8] In Haiti's case, the fertility rate nearly tripled after the quake, and is likely to remain elevated (above pre-quake levels) for long after.[9]

Languages

Taíno was the major pre-Columbian language in the region of what is _Haiti_ (or _Hayti_), a name rooted in the language to refer to the entire island of Hispaniola[12][13][14] to mean, "land of high mountains."[15]

Today, the Republic of Haiti has two official languages. They are French and Haitian Creole; the latter, a French-based creole where 90% of its vocabulary is derived from, with influences from Portuguese, Spanish, Taíno, and West African languages.[16] French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.[17][18] It is spoken by most educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.

Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas _départements_, or _collectivités,_ of France. Haitian Creole,[19] which has recently undergone a standardization, is spoken by virtually the entire population of Haiti.[20] It is related to the other French creoles, but most closely to Antillean Creole and Louisiana Creole variants.

Spanish, though not official, is spoken by a growing amount of the population, and is spoken more frequently near the border with the Dominican Republic. English is increasingly spoken among the young and in the business sector.


Religion

The state religion is Roman Catholicism which 80–85% of the population professes. 15–20% of Haitians practice Protestantism. Only a very small percentage of the population practice Vodou, mostly along with another religion.[21] The main religions practiced in Haiti are Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, and Judaism. In addition, the protestant population is continuing to grow, along with Islam and Judaism. The Islam population usually goes uncounted for and has links to the slave trade. Almost 99% of Haitians claim at least one religion, with many practicing some part of voodoo. [22]

Voodoo is rare among the urban elite and is often compared to Cuban Santeria due to the large Cuban population in Haiti. [23] The practice of voodoo revolves around family spirits called _Loua_ that protect children. To repay the spirits, children perform two ceremonies where the _Loua_ are given gifts like food and drinks. That does depend of the monetary status of these families, poorer families wait until there is a need to perform the rituals. [24]

Voodoo in relation to Christianity came along two different paths, the path with the Catholics and the path with the protestants. For the Catholic path; under the French the slaves were not allowed to practice Voodoo, but they were allowed to occasionally have dances on the weekend. These dances turned out to be Voodoo services, until they were liberated in 1804. Most Haitians see practicing Voodoo and Christianity as normal due to the many components they share. The catholic church wasn't always as accepting of Voodoo as it is now, in 1941-1942 a holy war was waged against Voodoo killing many of the higher ups in the Voodoo religion. This war ended around 1950 when the Catholics decided give up the prosecution of those who practiced Voodoo and to have a relative peace. The path with the protestants was less peaceful. The Protestants came to Haiti in 1970 and since then they have been bitter enemies of Voodoo, most often calling it devil worship. [25]


Education

Although public education at the primary level is now free, private and parochial schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered.

In recent years, several annual literacy campaigns launched in by the Martelly administration has increased overall literacy among adults in Haiti.[26] UNESCO projects an overall literacy rate of 61.1% in Haiti by 2015.[27] As of December 2014, World Bank has reported that school enrollment has increased from 78% to 90% in Haiti, very close to the goal of universal child enrollment.[28]


Labor

In 2004, 300,000 children were restavecs, the practice of which is comparable to indentured service of minors.[29]


Emigration

Large-scale emigration, principally to the Dominican Republic, United States, and Canada (predominantly to Quebec, with other areas of the country) – but also to Cuba, other areas of Europe and the Americas (like Argentina) such as France (with French Guiana), Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Ireland; and Venezuela, Brazil, the Bahamas and other Caribbean neighbors – has created what Haitians refer to as the Eleventh Department or the Diaspora. About one of every six Haitians live abroad.


Other demographic statistics

Demographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2019.[30]

-   One birth every 2 minutes
-   One death every 6 minutes
