This allows them to survive in arid environments.]] Aloe_vossii_-_plant_(aka).jpg_]] Aloe_rubroviolacea2.jpg_]] _ALOE_ ( , ), also written _Aloë_, is a genus containing over 500 species of flowering succulent plants.[1] The most widely known species is _Aloe vera_, or "true aloe", so called because it is cultivated as the standard source of so-called "aloe vera" for assorted pharmaceutical purposes.[2] Other species, such as _Aloe ferox_, also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications.

The APG IV system (2016) places the genus in the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae. Within the subfamily it may be placed in the tribe Aloeae.[3] In the past, it has been assigned to the family Aloaceae (now included in the Asphodeloidae) or to a broadly circumscribed family Liliaceae (the lily family). The plant _Agave americana_, which is sometimes called "American aloe", belongs to the Asparagaceae, a different family.

The genus is native to tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, Jordan, the Arabian Peninsula, and various islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion, Comoros, etc.). A few species have also become naturalized in other regions (Mediterranean, India, Australia, North and South America, Hawaiian Islands, etc.).[4]


Description

Most _Aloe_ species have a rosette of large, thick, fleshy leaves. _Aloe_ flowers are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of _Aloe_ appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or mottled. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).[5]


Systematics

The APG IV system (2016) places the genus in the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae.[6] In the past it has also been assigned to the families Liliaceae and Aloeaceae, as well as the family Asphodelaceae sensu stricto, before this was merged into the Asphodelaceae sensu lato.

The circumscription of the genus has varied widely. Many genera, such as _Lomatophyllum_,[7] have been brought into synonymy. Species at one time placed in _Aloe_, such as _Agave americana_, have been moved to other genera.[8] Molecular phylogenetic studies, particularly from 2010 onwards, suggested that as then circumscribed, _Aloe_ was not monophyletic and should be divided into more tightly defined genera. In 2014, John Charles Manning and coworkers produced a phylogeny in which _Aloe_ was divided into six genera: _Aloidendron_, _Kumara_, _Aloiampelos_, _Aloe_, _Aristaloe_ and _Gonialoe_.[9]

Uses

Aloe species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots. Many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents. _Aloe vera_ is used both internally and externally on humans as folk or alternative medicine. The plants can also be made into types of special soaps or used in other skin care products (see natural skin care).

Numerous cultivars with mixed or uncertain parentage are grown. Of these, _Aloe_ ‘Lizard Lips’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.[11]

Historical uses

Aloe,_Juliana_Anicia_Codex.jpg, a copy, written in Constantinople in 515 AD, of Dioscorides' 1st century AD work.[12]]] Historical use of various aloe species is well documented. Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.[13][14]

Of the 500+ species, only a few were used traditionally as herbal medicines, _Aloe vera_ again being the most commonly used species. Also included are _A. perryi_ and _A. ferox_. The Ancient Greeks and Romans used _Aloe vera_ to treat wounds. In the Middle Ages, the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a purgative.[15] Unprocessed aloe that contains aloin is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin.[16]

Some species, particularly _Aloe vera_, are used in alternative medicine and first aid. Both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally for skin discomforts. As an herbal medicine, _Aloe vera_ juice is commonly used internally for digestive discomfort.[17][18]

According to Cancer Research UK, a potentially deadly product called T-UP is made of concentrated aloe, and promoted as a cancer cure. They say "there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans".[19]

Aloin in OTC laxative products

On May 9, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin, the yellow sap of the aloe plant, for use as a laxative ingredient in over-the-counter drug products.[20] Most aloe juices today do not contain significant aloin.

Chemical properties

According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C₇H₂N₃O₅), chrysammic acid (C₇H₂N₂O₆), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados _Aloe_, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from _Aloe Socotrina_ and Zanzibar _Aloe_, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C₁₇H₁₃O₇·H₂O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C₁₇H₁₈O₇) prismatic crystals. _Aloe_ species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.

Flavoring

_Aloe perryi_, _A. barbadensis_, _A. ferox_, and hybrids of this species with _A. africana_ and _A. spicata_ are listed as natural flavoring substances in the US government _Electronic Code of Federal Regulations_.[21] _Aloe socotrina_ is said to be used in yellow Chartreuse.[22]


Heraldic occurrence

_Aloe rubrolutea_ occurs as a charge in heraldry, for example in the Civic Heraldry of Namibia.[23]
