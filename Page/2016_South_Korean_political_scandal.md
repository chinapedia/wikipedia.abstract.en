The 2016 SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL SCANDAL (, ) involves the influence of Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a shaman-esque cult leader Choi Tae-min, over President Park Geun-hye of South Korea.[1][2][3][4]

Widespread coverage of this South Korean political scandal began in late October 2016.[5][6] On November 29, Park offered to begin the process of removing herself from power.[7] On December 9, Park was impeached, and then Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn became the acting president.[8] On December 21, a Special Prosecution Team led by Park Young Soo began to investigate the Choi Soon-sil scandal.[9][10] On March 10, 2017, The Constitutional Court of Korea ruled to uphold the impeachment of President Park Geun-Hye. All 8 judges agreed that President Park abused her power. A new election was held 60 days after with Moon Jae-in, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea, winning over 41% of the popular vote in the election.[11]


Background

Choi Soon-sil

Choi Soon-sil had known President Park Geun-hye since 1974, when Choi's father, Choi Tae-min, offered to counsel and advise Park as she and her family were grieving after the assassination of Park's mother, then-first lady Yuk Young-soo.[12] In 2007, a South Korean newsmagazine publicized a thirty-year-old Korean Central Intelligence Agency report, revealing that Choi Tae-min initially approached Park by telling her that the deceased Yuk had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter.[13] A diplomatic cable from the U.S. embassy in Seoul, later made public by WikiLeaks, reported subsequent rumors that Choi was a "Korean Rasputin" who "had complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and...his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result."[14][15] In response to this scrutiny, Park called Choi Tae-min a "patriot" and stated she was grateful for his counsel and comfort during "difficult times."

In late 2016, reports surfaced which raised questions that Choi Soon-sil had inappropriate access to, and possible influence over, President Park. Choi had allegedly been given regular reports on Park's schedule, speeches, and personnel arrangements, and had even seen classified information on secret meetings with North Korea. Choi was also alleged to have dictated, or at the least influencing, Park's decision-making on everything from her choice of handbags, to public statements, to state affairs.[16][17]

Choi has been indicted for extorting bribes, abusing power illegally and leaking classified documents.[18] Choi is also accused of having influenced Ewha Womans University to change their admission criteria in order for her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to be given a place there.[19]

Censorship and early reporting

The Park regime exercised power over the media in various ways, including business ties with media executives, and had established a commission to harass and prosecute social media critics, including those who criticized her handling of the 2014 sinking of MV Sewol, in which 304 civilians died.[20] Choi's name had been completely obscured from public records through a variety of means. In July 2016, Park's illegal business ties to Choi Soon-sil were uncovered by a reporter working for Chosun Broadcasting Company, who even cornered Choi and attempted to secure an interview, but his report was spiked by executives at the company. In September, more cautious stories were printed by newspapers, alluding to Park's shady business deals, and on September 20, _The Hankyoreh_ was able to independently uncover Choi's name by interviewing employees at a massage parlor. The managing editor of _The Hankyoreh_ published a public appeal for Chosun Broadcasting Company to air the spiked story.[21] Following this story, investigation of Choi deepened, but her exact relationship with Park was still unclear.


Discovery of Choi Soon-sil's tablet computer

Reporters covering the story for _JTBC Newsroom_ located a rental office in Germany which had previously been temporarily used by Choi. There, they retrieved a Samsung tablet computer which contained her login information.[22] They found that Choi had received drafts of 44 presidential speeches on the tablet before she abandoned it. One of the most troubling of these was a Microsoft Word document which contained a corrected draft of a speech made by Park in Germany on March 28, 2014.[23] To avoid plausible deniability by Park, they initially reported on October 19 that anonymous sources had rumored Choi was editing Park's speeches. Once Park responded by denying that any of her speeches had been sent to private individuals, JTBC publicized their possession of the tablet on October 24. The following morning, Park admitted that Choi had been acting as her unofficial, unpaid personal assistant.[24]

Coverage of Choi subsequently spread to all media. Media outlets reported that Choi and President Park's senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million USD) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.[25][26][27]


Arrests

-   On November 2, 2016, top presidential aides Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung were arrested for abusing power and aiding Choi.[28][29] The Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying charges against Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded with the three in certain criminal activities. The president will be questioned by prosecutors, the first time this has occurred with a serving South Korean president.[30][31][32]

They were arrested for illegally funneling tens of thousands of U.S. dollars a month from their spy agency's secret budget for Park's private use through her presidential office budget.[49]

Arrest of Park Geun-hye

On 30 March 2017 the Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant for Park's arrest on corruption charges. She was arrested later that day.[50]


Parliamentary hearing

On 6 December, chiefs of South Korea's major conglomerates (chaebols) came to the National Assembly to attend the first parliamentary hearing on the scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her long-time confidante Choi Soon-sil. It happened for the first time since 1988.[51] Participants included Samsung Electronics Vice Chair Lee Jae-yong, Hyundai Motor Chair Chung Mong-koo, Lotte Group Chair Shin Dong-bin, SK Group Chair Chey Tae-won and the heads of CJ, LG, Hanwha and Hanjin, The Federation of Korean Industries.[52] In the hearing, presidents of the chaebols told the parliament that they were not seeking favours when they made contributions to two foundations at the heart of a scandal that appeared poised to bring down President Park Geun-hye.[53]

On 7 December 2016, President Park's former aides, including ex-chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong, testified in the 2nd parliamentary hearing about suspicions that Choi Soon-sil meddled in government affairs.[54]

On 14 December 2016, the Special Committee of the Parliament held a 3rd hearing, focused on solving the mystery surrounding President Park's 7-hour public absence on the day of the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking.[55]

On 15 December 2016, the Special Committee held a 4th hearing to question the allegations over Mir and K-Sports foundation and how Chung Yoo-ra cheated her way through Ewha Womans University.

On 22 December 2016, a 5th hearing was held to question former Presidential Secretary Woo Byung-woo and former presidential nurse Cho Yeo-ok.[57][58]

On 26 December 2016, special committee members of National Assembly held a 6th hearing in a prison and met Choi Soon-sil in her detention cell; she repeatedly refused to attend a parliamentary hearing. She denied most of her allegations over the influence-peddling scandal.[59][60]

On 9 January 2017, a 7th hearing was held to question Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun, former chief of admissions at Ewha Womans University Namkung Gon, K-Sports Foundation Chairman Chung Dong Chun and a staffer at the presidential security office Ku Soon-sung. The hearing confirmed that a blacklist for left-leaning artists existed.[61][62]


Public apology and presidential approval rating falls

On October 25, 2016, President Park publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi and apologized to the public. On October 28, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her approval ratings fell to 5%. Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher at 13% for over 60 years age group.[63] It was the worst ever presidential approval rating in the Korean history and even lower than the 6% approval rating of former President Kim Young-sam, who was widely blamed for failing the Korean economy, which eventually led to the Asian Financial Crisis.[64][65] On November 4, President Park apologized for the second time. On November 29, Park offered to resign as President and invited the National Assembly to arrange a transfer of power. The opposition parties rejected the offer, accusing Park of attempting to avoid the process of impeachment.[66]


Protests

민중총궐기_1112_175616.jpg The revelations about the relationship between Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil caused mass demonstrations in Seoul.[67][68] Protesters called for the resignation of Park Geun-hye.[69] On November 12, more than 1 million citizens participated in the protests at Gwanghwamun Square close to presidential residence demanding President Park's resignation or impeachment.[70] On November 19, another 1 million citizens participated in the national protest after President Park refused to help the investigation of her abuse of power.[71][72] On November 26, more than 2 million citizens participated in the protest, calling for the resignation of President Park.[73] Protests went on, and on January 21, 2017, a 13th protest was held in Seoul with more than 200,000 attendees.[74]


Impeachment process

On December 5, 2016, three opposition parties agreed to introduce a joint impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye. The motion, which was signed by 171 of 300 lawmakers, was put to a vote on Friday, 9 December 2016, and passed with 234 out of 300 votes, a tally much greater than the required 2/3 majority and which included many of Park's own ruling party.[75]

Court hearing and trial

On December 19, Choi Soon-sil attended the first hearing in the trial of President Park in Seoul District Court. In the first hearing, prosecutors say Choi used their relationship to pressure companies to donate to two foundations, and siphoned off money for personal use. However, she denies the allegations that she influenced the president.[76][77]

On January 5, 2017, constitutional court began its first trial regarding President Park's impeachment.[78] On January 16, 2017, Choi Soon-sil testified herself in the Constitutional Court and denied any wrongdoings.[79][80] The Constitutional Court declared that it will hold the final pleading from President Park on Feb. 24, suggesting that the court will make a decision on the impeachment trial before March 13.[81]

On March 10, the court issued a unanimous ruling, confirming the impeachment proposal and removing President Park from office.[82]
