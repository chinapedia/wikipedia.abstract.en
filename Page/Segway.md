The SEGWAY PT (originally SEGWAY HT) is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter by Segway Inc. It was invented by Dean Kamen and brought to market in 2001. _HT_ is an initialism for 'human transporter' and _PT_ for 'personal transporter'.


History

Independent company

The Segway PT (referred to at the time as the Segway HT) was developed from the self-balancing iBOT wheelchair which was initially developed at University of Plymouth, in conjunction with BAE Systems and Sumitomo Precision Products.[1] Segway's first patent was filed in 1994 and granted in 1997[2] followed by others[3] including one submitted in June 1999 and granted in October 2001.[4]

The invention, development, and financing of the Segway was the subject of a book,[5] and a leak of information prior to publication of the book and the launch of the product led to excited speculation about the device and its importance. John Doerr speculated that it would be more important than the Internet.[6] _South Park_ devoted an episode to making fun of the hype before the product was released. Steve Jobs was quoted as saying that it was "as big a deal as the PC",[7] (but later retracted that saying that it "sucked", presumably referring to "the design" but commenting about the boutique price, asking, "You're _sure_ your market is upscale consumers for transportation?")[8] The device was unveiled on 3 December 2001, following months of public speculation,[9] in Bryant Park, New York City, on the ABC News morning program _Good Morning America_[10][11] with the first units delivered to customers in early 2002.[12]

The original Segway models featured three speed settings: , with faster turning, and .[13] Steering of early versions was controlled using a twist grip that varied the speeds of the two motors. The range of the p-Series was on a fully charged nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery with a recharge time of 4–6 hours. In September 2003, the Segway PT was recalled, because if users ignored repeated low battery warnings on the PTs, it could ultimately lead them to fall.[14] With a software patch to version 12.0, the PT would automatically slow down and stop in response to detecting low battery power.

In August 2006 Segway discontinued all previous models and introduced the i2 and x2 products which were steered by leaning the handlebars to the right or left,[15] had a maximum speed of from a pair of Brushless DC electric motor with regenerative braking and a range of up to , depending on terrain, riding style and state of the batteries.[16] Recharging took 8–10 hours. The i2 and x2 also introduced the wireless InfoKey which could show mileage and a trip odometer, as well as put the Segway into Security mode, which locked the wheels and set off an alarm if it was moved, and could also be used to turn on the PT from up to away.[17]

In March 2014, Segway announced third generation designs, including the i2 SE and x2 SE sport, new LeanSteer frame and powerbase designs, with integrated lighting.[20]

Subsidiary of Ninebot

Ninebot Inc., a Beijing-based transportation robotics startup and a Segway rival, acquired Segway in April 2015 having raised $80M from Xiaomi and Sequoia Capital.[21] [22]

In June 2016 the company launched the Segway miniPRO, a smaller self-balancing scooter.[23]


Products

the following self-balancing scooters are available from Segway (For other Segway products see Segway Inc.):

-   Ninebot by Segway miniPro (smaller self-balancing scooter for general use, controlled by a 'knee control bar')[28]


Technology

The dynamics of the Segway PT are similar to a classic control problem, the inverted pendulum. It uses brushless DC electric motors in each wheel powered by lithium-ion batteries with balance achieved using tilt sensors, and gyroscopic sensors developed by BAE Systems' Advanced Technology Centre.[29] The wheels are driven forward or backward as needed to return its pitch to upright.


Usage

FlorenceSegwayTour.jpg, Italy]] In 2011 the Segway i2 was being marketed to the emergency medical services community.[30] The special police forces trained to protect the public during the 2008 Summer Olympics used the Segway for mobility.[31]

The Segway miniPro is also available to be used as the mobility section of a robot.[32]

Disability Rights Advocates for Technology[33] promoted the use of the Segway PT on sidewalks as an Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) issue. Segway Inc. cannot however market these devices in the US as medical devices (as per agreement with Johnson & Johnson with regard to the iBOT, a self-balancing wheelchair)[34] and they have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a medical device.

The maximum speed of the Segway PT is . The product is capable of covering on a fully charged lithium-ion battery, depending on terrain, riding style, and the condition of the batteries.[35] The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have Segway-specific recommendations but does say that bicycle helmets are adequate for "low-speed, motor-assisted" scooters.[36]
