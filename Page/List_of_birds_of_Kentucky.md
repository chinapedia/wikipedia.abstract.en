This LIST OF BIRDS OF KENTUCKY includes species documented in the U.S. state of Kentucky by the Kentucky Bird Records Committee (KBRC) of the Kentucky Ornithological Society.[1] Of the 387 species on the list, 97 are classed as accidental and six were introduced to North America. Four are extinct and three have been extirpated. An additional nine species are hypothetical as defined below. Birds that are considered probable escapees, although they may have been sighted flying free, are not included.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the _Check-list of North American Birds_, 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS).[2][3] Common and scientific names are also those of the _Check-list_.

The following tags are used to designate some species:

-   (A) ACCIDENTAL - A species on the Kentucky review list, for which the KOS requires documentation
-   (E) EXTIRPATED - a species which no longer occurs in Kentucky but exists elsewhere
-   (X) EXTINCT - a recent species that no longer exists
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention
-   (H) HYPOTHETICAL - species with only sight records or questionable reports, which also require documentation
