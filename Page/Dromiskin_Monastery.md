DROMISKIN MONASTERY is a medieval monastery and National Monument located in Dromiskin, Ireland.[1][2]


Location

Dromiskin Monastery is located in the centre of Dromiskin village, halfway between the River Fane and River Glyde and west of the Irish Sea coast.


History

The monastery at Dromiskin is said to have been founded by Lugaid (d. 515/516), a follower of Saint Patrick and son of Óengus mac Nad Froích, King of Munster, in the 6th century; or by Rónán, son of Bearach in the 7th century. Rónán died in 664 of _buide-connaill_ ("yellow plague," an epidemic illness in ancient Ireland).

The round tower was constructed in the 9th century. Dromiskin was burned by Vikings in 833 (Annals of Ulster). The Uí Chrítáin were hereditary clergy at Dromiskin and it was pillaged by Domnall ua Néill in 970.[3] The monastery was plundered by Irish in 908, Vikings in 978 and Irish again in 1043. It continued in operation until the 12th century.[4]


Buildings

The upper portion was rebuilt around the 12th century and used as a bell tower, and remained in use until the 19th century.

High cross

Some accounts associate it with Áed Findliath (High King of Ireland 862–879). One panel is believed to show David presenting Goliath's head to Saul. Also carved on it are dragons and a crucifixion.[5]

Church

The gable and foundation of a 12th century church with 15th century window remain at Dromiskin.[6]
