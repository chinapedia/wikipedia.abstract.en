NUKWASE NDWANDWE (c. 1890 â€“ 15 September 1957) was the Queen Mother of Swaziland, aunt of Sobhuza II, and the sister of Lomawa Ndwandwe.[1][2]


Early life

King Ngwane V died in 1899, during Ndwandwe's childhood.[3] Owing to hereditary considerations, the royal family consequently brought Ndwandwe into the late Ngwane V's harem.[4] Subsequently, Ndwandwe bore two sons and two daughters to Malunge, Ngwane V's younger brother, in the name of Ngwane V.[5]
