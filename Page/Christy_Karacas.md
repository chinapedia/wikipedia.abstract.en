CHRISTY KARACAS is an American musician, animator, voice actor, director and writer, known for creating _Superjail!_ and _Ballmastrz: 9009_ for Adult Swim.[1]


Career

Karacas studied film and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design, was a founding member and guitar player for the band Cheeseburger, and formerly animated title sequences and other animation for Vice Broadcasting System (VBS.tv).

Karacas began his career in the animation industry at MTV Animation, where he created the student film _Space War_, and served as a background designer for _Daria_.

He and Stephen Warbrick, prior to _Superjail!_, created the short film "Bar Fight", which caught the attention of Adult Swim, who allowed them, and Ben Gruber, to create a show of their own.

_Superjail!_ was originally animated by Augenblick Studios in the pilot episode and first season, but was later animated by Titmouse, Inc. from seasons two to four. The series ended its run in 2014. While doing the work on _Superjail!_, Karacas directed 10 episodes of the short-lived Cartoon Network animated series _Robotomy_, which ran from 2010 to 2011.

After _Superjail!_, Karacas would later move on to create another show for Adult Swim, titled _Ballmastrz: 9009_.
