WONHEE ANNE JOH is an author, theologian, professor and lecturer whose influence in the disciplines of religion, women's equality, and the Asian American experience has created a great deal of thought and positive discourse.[1]


Career

Joh is a Professor of Theology and Culture at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois. She is also serving as an invited affiliate faculty in Depts. of Religious Studies and Asian American Studies Program and faculty member of Religion and Global Politics Group (Buffett Institute) at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Joh describes her teaching philosophy to include "As a teacher, I believe that transformative praxis begins with each of us in our everyday lives. Theological reflection is crucial because the meaning of our lives is often understood through the prism of religious experience. Therefore, theological reflection must be bold and imaginative as well as grounded in the material reality of history of peoples' lives." [2]


_Heart of the Cross: A Postcolonial Christology_

Joh's renowned book _Heart of the Cross: A Postcolonial Christology_ (2006) Westminster John Knox Press, Louisville, Kentucky, is a theological masterpiece. "Utilizing the Korean concept of _jeong_, Joh constructs a theology that is feminist, political and love-centered, while acknowledging the cross as source of pain and suffering. Joh's innovative vision is a call for political love that is stronger than powers of oppression." [3]

"Wonhee Anne Joh's book, _Heart of The Cross,_ also contributes to the conversation not only with postcolonial theory but also with other theories such as post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and liberationist feminist hermeneutics. In this book, Joh investigates the specific theological category, Christology, by drawing on her Asian/Korean American experience." [4]
