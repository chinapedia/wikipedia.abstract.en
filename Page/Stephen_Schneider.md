STEPHEN HENRY SCHNEIDER (February 11, 1945 – July 19, 2010)[1] was Professor of Environmental Biology and Global Change at Stanford University, a Co-Director at the Center for Environment Science and Policy of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and a Senior Fellow in the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Schneider served as a consultant to federal agencies and White House staff in the Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.

Schneider's research included modeling of the atmosphere, climate change, and the effect of global climate change on biological systems. Schneider was the founder and editor of the journal _Climatic Change_ and authored or co-authored over 450 scientific papers and other publications. He was a Coordinating Lead Author in Working Group II Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report and was engaged as a co-anchor of the Key Vulnerabilities Cross-Cutting Theme for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) at the time of his death. During the 1980s, Schneider emerged as a leading public advocate of sharp reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. In 2006 Professor Schneider was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence advising the South Australian Government of Premier Mike Rann on climate change and renewable energy policies.[2] In ten years South Australia went from zero to 31% of its electricity generation coming from renewables.

An annual award for outstanding climate science communication was created in Schneider's honor after his death, by the Commonwealth Club of California.[3] The Stephen Schneider Memorial Lecture of the American Geophysical Union honors Schneider's life and work. [4]


Early work

Schneider grew up on Long Island, New York. He studied engineering at Columbia University, receiving his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1966. In 1971, he earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and plasma physics.[5] Schneider studied the role of greenhouse gases and suspended particulate material on climate as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

In 1971, Schneider was second author on a _Science_ paper with S. Ichtiaque Rasool titled "Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate" (_Science_ 173, 138–141). This paper used a one-dimensional radiative transfer model to examine the competing effects of cooling from aerosols and warming from CO₂. The paper concluded that:

Carbon dioxide was predicted to have only a minor role. However, the model was very simple and the calculation of the CO₂ effect was lower than other estimates by a factor of about three, as noted in a footnote to the paper.

The story made headlines in the _New York Times_. Shortly afterwards, Schneider became aware that he had overestimated the cooling effect of aerosols, and underestimated the warming effect of CO₂ by a factor of about three. He had mistakenly assumed that measurements of air particles he had taken near the source of pollution applied worldwide. He also found that much of the effect was due to natural aerosols which would not be affected by human activities, so the cooling effect of changes in industrial pollution would be much less than he had calculated. Having found that recalculation showed that global warming was the more likely outcome, he published a retraction of his earlier findings in 1974.[6]

In a 1976 book _The Genesis Strategy_ he discusses both long-term warming due to carbon dioxide and short-term cooling due to aerosols,[7] and advocated for adopting policies that are resilient to future changes in climate.[8]


Media contributions

Schneider was a frequent contributor to commercial and noncommercial print and broadcast media on climate and environmental issues, e.g., _Nova_, _Planet Earth_, _Nightline_, _Today Show_, _The Tonight Show_, Bill Maher's shows, _Good Morning America_, _Dateline_, The Discovery Channel, as well as appearances on the British, Canadian and Australian Broadcasting Corporations.[9]

Schneider commented about the frustrations and difficulties involved with assessing and communicating scientific ideas. In a January 2002 _Scientific American_ article, he wrote:

In 1989, Schneider addressed the challenge scientists face trying to communicate complex, important issues without adequate time during media interviews. This citation sometimes was used by his critics to accuse him of supporting misuse of science for political goals:

Personal

Schneider was married to the biologist Terry Root.[12] Schneider was a survivor of an aggressive cancer, mantle cell lymphoma. He documented his struggle to conquer the condition, including applying his own knowledge of science to design his own treatment regime, in a self-published 2005 book, _The Patient from Hell_.[13] He died unexpectedly on July 19, 2010 after suffering a pulmonary embolism while returning from a scientific meeting in , Sweden.[14][15]
