_GUDEODISCUS GIARDI_ is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Plectopylidae.

This species was described by French zoologist Pierre Marie Henri Fischer (1865-1916) (son of Paul-Henri Fischer) in 1898.


Subspecies

-   _Gudeodiscus giardi giardi_ (Fischer, 1898)
-   _Gudeodiscus giardi oharai_ Páll-Gergely, 2013[1]
-   _Gudeodiscus giardi szekeresi_ Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2013[2]

The specific name _giardi_ is in honor of French zoologist Alfred Mathieu Giard.[3] The subspecific name _oharai_ is in honor of the collector Kenji Ohara.[4] The subspecific name _szekeresi_ is in honor of the malacologist Miklós Szekeres.[5]


Distribution

The distribution of _Gudeodiscus giardi_ includes Cao Bằng Province and the northern part of Lạng Sơn Province in Vietnam[6] and western Guangxi in China.[7]

The type locality of _Gudeodiscus giardi giardi_ is "Cao-Bang".[8][9] _Gudeodiscus giardi giardi_ lives in Vietnam and China.[10] _Gudeodiscus giardi oharai_ lives in are north of Nanning in Western Guangxi, China.[11] _Gudeodiscus giardi szekeresi_ live in the type locality only: Langur Reserve, 25 km southeast of Chongzuo, China.[12]


Description

The most important shell characters for identification of _Gudeodiscus giardi_ include: high and rather sharply defined shell shape, narrow umbilicus (for the genus _Gudeodiscus_) and thick peristome.[13]

The size of the shell is small to large.[14] The shape of the shell is high and rather sharply defined. [15] The color of the shell is brownish, but some Chinese populations are small and yellow and translucent.[16] The sculpture is usually finely reticulated, that is resulting in a matt surface.[17] The umbilicus is deep.[18] Apertural lip, callus and apertural fold are very well-developed (callus is very much elevated).[19] Parietal wall has two lamellae.[20] The anterior lamella is usually connected to the lower plica.[21] Middle palatal plicae are short, depressed Z-shaped, or almost vertical, sometimes connected to each other.[22] The width of the shell 13.5–21.3 mm.[23] The height of the shell is 7.0–12.1 mm.[24]

The radula of _Gudeodiscus giardi_ has 12 lateral teeth and 15 marginal teeth.[25] The size of the central tooth is as large as the ectocone of the first lateral.[26] The shape of the first lateral is rhomboid and pointed.[27] Marginal teeth are bicuspid or tricuspid with blunt inner cusp and shallow incision between the inner two cusps.[28]

The reproductive system of specimen from China was described by Páll-Gergely & Asami in 2014[29] and from Vietnam by Páll-Gergely et al. in 2015.[30] Embryos were not recorded in the uterus.[31] There were recorded hook-like or flat and oval calcareous granules on the internal surface of penis.[32]


Ecology

It is a ground-dwelling species as all other plectopylid snails in Vietnam.[33]

It co-occur with other plectopylids in Vietnam: with _Gudeodiscus anceyi_, _Gudeodiscus francoisi_, _Sicradiscus mansuyi_ and with _Gudeodiscus suprafilaris_.[34] _Gudeodiscus phlyarius_ live at geographically close sites to _Gudeodiscus giardi_.[35]
