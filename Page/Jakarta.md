Located on the northwest coast of the world's most populous island, Java, it is the centre of economics, culture and politics of Indonesia, with a population of 10,075,310 .[8][9] Jakarta metropolitan area has an area of 6,392 square kilometers, which is known as Jabodetabek (an acronym of Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi). It is the world's second largest urban agglomeration (after Tokyo) with a population of 30,214,303 .[10] Jakarta is predicted to reach 35.6 million people by 2030 to become the world's biggest megacity.[11] Jakarta's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, attract migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, combining many communities and cultures.[12]

Established in the 4th century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. It was the _de facto_ capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta is officially a province with special capital region status, but is commonly referred to as a city. The Jakarta provincial government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is nicknamed the Big Durian, the thorny strongly-odored fruit native to the region,[13] as the city is seen as the Indonesian equivalent of New York (Big Apple).[14]

Jakarta is an alpha world city[15] and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat, making it an important city for international diplomacy.[16] Important financial institutions such as Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. As of 2017, the city is home to six Forbes Global 2000, two Fortune 500 and four Unicorn companies.[17][18][19] In 2017, the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$483.4 billion.[20][21] Jakarta has grown more rapidly than Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Beijing.[22]

Jakarta's major challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, gridlock traffic and congestion, and flooding.[23] In addition, Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) per year, which, coupled with the rising of sea levels, has made the city more prone to flooding, and also one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world.[24][25][26] Indonesian President Joko Widodo has announced a move of Indonesia’s capital, possibly to Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo.[27][28]


History

Names and etymology

(1522), a stone pillar with a cross of the Order of Christ commemorating a treaty between the Portuguese Empire and the Sunda Kingdom, at Jakarta History Museum]] Jakarta has been home to multiple settlements:

-   Sunda Kelapa (397–1527)
-   Jayakarta (1527–1619)
-   Batavia (1619–1942)
-   Djakarta (1942–1945)
-   Jakarta (1945–present)

Its current name "Jakarta" derives from the word _Jayakarta_ (Devanagari: जयकृत) which is ultimately derived from Sanskrit language; जय _jaya_ (victorious)[29] and कृत _krta_ (accomplished, acquired),[30] thus _Jayakarta_ translates as "victorious deed", "complete act" or "complete victory" which literally, Jakarta means the "victorious city". It was named after troops of Fatahillah successfully defeated and drove away Portuguese invaders from the city in 1527.[31] Before it was named "Jayakarta", the city was known as "Sunda Kelapa".

In the colonial era, the city was also known as _Koningin van het Oosten_ (Queen of the Orient), initially in the 17th century for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout.[32] After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.[33] During Japanese occupation the city was renamed as _Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi_ (Jakarta Special Municipality).[34]

Pre-colonial era

discovered in Tugu district, North Jakarta]] The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta, was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[35] The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia.[36] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement at least in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[37] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, _Chu-fan-chi_, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula and western Java (Sunda). The source reports the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden piles.[38] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮜᮕ) and by the 14th century, it was a major trading port for the Sunda kingdom.

The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513, while looking for a route for spices.[39] The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate from central Java.[40] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Javanese general from Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[41] and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asia trading centre.

Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, the English East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in Indonesia until 1682.[42] Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[43]

Colonial era

c. 1656]] When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and the English, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the English fort, and forced them to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power and in 1619 they renamed the city _Batavia_.

Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740 and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[44] At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number which changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded, fabrics, especially imported cotton, _batik_ and clothing worn by Arab communities.[45]

in the late 18th century by Johannes Rach c. 1770. The building now houses the Jakarta History Museum, Jakarta Old Town.]] The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913[46] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.[47] By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[48] including 37,067 Europeans.[49] After World War II, the city of Batavia was renamed "Jakarta" (a short form of Jayakarta) by nationalists, after achieving independence in 1949.[50]

On 5 March 1942, the Japanese wrested Batavia from Dutch control and the city was named Jakarta (, in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognized until full Indonesian independence was achieved on 27 December 1949 and Jakarta was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.

Independence era

, which stands in the centre of Merdeka square, commemorates the Indonesian struggle for independence.]] Following World War II, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta during their fight for independence and established their capital in Yogyakarta. Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945 and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month.

In 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta again became the national capital.[51] Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.[52][53] Projects included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new parliament building. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which 6 top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge in which half a million people were killed, including many ethnic Chinese,[54] marking the beginning of Suharto's New Order. A monument stands where the generals' bodies were dumped. , one of the main avenues of Jakarta]] This first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960, when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro, until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor. Based on _Act No. 5 of 1974_ relating to the Fundamentals of Regional Government, Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of Indonesia's then 26 provinces.[55]

In 1966, Jakarta was declared a "special capital region" (_Daerah Khusus Ibukota_), with status equivalent to that of a province.[56] Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from the mid-1960s commencement of the "New Order" until 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects—some for the benefit of the Suharto family[57][58]—and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[59] Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of the city.[60]

The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest and political manoeuvring. After 32 years in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions reached a peak when 4 students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces; four days of riots and violence ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign.[61] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians.[62] Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.[63] Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[64] with another bombing in 2009.[65]

In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas.[66] Previously, governors were elected by the members of Jakarta Council (DPRD).


Administration

Government and politics

Jakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a deputy governor, while DPRD is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. Executive governance consists of five administrative cities/_Kota Administratif_, each headed by a mayor—and one administrative regency/_Kabupaten Administratif_ headed by a regent/_Bupati_. Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent are directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regent are chosen by the governor of Jakarta. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.

Aside from representatives to the Regional Representative Council, Jakarta sent 21 members to the People's Representative Council. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's 3 national electoral districts, which also includes overseas voters.[67] Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on December 14, 2014 with a goal for smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living and a smart environment in the city using web and various smartphone based app.[68]

Polda Metro Jaya maintains the law, security and order of Jakarta. It is led by a Regional Chief of police _Kapolda_, who holds the rank of Inspector General of Police.

Municipal finances

The Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees among others.[69] The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances. In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50 trillion (about $US 5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US 380 per citizen. Spending priorities were education, transport, flood control, environment and social spending (such as health and housing).[70]

The provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15–20% of planned spending, largely because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies.[71] Regular underspending is a matter of public comment.[72]

Administrative divisions

(_Kecamatan_).]] Jakarta consists of five _Kota Administratif_ (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one _Kabupaten Administratif_ (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts/Kecamatan. The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:

-   Central Jakarta (_Jakarta Pusat_) is Jakarta's smallest city and the administrative and political centre. It is divided into 8 districts. It is characterised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and museums.[73]
-   West Jakarta (_Jakarta Barat_) has the city's highest concentration of small-scale industries. This city has 8 districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town.[74]
-   South Jakarta (_Jakarta Selatan_), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has 10 districts and functions as Jakarta's groundwater buffer,[75] but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the central business district is concentrated in Setiabudi, South Jakarta, bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta.
-   East Jakarta (_Jakarta Timur_) territory is characterised by several industrial sectors.[76] Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has 10 districts.
-   North Jakarta (_Jakarta Utara_) is bounded by the Java Sea. It is the location of Port of Tanjung Priok. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town and was the centre of VOC trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (Taman Impian Jaya Ancol), the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia.[77] North Jakarta is divided into 6 districts.

The only administrative regency (_kabupaten_) of Jakarta is Thousand Islands (_Kepulauan Seribu_), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It has of high conservation value because of its special ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and wind surfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands are speed boats or small ferries.[78]

: Jakarta's cities/municipalities (_Kota Administrasi/Kotamadya_)


Geography

Jakarta covers the smallest among Indonesian provinces. Greater Jakarta metropolitan area has an area of 6,392 square kilometers, which extends into two of the bordering provinces of West Java and Banten.[81] The Greater Jakarta area includes 3 bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).

Topography

beach]] Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level[82] and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is of land area and of sea area.[83] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from with an average elevation of above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. 13 rivers flow through Jakarta. They are:[84] Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja,[85] Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. These rivers flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.

)]] These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding. Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about each year, and up to in the northern coastal areas. To help cope with the threat from the sea, after feasibility study a ring dike is under construction around Jakarta Bay. The dike would be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is expected to be completed by 2025.[86] In January 2014, Central Government agreed to build 2 dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease Jakarta floods. Construction costs will be paid for by the central government, but land acquisitions are the responsibility of the Jakarta Authority.[87] Nowadays, an , with capacity per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[88]

Climate

Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (_Am_) according to the Köppen climate classification system. The wet season in Jakarta covers the majority of the year, running from October through May. The remaining four months (June through September) constitute the city's drier season (each of these four months has an average monthly rainfall of less than ). Located in the western part of Java, Jakarta's wet season rainfall peaks in January and February with average monthly rainfall of , and its dry season low point is in August with a monthly average of .

Parks and lakes

]] In June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (_Ruang Terbuka Hijau_) although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces.[90] As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.[91]

-   Merdeka Square () is an almost 1 km² field housing the symbol of Jakarta, Monas or _Monumen Nasional_ (National Monument). Until 2000 it was the world's largest city square. The square was created by Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1810) and was originally named Koningsplein (King's Square). On 10 January 1993, President Soeharto started the beautification of the square. Features including a deer park and 33 trees that represent the 33 provinces of Indonesia were added.[92]
-   Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field) is located in Central Jakarta near Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral, and Jakarta Central Post Office. It covers about 4.5 hectares. Initially it was called Waterlooplein and functioned as the ceremonial square during the colonial period. Colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the _Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat_ (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993 the park was turned into a public space again. It became a recreation place for people and serves as an exhibition place or for other events.[93] 'Jakarta Flona' (_Flora dan Fauna_), a flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.

Gondola]]

-   Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (Miniature Park of Indonesia), in East Jakarta, has 10 mini parks.
-   Suropati Park is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta. The park is surrounded by Dutch colonial buildings. Taman Suropati was known as Burgemeester Bisschopplein during the colonial time. The park is circular shaped with a surface area of . Several modern statues were made for the park by artists of ASEAN countries, which contributes to its nickname _Taman persahabatan seniman ASEAN_ ('Park of the ASEAN artists friendship').[94]
-   Menteng Park was built on the site of the former Persija football stadium. Situ Lembang Park is also located nearby, which has a lake at the center.
-   Kalijodo Park is the newest park, in Penjaringan subdistrict, with beside the Krendang River. It formally opened on 22 February 2017. The park is open 24 hours as a green open space (_RTH_) and child-friendly integrated public space (_RPTRA_) and has international-standard skateboard facilities.[95]
-   Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary and Angke Kapuk Nature Tourism Park at Penjaringan in North Jakarta.[96]
-   Ragunan Zoo is located in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. It is the world's third oldest zoo and is the second largest with the most diverse animal and plant populations.[97]
-   Setu Babakan is a 32 hectare lake surrounded by Betawi cultural village, located at Jagakarsa, South Jakarta.[98] Dadap Merah Park is also located in this area.
-   Ancol Dreamland is the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia. It is located along the bay, at Ancol in North Jakarta.
-   Taman Waduk Pluit/Pluit Lake park and Putra Putri Park at Pluit, North Jakarta.[99]
-   Tebet Honda Park, Puring Park, Mataram Park, Taman Langsat and Taman Ayodya in South Jakarta[100][101]


Demography

Population

Jakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta.[102] Inwards immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.[103]

Between 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled and during the period 1980–1990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%.[104] The 2010 census counted some 9.58 million people, well above government estimates.[105] The population rose from 4.5 million in 1970 to 9.5 million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2 million in 1970 to 28.5 million in 2010. As per 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10,075,310 people.[106] with a population density of 15,174 people/km².[107][108] As per 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30,326,103, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population.[109] The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010[110] and 101.3 in 2014.[111]

Ethnicity and language

Jakarta is a pluralistic and religiously diverse city. As of 2000, 35.16% of the city's population are Javanese, 27.65% Betawi, 15.27% Sundanese, 5.53% Chinese, 3.61% Batak, 3.18% Minangkabau and 1.62% Malays.[112] And as of 2010 Census, 36.17% of the city's population are Javanese, 28.29% Betawi, 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.08%.

The 'Betawi' (_Orang Betawi_, or 'people of Batavia') are the descendants of the people living in and around Batavia, and became recognised as an ethnic group around the 18th–19th century. The Betawi people are mostly descended from Southeast-Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs.[113][114] Betawi people are a creole ethnic group who came from various parts of Indonesia and intermarried with Chinese, Arabs and Europeans.[115] Betawi form a minority in the city; most live in the fringe areas of Jakarta with hardly any Betawi-dominated areas in central Jakarta.[116]

in Glodok, Jakarta]] A significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. Chinese in Jakarta traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. Officially, they make up 5.53% of the Jakarta population, although this number may be under-reported.[117]

The Sumatran residents are diverse. According to 2010 Census, roughly 346,000 Batak, 305,000 Minangkabau and 155,000 Malays lived there. The Batak and Minangkabau are spread throughout the city. The Batak ethnic group has increased in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest sub-ethnic Batak group in Jakarta.[118] Minangkabau people work as merchants, peddlers, and artisans, with more in white collar professions: doctors, teachers and journalists.[119][120]

Indonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta. English is the second language, while many elderly people speak Dutch and Portuguese. Each of the ethnic groups use their mother language at home, such as Betawi language, Javanese, Sundanese, Malay, Madurese, Batak, Minangkabau, Chinese, Arabic, and Tamil. Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. The language is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau, Chinese, and Arabic.

Religion

In 2017, Jakarta's religious composition was distributed over Islam (83.43%), Protestantism (8.63%), Catholicism (4.0%), Buddhism (3.74%), Hinduism (0.19%), and Confucianism (0.01%). Folk religion was claimed by 231 people.[121]

Most _pesantren_ (Islamic boarding schools) in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama,[122] modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They give priority to education, social welfare programs and religious propagation.[123] Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, including Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Jaringan Islam Liberal, and Front Pembela Islam.

Roman Catholics have a Metropolitan see, the Archdiocese of Jakarta, which includes West Java as part of the ecclesiastical province. A Bahá'í community is there.[124]

Culture

Rather than a single, dominant culture, Jakarta's many languages and ethnic groups support differences in regard to religion, traditions and linguistics.

Arts and festivals

The Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi have moved to the suburbs, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang-based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of _Tanjidor_ (a mixture betofween Betawi and Portuguese music), _Marawis_ (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or _Gambang Kromong_ (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese influenced Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.

Some festivals such as the Jalan Jaksa Festival or Kemang Festival include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to give performances.[125] Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performances can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata theatre.

Arts and culture festivals and exhibitions include the annual Jakarta International Film Festival (JiFFest), Djakarta Warehouse Project, Jakarta Fashion Week, Jakarta Fashion & Food Festival (JFFF), Jakarnaval, Jakarta Night Festival, Kota Tua Creative Festival, Indonesia Creative Products and Jakarta Arts and Crafts exhibition. _Flona Jakarta_ is a flora-and-fauna exhibition, held annually in August at Lapangan Banteng Park, featuring flowers, plant nurseries, and pets. Jakarta Fair is held annually from mid-June to mid-July to celebrate the anniversary of the city and is largely centred around a trade fair. However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians. Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world and arguably the biggest in the Southern hemisphere, and is held annually in March.

Several foreign art and culture centres are established in Jakarta, and mainly serve to promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries and art galleries. Among these foreign art and cultural centres are China Confucius Institute, Netherlands Erasmus Huis, UK British Council, France Alliance Française, Germany Goethe-Institut, Japan Foundation, and India Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center.

Tourism

]] Jakarta has been named the most popular location as per tag stories[166] and ranked 8th most posted among the cities in the world in 2017 on image sharing site Instagram.[167] The city is not a top international tourist destination, although it ranked as the fifth fastest growing destination among 132 cities according to MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index published in September, 2017. 59.1% of visitors came for business, while the other 40.9% were visiting for leisure.[168] According to _Euromonitor International's latest Top 100 City Destinations Ranking_, Jakarta ranked at 83 with more than 3.5 million international tourists visited in a year, 48.5% higher in comparison to the previous year.[169] In 2017 World Travel and Tourism Council's list Jakarta was among the top 10 fastest growing tourism cities in the world,[170] and categorized it as an _emerging performer_, which will see a significant increase in tourist arrivals in less than 10 years.[171].

As the gateway of Indonesia, Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as Bali, Lombok, Komodo Island and Yogyakarta. Jakarta is trying to attract more international tourist by MICE tourism, by arranging increasing numbers of conventions.[172][173] In 2012, the tourism sector contributed 2.6 trillion rupiah (US$268.5 million) to the city's total direct income of 17.83 trillion rupiah (US$1.45 billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011. at Sunda Kelapa harbor]] The popular heritage tourism attractions are in Kota[174] and around Merdeka square.

Infrastructure

Water supply

Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. 80% of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the 7 first years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005 tariffs were frozen, leading the private water companies to cut down on investments. According to PALYJA in its western half of the concession the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010.[179] According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004, but stagnated after that.[180] However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[181] while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[182] Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.[183]

Healthcare

Indonesia's healthcare system is among the best in Southeast Asia together with neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia or Thailand, the capital Jakarta does have many of the country's best-equipped private and public facilities. In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), universal health care in Indonesia. This scheme is the world's largest insurance system today that covers around 250 million people.[184] It is expected that the entire population will be covered in 2019.[185][186][187]

Hospitals are of a good standard; however, they are often overcrowded. Government-run specialized hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital as well as community hospitals Puskesmas. Private hospitals and clinics are another option for healthcare services. Private healthcare sector has seen significant changes, as the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organizations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Hermina operate in the city.[188][189]


Transport

Despite a variety of transport systems,[190] Jakarta faces traffic congestion during rush hours.[191] The city prioritised development of road networks, which were designed to accommodate private vehicles.[192] According to the National Development Planning Agency, or Bappenas, traffic congestion in Greater Jakarta wastes about $7.4 billion each year due to congestion.[193] As of 2018, there are over 13 million motorcycles and 4.4 million cars run on the roads of Jakarta.[194] About 3.6 million commuters commute from the outskirts.[195] 58 percent of these commuters use motorcycles, 12.8 percent use cars and only 27 percent use public transportation.[196] The city's 9.5% average annual growth rate of motorized vehicles far exceeds the 0.01% increase in road length between 2005 and 2010.

As of 2010, public transportation in Jakarta serves only 56% of commuter trips.[197] The first public transport system in the city was Jakarta Tramline, which opened in 1869 and ceased operation in 1962. At present public transit consists of a BRT TransJakarta, rail transit KRL Commuterline, Jakarta MRT, Jakarta LRT and Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link. Transit system under construction is Greater Jakarta LRT, which is expected to be operational by 2021.[198] The city administration is implementing one-fare integrated payment public transportation system by for all public transportation using _Jak Lingko_ card.[199]

Road

or _Jalan Tol Lingkar Dalam Jakarta_ in Grogol Petamburan, West Jakarta]] A structured road network was developed in the early 19th century as a part of the Java Great Post Road by former Governor-General Daendels. It connects most cities throughout Java. During the following decades, the expanding road network could not keep up with the increasing numbers of motorised vehicles. A toll road network composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards provides inner as well as outer city connections. Jakarta Outer Ring Road 2 is a toll road encircling greater Jakarta area, parallel with Jakarta Outer Ring Road. Jakarta Elevated Toll Road with a dedicated public transportation lane, connecting Jakarta Inner Ring Toll Road which is 69.77 kilometers in length is under construction.[200]

Many attempts have been made to reduce traffic congestion, including a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers were prohibited, a ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day,[201] and an 'odd-even' policy that permitted cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates to drive on alternate days.[202] Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) is expected to be operational by 2019 along with the opening of the Jakarta MRT.[203][204] bus at a station on Thamrin Avenue during Car-Free Day]] Many bus routes connect neighborhoods within the city limit to other areas of Greater Jakarta area and to cities across the island. The biggest bus terminal is Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal, arguably the largest in Southeast Asia.[205]

In 1971, cycle rickshaws (_becak_) were banned from major roads. Shortly thereafter, the government attempted a total ban, which substantially reduced their numbers.[206] From the early 1940s to 1991, Bajaj auto rickshaws were common, later allowed only in the back streets of some parts of the city.

Although _ojek_ (motorcycle taxis) are not an official form of public transport, they can be found throughout. Most ojeks are operated by the transportation network companies including Go-Jek and Grab.Angkot micro-buses play a major role connecting neighborhoods of the city. There are plenty of taxicabs along with Go-Jek and Grab.

TransJakarta serves as the bus rapid transit service, including the world's longest bus rapid transit routes ( in length). TransJakarta had a total of 128 routes as of April, 2018 (corridor, cross route & feeder route) – a significant increase from 41 routes in 2015. TransJakarta targeted to serve one million passengers per day by the end of 2018.[207][208] Other private owned bus systems like Kopaja, MetroMini, Mayasari Bakti and etc.

Tourists can catch the double-decker bus—free of charge, in several designated bus stops in front of city's points of interest. Several routes cover tourist attractions such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, the Cathedral, National Museum, Sarinah, Hotel Indonesia crossing, Kota Tua and Kalijodo Park.[209][210] The service includes Kota Tua in the north, Kalijodo Park in the west and Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan area in the south, via Sudirman avenue.[211][212] TransJakarta operates free tour buses every Saturday from 5PM to 11 PM to popular culinary destinations in Central Jakarta.[213] TransJakarta has special bus service to move shoppers from one mall to another, including Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, Senayan City and fX Sudirman.[214]

Rail

in Djatinegara, Batavia _(present Jakarta)_. The Batavia tramway served the city for almost a century until its closing in 1962. Picture circa 1947.]] Long-distance railways and local tram services were introduced during the colonial era. The first station was built in 1887 by a private railway company, which later became Jakarta Kota station.[215] The trams were replaced with buses in the post-colonial era, while long-distance railways continued to connect the city to its neighbouring regions as well as cities throughout Java. The main terminus for long distance train services are Gambir and Pasar Senen. High-speed railways are under construction connecting Jakarta to Bandung,[216] while a line between Jakarta and Surabaya is in planning.[217]

KRL Commuterline is a commuter rail system, that reaches Rangkasbitung in Banten and Cikarang in Bekasi Regency. The rail system uses rolling stock of rapid transit standard and operates at high frequency with a minimum headway. Daily ridership average was about 1 million,[218] totaling 336.7 million passengers in 2018.[219]

Jakarta MRT is constructing a north–south line metro between Kota and Lebak Bulus; and an east–west line that will connect to the north–south line at Sawah Besar station. The first, 15.2 km-long line between Hotel Indonesia and Lebak Bulus is opened at March 2019 with 13 stations (7 elevated stations and 6 underground stations). The network when complete will stretch approximately .[220][221] The MRT operates 285 trips daily from 5 AM until midnight, with 5 minutes headway.[222]

Greater Jakarta LRT was aimed to tackle Jakarta's high road traffic congestion. The northern section of the LRT project partly replaces the Jakarta Monorail project which has been cancelled.[223] The system is planned to connect Jakarta city center with suburbs such as Bekasi, Bogor and Depok.[224] The first phase will connect east Bekasi and Cibubur with Dukuh, passing through Cawang intersection. This phase will be long, with 18 stations.[225] Another Jakarta LRT line connecting Kelapa Gading district and Jakarta International Velodrome is to open in December 2018.[226]

Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link is a commuter train service connecting the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to the city center. Another express train service is now in planning to connect Soekarno-Hatta International Airport with Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. Completion of this line is expected to be in 2019.[227]

Air

Terminal 3]] Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport, located in Tangerang, Banten. The airport was ranked 18th busiest by Airports Council International, with about 63 million passengers in 2017.[228] The Soekarno–Hatta Airport Rail Link connects the airport to Sudirman Baru railway station, Central Jakarta.[229] A second airport, Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) serves domestic low cost airlines, private and VIP flights. Other airports include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago (_Kepulauan Seribu_).

Water transport

Jakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok offers ferry connections. Tanjung Priok is Indonesia's busiest port, and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 6.59 million TEUs.[230] To boost port capacity, the two-phase "New Tanjung Priok" extension project was undertaken. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple existing capacity. Muara Angke port is used as a public port, while Ancol marina port is used as a tourist port to connect Thousand Islands.[231]

On 6 June 2007, the city administration introduced the Waterway (officially _Angkutan Sungai_), a river boat service along the Ciliwung River.[232][233] However, because of varying water levels during the dry and wet seasons plastic garbage those comes with water from upstream during raining, this service was discontinued.


Cityscape

Architecture

in Kota Tua]] Jakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences.[234] External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (_Artocarpus integrifolia_) and comprise three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo.[235] Six hundred registered cultural heritage buildings survive.[236]

Colonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Bank Mandiri Museum. in post-modernist architecture, currently the fourth tallest building in Jakarta]]

In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate.[237] It was developed by developer N.V. de Bouwploeg, established by P.A.J. Moojen.

After independence, the process of nation building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterials, monuments, government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.[238] In 1996, Wisma 46 soars to height of with forty-eight stories and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.

The urban construction booms continued in the 21st century. Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD's in Asia-Pacific region.[239] According to CTBUH and Emporis, 88 skyscrapers reach or exceed , which puts the city at the top 10 of world rankings.[240] It has more buildings taller than 500 feet (150 m) than any other Southeast Asia or southern hemisphere cities. Gama Tower with 310 meters tip height is the tallest building in Jakarta.
