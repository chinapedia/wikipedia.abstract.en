LILLI LUXE (born 15 December 1989[1]) is an American Plus-size model that currently lives in Valencia, Spain.[2]


Background

Lilli Luxe (also known as Natalie Renee) was born in Fort Worth, Texas. Her family moved often and she has lived in Texas, California, Ohio, and Washington.[3] She gained an interest in pinup culture after she had difficulty finding standard clothes that fit her unique hourglass shape.[4] Her hobbies include designing, traveling, watching documentaries, perusing libraries and book shops, baking, and scouring antique stores, thrift stores, and flea markets for vintage treasures[5] Her favorite foods are Thai peanut noodles, California Sushi Rolls, and Chicken Tikka Masala[6]


Modeling

Lilli Luxe began modeling by doing trade shoots with local photographers and creating social media profiles to display her work. Her following grew, and she was soon picked up by Dorothy Combs Models and re-marketed under the name Natalie Renee.[7] Lilli has since modeled for TJ Maxx, Rue21, and Secrets in Lace, straddling the line between conservative plus size modeling and sexy pin up modeling.[8] Her celebrity lookalikes include Nicole Kidman, Anna Nicole Smith, Marilyn Monroe.[9] Her style icons include Jayne Mansfield, Anita Ekberg, Joan Holloway from Mad Men.[10] She was featured in an office themed spread for Issue 31 of Bachelor Pad Magazine [11]
