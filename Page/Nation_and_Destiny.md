_NATION AND DESTINY_ () is a 62-part North Korean film series released between 1992 and 2002. It aims to show that the Korean people "can live a glorious life only in the bosom of the Great Leader and socialist fatherland". Kim Jong-il personally chose the title and was extensively involved in the early episodes. Conceived as the largest film series ever produced in any country, it was the largest investment ever made in the history of North Korean cinema. Initially, the most senior writers, directors and actors were involved in the project and it was heavily promoted and eulogized by the North Korean media. The series was projected to reach 100 episodes, but none have been released since 2002.[1][2][3][4][5]

The film is notable for its scenes set in the Western world and South Korea. Also noteworthy is its portrayal of the "anti-system figure" Han Sorya, who was purged in the 1960s by Kim Il-sung, in a positive role. This was the first time that an "anti-system figure" has been portrayed as the hero on North Korean screen.[6] The use of South Korean popular songs was part of a "mosquito-net strategy", whereby it was hoped the North Korean public would be immunised to the culture of the outside world by gradual exposure.[7] According to defectors' testimony, North Korean audiences were engrossed by its depiction of First World affluence.[8][9]
