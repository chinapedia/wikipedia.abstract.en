OTTO FEIGE (21 September 1882 in Nysa - 2 January 1951 in Kaufbeuren) was an Admiral of the German _Kriegsmarine_ (War Navy) during World War II. He had initially served in the _Kaiserliche Marine_ (Imperial Navy) of the German Empire. He was born in Neisse in Silesia on 21 September 1882.

In 1940, then-_Konteradmiral_ (Rear Admiral) Feige was placed in command of the operation to transfer the unfinished to the Soviet Union. The _Kriegsmarine_ provided an escort of destroyers and other vessels to protect the ship from Allied attack. Upon arrival, Feige led an advisory team that was to help the Soviets complete the ship, though the ship, which had been renamed _Petropavlovsk_, was still under construction when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Feige had helped to delay the transfer of materials from Germany to complete the ship, in anticipation of Germany's eventual attack.
