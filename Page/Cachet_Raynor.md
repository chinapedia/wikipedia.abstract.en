CACHET KEARA RAYNOR is an American Maryland teenager who rose to fame in 2016 after a video she posted of herself on Twitter peeling off a charcoal face mask went viral.[1][2] Cachet's squeals and profanity in the video were retweeted over fifty-five thousand times and liked over eighty-five thousand times.[3][4][5] The popularity over the video led the seventeen-year-old aspiring makeup artist to be interviewed on Ellen and Inside Edition.


Viral video and subsequent fame

In early September 2016 Cachet posted a video of herself on Twitter peeling off a Pil'aten charcoal face mask.[6] The masks have become popular online for being difficult and sometimes painful to peel off.[7] In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Raynor said after leaving the mask on for an hour, she knew the mask would be hard to peel off so she recorded it to show her reaction.[8] Within twenty-four hours the video had over fifty-five thousand retweets and over eighty-five thousand likes. Cachet says of the video "I actually didn't think the video would go viral; I was just being silly."[9]
