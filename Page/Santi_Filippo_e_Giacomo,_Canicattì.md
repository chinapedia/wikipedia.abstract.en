Chiesa_santi_Filippo_e_Giacomo.jpg SANTI FILIPPO E GIACOMO is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic former-church built adjacent to a former Benedictine abbey, thus also known as the _Chiesa della Badia_, in the town of Canicattì, province of Agrigento, region of Sicily, Italy.


History

The abbey was built during the second half of the 17th century, patronized by the Baron Giacomo II Bonanno Crisafi. The ruins are in restoration and part now houses the _museo etno-antropologico_ of the town. The church, now deconsecrated, was completed in 1716, and located at the site of a former _Oratory of Santa Barbara_, held by a local fraternity.

The decorated and sculpted stone façade still displays the Bonanno Crifasi family coat of arms, depicting a rampaging rooster on a gilded background, with the motto "Nequi sol perdiem nequi lume per noxem".

The church has a single nave with a large choir, where the cloistered monks would gather; it was decorated in the early 18th century by followers of Giuseppe and Giacomo Serpotta. The interiors, have undergone various renovations. The chapels of the Crucifix and of the Blessed Virgin of the Hope (della Speranza, also known as _Madonna d'oltremare_ or _Our Lady of Overseas_) were refurbished. The altars to _Gesù Bambino_ (Jesus Child) and Santa Barbara were redone. However since the Second World War, poor conservation led to collapse of the vault, and the structure is now dilapidated.[1]
