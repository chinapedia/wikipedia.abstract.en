A NATURALISTIC PLANNED LANGUAGE is a constructed language specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary from a group of closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be relatively easier to use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group.

The term is most commonly used to apply to pan-Romance planned languages, though there have also been a few pan-Germanic, pan-Slavic and even pan-Celtic naturalistic planned languages.

Since the creation of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems to be generally more difficult to learn than for schematic planned languages, though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type.

The best known languages of this type are Occidental and Interlingua. These two also are designed as international auxiliary languages.
