FERAL AUDIO was an independent podcast network and production company. Founded in 2012 as a podcasting collective by Dustin Marshall with the support of Starburns Industries, Feral Audio LLC was formed in January 2016 as a partnership between Dustin Marshall, Jason Smith, Dan Harmon, and Starburns Industries.

Feral Audio billed itself as a "Fiercely Independent Podcast Network", offering its shows' creators 100% ownership and creative control over their content. Since its inception, Feral Audio produced high rated and critically acclaimed shows such as _Harmontown_, _The Duncan Trussell Family Hour_, Hour of Goon, and _My Favorite Murder_.[1]

In July 2016, Feral Audio made history by being the first podcast network to have a panel in San Diego Comic Con's Hall H.[2]

On January 2, 2018, Dustin Marshall announced he was shutting down Feral Audio in the wake of abuse claims. Some of the podcasts produced by Feral Audio have since moved to the then newly created Starburns Audio podcast network.[3]
