Characters

Main

Frank Stolte

CHIEF INSPECTOR FRANK STOLTE (portrayed by Johannes Brandrup) was the partner of Ingo Fischer and, later, of Semir Gerkhan. He came from the GSG9, where he shot a terrorist without a gun command. The court said he was free, but the media scolded him. After his death, Frank had to fight hard against the differences with his subsequent partner Semir.

Since the end of the first season he stopped to appear without explanation.

In "Risk" it came to the reunion with Semir when Frank tried elucidate back in Germany the supposed death of a colleague near Mostar, while uncovering criminal activity of his former employer. It is learned that he changed to the BKA and later into the private economy. He worked in various crisis areas, most recently for a private company in the clearing of landmines in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Ingo Fischer

CHIEF INSPECTOR INGO FISCHER (portrayed by Rainer Strecker) was the first partner of Frank Stolte, with whom he is good friends with. This comes to the latter's grief in the second episode, as Ingo took a shotgun blast to the chest, making him the shortest serving character in the series.

Katharina Lamprecht

KATHARINA LAMPRECHT (portrayed by Almut Eggert) was chief of police and former head of the highway police. She was commanding officer to Frank, Ingo, Semir and Andre. She stopped to appear in the series after the 6th episode of the 2nd season without an explanation.

Semir Gerkhan

SENIOR CHIEF INSPECTOR SEMIR GERKHAN (portrayed by Erdoğan Atalay) has been present since "The New Partner", and is the current Deputy Head of the _Polizei AutobahnSTation_.

Growing up in Cologne-Kalk, Semir was a criminal in his youth; at the age of 13, he stole cars. This also destroyed the friendship of his former clique, which excluded juvenile imprisonment. When he went to the German police, he was on odd ends with his father. He has a brother named Kemal and a grand cousin named Aladdin.

In "Forever and Ever", he marries the secretary of the department Andrea Schäfer and now has two daughters with her. During Fall of 2013, Andrea left him with the children and he was no longer himself for a while. The resignation of his partner at the time, Ben Jäger, further made him unpredictable for a long time. Only when Alex Brandt joins the Cobra 11 team and copes with the current fall with him after initial problems does he regain his self-confidence. In "1983", he and Andrea divorced, but still shared the concern for their children and kept in touch with each other on friendly terms. Since "The Last Night" in the Fall 2014 season, Semir has been reunited romantically with Andrea, finalised a second time by their marriage in "East of Eden".

In "72 Hours of Anxiety" Semir learns that he has another daughter, Dana Wegner, from an affair over 11 years ago. Semir has once again more contact with his illegitimate daughter during "At One's Own Risk", through which she was abducted in Brussels and was to be sold as a sex slave, whereupon Semir went to Brussels to save her. With the death of her parents in the latter episode, Semir is all Dana has left; despite their somewhat rocky relationship in later episodes, Semir deeply cares for her and her future.

Semir is known that he his silver BMW 3 Series drives in almost every episode to scrap. Despite all the daring maneuvers and accidents, Semir rarely carries serious injuries. In "Sabotage" and "Friends for Life", however, his car accidents lead to head injuries, both of which result in a several-day coma.

In "Angel of Death", Semir quits his job for private reasons and voluntarily moves into the LKA, which was formerly regarded by him as a punishment. When his colleague Ben Jäger is dependent on his help in a recent case, he returns to the Cobra 11 team.

His sidearm is a Walther P88 which has been his sidearm of choice since his appearance on the show.

André Fux

In 1997, CHIEF INSPECTOR ANDRÉ FUX (portrayed by Mark Keller) came to Frank Stolte's exit to the motorway police station. He had a black belt in Karate and exhibits especially outstanding skills in the unarmed combat. In 1999, André was wounded by a harpoon shot on Mallorca. He then falls out of the boat, goes underneath and was missing since then, deemed to have been killed.

In "Resurrection", it is revealed that Fux was found and tended to by a fisherman. He later began a new life and went undercover for the BKA. In the course of the episode, it is also revealed that his wife and his 5-year-old daughter died in a car bombing in 2009. Since then he has been chasing the murderers of his family. However, it later turned out that Fux had been affiliated with a criminal organisation as well, a fact that his former partner, Semir, could not comprehend. Later, following a car accident in the Alps, Semir grabbed his hand on the cliff to hold him, but could not hold him any longer, causing Fux to, following an emotional farewell, fall down a cliff and die. As Fux asked for Semir to further avenge his family in his place, this request perhaps fell on deaf ears.

Tom Kranich

CHIEF INSPECTOR TOM KRANICH (portrayed by René Steinke) came to the Kripo motorway in 1999 and was the successor of Chief Inspector André Fux. He has a sister who appeared in "Between two stools". His father is a successful night club owner in Cologne.

After Semir Gerkhan had overcome the grief over the loss of his colleague André Fux, he and Tom Kranich developed a real friendliness of men. Later they were also best friends outside the profession. In "Resignation" Tom had to cope with a severe blow when his then pregnant girlfriend Elena Krüger, was killed by a car bomb, which was intended for him. Because of it, he resigned.

For those two years his replacement was Jan Richter.

After two years Tom Kranich, now working as a go-kart instructor, returned at the request of his colleague Semir Gerkhan in "Comeback", after Jan had left. At first he only wanted to help with a case, but then decided to return to his old life and not to quit. In "Life & Death", Tom was killed when attempting to save a girl from human traffickers.

Jan Richter

INSPECTOR JAN RICHTER (portrayed by Christian Oliver) was originally a member of the theft decree. In "Baptism of Fire" he met Semir, when Semir was looking for a new partner, randomly apply to Jan. Since collaboration worked well, he chose Jan. Jan switched to the highway patrol and thus became Semir's new partner.

Jan was also Semir's best men, when Semir married Andrea Schäfer in "Forever and Ever". There is no real explanation for Jan's departure. At the half of the tenth season, "Extreme", he only survived an undercover assignment. There, his great love intentionally collapsed with a carriage into an abyss. It can be concluded that he has put the job on the nail.

Jan was only particularly mentioned in the subsequent episode "Comeback".

Chris Ritter

CHIEF INSPECTOR CHRIS RITTER (portrayed by Gedeon Burkhard) is Tom's successor. He was a clandestine investigator at LKA Department 60. During an order, he was unmasked by gangsterbones and tortured almost to death. When his colleagues found him, he was already half dead. He returned home, but he was no longer the man he used to be, and his marriage was ruined. He has a daughter and a son, but he does not have much time for it. He has a sister living in London who has a guest appearance in the series. As a result, in "Life and Death" she is kidnapped instead of Chris and to be misused for illegal organ trade. After this, the relationship between the two of them improved after his sister had denied him any contact for two years.

As a result, on "Life and Death", he goes undercover again as Mark Jäger. At first it looks as "Mark Jäger" had killed Tom. Chris, however, convinced Semir in his innocence. Together, they chase Tom's real murderer, who eventually dies in a shot change. Since this case arouses public interest and pictures of Chris are shown in the media, he can no longer work as a covert investigator and switches to the highway police.

First, however, he has great problems, again to determine as a normal policeman. He makes a lot of alleys and his methods of interrogating someone are unqualified for a policeman. In addition, he found it difficult initially to trust Semir. Later, however, the two get together and become private friends. However, this friendship was by no means as tight as with Semir's previous partners, as Chris suffered a severe trauma to his death because of his experiences.

Chris Ritter is shot and killed from a helicopter in an attempt to save a former girlfriend.

Ben Jäger

CHIEF INSPECTOR BEN JÄGER (portrayed by Tom Beck) is Chris' successor. He was first introduced to Semir in "Auf Eigene Faust", when Semir was chasing Chris' murderer, Sander Kalvus. Although distrustful of him at first, Semir and Ben soon became good friends. Ben is characterised as being an ambitious, often rebellious young officer and later, a similar counterpart to Semir's behaviour.

In "Einsame Entscheidung", he left the police after an emotional case, where he was forced to shoot his girlfriend to save Semir, and swore he never wanted to go through something like this again. He left to start his career as a musician in the United States, for which he was given a guitar signed by his colleagues. At the end of the episode, he is seen performing "This Time" in Hollywood with his band "The Backseats".

Alexander Brandt

After 2 years in prison for drug deals, CHIEF INSPECTOR ALEXANDER "ALEX" BRANDT, née Rickert (played by Vinzenz Kiefer), starts a new life in "Revolution". He is shown with a personality mixed with Andre's and Semir's behaviors; rowdy at times, but willing to get the job done. Alex is first shown leaving prison in the pilot episode of Season 19. However he owned a gun and a Police ID in his shack, which means he serves the law. He seems to have a good-bad relationship with Semir at first, but later, they become coexistent and cooperative with each other. Sometimes, in a hurry before taking up a chase, he will even take the wheel of Semir's car, using manual shift and scrapping it very few times. Alex also has a relationship with a young boy named Felix Neuberger, who had a few recurring appearances after the pilot episode "The Dark Side". He also appears to have a soft side going with his hardened self, as he shows this with officer Jenny Dorn after the death of Dieter Bonrath.

In "Wind Chimes", Alex met his father, Frank Rickert, who had committed a crime 30 years ago and been in hiding since that. After Frank was killed, Alex broke down completely as he has lost almost every great aspect of his family. This in turn led to his resignation from police, as he is last shown riding his Triumph Thruxton 900 on the autobahn away from the NRW after parting from Semir, intending to go find his mother in Brazil.
