Cast

The official list of cast members were released on 13 December 2016.[6] They include four boys; Alex Leslie, Josh Ritchie, Ross Worswick and Sean Pratt, and four girls: Harriette Harper, Maisie Gillespie, Zahida Allen and ZaraLena Jackson. Ross has previously appeared in the first series of the show whereas Josh featured in the first series of _Love Island_. With the announcement of the line-up it was also confirmed that _Geordie Shore_ star Aaron Chalmers would be arriving on the beach as an ex as well as former _The Only Way Is Essex_ cast member Nicole Bass.

All original cast members arrived at the beach during the first episode and were immediately told to prepare for the arrival of their exes. The first episode also included Zahida's ex-boyfriend Joe McLean arrive on the beach hell-bent on revenge against her, and _The Only Way Is Essex_ star Nicole Bass show up as Josh's ex-fling. Jack Devlin made his debut during the second episode determined to rekindle the relationship with his ex-girlfriend Harriette. He is also Nicole's ex. This episode also featured the shock arrival of Alex's ex-girlfriend Alice Downer who showed up at the villa with no warning. The third episode featured the arrival of _Geordie Shore_ cast member Aaron Chalmers, who arrived at the villa in a helicopter to surprise his ex-one night stand Maisie. The Tablet of Terror also gave Josh the power to send one of his housemates home during this episode, and he chose Alex. Another ex of Nicole's is unearthed during the fourth episode as Adam Oukhellou turns up with the clear intention to cause trouble. During the fifth episode Aaron's ex-girlfriend Becca Edwards arrived with unfinished business, whilst Alice made an unexplained departure from the villa. Jacques Fraser arrives during the sixth episode to patch things with his ex-girlfriend Nicole following rumours that he cheated on her, but he's left sick to his stomach during the seventh episode when the girl he cheated on her with Frankie Isabella arrives on the beach to reveal the whole truth. Zaralena also left the villa during this episode following one too many arguments. Trouble arises when Chanelle McLeary arrives as Josh's ex during the eighth episode, and she's quickly removed from the villa after a violent stand-off with Zahida. Jacques also leaves the villa during this episode when the Tablet of Terror forces Sean into sending somebody home. The penultimate episode featured the arrival of Jenny Thompson, the ex-girlfriend of Josh who turned up to see if he had matured. Maisie's ex-boyfriend Sam Stoddart who arrived on the island. The final episode included the arrival of Taylor Morgan declaring war on her ex-boyfriend Sean.
