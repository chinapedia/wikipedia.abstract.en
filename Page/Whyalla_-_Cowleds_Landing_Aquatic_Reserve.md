__NOTOC__ WHYALLA-COWLEDS LANDING AQUATIC RESERVE is a marine protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located in the waters of Spencer Gulf adjoining the east coast of Eyre Peninsula. About south of Whyalla, it includes land in the localities of Cowleds Landing and Middleback Range which is subject to tidal inundation.[1][2] It was declared in 1984 to protect "the mangrove-seagrass communities and associated fish nursery areas".[3]

Since 2012, it has been located within the boundaries of a 'sanctuary zone' in the Upper Spencer Gulf Marine Park.[4]

The aquatic reserve is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area.[5]
