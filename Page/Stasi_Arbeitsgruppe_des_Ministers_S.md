The WORKING GROUP OF THE MINISTER TASK GROUP "S" (AGM/S) (German: _Arbeitsgruppe des Ministers Aufgabenbereich "S"_) was an elite special operation unit of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic.[1]

Established in the 1970s, the official mission of AGM/S was to combat terrorism with military, police and intelligence methods. However its real mission was to serve as a paramilitary stay-behind organization trained to operate behind enemy lines. Effective 1 April 1988, the AGM/S was renamed "Department XXIII" (anti terrorism) and on 1 March 1989 it was integrated into Department XXII (counter-terrorism).[2] The Stasi was formally disbanded in February 1990.

The long-time head of the AGM/S was Stasi Major General Heinz Stocker, which is the reason for the letter S in the name of the organization. Colonel Günter Rosenow became head of the department XXIII in October 1988, after Stocker's illness-related resignation.[3]

Members of this unit were part of the anti-terrorist component of the Stasi's Guard Regiment "Feliks Dzerzhinsky" and were trained in Erkner on Rügen and in Teupitz. Parachute qualified units of the AGM/S are thought to include 2nd Reconnaissance Company (German: _2. Aufklärungskompanie_) and two Stasi airborne agent units at Erkner, associated with the Dynamo Parachute Team at Rote Helene, Leipzig.[4]

Research in Germany indicates that AGM/S was responsible for providing paramilitary training to the Red Army Faction (RAF). This training included the use of small arms, anti-tank weapons and explosives.[5]
