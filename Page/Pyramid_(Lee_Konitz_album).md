_PYRAMID_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz, pianist Paul Bley and guitarist Bill Connors recorded in 1977 and released on Bley's Improvising Artists label.[1][2][3][4]


Critical reception

Scott Yanow on Allmusic said "due to the free nature of the pieces, the music is less exciting than one might hope. Everyone takes chances in their solos but several of the pieces wander on much too long. Overall this session does not reach the heights one might expect from these great players".[5]
