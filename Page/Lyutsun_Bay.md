LYUTSUN BAY (Russian: _Zaliv Lyutsun_) is a small bay in the western Sea of Okhotsk. To its west lies Uda Gulf, while to its north and east lies the Shantar Sea, and to its south and east Tugur Bay.


Geography and climate

Lyutsun Bay is entered between Capes Mal Dugandzha to the west and Bol Dugandzha to the east. It is 11.3 km (about 7 mi) wide and has heavily wooded shores. Tides are semidiurnal, with springs rising and neaps . Tidal currents reach 3.5 to 4 knots at springs near the entrance of the bay, with the flood current going in a counterclockwise direction round the bay and the ebb in the opposite direction. The bay is sheltered from southwest and southeast winds but exposed to south and northeast winds.[1]
