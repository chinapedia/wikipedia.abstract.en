1-PHENYLETHANOL is the chiral positional isomer of phenethyl alcohol. It is a colorless liquid with a mild gardenia-hyacinth scent.[1]


Natural occurrence

1-Phenylethanol is found in nature as a glycoside, together with its hydrolase Î²-primeverosidase in tea (_Camellia sinensis_) flowers.[2] It is also reportedly present in cranberries, grapes, chives, Scottish spearmint oil, cheeses, cognac, rum, white wine, cocoa, black tea, filbert, cloudberries, beans, mushrooms, and endives.[3]


Synthesis

1-Phenylethanol can be produced as a racemic mixture by the reduction of acetophenone by reducing agents like sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride. Alternatively, benzaldehyde can be reacted with methylmagnesium chloride or similar organometallic compounds to afford racemic 1-phenylethanol.
