Welbeck_Street_Car_Park_01.jpg WELBECK STREET CAR PARK is an architecturally notable car park built in the Brutalist style and is found in Marylebone, just north of Oxford Street, in the City of Westminster, London.[1] The entrance is on the east side in Welbeck Street and it also borders Henrietta Place in the south and Marylebone Lane in the west.

The car park, designed by Michael Blampied and Partners, was completed in 1970 for the use of the nearby Debenhams store using a design of tessellated concrete polygons.[2][3] It was sold in 2016 to Shiva Hotels[4] and is due to be demolished in March 2019 after Historic England decided not to register it as a listed building.[5][6]
