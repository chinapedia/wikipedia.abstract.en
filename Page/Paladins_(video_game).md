_PALADINS: CHAMPIONS OF THE REALM_ is a free-to-play online Hero shooter video game by Hi-Rez Studios. The game was developed by Evil Mojo Games, an internal studio of Hi-Rez, and was released in 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.


Plot

Paladins: Champions of the Realm takes place in a sci-fi fantasy "Dungeonpunk" world. There are elements of both fantasy and science fiction, including medieval-like soldiers who use ranged weapons such as shotguns and assault rifles instead of swords.

In the world of paladins, there is a conflict between two factions; the magistrate and the paladins. Champions were recruited in order to minimize casualties of regular foot soldiers. The champions would be considered "special forces" as they are more efficient at combat than a regular soldier. Not all champions are committed, however. There were a few who did not pick sides during the war, rather they would contract with both, rendering them mercenaries. The rest of these special forces were committed to a faction, either the magistrate or the paladins/resistance. There are also minor factions in the game as well, the "Abyss", the "Thousand Hands" and the "Pyre".


Gameplay

_Paladins_ provides various characters, called Champions, for the players to choose during their gaming sessions. Each of these Champions falls into one of the following categories: Front Line, Damage, Support, and Flank. Being a team-based shooter, players must rely on strategy, character knowledge, coordination, and teamwork in order to attain victory. Players may use VGS, along with text and voice chat to communicate. A good team will have a balanced choice of classes that will support each other during the game.

-   FRONT LINE: Heroes who serve as the anchor of the team, holding the front and protecting their allies. With high health pools and shielding capabilities, Front Line champions excel at blocking enemy fire and disrupting enemy objective captures, they are very effective at zoning out the enemy team after a wipe.
-   DAMAGE: Combat Hero who possess reliable and consistent damage outputs or large burst damage potential. Their damage, coupled with average health pools and decent mobility, make Damage champions ideal for skirmishes and extended firefights.
-   SUPPORT: Champions with high utility and healing abilities, the backbone of any team. Due to their healing capabilities that keep their allies in the fight, Support champions are very valuable allies.
-   FLANK: Champions who excel at traversing the battlefield and getting behind enemy lines, eliminating vulnerable key targets. While most Flank heroes are relatively frail, having lower health pools than any other role, their excellent mobility and self-sustain provide them with the means of escape and survival.

There are 41 champions in _Paladins_,[1] five of which are available from the start for new players to choose between. Additionally, four champions are also temporarily accessible for free on a two-week rotation. Players can permanently acquire additional champions through purchases using in-game currency.

Game modes

There are different gameplay modes for _Paladins_:

-   SIEGE: The 'main' _Paladins_ game mode, two teams race against each other to capture the map's central capture point and, if successful, push a payload that spawns from it to the enemy base. Each successful push or capture grants one point. Preventing the enemy team from pushing the payload also grants one point. The first team to four points wins the game. A team cannot score their fourth point on defense, however, meaning you must capture a point or push the payload to win.
-   ONSLAUGHT: Teams battle over a large combat area in an attempt to take point control and earn points. Along with holding an uncontested presence on the control point, slaying enemy players also scores points for the team, akin to a team deathmatch. Killing an enemy scores the team 5 points, while holding control over the combat area earns the team 1 point per second. The first team to reach 400 points or the team with the most points after 10 minutes wins the game.
-   TEAM DEATHMATCH: A classic game mode in most first-person shooter games, where two teams fight against each other to score kills. The first team to 40 kills wins the game.
-   RANKED: The same game mode as Siege, however when players are choosing a champion, each team can pick two champions to ban, which makes them unavailable for either team. Also, each team can see the opponent’s champions that are picked and selected, and once a champion is picked by any player on a team, the other team can not use that same champion. Depending on the result of a Ranked match, you can gain or lose TP.


Reception

In response to accusations that the game is an _Overwatch_ clone, Hi-Rez COO Todd Harris said that "_Overwatch_ was not the inspiration for _Paladins_", and "the game that deserves the most credit is _Team Fortress 2_".[2]

The game was nominated for "Best Competitive Game" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards.[3][4]
