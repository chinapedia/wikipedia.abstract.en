BRYAN E. ROBINSON is an American writer, psychotherapist, and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte currently living in Asheville, NC. He is a graduate of East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina system and author of two novels and over 35 nonfiction books and Professor of Counseling and Child Development at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for 25 years...[1] At UNC-Charlotte, he conducted the first research studies on children of workaholics and the effects of workaholism on marriage and the family.[2] Robinson is best known for his book, _Chained to the Desk: A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children and the Clinicians Who Treat Them_ (2014, its third edition).[3] He is noted for his identification of two axes for workaholics: work initiation and work completion.[4] He associates the behavior of procrastination with both "Savoring Workaholics" (those with low work initiation/low work completion) and "Attention-Deficit Workaholics" (those with high work initiation and low work completion), in contrast to "Bulimic" and "Relentless" workaholics - both of whom have high work completion. He is widely recognized as being one of the world's leading experts on workaholism.[5] He is also known for developing the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART) a psychometric tool used to measure work addiction used clinically and in research worldwide to identify workaholism.[6] He has lectured on his pioneering research on workaholism and work/life balance across the United States and throughout the world: Sweden, Russia, Norway, Hong Kong, England, Canada, and Australia, and his books have been translated into thirteen languages: Arabic, Korean, Turkish, Hebrew, German, French, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, and Russian.[7]


Work

Robinson's early work included his publications on men in day care, teenage dads, and gay fathers. His interests turned to the field of addiction and recovery. When he realized there was no information on workaholism especially as it related to the family, Robinson and his research team launched a series of studies, the first of their kind, to examine the influence of work addiction on family functioning and to develop an empirical instrument to measure work addiction[8]


Awards

In 1989, during his tenure as Professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Robinson won the First Citizens Scholars Medal given annually to faculty for outstanding scholarship and a distinguished record in research. In 1998 Robinson's research on workaholism and the family was recognized by the American Counseling Association which honored him with the ACA Extended Research Award for conducting high-quality research over an extended period of time in areas of concern and interest to the counseling profession. Among his other honors are several literary awards for his Southern noir debut novel, _Limestone Gumption: A Brad Pope and Sisterfriends Mystery_: The New Apple Book Medal for psychological suspense, the Silver IPPY Award for outstanding mystery of the year; the USA Regional Excellence Book Award for best fiction in the Southeast; and the Bronze Foreword Review Book Award for best mystery[9]
