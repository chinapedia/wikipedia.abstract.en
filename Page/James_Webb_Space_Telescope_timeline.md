It is intended to be a premier observatory of the 2020s, combining the largest mirror yet on a near-infrared space telescope with a suite of technologically advanced instruments from around the world.[1] JWST is expected to cost at least 8.8 billion dollars, including design, construction, and five years of operations (does not include extended mission funding) or International contributions.[2][3] Its likely peak year for funding was probably 2014, when the project used more than US$650 million.[4]

The Telescope is designed to last at least five and half years (six months calibration plus five years science operations), but with a goal of 10 years.[5] The limiting factor is expected to be fuel to maintain its halo orbit, of which there is enough for at least ten years.[6]


Timeline of selected events

-   March 2016, Aft Optics Subsystem installed on OTE.[31]
-   November 2016, JWST construction completed (still needs testing, etc.)[32]
-   January 2017, JWST is fine after experiencing an anomaly during vibration testing in Dec 2016.[33]
-   March 27, 2018, JWST launch delayed to at least May 2020 as issues with the spacecraft element require further testing.[34]
-   June 27, 2018, JWST launch postponed to March 30, 2021 based on recommendations by an Independent Review Board.[35]

Planned

-   2016, OTE tests complete.
-   2017, OTIS tests complete.
-   2017, Spacecraft (inc sunshield) tests complete.
-   2018, Observatory I&T complete.
-   October 2018, planned launch as of 2016.[36]
-   Early 2019, planned launch as of October 2017.[37]
-   May 2020 or later, planned launch as of March 2018.[38]
-   March 30, 2021, planned launch as of June 2018.[39]


After-launch plan

-   After launch it is unfolded in the following planned order.[40]
    -   1) spacecraft appendages (solar arrays, high gain antenna)
    -   2) sunshield
    -   3) extend tower
    -   4) secondary mirror
    -   5) primary mirror
-   For 30 days after launch it takes a million mile trip to L2 halo orbit[41]
-   For six months JWST is prepared for full-time science operation.[42] This includes letting everything cool down, calibrating the mirrors and instruments, etc.[43]
-   Five year science mission starts after six months (planned)[44] (so five and a half years minimum planned)
-   10 years of operation goal, and enough fuel to maintain halo orbit for at least ten years is included.[45]

Nearly a month after launch, a trajectory correction will be initiated to place the JWST into a halo orbit at L2.[46]
