The DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN PARTY (DRP) is a minor political party in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The DRP was announced on 23 August 2012 by founder Anesia Baptiste.

The Democratic Republican Party espouses both a belief in democracy as a means of electing government into office and in republicanism. The party believes that rights and freedoms of all of the people are inalienable or endowed by the Creator God and that the government's function is to protect these liberties of both the majorities who elected it and minorities who did not elect it.

The DRP ran its first slate of six first time candidates for the 9 December 2015 general election.[1] All six of these DRP nominees were political candidates for the first time.[2]
