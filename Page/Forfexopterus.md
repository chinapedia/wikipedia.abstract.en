_FORFEXOPTERUS_ (meaning "scissor wings") is a genus of archaeopterodactyloid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation in China.[1] It contains a single species, _F. JEHOLENSIS._


Description

_Forfexopterus_ would have been large for an archaeopterodactyloid. The skull was low and long, measuring in length; it appears that no crest was present on either jaw. _Forfexopterus_ is unique among archaeopterodactyloids in that the first phalanx bone of the wing finger was shorter than the second but longer than the third. In addition, it exhibits a unique combination of traits: it has in total approximately 120 long, slender teeth, which span from the tip of the jaw to 1/3 along the length of the skull (stopping before the nasoantorbital fenestra); the crest on the sternum, known as the "cristospine", is long; the location where the coracoid attaches to the sternum is further forward on the right side than the left; and the coracoid bears a flange.[2]


Discovery and naming

The holotype specimen of _Forfexopterus_ was discovered by a local farmer, who had partially damaged this specimen while attempting to remove the encasing rock; the specimen was later restored. The specimen, which has the number HM V20, represents a single individual, and consists of a mostly complete skeleton including the skull but missing most of the vertebral column.[3] It was discovered in rocks belonging to the Jiufotang Formation, dating to approximately 120 million years ago (Aptian), and it was described in 2016.[4][5]

The generic name _Forfexopterus_ is derived from Latin _forfex_ ("scissors") and Greek _pterus_ ("wings"); the specific name _jeholensis_ refers to the Jehol region.[6]


Classification

While no phylogenetic analysis was conducted, the authors determined that _Forfexopterus_ was a member of the Archaeopterodactyloidea, on account of the long fourth metacarpal and the reduced fifth metatarsal.[7]
