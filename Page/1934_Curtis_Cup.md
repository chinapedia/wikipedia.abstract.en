The 2ND CURTIS CUP MATCH was played on September 27 and 28, 1934 at the Chevy Chase Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The United States won 6½ to 2½.[1]


Format

The contest was played over two days, with three foursomes on the first day and six singles matches on the second day, a total of 9 points. Matches were over 18 holes.

Each of the 9 matches was worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match was all square after the 18th hole extra holes were not played. Rather, each side earned ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulated at least 5 points won the competition.
