IRAN–THAILAND RELATIONS refer to the bilateral relations between Iran and Thailand. Iran has an embassy in Bangkok while Thailand has an embassy in Tehran.


History

Relations between the two countries began when visits of Persian diplomatic delegations to Siam are attested as early as 1685.[1]

Following the lifting of sanctions in 2016 as a result of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran and Thailand will continue to maintain closer economic relations.[2]

Following the death of Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand on 13 October 2016, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani offered condolences to the Thai people and government in a letter sent to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha saying “the Islamic Republic of Iran always regards Kingdom of Thailand as an age-old friend and partner and hopes to see the expansion of bilateral relations in all fields".[3]


Transport

This comes after AirAsia X introduced that same route.[4][5] The first inauguration flight was launched on 1 October 2016.[6]


State visits

On 8 October 2016, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arrived in Bangkok for the 2nd Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit. President Rouhani met with Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha and discussed economic cooperation between the two countries.


Economic relations

Iran is looking into the Thai rice standard in order to start importing the product as soon as possible, while Thailand targets to export at least 700,000 tonnes of rice to Iran every year. In return, Thailand will start receiving imported crude oil and natural gas from Iran and wants to invest in energy businesses, which includes alternative energy projects.[7]

According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Thailand), trade between Iran and Thailand estimates around $794.46 million.[8] The relationship will also cover food and energy security, with two-way trade set to reach 3 billion USD for the next 5 years, according to the Thai News Agency.


Tourism

Thailand has become a popular destination for Iranian medical tourists.[9] However, due to numerous incidents of methamphetamine smuggling, Iranians coming to Thailand fall under heavy suspicion from police.[10]
