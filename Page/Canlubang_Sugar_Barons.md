The CANLUBANG SUGAR BARONS were a baseball team that played in the now defunct Manila Bay Baseball League. They were the baseball team of the Canlubang Sugar Estate which is also now defunct.[1]

The baseball team was organized by the Yulo family of Canlubang, Laguna who were involved in the sugar industry.[2] During the World War II, when the Japanese occupiers of the Philippines established a baseball league in Manila, the Canlubang Sugar Barons competed under the name "Nan'yō Kōhatsu".[3] The Sugar Barons dominated the Manila Bay Baseball League[4] winning at least seven straight titles under manager, Rodolfo Tingzon.[5] and had their home field in Laguna is the only regulation baseball field in the country at that time other than the Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium.[6]

The team which existed for more than 50 years became defunct when the Manila Bay Baseball League folded in 1979.[7] The Canlubang Sugar Barons also suffered from a significant rise of sugar prices in the world market.[8] Among the team's notable players is national team player, Filomeno Codiñera.
