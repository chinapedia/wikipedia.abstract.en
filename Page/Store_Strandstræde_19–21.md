History

Store_Strandstræde_vintage_photo.jpg Store_Stre_Strandstræde_(Janus_Laurentius_Ridter).jpg ]] Store Strandstræde 19–21 was built by the consortium "Hallandshus" in connection with an expansion of part of Store Strandstræde at no cost for the city. The expansion of the street to a width of 20 Danish alls was adopted by the city council in 1906. The project eas part of a transformation of the old fortified city from "city" to "city centre", a development which was a result of the decommissioning of the city's old fortifications and involved the replacement of old residential buildings with modern commercial properties. It began with Det Københavnske Byggeselskab's construction of Ny Østergade in 1873-76 and was followed by the expansion of Christen Bernikowsstræde, Nygade and Farvergade, and the creation of the Christian IX's Gade neighbourhood. This transformation peaked in 1894–1915.

The new building in Store Strandstræde was designed by Aage Langeland-Mathiesen. Construction began in 1907 and was completed in 1908.[1]
