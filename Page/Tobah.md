TOBAH ( ) is a village and union council of Jhelum District in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. It is part of Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil.[1] Postal Code (ZIP) 49030.[2]

The town merely consisted of small population with a couple of schools and a Basic Health Unit till the end of 90s. However, significance of the town literally enhanced to greater extents after the M2 project completed back in 1997. With the construction of Lillah Exit Toll Plaza, the distances to major cities like Rawalpindi & Lahore simply reduced thus creating grand opportunities for better living of the natives of the town.

The land is generally arid but still teemed with lush green fields which add to the overall beauty of town. Generally the climate is warm, however, temperature falls very low during winters with foggy days and nights. The major crops in the area is wheat, and few vegetables as well. People are hospitable who care for each other. The rate of crime & conflicts is relatively lesser than neighbouring towns thus offering an absolutely peaceful environment. The major occupations of the people are agriculture, employment in armed forces, revenue dept and private shops and business. The level of general awareness is continuously improving which is evident from construction of more and more schools and better results of students. Development has become rapid both on private and official scales and the literacy rate is also gearing up.

It can be well anticipated that the town will soon see greater developments and earn better living standards with sheer devotion of people and blessings of Allah.
