_TIME ZONES_ is an album by electronic musician Richard Teitelbaum and saxophonist Anthony Braxton recorded in 1976 and originally released on the Freedom label.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick stated "The two had a long and fruitful relationship and these pieces give a good idea why: both possessed probing intelligence that enabled them to dig deep into each other's individual musical languages, unearthing surprising common ground as well as acknowledging differences".[4] In JazzTimes Bill Shoemaker wrote "Teitelbaum is in a class by himself when it comes to improvising with synthesizers. His ability to morph from horn-like voice to viscous texture, to melt between foreground and background, and to incite inspired improvisations from Braxton (especially an alto solo at the end of "Crossings," which unravels from desultory lyricism to an eerie reed effect), is thoroughly engaging".[5]
