GUILHEM MOLINIER or MOULINIER ( 1330–50) was a medieval Occitan poet from Toulouse. His most notable work is _Leys d'amors_ ("Laws of Love"), a treatise on rhetoric and grammar. The occasion for its composition was the founding in 1323 of the Consistori de la Sobregaya Companhia del Gay Saber ("Consistory of the Happy Company of the Gay Science") at Toulouse. The consistory consisted of seven members who organized poetic contests and rewarded lyric poems that best imitated the style of the 12th- and 13th-century troubadours. Molinier was not an original member of the consistory, but he was its chancellor in 1348, when he was tasked with codifying the principles of Occitan lyric poetry. In this work he had a collaborator, Marc Bartholomieu. A final version was approved by the consistory in 1356.[1]

Leys_d'amors.jpgThe original _LEYS D'AMORS_ dates to 1328. The archives of the present-day Académie des Jeux floraux (a descendant of the Consistory del Gay Saber) contains a folio copy of this edition under the title by which the work has become known. It contains many subsequently deleted passages and numerous editorial markings. A folio copy of the final and definitive text is also in the archive of the Académie, under the title _Las Flors del gay saber_ ("The Flowers of the Gay Science"). It contains all the deletions, modifications and additions indicated in the unedited 1328 text. This manuscript received a critical edition in 1841–43. A copy of the latter text is also found in the Archives of the Crown of Aragon and a verse edition is found in the National Library of Catalonia. Further copies based on the Catalan manuscripts are found in Paris, Madrid and Toulouse.[2]

The _Leys d'amors_ is divided into five parts. Part I contains some philosophy of language, theory of poetry, epistemology and rules of orthography. Part II deals with rules for versification and the issue of literary genre. Part III is about grammar and contains both classical material borrowed from Donatus, Priscian, Isidore and Alexander de Villa Dei, as well as modern material on the system of declensions in Occitan, the use of articles, the nature of the sentence and semantics. In terms of linguistic varieties, this section recommends the _us acostumat_ ("customary usage") over local customs. Part IV discusses errors (barbarisms and solecisms) and bad verse. Part V covers practical considerations.[3]

The _Leys d'amors_ owes a debt to Brunetto Latini's _Li livres dou Tresor_ and Albertano di Brescia's _Ars loquendi et tacendi_. It was in turn especially influential in Catalonia. Its influence can be seen in Luys d'Averçó's _Torcimany_ and Joan de Castellnou's _Compendi de la coneixança dels vices en els dictats del Gai Saber_. Its influence can even be seen in the Castilian lyrical grammar of Enrique de Villena.[4]
