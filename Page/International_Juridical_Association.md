The INTERNATIONAL JURIDICAL ASSOCIATION (IJA; 1931–1942) was an association of socially minded American lawyers, established by Carol Weiss King[1] and considered by the U.S. federal government (in the form of the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee or HUAC) as "another early (communist) front for lawyers. The principal concern about the IJA (and, as of 1942, its successor group, the National Lawyers Guild or NLG) was that it "constituted itself an agent of a foreign principal hostile to the interests of the United States."[2][3][4]


History

Background

MOPR.jpg (Russian acronym "MOPR")]]

HUAC's account of the IJA traced back to 1922, when the Communist International established the International Red Aid (Russian acronym "MOPR") to:

HUAC's translation: International Red Aid (MOPR) served to protect Comintern ("subversive") agents "whenever they ran into difficulties with the law of the various countries in which they were operating."[5]

In 1925, MOPR had established an American section known as the International Labor Defense (ILD). The ILD functioned until 1946, when it merged into the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), deemed a "new subversive organization" by HUAC.[6]

According to HUAC, the International Juridical Association (IJA) formed in 1931 and "cooperated closely" with the ILD.[7]

Establishment

MKGandhi.jpg.]] The IJA was the brainchild of Carol Weiss King, according to a biography by Ann Fagan Ginger. As Ginger recounts, King decided to take "a trip to Europe" and happened to choose Russia thanks to an ad for "12 thrilling days in the U.S.S.R"[8] (The source happened to appear in the communist literary magazine _New Masses_. Ginger wrongly cites summer of 1932 for the ad's wording, which appeared in the April 1932 issue.[9] However, a similar ad appeared in May 1931 with the lead "To the Soviet Union!" and itinerary therein that matches Ginger's account.[10]) In Moscow, King met American Harry Shapiro, a Harvard Law School graduate, with whom she discussed the ILD and its "Soviet counterpart," the MOPR. "Shapiro urged King to help organize a new association of lawyers" in the States to "fight repression on many fronts" as most MOPR national sections were illegal. He gave her names in Berlin to look up.[11] (Ginger's "trip" narration follows that of the NLG.[12])

Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0527-0001-861,_Carl_von_Ossietzky_vor_der_Strafanstalt_Berlin-Tegel.jpg In Berlin, she met with Dr. :de:Alfred Apfel, head of a new group called the "International Juridical Association". The IJA already had sections in Germany, France,[13] and Austria. Sections fell under an "Organizing Committee" "International Juridical Association," headed by Apfel. Their purpose was to defend civil liberties and labor unions.[14] (The IJA expanded to Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Netherlands, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Venezuela. Members included Mahatma Gandhi.[15][16][17]) A similar brief account of Apfel, Weiss, and formation of the American section of the IJA appears in _The Red Angel: The Life and Times of Elaine Black Yoneda_.[18]

Upon her return to the states, she rented offices for the American section of the IJA in the St. Denis Building at 80 E 11th Street, New York NY 10003. Ginger stated:

  Within a few months, she had forty-nine names from twenty states to put on the letterhead, including not only the customary East Coast liberal names but writer Sherwood Anderson from Virginia, and two each from Tennessee and Louisiana, one each from Canada and Puerto Rico.[19]

Funding ran short, so she moved the IJA's offices into her own at 100 Fifth Avenue.[20]

(King's biography in _The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law_ states only that she came back from Moscow and Berlin to found the _International Juridical Association Bulletin_.[21])

A HUAC report stated that George Anderson had helped found the IJA:

  George Andersen helped to found a "legal bureau" established in response to this directive in the United States in the early 1930s under the name of the International Juridical Association. He served on the national committee of this Communist-controlled offshoot of the International Labor Defense in 1942. In the same year, he was legal adviser for the Committee for Citizenship Rights, which was intended to protect Communist subversion from any penalties under the law.[22]

The report also carefully notes that Anderson was an NOL member, too.[23]

(Both HUAC reports document the close association of the IJA and NLG with the "American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (1934–1952)."[24][25][26])

Merger into NLG

According to report by HUAC on the NLG, the IJA "quietly disappeared from the American scene in the early 1940's" and merged into the NLG. As proof points, HUAC stated that the December 1942 issue of the _International Juridical Association Monthly Bulletin_ announced the journal's merger into NLG's _Lawyers Guild Review_. The December 1942 issue also announced that its writers move to the board of editors of the _Lawyers Guild Review_ and take primary responsibility for the material in its "IJA section.".[27] (_A Catalogue of the Law Collection at New York University: With Selected Annotations_ confirms absorption by 1943.[28])


Issues championed

Approach

From inception, King felt the mission of American branch of the IJA was to champion "civil liberties and labor law problems."[29]

She was very careful in envisioning how it would operate:

  It would not compete with the existing defense groups – the ACLU, the ILD, and the NAACP; on the contrary, it would assist them in their legal defense work. Building on the European models, she planned a legal research group that would hold forums on current legal problems, draft new social legislation, write briefs in pending cases, and publish a monthly legal bulletin on labor and civil rights law.[30]

In 1932, the IJA bulletin announced further that it would support "human rights."[31]

Activities

In 1931, the IJA championed was that of Euel Lee AKA "Orphan Jones" (defended by Bernard Ades when King filed papers with the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Then, the IJA's bulletin wrote a defense of communist August Yokinen against his deportation by the U.S. Government (which followed the Yokinen Show Trial of March 1931).[32]

In 1932, the IJA championed the Scottsboro Boys case before the U.S. Supreme Court by recommending the ILD's Walter Pollak as attorney. Further, it raised two constitutional issues: first, the right to counsel (denied to defendants, it argued) and, second, the right to trial by peers (since fellow African-Americans had been excluded from the jury). In May 1932, King represented the IJA with a delegation of attorneys from Johns Hopkins University and the Union Theological Seminary to investigate violent strikes in Bell County, Kentucky. Following the July 1932 arrest of Angelo Herndon in Atlanta, the IJA bulletin began covering the case, after which King helped research the case when the ILD requested help from the IJA. In the fall of 1932, IJA members King and Brodsky among others supported the presidential candidacy of CPUSA leaders William Z. Foster and James W. Ford. Also in 1932, the IJA began to champion the right of foreigners against deportation by the U.S. Government, starting with its reaction against the Dies Deportation Bill of 1932. In June 1932, U.S. Rep. Fiorello H. La Guardia (20th) introduced an anti-deportation bill based on the IJA's recommendations. In November 1932, the IJA experienced some success when the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the Scottsboro Boys case. In December 1932, King telegrammed President Herbert Hoover and then joined a CPUSA-led Hunger March on Washington (which followed a similar march in the UK earlier that fall).[33][34]

In 1933, King sent a letter of protest to the German embassy regarding the arrest of Apfel by the new Nazi government.[35] The _IJA Monthly Bulletin_ noted his arrest and death, stating that he had been tortured.[36] The IJA helped organize an international campaign for the Nazi government to release Georgi Dimitrov after acquittal for his role in the Reichstag Fire. During that year, King, Nathan Greene, and other IJA members supported the labor cases of Abe Isserman and others by researching and writing complaints and briefs. The IJA responded to a request by defense lawyer Benjamin J. Davis Jr., the IJA agreed to review the brief of Angelo Herndon.[37]

In 1934, King wrote an argument in the IJA bulletin on how to raise constitutional issues during state criminal cases. The IJA then made recommendations in the Angelo Herndon case. They organized to have Columbia University law professor Herbert Wechsler and Whitney North Seymour, former U.S. assistant solicitor general (1931–1931) write briefs. The IJA organized a luncheon in ohonor of Dr. Kurt Rosenfeld, former Prussian Minister of Justice, then in exile from Nazi Germany.[38]

In May 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against appeal on the Angelo Herndon case.[39]

In June 1937, members of the IJA attended an ILD national conference in Washington, DC, to review the Memorial Day massacre of 1937.[40]

In 1939, the IJA supported the United Shoe Workers-CIO against Bata Shoes Company, which had come under Nazi control in 1938.[41]

Criticism: Communism

Chairman_Dies_of_House_Committee_investigating_Un-American_activities.jpg proofs letter replying to FDR (1938)]] In 1939, the Dies Committee began investigating the IJA as part of its investigation into the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

HUAC characterized IJA as "Another early front for [communist] lawyers was the International Juridical Association ... and its members were closely interlocked with the International Labor Defense as well as the National Lawyers Guild (NLG). Among its prominent members was Alger Hiss." It saw the IJA as active defender of Communists in various kinds of lawsuits; it ascertained a pattern of that "consistently followed the Communist Party line." As early as a report of March 29, 1944, HUAC had considered the IJA a communist "front."[77]

In its 1950 report on the NLG (which includes a brief description of the IJA), HUAC cited the "New York City Council Committee Investigating the Municipal Civil Service Committee" (1940–1941), which (according to HUAC) stated:

  The bulletins of the International Juridical Association from its very inception show that it is devoted to the defense of the Communist Party, Communists, and radical agitators and that it is not limited merely to legal research but to sharp criticism of existing governmental agencies and defense of subversive groups.[78]

HUAC noted that "examination of the [IJA monthly] bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career."[79] In a footnote in his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers notes:

  In the early 1930's, Hiss had been a member of the International Juridical Association, of which the late Carol [Weiss] King, a habitual attorney for Communists in trouble, was a moving spirit. The International Juridical Association has been cited as subversive by the Attorney General. Also among its members: Lee Pressman, Abraham Isserman (one of the attorneys for the eleven convicted Communist leaders), Max Loewenthal (sic: should read "Max Lowenthal"), author of a recent book attacking the F.B.I.[80]


Publications

Monthly bulletin

Throughout, the IJA published the _International Juridical Association Monthly Bulletin_, edited by Joseph Kovner and Nathan Greene (AKA "Nuddy" Greene).[81][82][83]

One of the main functions of the bulletin was to mention and cover "little cases" around the country, which made the bulletin a de facto newspaper of record for such.[84]

HUAC's 1950 report on the NLG noted regarding the IJA that "examination of the bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career.[85]

According to the _Encyclopedia of the American Left_, the _IJA Bulletin_ was "widely considered the law journal of the Left."[86]

Early content included the following:

-   1931: Enjoining Free Speech: Review of a number of labor injunction cases (June 1931)

-   1932: The Hosiery Workers Injunction at Nazareth, PA: Decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court; dissenting opinion by Justice Maxey (January 1932)[87]

"The bulletins go free to a mailing list of about 350 persons and organizations."[88]

Archived collections

Thomas_Jefferson_Building_Aerial_by_Carol_M._Highsmith.jpg]] There appears to be no online source for a digitized (OCR) collection of the bulletin.

The Tamiment Library, whose archives include those of the Communist Party of the USA, has no single collection listed only of the IJA's monthly bulletin, although issues and mention appear in scores of other collections of personal papers, photographs, etc.
