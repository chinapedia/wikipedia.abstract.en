The 2017 AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE SEASON was the 121st season of the elite Australian rules football competition and the 28th under the name 'Australian Football League', having switched from 'Victorian Football League' after 1989. There were 18 teams competing in the league, the same as the preceding five seasons. The first game was played on Thursday, 23 March, and the season concluded with the 2017 AFL Grand Final on Saturday, 30 September. Richmond defeated Adelaide in the grand final by 48 points, winning their first premiership since 1980.


Rule changes

The following amendments were made to the Laws of the Game for the 2017 season:[1]

-   Rules relating to around-the-ground ruck contests were amended such that only the nominated ruckman for each team is permitted in the contest, eliminating the option for another player to enter the contest and take the tap, otherwise known as the "third man up" strategy.[2] This was done to make ruck contests easier to adjudicate, to reduce the risk of injuries to ruckmen, and to increase the value of the skill of ruckwork.[3]
-   A more stringent interpretation of deliberate rushed behinds was introduced, by allowing the umpire to consider prior opportunity, distance from the goal line and degree of applied pressure when judging whether or not to pay a free kick.
-   Adjustments were made to the interpretation of high tackles, giving the umpire more discretion to call play-on when he deems that the tackled player is responsible for the high contact. This was introduced to discourage the practice of ducking into a tackle, dropping the knees when tackled or trying to shrug off a tackle to earn a free kick.[4]
-   A more stringent interpretation of punches to the body was introduced to the match review panel and tribunal to allow for suspensions to be imposed; and to allow fines to be imposed for low impact jumper punches.


Pre-season

JLT Community Series

The pre-season series of matches returned in 2017 as the newly renamed JLT Community Series, which featured 27 practice matches played over 25 days, beginning on 16 February and ending on 12 March.

The International Rules Series returned in November 2017, with Australia hosting two test matches. The series was played on an aggregate-points basis, with the winner being the team that scores the highest amount over the two test matches. The matches were played on 12 and 18 November 2017 at Adelaide Oval and Domain Stadium. The Australian team was again composed exclusively of players who have won All-Australian honours in their careers.[124] The times and venues for the series were announced in August.[125]
