KADIATOU KONATÉ is a Malian film director and screenwriter. Her most notable work is _L'Enfant terrible_, an animated short based on African myths. She has also produced several documentaries, often focusing on the issues of women and children in Mali.


Personal history

Konaté was born in Bamako, Mali.[1] Her family, the Konates, were royalty that had once belonged to the Gbara of Old Mali.

She was educated at Cheikh Anta Diop University.[2]


Film career

After leaving university, Konaté worked as a member of the crew on Souleymane Cissé's 1985 classic film _Yeelen_.[3] In 1989 she wrote the screenplay for the short animated film _La Geste de Ségou_, directed by fellow Malian Mambaye Coulibaly.[4] Her first credited solo work is listed as the documentary _Des Yeux Pour Pleurer_ (Crying Eyes), shot on video in 1992.[5] Konaté followed this with a second documentary, also shot on video, _Circulation Routiere_ (_Traffic_), co-directed with Kabide Djedje.[6] In 1993 she produced three short films, the most notable of which was _L'Enfant terrible_ (_The Terrible Child_), co-produced with the Belgian workshop Graphoui.[7] _L'Enfant terrible_, which is based upon a Central African myth, is, like _La Geste de Ségou_, an animated story that used puppets.[8] It follows a benevolent spirit, a child which is born with teeth and the ability to talk and walk, who finds its older brother and begins an unusual journey.[9] It remains her most highly acclaimed work.[10]

Konaté followed her short films by returning to documentaries, releasing _Femmes et Développement_ in 1995.[11] _Femmes et Développement_ makes comparison between women in Mali from different socioeconomic groups. The film looks at what has been accomplished by women in her country and what still needs to be accomplished.[12] In 1998 she directed _Un mineur en milieu carcéral_, a short documentary which explored the plight of children who have been incarcerated, often for minor offenses.[13]

Her 2008 documentary _Daman Da_ (_Yellow Mirage_), follows the day-to-day lives of gold miners in Mali. She was drawn to the topic after watching a local news report on the subject.[14] The film showed the difficulties faced by the miners, working in crude conditions, but also the honesty and work ethic they displayed.[15]
