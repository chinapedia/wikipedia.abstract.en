_COLORADO V. BERTINE_, 479 U.S. 367 (1987), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the State from proving charges with the evidence discovered during an inventory search.[1]

This case is controlled by the principles governing inventory searches of automobiles and of an arrestee's personal effects, as set forth in _South Dakota v. Opperman_,[2] and _Illinois v. Lafayette_,[3] rather than those governing searches of closed trunks and suitcases conducted solely for the purpose of investigating criminal conduct. _United States v. Chadwick_,[4] and _Arkansas v. Sanders_,[5] distinguished.[6]
