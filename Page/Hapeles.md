_HAPELES_ ( â€“ The Leveler) is a Hebrew-language daily newspaper published in Jerusalem. Like other Haredi newspapers, it is not published on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), but instead is put out as an expanded weekend edition.

_Hapeles_ was founded through the encouragement of Shmuel Auerbach, leader of the Jerusalem Faction, an Israeli-Haredi political organisation.


History

_Hapeles_ is a continuation of the ideology underlying line adopted by the founders of the newspaper _Yated Ne'eman_. _Yated Ne'eman_ was part of a broad initiative to create communal organizations to serve the Lithuanian Torah community. _Yated Ne'eman_ rejected secular life and displayed an ambivalent attitude towards the State of Israel and Zionism. They recognized them as a de facto political entity, but denied that Zionism was the destiny of the Jewish people. Instead the newspaper emphasized pious observance of the mitzvot of the Torah and Jewish law.

In 2012 the paper was taken over by more moderate ultra-Orthodox elements. The CEO, the editor-in-chief and some of its guiding rabbinical board members (the "spiritual committee"), who were considered to represent the more strict ideological line, were fired during the changes. _Hapeles_ was created to continue the original direction of _Yated Ne'eman_. The dismissed CEO and chief editor were appointed to those positions on the new paper.

Campaign against recruitment of haredim

Hapeles leads an extensive campaign against recruitment of haredim to Israel Defense Forces.[1] As a result, it faced criticism from the Israeli government, including Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman.[2]

Suspicion of criminal activity

In April 2017, _Hapeles_ editors were arrested and all the computers in the newspaper's HQ were confiscated. The charge was illegal efforts to get large companies in Israel to advertise in the newspaper.[3] However, the newspaper claimed that the charges against it were a government persecution, due to his activity against the recruitment of Haredim. The claims relied on controversial quotations of Eli Ben-Dahan, Israeli deputy minister of defence[4]
and Roni Alsheikh, the chief of Israeli police.[5]
