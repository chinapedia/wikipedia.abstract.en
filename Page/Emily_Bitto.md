EMILY BITTO is an Australian writer. Her debut novel _The Strays_ won the 2015 Stella Prize for Australian women's writing.[1]


Biography

Bitto was shortlisted for the Prize for an Unpublished Manuscript for an emerging Victorian Writer at the 2013 Victorian Premier's Literary Awards, for the manuscript of her debut novel, _The Strays_. The novel was subsequently published by Affirm Press in March 2014.

_The Strays_ is a fictionalisation of the 1930s group of Australian artists known as the Heide Circle. Bitto has said that she "tried to capture (...) the romance and excitement of that circle; the sense of the new that stirred the stale waters of outer Melbourne when a group of artists came together to work and live side by side, to buck the establishment and create their own small utopia within the confines of an old house and a large, thriving garden."[2]

_The Age_ described it as "an eloquent portrayal of the damage caused by self-absorption as well as a moving study of isolation".[3] It was awarded the $50,000 2015 Stella Prize for the best book of fiction or nonfiction by an Australian woman. The Stella Prize judges described _The Strays_ as "like a gemstone: polished and multifaceted, reflecting illuminations back to the reader and holding rich colour in its depths."[4]

_The Strays_ has been published in the UK (Legend Press), U.S. (Twelve Books) and Canada (Penguin). It was a New York Times Book Review editor's pick, and received favourable reviews from NPR and the New Yorker.

Bitto attended the University of Melbourne where she earned a masters in literary studies and a PhD in creative writing. She lives in Melbourne, where she co-owns and runs the Carlton wine-bar Heartattack and Vine, which she opened with her partner and two friends in late 2014.[5]
