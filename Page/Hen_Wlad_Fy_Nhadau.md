"HEN WLAD FY NHADAU" () is the national anthem of Wales.[1] The title – taken from the first words of the song – means "Old Land of My Fathers" in Welsh, usually rendered in English as simply "LAND OF MY FATHERS". The words were written by Evan James and the tune composed by his son, James James, both residents of Pontypridd, Glamorgan, in January 1856.[2][3] The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the National Library of Wales.[4]


Origins

_Glan Rhondda_ (Banks of the Rhondda), as it was known when it was composed, was first performed in the vestry of the original Capel Tabor, Maesteg (which later became a working men's club), in either January or February 1856, by Elizabeth John from Pontypridd, and it soon became popular in the locality.[5]

James James, the composer, was a harpist who played his instrument in the public house which he ran, for the purpose of dancing.[6] The song was originally intended to be performed in 6/8 time, but had to be slowed down to its present tempo when it began to be sung by large crowds.


Popularity

The popularity of the song increased after the Llangollen festival of 1858. Thomas Llewelyn of Aberdare won a competition for an unpublished collection of Welsh airs with a collection that included _Glan Rhondda_. The adjudicator of the competition, "Owain Alaw" (John Owen, 1821–83) asked for permission to include _Glan Rhondda_ in his publication, _Gems of Welsh melody_ (1860–64). This volume gave _Glan Rhondda_ its more famous title, "Hen wlad fy nhadau", and was sold in large quantities and ensured the popularity of the anthem across the whole of Wales.[7]

At the Bangor Eisteddfod of 1874 "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" gained further popularity when it was sung by Robert Rees ("Eos Morlais"), one of the leading Welsh soloists of his day.[8] It was increasingly sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.[9]

"Hen wlad fy nhadau" was also one of the first Welsh-language songs recorded when Madge Breese sang it on 11 March 1899, for the Gramophone Company, as part of the first recording in the Welsh language.[10][11]

In 1905, "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" became the first national anthem to be sung at the start of a sporting event.[12][13] Although crowds singing anthems during matches was commonplace, there was no precedent for the anthem to be sung before a game commenced in any sport. The Welsh national rugby team were playing host to the first touring New Zealand team, who to that point were unbeaten. After Wales won the Triple Crown in the 1905 Home Nations Championship the match was dubbed the 'Game of the Century' by the press. The New Zealand team started every match with the Haka, and Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams, suggested that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in the singing of the anthem as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in,[14] and Wales became the first nation to sing a national anthem at the start of a sporting event.[15]

In 1978 as part of their album, also called "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", Geraint Jarman a'r Cynganeddwyr recorded a version of the Welsh national anthem using electric guitars, inspired by Jimi Hendrix's rendition of the _Star-Spangled Banner_. Jarman's version, played by Welsh guitarist Tich Gwilym is one of the most famous modern versions of the song.[16]


Usage

Tradition has established "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" as an unofficial Welsh anthem[17] since 1905, when it was first sung by fans at rugby games, although the official anthem at the time was "God Bless the Prince of Wales". "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" slowly established itself as the more popular anthem over the next four decades, and was sung along with "God Bless the Prince of Wales" and "God Save the Queen" before sporting events until 1975, when sports officials decided that "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" should be sung alone. Like other British anthems, it has not been established as a national anthem by law, but it has been used as a national anthem at official governmental ceremonies, including the opening of the Welsh Assembly, and at receptions of the British monarchy since the 1970s.[18][19] It is recognised and used as an anthem at both national and local events in Wales.

Usually this will be the only anthem sung: only the first stanza and chorus are usually sung (and in the Welsh language). _God Save the Queen_, the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" during official events with a royal connection.[20]

The existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country. In 1993 the newly appointed Secretary of State for Wales John Redwood was embarrassingly videotaped opening and closing his mouth during a communal singing of the national anthem, clearly ignorant of the words but unable to mime convincingly;[21] the pictures were frequently cited as evidence of his unsuitability for the post. According to John Major's autobiography, the first thing Redwood's successor William Hague said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words. He found Ffion Jenkins, and later married her.[22]

"Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" has been adapted to the anthems of Cornwall (_Bro Goth agan Tasow_), Brittany (_Bro Gozh ma Zadoù_),[23] and Y Wladfa (_Gwlad Newydd y Cymry_, see below). These adaptions share the same tune as "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" and have similar lyrics.


Lyrics

Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi, Gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri; Ei gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mad, Dros ryddid collasant eu gwaed.

    Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad.
    Tra môr yn fur i'r bur hoff bau,
    O bydded i'r hen iaith barhau.

Hen Gymru fynyddig, paradwys y bardd, Pob dyffryn, pob clogwyn, i'm golwg sydd hardd; Trwy deimlad gwladgarol, mor swynol yw si Ei nentydd, afonydd, i fi.

Os treisiodd y gelyn fy ngwlad tan ei droed, Mae hen iaith y Cymry mor fyw ag erioed, Ni luddiwyd yr awen gan erchyll law brad, Na thelyn berseiniol fy ngwlad.

Translations

_Verse translation by A.P. Graves_[24]

O Land of my fathers, O land of my love, Dear mother of minstrels who kindle and move, And hero on hero, who at honour's proud call, For freedom their lifeblood let fall.

    Wales! Wales! O but my heart is with you!
    As long as the sea your bulwark shall be,
    To Cymru my heart shall be true.

O land of the mountains, the bard's paradise, Whose precipice, valleys are fair to my eyes, Green murmuring forest, far echoing flood Fire the fancy and quicken the blood

For tho' the fierce foeman has ravaged your realm, The old speech of Wales he cannot o'erwhelm, Our passionate poets to silence command, Or banish the harp from your strand.

_Verse translation by W.S. Gwynn Williams_[25]

The land of my fathers is dear to me, Old land where the minstrels are honoured and free; Its warring defenders so gallant and brave, For freedom their life's blood they gave.

    Home, home, true I am to home,
    While seas secure the land so pure,
    O may the old language endure.

Old land of the mountains, the Eden of bards, Each gorge and each valley a loveliness guards; Through love of my country, charmed voices will be Its streams, and its rivers, to me.

Though foemen have trampled my land 'neath their feet, The language of Cambria still knows no retreat; The muse is not vanquished by traitor's fell hand, Nor silenced the harp of my land.

_A more literal translation:_

The old land of my fathers is dear to me, Land of bards and singers, famous men of renown; Her brave warriors, very splendid patriots, For freedom shed their blood.

    Nation [or country], Nation, I am faithful to my Nation.
    While the sea [is] a wall to the pure, most loved land,
    O may the old language [_sc._ Welsh] endure.

Old mountainous Wales, paradise of the bard, Every valley, every cliff, to my look is beautiful. Through patriotic feeling, so charming is the murmur Of her brooks, rivers, to me.

If the enemy oppresses my land under his foot, The old language of the Welsh is as alive as ever. The muse is not hindered by the hideous hand of treason, Nor [is] the melodious harp of my country.


Cultural influence

]] The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas is often quoted as saying "The land of my fathers. My fathers can have it!" in reference to Wales. However, this is misleading, as it was a villainous character in one of Thomas' short stories that spoke this line.

Gwynfor Evans named his history of Wales _Land of my fathers: 2,000 years of Welsh history_. It was a translation of the Welsh original, _Aros Mae_.

The £1 coins minted in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 with a Welsh emblem on the reverse, also bear the edge inscription PLEIDIOL WYF I'M GWLAD ("I am devoted to my country"), from the refrain of "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau".[26] The new Royal Badge of Wales adopted in 2008 features this motto.


_Gwlad Newydd y Cymry_

A version of "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" was written by Lewis Evans, a migrant from Wales to Y Wladfa, a Welsh-speaking settlement in Patagonia, South America. The version penned by Evans is called _Gwlad Newydd y Cymry_ (The New Country of the Welsh). _Gwlad Newydd y Cymry_ is played to the same tune as "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau".[27]

The lyrics to _Gwlad Newydd y Cymry_ are as follows (note that the spelling is not consistent with modern Welsh):

Lyrics

Y mae Patagonia yn annwyl i mi, Gwlad newydd y Cymry mwyneiddlon yw hi; Anadlu gwir ryddid a gawn yn y wlad, O gyrhaedd gormesiaeth a brad:

    Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad,
    Tra haul y nen uwchben ein pau,
    O! bydded i'r Wladfa barhau.

Bu'r Cymry yn gorwedd dan ddirmyg yn drwch, Wel, diolch am Wladfa i'n codi o'r llwch; Ein heniaith a gadwn mewn urddas a bri, Tra'r Gamwy'n ddysgleiriol ei lli:

    (chorus)

'Chaiff Cymro byth mwyach ymostwng i Sais,- Terfynodd ei orthrwm - dystawyd ei lais; Y Wladfa fawrygwn tra'r Andes wen fawr, A'i choryn yn 'stafell y wawr:

    (chorus)

Translation

Patagonia is dear to me, The new land of the noble Welsh people; True freedom we breathe in our new country, Far from the reach of oppression and betrayal:

    Nation [or country], Nation, I am faithful to my Nation.
    While the sun rises above the land,
    Oh! may the Settlement continue.

The Welsh have been lying broken in scorn, Well, thanks to the _Wladfa_ from dust we're reborn; Our language of old we laud and esteem While Camwy flows with shining stream:

    (chorus)

Let Welshman submit to the English no more, Their oppression is ended, and silenced their roar; _Y Wladfa_ we praise while the great white Andes, With its peak in the chamber of dawn:

    (chorus)
