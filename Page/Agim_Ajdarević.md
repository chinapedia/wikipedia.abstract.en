AGIM AJDAREVIĆ (, born 7 May 1969) is a former Kosovo Albanian, footballer.


Career

He started playing in Serbian ower-league sides FK Ozren Sokobanja and FK Radnički Pirot.[1] Then, he played with Serbian side FK Radnički Niš in the 1988–89 Yugoslav First League,[2] then with Serbian/Kosovar side KF Liria in the 1989–90 Yugoslav Second League,[3] then with Serbian side FK Sloboda Užice in the 1990–91 Yugoslav Second League,[4][5] and finally with Serbian side FK Spartak Subotica in the 1991–92 Yugoslav First League.[6]

In 1992, while on hollydays in Sweden, Yugoslav War started and Ajdarević family decided to stay.[7] Several Swedish clubs were interested in signing him, but, since he had professional contract with Spartak Subotica, any club would need to pay a transfer-fee. Falkenbergs FF went ahead and Agim Ajdarević in the following years scoored 105 goals in 175 gams for FFF.[8] His sons, Astrit Ajdarević born in 1990, Arben Ajdarević born in 1995, and Alfred Ajdarević born in 1998, also became footballers.[9]


Personal life

According to Albanian press, the family real surname was Hajdari but Agim switched it to "Ajdarević".[10]
