The IMMACULATE CONCEPTION CATHEDRAL[1] () Also APATZINGÁN CATHEDRAL[2][3] It is a Catholic temple in the city of Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico. Is a modernist building and is the headquarters of the Diocese of Apatzingán. It was built in the second half of the 20th century.

Before the present building, there was another of simple proportions, possibly raised in the sixteenth century. The old building, of adobe and stone, consisted of a single nave that supported a roof of two waters covered by tile. The cover, very simple, was composed by an arc of half point, finished off by a cornice and a small window in the choir. On the right side, the bell tower, three bodies and cupulin, stood, which had a clock.

At the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century, and with the growth of the city and the need for greater space for parishioners, it was decided to demolish the previous construction to build a new work that was in line with the ideal of progress that Predominated in the region. It was decided to build it in modernist style that was in vogue back then.

The new building was raised to the rank of cathedral on July 24, 1962 with the creation of the Diocese of Apatzingán.
