Career

Di Yorio's youth career started at the age of four when he joined the ranks at Talleres, he remained with them until 2010 when he moved to join Kimberley's youth team.[3] A further five years later he departed to join Argentine Primera División club Aldosivi's reserves.[4] He was promoted into Aldosivi's first-team a year later in 2016 and made his debut on 10 April against Racing Club, he played thirty-four minutes and picked up a card in the process. One more league appearance and one in the Copa Argentina followed for Di Yorio in 2016.[5][6] He didn't make a first-team appearance in 2016–17 as Aldosivi were relegated to the second tier.[7]

On 6 March 2019, Di Yorio signed for Ecuadorian Serie B side L.D.U. Portoviejo on loan.[8][9] He scored his first senior goal with the club, converting a penalty in a 1–0 win over Independiente Juniors on 6 April.[10]
