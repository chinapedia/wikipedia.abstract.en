Morphogenic_digital_art_exhibition_by_Andy_Lomas_at_Watermans_Arts_Centre,_London.jpg Creations'' digital art exhibition by Andy Lomas at Watermans Arts Centre, west London, in 2016.[1]]] Morphogenic_sculpture_by_Andy_Lomas.jpg ANDY LOMAS (born 1967 in Welwyn Garden City, England[2]) is a British artist with a mathematical background, formerly a television and film CG supervisor and more recently a contemporary digital artist,[3] with a special interest in morphogenesis using mathematical morphology.[4]

Lomas previously worked on visual effects using computer graphics (CGI) for television and films such as _The Matrix Reloaded_ (2003), _The Matrix Revolutions_ (2003) and _Avatar_ (2009).[5] before becoming a digital artist. In 2006 he appeared in _The Tech of 'Over the Hedge_', a short documentary.[6] With his collaborators, in 1999 Lomas won the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards _Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries or a Movie_ for the 1999 film _Alice in Wonderland_.

Lomas's works are displayed in the form of videos, still images, and sculptures, produced using a mathematical programming approach. Some works include collaborative music, by Max Cooper for example.[7] His artworks are inspired by the work of Ernst Haeckel, D'Arcy Thompson, and Alan Turing.[8][9]

Lomas won the 2014 international Lumen Prize _Gold Award_ for digital art, the top category.[10] He has exhibited at the Butler Institute of American Art (Youngstown, Ohio, USA), the Computing Commons Art Gallery (Arizona State University), the Los Angeles Center for Digital Art, and SIGGRAPH.[11]

In Juneâ€“July 2016, Lomas held a solo exhibition of his work at the Watermans Arts Centre in west London,[12] which has been acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum for its collection.[13] His work is also held in the D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum art collection at the University of Dundee in Scotland, funded by the UK Art Fund.[14]

By way of summarizing his technique, Lomas counts himself among those who have entered into a "hybrid" relationship with the computer, wherein the latter is used to quickly generate a series of visual images based on an original idea or algorithm.[15]
