CARRICKNAGAT MEGALITHIC TOMBS are megalithic tombs and a National Monument located in County Sligo, Ireland.[1]


Location

Carricknagat is located halfway between Ballygawley and Ballintogher, near a source of the Ballisodare River.[2]


History

Carricknagat tombs were built c. 4000–2500 BC, in the Neolithic.

The name means "the cats' stone" or "the pine martens' stone;" ancient monuments are often said to be haunted by wild animals, possibly representing the spirits of the dead.[3]
