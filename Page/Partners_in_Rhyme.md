_LEN GOODMAN'S PARTNERS IN RHYME_ is a British television series hosted by Len Goodman,[1] which began airing on 19 August 2017 on BBC One. The show was created by Matt Edmondson and was made by Panda TV and AOP for the BBC.[2][3][4] The show involved guessing rhymes from animated scenes (by company Creative Nuts) shown to the contestants; the two contestants were paired up with two celebrities and whoever had the most points went through to the final round to win a holiday.


Reception

The show received generally poor reviews from critics. Stuart Heritage writing in _The Guardian_ described it as "a terrible toddler's drawing of a show" and a "fermented kaleidoscope of dung".[5]
