Format

Over the course of 30 days one unsuspecting member of the public is secretly filmed with hidden cameras. A team of tv-makers takes control over every aspect of this person’s life. After one month of extraordinary and bizarre experiences he unknowingly walks into a TV-studio to play the gameshow of his life.[2]

The situations are set up by family members, friends, colleagues, and abetted by Flemish celebrities. After one month the person is lured into a television studio where it is revealed that almost everything that happened during the last month was a setup.The candidate then participates in a quiz based on the events, with the opportunity of winning prizes. The more questions they can answer correctly, the more prizes they win.[3]


Rounds

Round 1 – True to your word: Some months previously, the candidate is advised they have been chosen for the preselection of a new TV show (a fake one set up for the purpose). Some days after attending the preselection interview, the candidate receives a letter stating that he was not selected for the show. During the pre-selection, the candidates are asked many questions regarding behavior, and how they would react to certain situations. The person is later tested to see if they do behave as claimed.

Round 2 – You should know this: The candidate must give answers for questions to which the solution has been clearly given during the last month.

Round 3 – Who Knows: Three people must estimate what the candidate did in various humorous situations.

Round 4 – True Story: The candidate gets a list of three bizarre scenarios and must guess which one really occurred.

Round 5 – The last chance: The candidate gets one minute to answer True or False questions about events that happened during the show.
