Orange and Lemons (1999–2007)

Orange & Lemons were officially formed in 1999. The band originally consisted of Mcoy Fundales on vocals, Clem Castro on guitars, Law Santiago on bass and Michael Salvador on drums. The band started doing cover songs from their influenced artists, The Beatles and The Smiths. The band were managed by Bong Baluyot.

Sometime in early 2000s Mcoy Fundales and Clem Castro met brothers Ace and JM del Mundo in a local bar in Bulacan. The two replaced original members Law Santiago and Michael Salvador who left the group and filled the full-time duties for bass and drums. The band later recorded their new songs and released their debut album _Love in the Land of Rubber Shoes and Dirty Ice Cream_ in 2003 under Terno Recordings.

In October 2004 Orange & Lemons signed a contract Universal Records. The band proceeded to record a new album; their second and first under a major label. Strike Whilst The Iron Is Hot was completed and released in June 2005, with singles including "Hanggang Kailan (Umuwi Ka Na Baby)", "Heaven Knows (This Angel Has Flown)" and "Lihim". One of the band's biggest breaks came with an offer from Philippine media giant ABS-CBN for Orange and Lemons to do the jingle/soundtrack for a new series Pinoy Big Brother, the Philippine franchised version of the reality TV show Big Brother. Orange and Lemons came up with a song called "Pinoy Ako".


Kenyo and solo activities (2007–present)

After weeks of speculation, it was reported on October 10, 2007 by Inquirer News that Orange and Lemons had disbanded. The reason stated was primarily due to differences between band members and their managers. The three remaining members later formed a new band called Kenyo.[5] The band released their debut album, Radiosurfing, in 2008.[6]

On May 24, 2014, it was announced that Fundales would be taking part in the third Philippine Popular Music Festival interpreting the song "Kung Aking Ang Langit" alongside singer Clara Benin, daughter of former Side A bassist Joey Benin. On July 26, the entry won the Spinnr People's Choice award.[7]
