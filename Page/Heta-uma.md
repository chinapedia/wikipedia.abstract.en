_HETA-UMA_ ( or ) is a Japanese underground manga movement started in the 1970 decade with the magazine _Garo_.[1] _Heta-uma_ can be translated as "bad but good", designating a work which looks poorly drawn, but with an aesthetically conscious quality, opposed to the polished look of mainstream manga.

Some of _heta-uma_'s main artists are Teruhiko Yumura (pen name "King Terry"),[2] Yoshikazu Ebisu[3] and Takashi Nemoto.[4]
