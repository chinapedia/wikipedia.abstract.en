Professional career

Minor leagues

Maton was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 20th round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft.[2] He made his professional debut that year with the Short Season-A Tri-City Dust Devils.[3] In 23 relief appearances, Maton pitched to a 4–2 win–loss record, 1.38 earned run average (ERA), and 58 strikeouts in 32 innings pitched.[4] In 2016, Maton pitched for the Class-A Fort Wayne TinCaps, Advanced-A Lake Elsinore Storm, and Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas.[5] He made a total of 38 appearances for the three teams, and posted a 5–3 record, 1.74 ERA, and 78 strikeouts in 51 innings.[6] After the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League for the Peoria Javelinas.[7] Maton began the 2017 season with Triple-A El Paso.[8]

San Diego Padres

On June 11, 2017, Maton was called up by the Padres after Jake Esch was designated for assignment.[9] Maton remained with the big league club for the rest of the season, pitching in a middle relief role. He finished the season with a 4.19 ERA and 46 strikeouts in 43 innings over 46 games.

Maton started 2018 with Triple-A El Paso, but was quickly recalled to the majors when Wil Myers went to the disabled list on April 4.[10] On May 13, Maton went to the DL with a strained lat and returned to the team on June 21 after a rehab assignment.[11] He was quickly optioned to Triple-A on June 24, but recalled again on July 9 after posting a sub-1.00 WHIP in six appearances in El Paso.[12] Maton stayed with the Padres for the remainder of the year, again pitching in middle relief. For the season, he had a 4.37 ERA and 55 strikeouts in 47 innings. Maton's walk rate rose in 2018, and he was less effective after returning from his injury, posting a 0.56 ERA in his 16 innings before going on the DL and a 6.32 ERA with the Padres afterwards.[13]

Cleveland Indians

On July 12, 2019, Maton was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for international bonus pool allotments.[14]
