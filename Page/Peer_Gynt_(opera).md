_PEER GYNT_ is a 1938 opera by Werner Egk to a libretto after the play _Peer Gynt_ by Henrik Ibsen. The premiere took place on 24 November 1938 at the Berliner Staatsoper where Egk was the conductor at the time.[1]

The opera was controversial in the Nazi press. This criticism was quashed when Adolf Hitler, an attendee at the performance, allegedly approved of the work.[2] Despite Stravinsky-like music, the premiere met the approval of Joseph Goebbels, which has since tainted both the opera and composer. The opera was not performed in the Third Reich after 1940.
