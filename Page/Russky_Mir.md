_RUSSKY MIR_ (, Russian World)[1] was a daily Russian newspaper published in Saint Petersburg in 1871-1880. Its publishers Mikhail Chernyayev, Vissarion Komarov, Pavel Viskovatov, and Fyodor Berg were also its co-editors, alongside Dmitry Stakheyev and later Evgeny Rapp.[2]

Launched on 1 September 1871 by the army general Mikhail Chernyayev who'd just left the Ministry of Defense in defiantly anti-reformist mood, it was originally a conservative publication. Regarded as the stronghold of the 'Old Russia party', its position "could be seen as parallel to that of the British Tories of the time... What it opposed apparently were not the Alexander II's reforms as such, but the fact that the landowners and the gentry had been denied the leading role in the new developments," the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary argued.[3]

In 1877, as Evgeny Rapp became its editor-in-chief, the newspaper took a more liberal stance, with Semyon Vengerov and Nikolai Minsky becoming its active contributors and Ludwig Slonimsky taking charge of the foreign policy section. It started to publish literary supplements, then merged with _Birzhevoy Vestnik_ (_Stock Exchange Herald_) and in January 1880 changed its name to _Birzhevye Vedomosti_ (_Stock Exchange News_).[4]
