PUBLIUS CURIATIUS FISTUS TRIGEMINUS,[1] or PUBLIUS HORATIUS PULVILLUS,[2][3] was a Roman politician in the 5th century BC, consul in 453 BC, and decemvir in 451 BC.


Family

He was named _Publius Curiatius_ by Livy, but _Publius Horatius_ by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, which nevertheless confirms Livy's as fact. Diodorus Siculus himself only gives _Trigeminus_. He could have been part of the _gens Horatii_ and not in that of the _Curiatii_, two _gentes_ that had opposed each other during the Roman monarchy in the fight of the Horatii and the Curiatii.

If he was part of the _gens Curiatii_, he was the only member of the family to become consul.


Biography

Consulship

In 453 BC, he was consul with Sextus Quinctilius Varus. Rome was ravaged this year by a famine and an epidemic, which killed animals as well as people. It is thought to have been typhus, an epidemic that raged on for ten or more years.[4] His colleague, Varus, and the consul suffect that replaced him both caught the disease that same year.

_Decemvirate_

In 451 BC, he was part of the First Decemvirate which wrote the ten first tables of the Law of the Twelve Tables.[5][6][7]
