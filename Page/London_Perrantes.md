LONDON TYUS PERRANTES (born October 3, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for Cholet Basket of the French LNB Pro A. He played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers.


High school career

Perrantes attended Crespi Carmelite High School, where he was coached by Russell White. Perrantes developed his signature calm, deliberate playing style after competing against older players. He was noticed by Washington State football player Nico Grasu, who alerted the university's basketball coach, Tony Bennett. When Bennett was hired by Virginia, Perrantes committed to play for him, turning down an offer from USC after Kevin O'Neill was released as coach.[1] As a senior, he averaged 19.9 points and 5.8 assists per game and was named L.A. Daily News Player of the Year and L.A. Times All-Area First Team. He was ranked No. 86 on ESPN's Top 100 recruiting list for 2013.[2]

As a freshman, Perrantes led Virginia to the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16 for the first time in 19 years while starting 33 games and shooting 44% from behind the arc.[3] On the season, he averaged 5.5 points and a team-high 3.8 assists per game. He was suspended the first game of his sophomore season for violating undisclosed team rules.[4] He scored a career-high 26 points in a match against Miami on January 1, 2015.[5] Perrantes broke his nose and suffered a mild concussion after colliding with Malcolm Brogdon in a win against Florida State on February 22.[6] He averaged 6.4 points and 4.6 assists per game as a sophomore, leading the Cavaliers to a 30-4 record and second straight Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title.[7]

As a junior, Perrantes became more of a vocal leader on the team, identifying himself as the player who picked the team up when it was dragging.[8] He hit a career-high seven three-pointers to go along with 22 points in a loss to Virginia Tech on January 4, 2016.[9] Perrantes scored 16 points with four 3-pointers in a 73-65 win against Syracuse on January 24.[10] Perrantes averaged 11.0 points, 4.4 assists and 3.0 rebounds per game, shooting 43.9 percent from the field, 48.8 percent from 3-point range and 80.3 percent from the free-throw line. He was named honorable mention All-ACC by the media and coaches.[11] "He just stirred the pot," coach Bennett said of Perrantes in 2016. "He made everything kind of work out. He got guys the ball. He understood it."[12]

As a senior, Perrantes was named to the Second Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference.[13] His season ended with a 65-39 loss to Florida in the NCAA Tournament. Perrantes averaged 12.7 points and 3.8 assists per game. He tied a program record with 138 games played and scored 1,225 points in his Virginia career.[14]
