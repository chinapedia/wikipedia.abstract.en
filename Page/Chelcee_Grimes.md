Career

Music career

Grimes' first songwriting success came with "Million Miles", a song she co-wrote for Kylie Minogue with Danish producers Cutfather, inspired by being away from her family. She recalls:

  ‘I just sang ‘I feel like I’m a million, million, million, feel like I’m a million miles away ...’ And that was the hook. I could have chosen any subject, they just played me the track they’d built for her sound and asked for lyrics and a top line, but that was what came to me.’ [5]

Chelcee is a performer signed to RCA Records. In June 2018 Chelcee released her debut single 'Just Like That'. The music video uploaded to YouTube gained over 100,000 views within 24 hours.

In 2014 she won "Best up and coming new act" at the Juice FM Style Awards.[6]


Football career

Chelcee's football career started when she began playing for Liverpool Ladies aged 10.[7] Since then, she has played for Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Tranmere Rovers, and is currently playing as a forward for Fulham Ladies.[8][9]
