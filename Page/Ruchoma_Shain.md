Biography

Ruchoma Herman was born on New York's Lower East Side to Rabbi Yaakov Yosef and Aidel Herman.[7][8][9] She was the youngest of her parents' five children.[10][11] She had three sisters and one brother.[12]

At seventeen years old, she married Moshe, the eldest son of Rabbi Shimon and Geneshe Shain.[13][14] Shortly after their wedding, the couple, at the behest of her father, traveled to Mir, Belarus, where they spent nearly six years while her husband studied at the Mir yeshiva under Rabbis Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, Yeruchom Levovitz, and Yechezkel Levenstein.[15] Her sister, Bessie, wife of Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, and her brother, Rabbi Nochum Dovid, also joined them in Mir.[16] Later they returned to the East Side. When their children were grown, the Shains moved to Jerusalem, purchasing an apartment in the new development of Kiryat Mattersdorf.[17]

In the United States, Shain taught English to several grades.[18] In Jerusalem, she became a popular lecturer to women and girls. After the publication of her books, Shain received visitors seeking her counsel regarding various topics.[19]

Shain wrote her first book, _All for the Boss_, in her late sixties upon the request of Yaakov Feldheim, one of the founders of Feldheim Publishers. Published in 1984, her book about growing up in New York City and the influence of her father became one of the all-time best-sellers for the publishing company,[20] which until then had concentrated on Torah and rabbinic literature. _All for the Boss_ was revised and expanded in 2001,[21] and Feldheim published a "Young Readers Edition" in 2006. Feldheim translated the book into Hebrew in 2002.[22] In 2010 a _Ynet_ reporter called the book "one of the most read, talked about, and widely studied in the Haredi street".[23] Shain went on to write four more books, drawing on her personal and teaching experiences.

About ten years before her death, she returned to the United States to be near her children in Adelphia, New Jersey, where she continued to welcome visitors. She died in 2013 in Lakewood Township, New Jersey.[24]

Her children are Rabbi Yisrael Meir Shain, Mrs. Mashi Wilner, and Rabbi Refoel Yitzchak Shain.[25]


Influence

Shain's stories about her childhood, and her viewpoints on teaching, have been quoted by numerous authors.[26][27][28][29][30]
