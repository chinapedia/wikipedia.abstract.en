PARK JAE-KYUNG (; born 15 February 1984) is a South Korean professional golfer currently playing on the Korean Tour.


Early life and amateur golf career

Park was born into a golfing family. His grand-uncle Park Myeong-chul served as the 3rd and 4th President of the KPGA, and was the South Korean representative for the World Cup from 1956 to 1959.[1]

His father's elder brother, his father, and his own elder brother are all KPGA tour pros.[2]

Unsurprisingly, Park was exposed to golf from a young age and his childhood was filled with golf clubs instead of toys. It was in 6th grade that Park decided that he would pursue a golfing career.[3]


Professional career

Park became a member of the KPGA in 2003, first as a pro on 29 April, then as a tour pro on 29 August.[4] He made his Korean Tour debut in 2004.[5]

Park completed his mandatory military service obligations from 2008 to 2010. Park came in third place in his first competition after military service, the 8th KPGA Academy Tour.[6]

Since then he has participated in the Korean Tour and Challenge Tour.[7]
