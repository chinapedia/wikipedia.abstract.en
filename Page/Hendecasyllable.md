In poetry, a HENDECASYLLABLE is a line of eleven syllables. The term "hendecasyllabic" is used to refer to two different poetic meters, the older of which is quantitative and used chiefly in classical (Ancient Greek and Latin) poetry and the newer of which is accentual and used in medieval and modern poetry.


In classical poetry

The classical hendecasyllable is a quantitative meter used in Ancient Greece in Aeolic verse and in scolia, and later by the Roman poets Catullus and Martial.[1] Each line has eleven syllables; hence the name, which comes from the Greek word for eleven.[2] The heart of the line is the choriamb (- u u -). There are three different versions. The pattern of the PHALAECIAN (Latin: _hendecasyllabus phalaecius_) is as follows (using "-" for a long syllable, "u" for a short and "x" for an "anceps" or variable syllable):

x x  - u u -  u -  u - x 

(where x x is either - u or - -  or u -)

Another form of hendecasyllabic verse is the "ALCAIC" (Latin: _hendecasyllabus alcaicus_; used in the Alcaic stanza), which has the pattern:

x - u -  x  - u u -  u -

The third form of hendecasyllabic verse is the "SAPPHIC" (Latin: _hendecasyllabus sapphicus_; so named for its use in the Sapphic stanza), with the pattern:

- x -  x  - u u -  u - -

Forty-three of Catullus's poems are hendecasyllabic; for an example, see Catullus 1.

The metre has been imitated in English, notably by Alfred Tennyson, Swinburne, and Robert Frost, cf. "For Once Then Something." Contemporary American poets Annie Finch ("Lucid Waking") and Patricia Smith ("The Reemergence of the Noose") have published recent examples. Poets wanting to capture the hendecasyllabic rhythm in English have simply transposed the pattern into its accentual-syllabic equivalent: /u|/u|/uu/u|/u|, or trochee/trochee/dactyl/trochee/trochee, so that the long/short pattern becomes a stress/unstress pattern. Tennyson, however, maintained the quantitative features of the metre:

    O you chorus of indolent reviewers,
    Irresponsible, indolent reviewers,
    Look, I come to the test, a tiny poem
    All composed in a metre of Catullus...
    ("Hendecasyllabics")


In Italian poetry

The hendecasyllable () is the principal metre in Italian poetry. Its defining feature is a constant stress on the tenth syllable, so that the number of syllables in the verse may vary, equaling eleven in the usual case where the final word is stressed on the penultimate syllable. The verse also has a stress preceding the caesura, on either the fourth or sixth syllable. The first case is called _endecasillabo a minore_, or lesser hendecasyllable, and has the first hemistich equivalent to a _quinario_; the second is called _endecasillabo a maiore_, or greater hendecasyllable, and has a _settenario_ as the first hemistich.[3]

− The most usual stress schemes for the Italian hendecasyllable are stresses on sixth and tenth syllables (for example, "_Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_," Dante Alighieri, first line of _The Divine Comedy),_ and on the fourth, seventh and tenth syllables ("_Un incalzar di cavalli accorrenti_," Ugo Foscolo, _Dei sepolcri_).

Most classical Italian poems are composed in hendecasyllables, including the major works of Dante, Francesco Petrarca, Ludovico Ariosto, and Torquato Tasso. The rhyme system varies from terza rima to ottava, from sonnet to canzone. From the early 16th century, hendecasyllables are often used without a strict system, with few or no rhymes, both in poetry and in drama. An early example is _Le Api_ ("the bees") by Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai, written around 1517 and published in 1525, which begins:[4]



        Mentr'era per cantare i vostri doni
        Con altre rime, o Verginette caste,
        Vaghe Angelette delle erbose rive,
        Preso dal sonno, in sul spuntar dell'Alba
        M'apparve un coro della vostra gente,
        E dalla lingua, onde s'accoglie il mele,
        Sciolsono in chiara voce este parole:
        O spirto amici, che dopo mill'anni,
        E cinque cento, rinovar ti piace
        E le nostre fatiche, e i nostri studi,
        Fuggi le rime, e'l rimbombar sonoro.

Like other early Italian-language tragedies, the _Sophonisba_ of Gian Giorgio Trissino (1515) is in blank hendecasyllables. Later examples can be found in the _Canti_ of Giacomo Leopardi, where hendecasyllables are alternated with _settenari_. The effect of _endecasillabi sciolti_ ("untied" hendecasyllables) may be considered similar to that of English blank verse.

It has a role in Italian poetry, and a formal structure, comparable to the alexandrine in French.


In Polish poetry

The hendecasyllabic metre (Polish: _jedenastozgłoskowiec_) was very popular in Polish poetry, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, owing to strong Italian literary influence. It was used by Jan Kochanowski,[5] Piotr Kochanowski (who translated _Jerusalem Delivered_ by Torquato Tasso), Sebastian Grabowiecki, Wespazjan Kochowski and Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski. The greatest Polish Romantic poet, Adam Mickiewicz, set his poem Grażyna in this measure. The Polish hendecasyllable is widely used when translating English blank verse.

The eleven-syllable line is normally defined by primary stresses on the fourth and tenth syllables and a caesura after the fifth syllable. Only rarely it is fully iambic.

A popular form of Polish literature that employs the hendacasyllable is the Sapphic stanza: 11/11/11/5.

The Polish hendecasyllable is often combined with an 8-syllable line: 11a/8b/11a/8b. Such a stanza was used by Mickiewicz in his ballads, as in the following example.

    _Ktokolwiek będziesz w nowogródzkiej stronie,_
    _Do Płużyn ciemnego boru_
    _Wjechawszy, pomnij zatrzymać twe konie,_
    _Byś się przypatrzył jezioru._
    _(Świteź)_


In Portuguese poetry

The hendecasyllable (Portuguese: _hendecassílabo_) is a common meter in Portuguese poetry. The best-known Portuguese poem composed in hendecasyllables is Luís de Camões' epic _Os Lusíadas_, which begins as follows:



        As armas e os barões assinalados,
        Que da ocidental praia Lusitana,
        Por mares nunca de antes navegados,
        Passaram ainda além da Taprobana,
        Em perigos e guerras esforçados,
        Mais do que prometia a força humana,
        E entre gente remota edificaram
        Novo Reino, que tanto sublimaram

In Portuguese, the hendecasyllable meter is often called "decasyllable" (_decassílabo_), even when the work in question uses overwhelmingly feminine rhymes (as does _Os Lusíadas_).


In English poetry

The term "hendecasyllable" is sometimes used in English poetry to describe a line of iambic pentameter with a feminine ending, as in the first line of John Keats's _Endymion:_ "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever."
