BUTCH (formerly known as SPIKE) is an animated cartoon character: an anthropomorphic Irish dog. He was created in 1949 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio.

Spike or Butch was a short-lived animation cartoon series featuring Butch Dog. The title character was also a recurring antagonist in the Droopy shorts. His name was changed to Butch to avoid confusion with Spike from the Tom and Jerry cartoons. All of the original, the 1940s and 1950s shorts were directed by Tex Avery.[1]
