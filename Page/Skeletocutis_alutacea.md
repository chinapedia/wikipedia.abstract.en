_SKELETOCUTIS ALUTACEA_ is a species of poroid fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It was described as new to science in 1946 by American mycologist Josiah Lincoln Lowe as _Poria alutacea_.[1] Jean Keller transferred it to the genus _Skeletocutis_ in 1979.[2] It is found in the United States and Canada, in Europe, and New Zealand, where it causes a white rot in various woody substrates.[3]

The basidia of _S. alutacea_ are club-shaped, measuring 9–12 by 4–5 µm. Its spores are hyaline, smooth, cylindrical, straight to slightly curved, and measure 2.5–3.5 by 1–1.5 µm.[4]
