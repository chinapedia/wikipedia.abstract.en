_SCRAPPY LITTLE NOBODY_ is a 2016 memoir by Anna Kendrick, comprising "a collection of autobiographical essays".[1] An audiobook read by Kendrick was released along with the book. Kendrick said of the book: "My goals for this book were to make people laugh, to feel connected to people, and maybe get people to feel more connected to me."[2] The book covers Kendrick's childhood in Maine, her Broadway career as a teenager, her film career, and performing and presenting at the Academy Awards.[3]


Reception

Alex McCown of _The A.V. Club_ called _Scrappy Little Nobody_ "worth reading", stating the book is "the tale of an unusual life and oddball persona rising to fame, and it's a damn entertaining one".[4] _Kirkus Reviews_ was more critical, saying that "her attempts at humor often fall flat", and that "Kendrick is a scrappy little somebody now, but she should stick to acting".[5] _Vogue_ described it as "a charming, funny and sometimes probing collection of personal essays".[6] The _Winnipeg Free Press_ complained that the book was "filled with one average anecdote after another", but praised how she was "beautifully candid about the struggles she went through regarding body image as a young, underdeveloped girl and the anxiety with which she continues to grapple".[7] The _Buffalo News_ called it a "semi-satisfying look at what happens when you become a relatively well-known performer at a young age".[8]
