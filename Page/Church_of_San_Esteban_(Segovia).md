The CHURCH OF ST STEPHEN (Spanish: _Iglesia de San Esteban_) is one of a number of medieval churches in Segovia, Spain. It dates from the 12th century and is noted for its Romanesque bell tower.


Conservation

The tower is designated a _Bien de Interés Cultural_ and has been protected since 1896,[1] when it was declared a National Monument (published in the Madrid _Gazette_ on 13 December 1896).

Since 1985 the church has been part of a World Heritage Site: the Old Town of Segovia and its Aqueduct. In giving this designation to Segovia, UNESCO noted that the outstanding monuments of the city included "several Romanesque churches".[2]
