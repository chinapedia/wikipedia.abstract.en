A PRIVATE is a soldier of the lowest military rank (equivalent to NATO Rank Grades OR-1 to OR-3 depending on the force served in).

In modern military writing, "private" is shortened to "Pte" in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth of Nations countries and to "Pvt." in the United States.


Etymology

The term derives from the medieval term "private soldiers" (a term still used in the British Army), denoting individuals who were either hired, conscripted, or mustered into service by a feudal nobleman commanding a battle group of an army. The usage of "private" dates from the 18th century.


Asia

Israel

    _For information, you may refer to Israel Defense Forces ranks._

In the Israel Defense Forces, טוראי _Turai_ ("private") refers to the lowest enlisted rank. After 7–10 months of service (7 for combatants, 8 for combat support and 10 for non-combatants) soldiers are promoted from private to corporal (_rav-turai_ or _rabat_), if they performed their duties appropriately during this time. Soldiers who take a commander's course, are prisoner instructors or practical engineers become corporals earlier. An IDF private wears no uniform insignia and is sometimes described as having a "slick sleeve" for this reason.

Korea

The equivalent ranks to privates within the North and South Korean armies are _il-byong_ (private first class) and _e-byong_ (private second class). The symbol for this rank is 1 line ( | ) or 2 lines ( || ). Private second class is known by 1 line, while private first class is 2 lines.

Singapore

Once recruits complete their Basic Military Training (BMT) or Basic Rescue Training (BRT), they attain the rank of private (PTE). Privates do not wear ranks on their rank holder. PTEs who performed well are promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal (LCP). The PFC rank is rarely awarded nowadays by SAF. All private enlistees can be promoted directly to lance corporal should they meet the minimum qualifying requirements, conduct appraisal and work performance.[1] Recruits who did not complete BMT but completed 2 years of National Service will be promoted to private.

The air force rank of aviator was formerly private, but this changed when traditional air force rank insignia were restored. The French-language equivalent of private is .

-   Private (recruit) (Pte(R)) – an untrained new recruit holds this rank through recruit training, known as the Basic Military Qualification Course (BMQ).

Private (recruit) and private (basic) are Development Period 1 within the Canadian Forces Professional Development System.
-   Private (trained) (Pte(T)) – A private (basic) becomes a private (trained) upon attaining Qualification Level 4. A private (trained) is the only private to wear rank insignia, a single chevron. Private (trained) and the next rank of corporal are Development Period 2 within the Canadian Forces Professional Development System.[3]

United Kingdom

In the British Army, a private (Pte) equates to both OR-1 and OR-2 on the NATO scale, although there is no difference in rank. Privates wear no insignia. Many regiments and corps use other distinctive and descriptive names instead of private, some of these ranks have been used for centuries, others are less than 100 years old.[4] In the contemporary British Armed Forces, the army rank of private is broadly equivalent to able seaman in the Royal Navy, aircraftman, leading aircraftman and senior aircraftman in the Royal Air Force, and marine (Mne) or bandsman, as appropriate equivalent rank in the Royal Marines. In the Boys' Brigade the rank of private is used when a boy moves from the junior section to the company section.

Notably, both Sir Fitzroy Maclean and Enoch Powell are examples of rare, rapid career progression with the British Army, both rising from the rank of private to at least brigadier during World War II.

Finland

Sotamies_kauluslaatta.svg The Finnish equivalent rank is _sotamies_ (literally "war man"), although since 1973 this has been purely a paper term as all infantry troopers were renamed as _jääkäri_ troops, previously reserved only to mobile light infantry.

The equivalent of the lowest rank (NATO-standard code OR-1) is either _Schütze_ (rifleman), _Kanonier_ (gunner) or _Jäger_ (light-infantryman otherwise ranger), and sometimes in general simply _Soldat_ (soldier), as well as other unit-specific distinctions.[5] Up until 1918 it was _Gemeine_[6] (Ordinary [soldier]) as well as unit-specific distinctions such as _Musketier_ (musketeer), _Infanterist_ (infantryman), _Kürassier_ (cuirassier), _Jäger_ (light-infantryman otherwise ranger), _Füsilier_ (fusilier) etc., until 1945 _Soldat_ (soldier) and unit-specific distinctions such as _Schütze_ (rifleman), _Grenadier_ (grenadier) etc. The navy equivalent of the OR-1 rank is known as _Matrose_[7] (sailor or seaman), and the German Air Force equivalent is _Flieger_[8] (aviator or airman) which is also used by army aviators.

Hungary

The name of the lowest rank in the Hungarian army (_Magyar Honvédség_) is the _honvéd_ which means "homeland defender". The word is also used informally for a soldier in general of any rank (i.e. "our _honvéds_" or an officer referred as a _honvédtiszt_, _honvéd_ officer). This is because Hungarian military traditions are strictly defensive, despite the Hungarian army participating in offensives on foreign soil in both world wars. The word _honvéd_ has been in use since the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.

Private (Pte) (_saighdiúr singil_ in Irish), is the lowest enlisted rank in the Irish Army. Soldiers enlist as recruits then undergo a basic course of instruction. There are three grades of private in the army. After basic training the soldier is upgraded (rather than promoted) from recruit to private 2 star (Pte 2*) (_saighdiúr singil, 2 réalta_). After more corps-specific training (usually lasting eight weeks) the soldier is upgraded to private 3 star (Pte 3*) (_saighdiúr singil, 3 réalta_). All are usually just addressed as "private", although before being upgraded, recruits may be addressed as "recruit".

In corps units, the rank designation changes. In the artillery, the rank is known as gunner (Gnr), but usually only after the completion of a gunners' course, and in the cavalry it is known as trooper (Tpr). Communications and Information Services privates are known as signalman or signalwoman. Medical orderlies are sometimes referred to as medic, although this can apply to privates and corporals.

Italy

Netherlands

In the Royal Netherlands Army, the _Landmacht_, the equivalent ranks are _soldaat_ (soldier), similar to the original French, with different classes:

-   _Soldaat der derde klasse_ (soldier/private 3rd class), for soldiers in Algemene Militaire Opleiding or AMO (General Military Training), with insignia.
-   _Soldaat der tweede klasse_ (soldier/privat 2nd class), the basic infantry rank, an insignia single striped red band, obtained after AMO but before completion of _Initiële Functie Opleiding_ or IFO (initial job training).
-   _Soldaat der eerste klasse_ (soldier/privat 1st class), comparable to private first class, with an insignia with two neighbouring striped red bands, obtained automatically a year after completion of IFO.

Depending on where the _soldaat_ serves, he may be deemed a _kanonnier_ (gunner in the artillery), _huzaar_ (hussar in the cavalry) or _fuselier_ (rifleman in the rifles) as well as _commando_, _jager_ or _rijder_. There is less differentiation than in other countries between different armed forces. A _soldaat_ can be promoted to _korporaal_ (corporal).

United States

United States Army

Army-USA-OR-02.svg In the United States Army, private is used for the two lowest enlisted ranks, just below private first class (E-3) or PFC. The lowest rank is "Private (E-1)" or PV1, and sometimes referred to as recruit, but also held by some soldiers after punishment through the Uniform Code of Military Justice or prisoners after conviction until they are discharged. A PV1 wears no uniform rank insignia; since the advent of the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), the term "fuzzy" has come into vogue, referring to the blank velcro patch on the ACU where the rank would normally be placed. The second rank, "Private (E-2)" or PV2, wears a single chevron, known colloquially as "mosquito wings". Advancement to PV2 is automatic after six months' time in service, but may get shortened to four months if given a waiver. A person who earned the Eagle Scout award, the Gold Award, or completed at least two years of JROTC may enlist at any time at the rank of PV2.[9] The term of address, "Private," may be properly applied to any Army soldier E-1 (PV1) to E-3 (PFC). The abbreviation "PVT" may be used whenever the specific grade of private is immaterial (such as in Tables of Organization and Equipment). While a soldier is currently in Initial Enlistment Training, he or she will often be referred to as "Private" by the training cadre, regardless of actual rank, even if the soldier enlisted as a Specialist (E-4).

United States Marine Corps

In the United States Marine Corps, _private_ (Pvt) refers only to the lowest enlisted rank, just below private first class. A Marine Corps private wears no uniform insignia and is sometimes described as having a "slick sleeve" for this reason. Most new, non-officer Marines begin their military career as a private. In the Marine Corps, privates first class are not referred to as "private"; it is more appropriate to use either "private first class" or "PFC".
