SECH'ŎN STATION is a railway station in Sech'ŏn-dong, Hoeryŏng county, North Hamgyŏng province, North Korea on the Sech'ŏn branch of the Hambuk Line of the Korean State Railway.[1]

The station was opened in 1920 by the privately owned Tomun Railway Company, at the same time as the rest of the first stage of its mainline, from Hoeryŏng to Sangsambong.[2] It was subsequently nationalised by the Chosen Government Railway in 1929, and from 1934 to 1940 it was managed by the South Manchuria Railway.[3] Finally, after the partition of Korea it became part of the Korean State Railway.[4]
