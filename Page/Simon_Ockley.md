SIMON OCKLEY (16789 August 1720) was a British Orientalist.


Biography

Ockley was born at Exeter. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1697, MA. in 1701, and B.D. in 1710.[1] He became fellow of Jesus College and vicar of Swavesey, and in 1711 was chosen Adams Professor of Arabic in the university. He had a large family, and his latter days were embittered by pecuniary embarrassments, which form the subject of a chapter in Isaac D'Israeli's _Calamities of Authors_. The preface to the second volume of his _History of the Saracens_ is dated from Cambridge Castle, where he lay a prisoner for debt.[2]

Ockley maintained that a knowledge of Oriental literature was essential to the proper study of theology, and in the preface to his first book, the _Introductio ad linguas orientales_ (1706), he urges the importance of the study.[3]

He died at Swavesey.

-   _The History of the Saracens_, is his main work. It was published in two volumes, 1708-1718, and long enjoyed a great reputation; unfortunately Ockley took as his main authority a manuscript in the Bodleian of Al-Waqidi's _Futúh al-Shám_, which is rather historical romance than history.1
