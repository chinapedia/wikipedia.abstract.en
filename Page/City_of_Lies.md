The first trailer for the film, originally titled _LAbyrinth_, was released on May 21, 2018, which would have been The Notorious B.I.G.'s 46th birthday.[31] Following the merger between Open Road Films and IM Global to form Global Road Entertainment, the film was retitled _City of Lies_ and given a release date of September 7, 2018, 22 years after the Tupac Shakur Las Vegas shooting.[32][33] However, in August 2018, the film was pulled from the schedule reportedly due to an ongoing lawsuit involving Depp and the film's location manager; no replacement date was announced.[34] Later that same month, on August 23, 2018, reports surfaced that Depp's legal trouble was used as a scapegoat, and the film in fact may be being suppressed by the Los Angeles Police Department, who is implicated in the film, or other various players who do not want the film released.[35] On August 29, 2018, another lawsuit was filed by Bank Leumi for owed millions of unpaid guarantees caused by pulling the film from release.[36]
