TANBE10[1] (abbreviated as TB10) (Persian: _Tan-be-dah – تن به 10_), meaning "One Against 10", is an underground Iranian hip hop group from Tehran, formed by Amir Aemha, Mehdi Alpha, Ali10 and his brother Reza Moty and is part of the late first-generation of gangsta rap in Iran,[2][3][4] a sort of an artistic rebellion, as producing western style music and even more "rap" are prohibited acts in Iran since the 1979 revolution.[5][6][7]

The general theme of their songs includes self-praise and the description of their current mood which is a representation of the Iranian modern society. In contradiction with old school hip-hop artists, all of the group members hold at least a post-graduate degree and even some are at a Phd level which results in the use of scientific words and expressions in their lyrics, setting them apart from other conventional hip-hop artists in the country.[8][9]

Apart from their group gangsta songs, the group is best known for the introduction of talents such as Justina and Amir Khalvat and their beef story with Erfan and Tik Taak band in 2012 followed by multiple diss songs[10] and interviews.[11][12]

As of October 2016, Tanbe10 consisted of former members and Pooria Sharlatan.[13]


History

From alliance to independence (2006-2007)

Tanbe10's debut album "Artesh-e Tanbe10",[14] meaning "The Army of Tanbe10" was released in 2007 as an alliance between several Persian gangsta rappers and bands from within the country and abroad including Aemha (Opposite Kingkong band, Germany), Alpha and Moty (Segam band, Iran), Shahinloo, Ali Sufi, Shah MC and Apachi (TM band, Denmark), Mammoth, Tetis (PK Busta band, Iran) and Ali10 (Iran).[15]

After this collaboration and well received feedbacks, some of the members decided to quit their former groups to form Tanbe10 as an independent band.[16]

Divar Records (2007-2008)

The newly formed group caught the attention of Divar Records founder Ehsan Atour that led them to joining the label alongside famous artists such as Bahram Nouraei, Babak Tighe, Nimosh and Suchmeh in the same year[17][18][19][20] and the release of single tracks like _Divar-e Beton_ and the massive collaboration club hit with the then reformed TM band, entitled _Dokhtar-e Bandar_.[21]

The first come back and new members (2008-2009)

In 2008, the band decided to part ways with Divar Records for personal reasons and conflicts within the group and went silent for about 6 months before coming back with the single track _Bargashtim_ followed by several other well received single tracks. In the same year, the band added two new members Parham Sezar and Pooria Sharlatan through a nomination process and they were introduced to fans with the hit single _Bye Bye_.[22]

The bright year (2010-2011)

2010 was also a bright year for the band with Amir Khalvat joining the team as a new member and the release of the massive hit, _Dast Too Jib_, a gangsta rap song about enjoying life in Tehran which they dedicated to Zedbazi, a Persian hip-hop pioneer band they admired, following their retirement from music rumors earlier that year.[23]

Khalvat separated from the group shortly after, to pursue his musical career as an independent artist.[24]

Artesh-e Tanbe10 contest (2011-2012)

After major success in underground musical activities and good past experiences with young talents, Tanbe10 decided to organize a series of competitions to introduce new talents in singing and music production entitled _Artesh-e Tanbe10_ and _TanbeBeat_ respectively and started their own label "Mishnasi-Maro Records" inspired by their famous slogan _Mishnasi Maro_ (Persian: Mishnāsi Māro, می شناسی مارو) meaning _You Know Us_.[25]

_Arteshe Tanbe10 Vol2_ was the single track that featured the 10 winners of the competition.[26] It was released in 2011 and was very well received leading to the Introduction of the singer, songwriter and rapper girl, _Justina_ as the first official member of Mishnasi Maro Records, not only defying political rules against underground rap production but also religious ones which precisely restrict women from singing publicly.[27][28]

TanbeBeat contest for music producers was also a hit, featuring best Iranian hip-hop producers of the time, Atour and Alireza JJ as juries.[29] The latter also produced one of the most famous hit singles of the band _Hamine ke Hast_ in 2011. The second year of Artesh-e Tanbe10 contest was cancelled in final stages due to security problems caused for some of the last year's winners in Iran which led to the discontinuity of both talent seeking contests but H-beatz (Hamid Shekari's pseudonym) was the winner as the mentioned.[30]

The diss year (2012-2013)

In 2012, after a series of Facebook comments and insults from one of Tik Taak band's members followed by some of the Paydar alliance members regarding Tanbe10, the group released the hit single diss track "Are!" The grudge caused massive reactions online and was mentioned especially in TV interviews such as GemTV's _Cold Spray_ and AAAmusic's _Persian Paparazzi_ interviews with Erfan, the leader of Paydar alliance.[31][32] Later that year, Paydar responded with _Ye Vajab Az Ma_ that was followed by the diss track _Lol_ from Tanbe10. This contention is one of the most famous beef stories of Iranian gangsta rap and the two diss tracks from Tanbe10 are usually cited as best diss tracks of Persian hip-hop.[33]

The second come back (2013-present)

In 2013, the band went off silent again after the separation of Sezar and Sharlatan from the group and due to personal involvements of the now older band members.[34]

After two years, Tanbe10 came back to the hip-hop scene with the _6.3.3_ title alongside other famous artists on the "Ampoule album" from _13 Company_ in 2015 which was played more that 300 thousand times as of October 2016.[35] A few months later the return of Sharlatan to the group was celebrated with another single, _Kar-e Maas_.[36][37]


Discography

Tanbe10's musical career comprises memorable tracks such as _Bazi Tatil_, _Bachehaye Bad, Hamine Ke Hast, Lol, Are, Divert, Dast too Jib, Taze Dare Khosh Migzare, Baham Bashim, Ba To Khoobam_, _Nagoo Dire_ and several collaborations from featured songs to music productions including artists like Sogand, Alireza JJ, Amir Khalvat, Justina, Mojan YZ, Tm Bax, Nima Nimosh, Satrap, Janjal, Saeed Kermani, Pionna, Ghogha and Salome MC.[38]
