It originally run from 1949 until 1956.


History and profile

The comics were inspired by the Vittorio De Sica's neorealist drama film _Shoeshine_, and the series itself has been described as a "neorealist comic".[1] Set in Italy between the end of World War II and contemporary days, each issue was a self-contained episode and recounted the adventures of the young shoeshine Nico and of his friends. It debuted on January 22, 1949 and got an immediate success.[2][3][4]

Initially filled with realistic elements, the stories gradually lost originality and believability, with the group of teenagers sent to missions in Africa, China or Canada, and both the quality and the commercial success of the series started to decline.[5] Starting from September 1953, the issues were released without titles.[6] _Sciuscià_ officially ceased its publications in April 1955, while the series continued to be published in _Il Piccolo Sceriffo_ until 1956.[7]

The series was briefly resurrected in 1965 in the comic magazine _Commandos_, with new stories still written by Torelli and illustrated by Lina Buffolente.[8] The comic book series also inspired a novel, _Sciuscià_ (1952), written by Tristano Tirelli and Gianna Arguissola.[9][10]

During the years the comic book series was republished several times.[11]
