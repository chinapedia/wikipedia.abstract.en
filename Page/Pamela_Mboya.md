Tom_Mboya_honeymoon_Tel_Aviv_1962.jpg PAMELA MBOYA (1938 â€“ 26 January 2009) was a Kenyan political activist and diplomat, the wife of government official Tom Mboya.


Early life and education

Pamela Odede was born at Maseno, near Lake Victoria. Her father Walter Odede was a politician. She studied art at Makerere University from 1957 to 1959. She earned a bachelor's degree in sociology at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio.[1]


Career

Pamela Odede married Thomas Mboya in 1962, in a large Roman Catholic wedding.[2] She was widowed when he was assassinated on 5 July 1969. Images of Pamela Mboya as a glamorous bride, and as a young widow grieving, became iconic in Kenya's turbulent 1960s and 1970s; the name "Pamela" even became trendy for Kenyan girls after her influence.[3] Pamela Mboya was frequently photographed as a hostess with international visitors: during her marriage, she danced with Prince Philip to celebrate Kenya's independence in 1964; after she was widowed, she visited with Coretta Scott King and other survivors of loss by assassination.[4][5]

Pamela Mboya was Kenya's permanent representative to the UN Habitat in the 1980s. She chaired HelpAge Kenya, and was a member of the Kenyan Women's Political Caucus.[6]


Personal life

Pamela and Tom Mboya had five children together, one of whom died as a young boy. After she was widowed, she had another son with her brother-in law, in accordance to Luo tradition, whom she named Tom Mboya, Jr. in his honour.

Pamela Mboya died from ovarian cancer in 2009, aged 70 years, in South Africa.[7]

Her daughter Maureen Odero is a judge in Mombasa, and her daughter Susan Mboya is president of the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation and the wife of Evans Kidero, governor of Nairobi.[8]
