INDIANA "INDY" NEIDELL (born September 28, 1967) is an American historian, actor, voice actor, musician and YouTube personality, best known for presenting the video series, _The Great War_ on _The Great War Channel_[1][2] which documented World War I in real time using modern research, various secondary sources and archival footage.[3][4] A similar project, _World War Two_ (about World War II) began in September 2018.[5] Neidell is also a writer and actor with credits that include _Metropia_ and numerous commercials in Europe, as well as video game voice-acting.[6][7]


Early life and education

Originally from Houston, Texas, Neidell attended St. John's School.[8] He studied history at Wesleyan University.[9]


Career

Neidell was approached by Mediakraft, the producers of _The Great War_, to host the series after they saw a series of videos he had produced between May and September 2013 about the history of baseball, entitled _Watch Sunday Baseball_.[10] _The Great War_ spin-off YouTube channel “It's History” also featured Neidell as a guest host for episodes on famous military campaigns.

In June 2017, he launched the _TimeGhost History_ YouTube channel with Spartacus Olsson, the creator of _The Great War_ and producer for its first two years. The first feature was day-by-day coverage of the Cuban Missile Crisis, 55 years to the day after the event. In April 2018, they launched the "Between-2-Wars" series to recap the Interwar period. The Great War project officially ended on November 11, 2018, exactly 100 years after the signing of the Armistice at Compiègne which formally ended all hostilities in the First World War. Neidell stated in his finale video that the channel will continue to release some episodes about events following the First World War. As for himself, Neidell has moved on to focus on other projects, such as the aforementioned World War II series.

With _The Great War_ project (a similar web series which followed World War I) coming to a close in November 2018, Indy Neidell and Spartacus Olsson prepared for an equivalent YouTube project focusing on World War II, which they would produce themselves through their own TimeGhost channel (unlike The Great War) with a projected start date for September 1, 2018. Accounting for the war's longer duration and larger scope for this independent project without the participation of Mediakraft Networks, it is a collaboration of various channels: TimeGhost will focus on a weekly series on the general historical events of the war in the European and Pacific Theatres of the war. To raise the seed money for this project, there has been a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised €54,380 ($63,816).[11] With those funds available, a new studio was built from the ground up in its own building and arrangements were made with media providers such as Reuters News Service for archival footage.[12] The series also has a Instagram account which runs parallel to it and follows the events of World War II on a day-by-day basis.[13] As of July 11, 2019, the YouTube channel had received 10,840,028 views and has 285,593 subscribers.[14]

In February 2019, Neidell teamed up with Swedish power metal band Sabaton, for a project called “Sabaton History”, for which he is the host and writer. The series documents the historical events surrounding the band's songs.


Personal life

Neidell lives in Stockholm, Sweden.[15][16]
