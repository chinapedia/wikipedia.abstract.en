Plot

After Rick receives a wedding invitation from Birdperson through an intergalactic parcel delivery, Jerry is accidentally sent with the same service to the wedding destination. In order to retrieve Jerry, Rick is forced to attend his best friend's wedding on the distant planet Squanch along with the rest of the family, despite his objections. During the reception, Birdperson's bride Tammy Gueterman reveals herself to be an agent of the Galactic Federation. Tammy kills Birdperson and has numerous agents attack the wedding guests. Rick is able escape with his family safely, but they are unable to return to Earth, as the Federation would be searching for them there. After visiting a planet orbiting an endlessly screaming sun and a planet where all life is "on the cob", the family hides out on a very small planet outside the reach of the Federation.

As Rick leaves to explore the planet, Jerry suggests to the rest of the family that they should return to Earth and turn Rick in citing Rick's selfishness. However, the rest of the family defends Rick, saying that they want to stay with him due to their unconditional love for him as a family member. Rick hears all this from beneath the floor of their house. After convincing Morty that he is leaving to go buy ice cream, Rick leaves the planet, calls the Federation, and turns himself in under the guise of Jerry (and ridiculing Jerry in the process) while freeing his family from a life on the run. The Federation rescues the family and they are returned to Earth, which has now joined the Federation and is bustling with alien tourists. After being told on numerous occasions to get a job, Jerry finally is assigned a job by the Federation upon returning to Earth.

Rick is captured by the Federation and is transported to a prison planet, and under the charges of having committed "everything", Rick is incarcerated seemingly indefinitely.

In a post-credits scene, after watching the main events (and credits) of "The Wedding Squanchers" on Interdimensional TV, Mr. Poopybutthole asks the audience what they think will happen in season 3, and harasses a pizza deliveryman with the same question. He also states that season 3 will come in a year and a half or longer.


Music

The climax of the episode features the song "Hurt" by the American alternative rock band Nine Inch Nails.[1][2]


Reception

"The Wedding Squanchers" received critical acclaim from television critics. Zack Handlen, reviewing for the episode for _The A.V. Club_, wrote that the episode "was hilarious, in addition to being, by the end, pretty goddamn heavy indeed", and called its ending "a brilliant conclusion—one that both presents plenty of story possibilities for the seasons ahead, while still serving as a fitting conclusion to the show’s excellent sophomore year".[3] In a review of the episode, IGN writer Jesse Schedeen wrote that "this show really knows how to hit fans in the feels, and rarely has it succeeded so well in that regard".[4]
