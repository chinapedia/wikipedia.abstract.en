On 31 October 1926, its laboratory at Petaling Estate was closed down and from 1 November 1926, the institute took over the equipment of the Rubber Growers' Association. Also in 1926, the institute made a request to the government for the temporary laboratory building of the institute at Damansara Road in Selangor. The request was granted and the building was leased for five years. In 1936, the institute decided to relocate to a new building at Ampang Road. The building was officiated by Selangor Sultan Sulaiman on 22 April 1936 and the institute restarted its operation on 19 May 1937.[1][2]
