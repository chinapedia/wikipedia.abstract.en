ROYAL GORGE is a gap in Iron County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The gap is at a point where Minor Creek cuts through a ridge in Ketcherside Mountain. Routes 72 and 21 pass through the gap southwest of Ironton.[2]

Royal Gorge most likely takes its name from the gorge of the same name in Colorado.[3]
