The MASSACHUSETTS EXPAND SLOT MACHINE GAMING INITIATIVE was a 2016 Massachusetts ballot measure.

The ballot question specified that the additional slots parlor be licensed only on a property within of a racetrack and built on a parcel that is at least in size.[1] The only location in the state where this would have applied was Suffolk Downs in East Boston.[2]

-   A "yes" vote would allow a second slots parlor to exist in Massachusetts.[3]
-   A "no" vote would leave the current number of one slots parlor place.
