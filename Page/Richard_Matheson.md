RICHARD BURTON MATHESON (February 20, 1926 – June 23, 2013) was an American author and screenwriter, primarily in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres. He is best known as the author of _I Am Legend_, a 1954 science fiction horror vampire novel that has been adapted for the screen four times, as well as the film _Somewhere In Time_ for which he wrote the screenplay based on his novel _Bid Time Return_. Matheson also wrote 16 television episodes of _The Twilight Zone_, including "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" and "Steel". He adapted his 1971 short story "Duel" as a screenplay directed by Steven Spielberg for the television film _Duel_ that year. Seven of his novels and short stories have been adapted as motion pictures: _The Shrinking Man_, _Hell House_, _What Dreams May Come_, _Bid Time Return_ (filmed as _Somewhere in Time)_, _A Stir of Echoes_, _Steel_ (filmed as _Real Steel_), and _Button, Button_ (filmed as _The Box)_. The movie _Cold Sweat_ was based on his novel _Riding the Nightmare_, and _Les seins de glace_ (_Icy Breasts_) was based on his novel _Someone is Bleeding_.


Early life

Matheson was born in Allendale, New Jersey to Norwegian immigrants Bertolf and Fanny Matheson. They divorced when he was 8, and he was raised in Brooklyn, New York by his mother. His early writing influences were the film _Dracula_, novels by Kenneth Roberts, and a poem which he read in the newspaper _Brooklyn Eagle_,[1] where he published his first short story at age 8.[2] He entered Brooklyn Technical High School in 1939, graduated in 1943, and served with the Army in Europe during World War II; this formed the basis for his 1960 novel _The Beardless Warriors_.[3][4] He attended the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, earning his BA in 1949, then moved to California.[5][6]


Career

1950s and 1960s

His first-written novel, _Hunger and Thirst_, was ignored by publishers for several decades before eventually being published in 2010, but his short story "Born of Man and Woman" was published in _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_, Summer 1950, the new quarterly's third issue[7] and attracted attention.[8] It is the tale of a monstrous child chained by its parents in the cellar, cast as the creature's diary in poignantly non-idiomatic English. Later that year he placed stories in the first and third numbers of _Galaxy Science Fiction_, a new monthly.[9] His first anthology of work was published in 1954.[10] Between 1950 and 1971, he produced dozens of stories, frequently blending elements of the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres.

He was a member of the Southern California Sorcerers in the 1950s and 1960s, which included Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, George Clayton Johnson, William F. Nolan, Jerry Sohl, and others.[11]

Several of his stories, including "Third from the Sun" (1950), "Deadline" (1959), and "Button, Button" (1970) are simple sketches with twist endings; others, like "Trespass" (1953), "Being" (1954), and "Mute" (1962) explore their characters' dilemmas over 20 or 30 pages. Some tales, such as "The Doll that Does Everything" (1954) and "The Funeral" (1955) incorporate satirical humour at the expense of genre clichés, and are written in an overblown prose very different from Matheson's usual pared-down style. Others, like "The Test" (1954) and "Steel" (1956), portray the moral and physical struggles of ordinary people, rather than the then nearly ubiquitous scientists and superheroes, in situations which are at once futuristic and everyday. Still others, such as "Mad House" (1953), "The Curious Child" (1954), and perhaps most of all, "Duel" (1971), are tales of paranoia, in which the everyday environment of the present day becomes inexplicably alien or threatening. "Duel" was adapted into the 1971 TV movie of the same name.

Matheson's first novel to be published, _Someone Is Bleeding_, appeared from Lion Books in 1953.[12] In 1960, Matheson published _The Beardless Warriors_, a non-fantastic, autobiographical novel about teenage American soldiers in World War II. It was filmed in 1967 as _The Young Warriors_ though most of Matheson's plot was jettisoned. During the 1950s he published a handful of Western stories (later collected in _By the Gun_); and during the 1990s he published Western novels such as _Journal of the Gun Years_, _The Gunfight_, _The Memoirs of Wild Bill Hickok_, and _Shadow on the Sun_.

His other early novels include _The Shrinking Man_ (1956, filmed in 1957 as _The Incredible Shrinking Man_, again from Matheson's own screenplay) and a science fiction vampire novel, _I Am Legend_ (1954) (filmed as _The Last Man on Earth_ in 1964, _The Omega Man_ in 1971, and _I Am Legend_ in 2007).

Matheson wrote screenplays for several television programs including the Westerns _Cheyenne_, _Have Gun – Will Travel_, and _Lawman_.[13] He is most closely associated with the American TV series _The Twilight Zone_, for which he wrote more than a dozen episodes,[14] including "Steel" (1963), "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" (1963), "Little Girl Lost" (1962), and "Death Ship" (1963). For all of his _Twilight Zone_ scripts, Matheson wrote the introductory and closing statements spoken by creator Rod Serling.[15] He adapted five works of Edgar Allan Poe for Roger Corman's Poe series, including _House of Usher_ (1960), _The Pit and the Pendulum (1961)_, and _The Raven_ (1963).[16]

He wrote the _Star Trek_ episode "The Enemy Within" (1966).

For Hammer Film Productions he wrote the screenplay for _Fanatic_ (1965; US title: _Die! Die! My Darling!_) based on the novel _Nightmare_ by Anne Blaisdell, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Stefanie Powers; he also adapted for Hammer Dennis Wheatley's _The Devil Rides Out_ (1968).[17]

1970s and 1980s

In 1973, Matheson earned an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his teleplay for _The Night Stalker_, one of two TV movies written by Matheson and directed by Dan Curtis (the other was _The Night Strangler_, which preceded the TV series _Kolchak: The Night Stalker_). Matheson worked extensively with Curtis; the 1977 television movie _Dead of Night_ features three stories written for the screen by Matheson — "Second Chance" (based on the story by Jack Finney); "No Such Thing as a Vampire" (based on Matheson's story of the same name); and "Bobby", an original script written for this omnibus movie by Matheson. "Bobby" was later refilmed with different actors as the second segment of _Trilogy of Terror II_.

Three of his short stories were filmed together as _Trilogy of Terror_ (1975), including "Prey" (initially published in the April 1969 issue of _Playboy_ magazine) with its famous Zuni warrior fetish doll. The Zuni fetish doll reappeared in the final segment of the belated sequel to the first movie, _Trilogy of Terror II_.

Other Matheson novels turned into notable films in the seventies include _Bid Time Return_ (as _Somewhere in Time_), and _Hell House_ (as _The Legend of Hell House_), both adapted and scripted by Matheson himself.

In the 1980s, Matheson published the novel _Earthbound_, wrote several screenplays for the TV series _Amazing Stories_, and continued to publish short fiction.

1990s

Matheson published four western novels in this decade, plus the suspense novel _Seven Steps to Midnight_ (1993) and the blackly comic locked-room mystery novel, _Now You See It ..._, aptly dedicated to Robert Bloch (1995).

He also wrote several movies—the offbeat comedy and box-office flop _Loose Cannons_, the biopic _The Dreamer of Oz_ (about L. Frank Baum), a segment of _Rod Serling's Lost Classics_, and segments of _Trilogy of Terror II_. Short stories continued to flow from his pen, and he saw the adaptations by other hands of two more of his novels for the big screen—_What Dreams May Come_ and _A Stir of Echoes_ (as _Stir of Echoes_). In 1999, Matheson published a non-fiction work _The Path_, inspired by his interest in psychic phenomena.[18]

21st century

Many previously unpublished novels by Matheson appeared late in his career, as did various collections of his work and previously unpublished screenplays. He also wrote new works, such as the suspense novel _Hunted Past Reason_ (2002).[19] and the children's illustrated fantasy _Abu and the Seven Marvels_.

Sources of inspiration

Matheson cited specific inspirations for many of his works. _Duel_ was derived from an incident in which he and a friend, Jerry Sohl, were dangerously tailgated by a large truck on the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[20]

According to film critic Roger Ebert, Matheson's scientific approach to the supernatural in _I Am Legend_ and other novels from the 1950s and early 1960s "anticipated pseudorealistic fantasy novels like _Rosemary's Baby_ and _The Exorcist_."[21]


Personal life and death

In 1952, Matheson married Ruth Ann Woodson, whom he met in California. They had four children.[22] Bettina Mayberry, Richard Christian Matheson, Chris Matheson and Ali Matheson.

Richard Christian, Chris and Ali became writers of fiction and screenplays.

Matheson died on June 23, 2013 at his home in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 87.[23][24][25]


Awards

Matheson received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984 and the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Horror Writers Association in 1991. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2010.[26][27]

At the annual World Fantasy Conventions he won two judged, annual literary awards for particular works: World Fantasy Awards for _Bid Time Return_ as the best novel of 1975 and _Richard Matheson: Collected Stories_ as the best collection of 1989.[28][29]

Matheson died just days before he was due to receive the Visionary award at the 39th Saturn Awards ceremony. As a tribute, the ceremony was dedicated to him and the award was presented posthumously. Academy President Robert Holguin said "Richard's accomplishments will live on forever in the imaginations of everyone who read or saw his inspired and inimitable work."[30]

The tribute anthology _He is Legend_ was published by Gauntlet Press in 2009.


Influence

Other writers

Stephen King has listed Matheson as a creative influence and his novel _Cell_ is dedicated to Matheson, along with filmmaker George A. Romero. Romero frequently acknowledged Matheson as an inspiration and listed the shambling vampire creatures that appear in _The Last Man on Earth_, the first film version of _I Am Legend_, as the inspiration for the zombie "ghouls" he envisioned in _Night of the Living Dead_[31]

Anne Rice stated that when she was a child, Matheson's short story "A Dress of White Silk" was an early influence on her interest in vampires and fantasy fiction.[32]

Directors

After his death, several figures offered tributes to his life and work. Director Steven Spielberg said:

Another frequent collaborator, Roger Corman said:

On Twitter, director Edgar Wright wrote "If it's true that the great Richard Matheson has passed away, 140 characters can't begin to cover what he has given the sci fi & horror genre." Director Richard Kelly added "I loved Richard Matheson's writing and it was a huge honor getting to adapt his story 'Button, Button' into a film. RIP."[33]
