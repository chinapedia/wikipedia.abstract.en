_ALLE MENN_ (Every Man) was a Norwegian weekly magazine that was first published in 1929 by the company Forlagshuset as the crime-story magazine _Mystikk_.[1] In 1945 the name of the publication was changed to the more attractive title _Alle Menns Blad_ (Every Man's Magazine) and it was published on a monthly basis.[2] In 1962 the name of the magazine was changed once again, to _Alle Menn_, and it was published by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag until 1974.[3] The magazine ceased publication in 2006.[4]


1929–1945

_Mystikk – Magasinet for detektivhistorier og fantastiske hendelser_ (Mystikk: The Magazine for Detective Stories and Fantastic Events), which was published weekly until 1943, contained only one detective story in its first years, illustrated and translated from English.[5] Towards the end of the 1930s, the magazine started containing a main story and several shorter stories. In 1943 the magazine was given the secondary title _Et blad for alle menn_ (A Magazine for Every Man) and started carrying comics, short reports, and the feature _Frimerkesamler'n_ (The Stamp Collector) before its publication was interrupted because of the Second World War. Four issues of _Mystikk_ appeared in 1945 before the magazine's name was changed to _Alle Menns Blad_ (Every Man's Magazine).[6]


1945–1962

_Alle Menns Blad_ stated appearing in August 1945 without any difference other than its logo from the four preceding issues that year. At the beginning of the 1950s, the magazine started featuring photographs, many drawings, Western fiction, reports, and a series called _Gamle norske kriminalsaker_ (Old Norwegian Criminal Cases). In 1954 the magazine was sold to the company Romanforlaget, and in 1961 and 1962 four installments of Ian Fleming's _The Spy Who Loved Me_ appeared in it for the first time in Norwegian.[7]


1962–2006

In December 1961 _Alle Menns Blad_ was purchased by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, which also owned _Alle Kvinners Blad_ (Every Woman's Magazine), and starting with issue 8 in 1962 the name was changed to _Alle Menn_ (Every Man). That same year, it started the feature _Lykkepiken_ (Happy Girl), with black-and-white pictures of scantily clad women.[8] Issue 5 of _Alle Menn_ in 1966 featured Norway's first color centerfold.[9] The feature _Piker med futt_ (Girls with Spunk) followed this, with pictures and interviews of women with special backgrounds, including Åse Kleveland, Inger Lise Rypdal, and Grynet Molvig, and the magazine started printing crime stories selected from the works of Alfred Hitchcock.[10]

Starting in the mid-1970s, the magazine began featuring many photos of nude women and fewer stories, and from number 40/41 in 1979 onward the magazine's focus was on sex with as many pictures as possible of women in the least amount of clothing, and with a new column with readers' own sexual experiences.[11] From 1989 to 1993, a parallel publication, _Alle Menn Spesial_ (Every Man's Special), was also issued with two front covers titled _Spesial_ and _Action_.[12]

In 2004 _Alle Menn_ changed its profile to a men's journalism magazine, and the last issue of the magazine was published in 2006.[13]
