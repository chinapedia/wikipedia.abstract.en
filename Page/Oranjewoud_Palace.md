Landgoed_oranjewoud_2b.jpg Paleisoranjewoudrond1765.jpg The ORANJEWOUD PALACE is a palace and estate which gives its name to Oranjewoud in the Province of Friesland in the Netherlands.

Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau, widow of William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, acquired what was then known as the Schoterswoud at Heerenveen, an estate consisting of several fields, forests and buildings. She built a palace and gardens there, which after her death were inherited by John William Friso, Prince of Orange, who commissioned Daniel Marot to build the _Paleis Oranjewoud_. Work began in 1708 and continued under John William's wife Marie-Louise, but it was never completed and after a period of neglect it was terminated. The current house on the estate was built in 1829.
