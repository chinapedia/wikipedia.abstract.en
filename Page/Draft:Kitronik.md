KITRONIK is a designer, manufacturer and supplier of educational electronic kits, based in Nottingham, England. The kits support design and technology teaching and learning in schools. The company also sells materials, tools, test equipment and e-textiles products. The company was one of the 29 partners in the BBC Micro Bit project.[1]


History

Founding

Kitronik was founded in 2005[2] by Geoff Hampson and Kevin Spurr. After graduating from Loughborough University in the field of Electronic Engineering they set out to fill a void in the resources available for those just starting out with Electronics.

Early History

The idea for the company came from Geoff Hampson's work with Scouts' technology camps.[3] From 2002 he began designing kits for the scouts and some of these kits later became Kitronik products.

In early December of 2005 the first website was created [4], the first kits were designed and bagged and teaching notes were written for each of the kits. The first Kitronik catalogue was sent to 1000 of the largest UK schools with a xylophone kit with teaching notes.

On 14th December 2005 the first order was received and the very first sale was dispatched to a School in Lancashire.

Recent History

Kitronik have extended their range of educational kits for the micro:bit with a robotics kit, the :MOVE mini buggy[5], an RGB LED ring, the :ZIP Halo[6] and the :GAME Zip 64[7]

In collaboration with Lorraine Underwood, they have developed lesson plans for teachers aimed at KS3 (ages 11-14) as part of their "Kitronik University".


Product Range

The company stocks a range of electronic project kits, components, tools and test equipment, a wide range of materials and also e-textiles products including conductive thread.

Kitronik are also one of a small number of official BBC micro:bit re-sellers.[8]


The BBC micro:bit Partnership

In 2012 the BBC, recognising the growing tech skills gap in the UK, aimed to develop a technology that they would give away free to one million British school children that would encourage them to write code and build things rather than just be consumers of media and thus attempt to bridge the recognised skills gap.[9]. The BBC gathered together a group of 29 partners[10], including Kitronik[11], to produce the micro:bit.

Kitronik's Role

Kitronik developed teaching and learning resources for schools and also gave away 5,500 e-textile sewing kits to Design and Technology teachers to highlight how the BBC micro:bit can be used to control wearable electronics.[12] Kitronik also developed supporting electronics and kits [13] , such as a motor driver board and Inventors kit [14] , designed to facilitate students learning how to build and control electronic circuits with code. After the roll out to British school children the BBC micro:bit was made available to the general public to buy [15], the BBC put together a group of official re-sellers, which includes Kitronik, to facilitate this.[16]
