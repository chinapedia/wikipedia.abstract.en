MICKEY KEATING (born 1990 or 1991)[1] is an American film director and writer. His work includes _Ritual_, _Pod_, _Darling_, _Carnage Park_, and _Psychopaths_.


Career

Keating interned at Blumhouse when he was a teenager. His feature directing debut, the horror film _Ritual_, was produced by Eric Fleischmann, a friend who was also a former intern there.[2] His next two films, _Pod_, a science fiction-horror film, and _Darling_, a psychological horror film, were shot nine months apart; both premiered in 2015. _Darling_ was produced by Glass Eye Pix, where Keating had also interned.[3] For _Carnage Park_, a neo-Western horror film released in 2016, Fleischmann returned to produce.[4] Describing _Darling_ and _Carnage Park_, _Charleston City Paper_ critic Kevin Young wrote that they show obvious influences from other horror films, but Keating's wide-ranging explorations of the various horror subgenres make him a promising director.[5] Katie Rife of _The A.V. Club_ wrote that although _Carnage Park_ is fun, Keating needs to move beyond stylized homage to avoid the risk of being labeled an imitator.[6] His next film, _Psychopaths_, completed principal photography in March 2016,[7] and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2017. _Crooks_, a heist film, began shooting in summer 2018.[8]

Keating is the host of _The Core_, a Shudder and Uproxx-produced talk show where he interviews filmmakers about their work and plays with practical effects.[9]


Style

Keating is primarily known for making films that borrow elements from established styles and filmmakers with his own take on them; for example, _Darling_ is influenced by Roman Polanski's "Apartment Trilogy", while _Carnage Park_ is influenced by the thriller films of Sam Peckinpah and Peter Watkins. Keating is also known for unusually fast-paced and flashy uses of inter-titles and captions within his films.
