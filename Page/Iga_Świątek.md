IGA ŚWIĄTEK (; born 31 May 2001) is a tennis player from Poland. She has won seven ITF singles titles and achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 61 on July 15th 2019.

As a junior, she was part of the Polish team which won the Junior Fed Cup in 2016.[1] She was also the 2018 French Open girls' doubles champion with Caty McNally, having lost to her partner in the singles' semi-final, but the highlight of her junior career was her victory in the girls' singles final at Wimbledon a few weeks later, defeating Leonie Küng of Switzerland in straight sets. She completed her junior career at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, where she won the gold medal in the girls' doubles with Kaja Juvan of Slovenia, who also won gold in the girls' singles.[2]


Early life and background

Iga Świątek was born to 1988 Olympic rower Tomasz Świątek who competed in the men's quadruple sculls event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.[3] She resides in Raszyn, a small town near Warsaw.


Career

2016 to 2017: Junior career and early years

In summer 2016, Świątek defeated Olga Danilović in the final of the Canadian Open Junior Championships, and followed that with her first win in a senior ITF tournament in Stockholm at age 15. She then beat Marta Kostyuk in the title match at the AGL Loy Yang Traralgon Junior International in January 2017, and then claimed her first clay-court singles title on the ITF pro circuit a month later with a victory over Martina Di Giuseppe in Bergamo. Świątek came through the qualifying rounds to reach the final.[4]

At age 17, Świątek and her partner Caty McNally beat Yuki Naito and Naho Sato in the French Open junior doubles final. She also reached the junior singles semifinals, losing to McNally in three sets.

On 14 July 2018, Świątek reached her first Grand Slam junior singles final, in which she defeated Switzerland's Leonie Küng in straight sets. Świątek became the fourth Polish junior champion at Wimbledon after Aleksandra Olsza and Agnieszka and Urszula Radwańska.[6]

Świątek won back-to-back $60,000 titles in Budapest and Montreux to enter the top 200.[7]

In October, Świątek competed at the third Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.[8] She qualified based on her ITF world junior rankings, and played singles, doubles and mixed doubles. She won the gold medal in doubles with Kaja Juvan, defeating Yuki Naito and Naho Sato of Japan in the final.

Świątek had a strong 2018 season, raising her ranking from No. 727 to a career high of No. 174 and winning four ITF titles.[9] Her year-end ranking was 186.[10]

2019: First WTA final, Grand Slam R4 and top 100

Iga_Swiatek_Interview.png Świątek started the season with her first WTA event at the Auckland Open, where she lost in the final round of qualifying. She made it through the qualifying rounds of the Australian Open, and in the first round, Świątek defeated Ana Bogdan in three sets. Following the Australian Open, Świątek achieved a new career-high singles ranking of No. 140 and participated in the 2019 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone, which was played in Zielona Gora, Poland.

In February, Świątek made it to the second round at the Hungarian Ladies Open. At the Ladies Open Lugano in Switzerland, Świątek upset No. 3 seed Viktória Kužmová in three sets to reach her first WTA quarterfinal. The win over the world No. 46 was the first top-50 victory in Świątek's career.[11]. She then defeated the No. 8 seed Vera Lapko and Kristýna Plíšková to reach her first WTA final which she lost to Polona Hercog in three sets.[12] Reaching the Lugano final boosted her into the Top 100 for the very first time[13].

Iga Świątek bounced back from a first-set bagel to defeat Monica Puig and reach the second week in her first-ever French Open[14]. Making her French Open main draw debut, Świątek became the second player born in the 2000s to reach week two of a major - following Amanda Anisimova's efforts at the Australian Open. Świątek lost to defending champion Simona Halep in the 4th round.[15]
