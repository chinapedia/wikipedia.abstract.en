RÁDIÓ ROCK 95.8 is a Hungarian rock music radio station. It is currently the only radio station in Hungary which broadcasts rock music exclusively.


History

On 17 May 2016, the Rádió Rock began broadcasting. The radio station aimed to gain 2,5 million listeners therefore it is available online as well. On February 1st 2019, the broadcast was terminated and Slager FM took the frequency. [1]

Rádió Rock's main principle is to give possibility to the Hungarian rock, Hungarian alternative, indie and metal music scenes.[2]
