Production

In early 2015, H. Vinoth, who had directed the successful heist film _Sathuranga Vettai_ (2014), agreed to make his next film for the production studio, Thirrupathi Brothers, who had helped distribute the earlier film. Vinoth submitted two scripts to production studio, including a sequel to his earlier film.[1] Soon after, Thirrupathi Brothers ran into financial difficulties and Vinoth went on to narrate the script of the sequel to actors Ajith Kumar and Suriya, for films to be produced by Sathyajyothi Films and Studio Green, but neither venture materialised.[2][3]

In August 2016, the original film's producer Manobala came forward and decided to produce the film himself, bringing in Arvind Swamy and Trisha to play the lead roles. Vinoth parted with his script because he was busy working on the pre-production of another film starring Karthi, so Nirmal Kumar, who had previously made _Salim_ (2014), was signed on as director.[4][5] The film subsequently began production in mid-October 2016. Arvind Swamy finished shooting his portions in March 2017,[6] while Trisha finished hers the following month.[7] Few portions of the film were shot at Penang. In June 2017, the crew has completed the filming and its a complete wrap.[8]
