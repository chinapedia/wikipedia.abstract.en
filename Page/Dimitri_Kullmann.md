DIMITRI MICHAEL KULLMANN (born 1958)[1] is a professor of neurology at the UCL Institute of Neurology,[2] University College London (UCL), and leads the synaptopathies initiative funded by the Wellcome Trust.[3] Kullmann is a member of the Queen Square Centre For Neuromuscular Disease[4] and a consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.[5][6]


Education

Kullmann was educated at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle[7] and studied physiology at Balliol College, Oxford[8] where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree and a Doctor of Philosophy degree.[9] He studied and trained at the University of Oxford and St Thomas's Hospital Medical School at the University of London.[10] His postgraduate research was supervised by Julian Jack.[11]


Research and career

Kullmann's research[12][13] investigates how synapses function in health and disease.[14] His laboratory helped to show how neurotransmitters activate different receptor subtypes in and around synapses, and resolved some controversies about the mechanisms of long-term changes in synaptic strength.[15] Genetic and autoimmune disorders of synaptic proteins (‘synaptopathies’) provide insights into the mechanisms of a broad range of neurological diseases including epilepsy and migraine.[16] Together with his colleagues, Kullmann has used these insights to devise gene therapy strategies that could be used to treat intractable epilepsy.[17][18]

The Kullmann lab[19][20] has contributed to the discovery and elucidation of silent synapses,[21] glutamate spillover, tonic inhibition,[22] long-term potentiation in interneurons,[23] neurological channelopathies[24] and Synaptopathies, gene therapy for epilepsy,[25] and mechanisms of neural oscillations.[26] Kullman serves as the editor-in-chief of the scientific journal _Brain_[27] and on the editorial board of the journal _Neuron_.[28] Before working at UCL, he did postdoctoral research with Roger Nicoll at the University of California, San Francisco.[29]

Awards and honours

Kullmann was awarded the University Gold Medal in Medicine by the University of London, in 1986.[30] and the Baly Medal by the Royal College of Physicians in 2017.[31] He was elected a Guarantor of _Brain_ in 2000,[32] elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2001,[33] a Corresponding Fellow of the American Neurological Association in 2013[34], a member of the Academia Europaea (MAE) in 2017[35] and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[36]
