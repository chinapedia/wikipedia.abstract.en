GERWALD CLAUS-BRUNNER (19 May 1972 â€“ 19 September 2016) was a German politician and member of the Pirate Party Berlin, which is a branch of the national Pirate Party. He entered the state parliament of Berlin when the Pirate party won 15 seats in the 2011 Berlin state election.[1]


Death

Claus-Brunner was found dead on 19 September 2016 along with a 29-year-old man Jan Mirko L. in an apparent murder suicide.[2][3][4][5]

The autopsy came to the result that Claus-Brunner had committed suicide and that the 29-year-old man had been killed days earlier. On 21 September, a parcel service gave an undeliverable parcel to the police; Claus-Brunner had sent it to a former longtime companion. The parcel contained a letter in which Brunner confessed to having killed the man. Brunner had been in love with him; Brunner's final twitter tweet was a photo of that man.[6]
