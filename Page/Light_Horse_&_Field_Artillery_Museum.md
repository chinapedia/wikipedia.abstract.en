The LIGHT HORSE & FIELD ARTILLERY MUSEUM is an Australian military museum located approximately 40 minutes East of Melbourne in Nar Nar Goon, Victoria.[1] It contains a number of exhibits of military items including gun carriages and cooking wagons restored by owner Bernie Dingle.[2] It also has a number of animals, including horses used in Anzac Day marches.

In 2015 it was closed to the public due to a building order from Cardinia Council, which in 2014 had ordered upgrades costing $80,000 - $100,000 including large water tanks, a sprinkler system and other changes.[3]
