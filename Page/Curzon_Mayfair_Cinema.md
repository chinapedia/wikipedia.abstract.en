The CURZON MAYFAIR CINEMA is a Grade II listed building at 37–38 Curzon Street, London W1, built in 1963–66 by H. G. Hammond for Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners, architects.[1]

Historic England have described it as "the finest surviving cinema building of the post-war period, it is also the least altered."[2] It is part of the Curzon Cinemas chain.


Closure threat

The cinema faces closure due to legal action from the property developer 38 Curzon Limited, who are turning the office space above into flats, and are claiming that noise from the cinema can be heard on the two floors above. Curzon cannot afford the £500,000 bill for soundproofing, and Rob Kenny, a Curzon director has said that they could "never obtain approval for as the auditorium and surrounding walls are listed".[3]

The issue was resolved after a petition as well as an intervention by mayor Sadiq Khan.[4]
