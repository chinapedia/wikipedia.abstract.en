JOHN CHARLES JULIAN LENNON (born 8 April 1963) is an English musician and photographer, son of The Beatles member John Lennon and his first wife Cynthia.

He was the direct inspiration for three Beatles' songs: "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" (1967), "Hey Jude" (1968), and "Good Night" (1968). His parents divorced in 1968, and he is half-brother to Sean Lennon. He has produced a number of albums starting with _Valotte_ (1984), as well as a documentary film _WhaleDreamers_ on an environmental theme. Lennon has also held exhibitions of his photography.


Early life

Julian Lennon was born on 8 April 1963 in Liverpool. He was named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, was his godfather.

Lennon inspired one of his father's most famous songs, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," whose lyrics describe a picture the boy had drawn, a watercolor painting of his friend, Lucy O'Donnell, from nursery school, surrounded by stars. Another composition of his father inspired by him was the lullaby "Good Night", the closing song of _The Beatles_ (also known as The White Album). In 1967, he attended the set of the Beatles' film _Magical Mystery Tour_.

When Julian was five years old in 1968, his parents divorced following his father's infidelity with Japanese multimedia artist Yoko Ono.[1][2][3] John Lennon married Ono on 20 March 1969, and Julian has a younger half-brother, Sean Lennon, and a stepsister, Kyoko Chan Cox.

Paul McCartney wrote "Hey Jude" to console him over the divorce; originally called "Hey Jules", McCartney changed the name because he thought that "Jude" was an easier name to sing.[4] After his parents' divorce, Julian had almost no contact with his father until the early 1970s when, at the request of his father's then short-term girlfriend, May Pang (Yoko Ono and Lennon had temporarily separated), he began to visit his father regularly. John Lennon bought him a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas 1973, and encouraged his interest in music by showing him some chords.[5][6]


Relationship with his father

Following his father's murder on 8 December 1980, Julian Lennon voiced anger and resentment towards him, saying,

  I've never really wanted to know the truth about how dad was with me. There was some very negative stuff talked about me ... like when he said I'd come out of a whisky bottle on a Saturday night. Stuff like that.[7] You think, where's the love in that? Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit ... more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.

Lennon chafed at hearing his father's peace and love stance perpetually celebrated. He told the _Daily Telegraph_, "I have to say that, from my point of view, I felt he was a hypocrite", he said, "Dad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces—no communication, adultery, divorce? You can't do it, not if you're being true and honest with yourself."[8]

Lennon was excluded from his father's will. However, a trust of £100,000 was created by his father to be shared between Julian and his half brother Sean.[9][10] Julian sued his father's estate and in 1996 reached a settlement agreement reportedly worth £20 million.[11]

By 2009, Lennon's feelings toward his father had mellowed considerably. Recalling his renewed contact with his father in the mid-1970s, he said,

  Dad and I got on a great deal better then. We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear — they were the happiest time I can remember with him.[12]


Education

Lennon was educated at Ruthin School, a boarding independent school in the town of Ruthin in Denbighshire in North Wales.[13]


Career

Music career

Lennon made his musical debut at age 11 on his father's album _Walls and Bridges_ playing drums on "Ya-Ya", later saying, "Dad, had I known you were going to put it on the album, I would've played much better!"[14] In the 1980s, according to AllMusic, he "parlayed a remarkable vocal similarity to his father into a successful singing career".[15]

Lennon enjoyed immediate success with his debut album, _Valotte_, released in 1984. Produced by Phil Ramone, it spawned two top 10 hits, the title track and "Too Late for Goodbyes", and earned Lennon a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1985. Music videos for the two hits were made by film director Sam Peckinpah and producer Martin Lewis. The song "Valotte" has remained a staple on adult contemporary radio stations. After the album's release, Paul McCartney sent Lennon a telegram wishing him good luck.[16]

His second album, 1986's _The Secret Value of Daydreaming_, was panned by critics. However, it reached number 32 on the _Billboard_ 200 chart, and produced the single "Stick Around", which was Lennon's first number 1 single on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. He recorded the song "Because", previously recorded by The Dave Clark Five, in the UK for Clark's 1986 musical _Time_.

On 1 April 1987, Julian Lennon appeared as the Baker in Mike Batt's musical _The Hunting of the Snark_ (based on Lewis Carroll's poem).[17] The all-star lineup included Roger Daltrey, Justin Hayward and Billy Connolly, with John Hurt as the narrator. The performance, a musical benefit at London's Royal Albert Hall in aid of the deaf, was attended by the Duchess of York.[18] Although Lennon never achieved the same level of success in the US as he had enjoyed with _Valotte_, his 1989 single "Now You're in Heaven" peaked at number 5 in Australia and gave him his second number 1 hit on the Album Rock Tracks chart in the US.Julian_Lennon_2000.jpgIn 1991, George Harrison played guitar on Lennon's album _Help Yourself_, which included the single "Saltwater" although he was not directly credited. The single "Saltwater" reached number 6 in the UK and topped the Australian singles charts for four weeks. During this time, Lennon contributed a cover of the Rolling Stones' "Ruby Tuesday" to the soundtrack of the television series _The Wonder Years_.

Lennon left the music business for several years in the 1990s. He followed his interests in cooking, sailing and sculpting. After he began his performing career, there was occasionally unfounded media speculation that Lennon would undertake performances with McCartney, Harrison and Ringo Starr. In the _Beatles Anthology_ series in 1995, the three surviving Beatles confirmed there was never an idea of having Julian sit in for his father as part of a Beatles reunion, with McCartney saying, "Why would we want to subject him to all of this?"

In May 1998, Lennon released the album _Photograph Smile_ to little commercial success. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as "well-crafted and melodic", and concluded by saying that it was "the kind of music that would receive greater praise if it weren't made by the son of a Beatle".[19] In 2002, he recorded a version of "When I'm Sixty-Four", from the Beatles' _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ album, for an Allstate Insurance commercial.

In 2006 he ventured into Internet businesses, including MyStore.com with Todd Meagher and Bebo founder Michael Birch.[20] In 2009 Lennon created a new partnership with Meagher and Birch called theRevolution, LLC. Through this company, Lennon released a tribute song and EP, "Lucy", honouring the memory of Lucy Vodden (née O'Donnell), the little girl who inspired the song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", with 50 per cent of the proceeds going to fund Lupus research.[21][22][23][24][25][26]

In October 2011, Lennon released the album _Everything Changes_. In 2012 he worked with music film director Dick Carruthers on the feature-length video documentary _Through the Picture Window_, which followed Lennon's journey in the making of _Everything Changes_ and includes interviews with Steven Tyler, Bono, and Paul Buchanan from The Blue Nile. _Through the Picture Window_ was also released as an app in all formats with bespoke videos for all 14 tracks from the album.[27][28][29]

Film

Lennon's first-ever tour in early 1985 was documented as part of the film _Stand By Me: A Portrait Of Julian Lennon_ — a film profile started by Sam Peckinpah, but completed by Martin Lewis after Peckinpah's death. Lennon has appeared in several other films including _The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus_ (1996, but shot in 1968), _Cannes Man_ (1996), _Imagine: John Lennon_ (1988), _Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll_ (1987), and a cameo in _Leaving Las Vegas_ (1995) as a bartender. Julian provided the voice for the title role in the animated film _David Copperfield_.[30] He was also the voice of the main character Toby the Teapot in the animated special _The Real Story of I'm a Little Teapot_ (1990).

Lennon is also the producer of the documentary called _WhaleDreamers_[31] about an aboriginal tribe in Australia and its special relationship to whales. It also touches on many environmental issues. This film has received many awards[32] and was shown at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Julian_Lennon.jpg

Photography

After photographing his half-brother Sean's music tour in 2007, Lennon took up a serious interest in photography.[33]

On 17 September 2010,[34] Lennon opened an exhibition of 35 photographs called "Timeless: The Photography of Julian Lennon" with help from long-time friend and fellow photographer Timothy White. Originally scheduled to run from 17 September to 10 October,[35] the Morrison Hotel Gallery extended it a week to end 17 October.[36] The photographs include shots of his brother Sean and U2 frontman Bono.[37]

Lennon's "Horizons" series is featured at the Emmanuel Fremin Gallery, NYC, 12 March – 2 May 2015.[38]

Book

Shortly after the death of his father, Lennon began collecting Beatles memorabilia. In 2010, he published a book describing his collection, entitled: _Beatles Memorabilia: The Julian Lennon Collection_.[39][40]

Charity work

Lennon founded The White Feather Foundation in 2009. Its mission "embraces environmental and humanitarian issues and in conjunction with partners from around the world helps to raise funds for the betterment of all life, and to honour those who have truly made a difference."[41] Its name came from a conversation Lennon once had with his father. "Dad once said to me that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK – that we were all going to be OK – the message would come to me in the form of a white feather. ... the white feather has always represented peace to me."[42][43] Julian_Lennon_2015.jpg


Personal life

Lennon has been quoted as having a reasonably "cordial" relationship with Ono, whilst getting along very well with her son, his half-brother Sean. Julian saw Sean perform live for the first time in Paris, on 12 November 2006 at La Boule Noire and he and Sean spent time together on Sean's tour in 2007.[44]

Julian has never married nor has children of his own, revealing that his difficult relationship with his famous father had discouraged him from doing so. He said that, unlike his father, he wanted to be mature enough to cope with fatherhood. “He was young and didn’t know what the hell he was doing," Julian said. "That’s the reason I haven’t had children yet. I didn’t want to do the same thing. No, I’m not ready. I want to know who I am first.”[45]

In commemoration of John Lennon's 70th birthday and as a statement for peace, Lennon and his mother, Cynthia, unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in his home town of Liverpool, on 9 October 2010.[46]

He now resides in Monaco.

Lennon remains friends with his father's former bandmate, Paul McCartney, though they experienced a public falling out in 2011 when Lennon was not invited to McCartney's wedding to Nancy Shevell.[47]
