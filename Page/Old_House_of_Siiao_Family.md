The OLD HOUSE OF SIIAO FAMILY () is a former residence in Jiadong Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan.


History

The Siiao family came to Taiwan from Guangdong and worked as businessmen. The house was constructed during the reign of Xianfeng Emperor during the Qing Dynasty. After the handover of Taiwan to Japan from Qing Dynasty in 1895, there was local conflict between the locals and Japanese government which stirred up some shooting. Some of the bullet holes remains are still visible on the room walls. The house was then later registered as Class 3 historical site.[1]


Architecture

The house was constructed with two courtyards and five blocks with Hakka architecture style. The five blocks are the entrance hall, ancestor's memorial tablets room and Gods of heaven and ground shrine room and dwelling places.[2]
