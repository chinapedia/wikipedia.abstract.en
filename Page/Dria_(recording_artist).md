Dria started her solo career when she was featured in Ray J's single "ATM".[5] The single featured her for the first time under the artistic name of "Dria", and was later used for licensing for the show “Love and Hip Hop Hollywood”.[6] It was initially written by The Frontrunnaz team as a song for Miley Cyrus or Rihanna. Ray j's management team heard Dria's vocal on the song and decided to keep her on the song as a feature. Dria's voice is featured on the Pre-Chorus and the Chorus of the song.[7][8] ATM received generally positive reviews with ThisisRnB describing it as a "bouncy single for his unreleased album"[9] and Sue Robinson (from AXS) commenting on how "the trio [Ray J, Dria and Migos] creates just the right blend to this energized rhythm which contains a multitude of sexual innuendos – possibly a hint to fans on what can be expected in the upcoming studio album"[10]

2015–2016: Logic, Lecrae and Dove nomination

In 2015, Dria's solo career took off: In 2015, she was a featured artist on the mixtape release: "Frontrunnaz presents Ready, Set, Go ft. Dria, Keme Davis and Dutchess"[11] produced by The Frontrunnaz. That year she also collaborated with Drake in the production of the soundtrack for Serena Williams’ Signature Statement Fall Collection for the HSN with KIA STYLE360.[12]

While working with her writing partner, Christopher Thornton in Los Angeles, they were invited to an impromptu recording session with rapper Logic. After being asked to stay another day for more vocals, she would go on to co-write “Till the end” and sing background vocals on 4 songs on his debut album “Under Pressure”.[13][14][15] As the relationship and success with Logic progressed, Dria was hired to compose and sing on Logic's 2nd and 3rd albums. She and Chris were invited to Hawaii to provide vocals on 8 songs on the “Under Pressure” album including one co-write and a featured artist spot on "Stainless".[16]

Logic's successful hip-hop album The Incredible True Story (2015) debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 in the US and sold 135,000 album-equivalent units and 118,000 copies in its first week.[17] The album debuted at number 1 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, surpassing Under Pressure, which opened at number 2.[18][19]

Dria was featured on Lecrae's Illuminate[20] released in February 2016, where she performed the chorus and background vocals. Illuminate was released as an exclusive pre-download for the people that preordered Lecrae's new book, Unashamed, that was released on May of the same year.

On August 2016 she was featured in Young Thug's new album "No, my name is Jeffery" with additional vocals as well as in Monn's "Not Missin U", on which the Crssbeat critics stated "The sweet vocals of Dria are one of the key elements which flow through the track alongside the melodies which have been made."[21] In September 2016, Dria teased in her Twitter account about a new project to come that was "completely God driven" and she was very excited about.[22]

2017– present: Logic, Meek Mill and solo career
