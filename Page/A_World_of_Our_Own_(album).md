_A WORLD OF OUR OWN_ is the fourth studio album by the Australian group The Seekers. The album was released in 1965. In some countries, the album was titled THE SEEKERS. The album peaked at number 19 in the Billboard 200[1] and number 5 in the United Kingdom.[2]


Reception

Richie Unterberber from AllMusic said; "The title track is an acceptable pop-folk song in the "I'll Never Find Another You" fashion. But the rest is rather ho-hum fare in the style of Peter, Paul & Mary with a slightly more prominent beat. Bruce Woodley sneaks in with a couple of compositions, but most of this is traditional folk with far less pop flair than Tom Springfield's songs, such as "This Land Is Your Land," "Allentown Jail," "Just a Closer Walk With Thee," and "You Can Tell the World." A couple early Bob Dylan covers and a version of Ian Tyson's "Four Strong Winds" reinforce the sense of a group whose sound was still more suited for 1963 than 1965, on album at least." [3]
