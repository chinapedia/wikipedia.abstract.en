CORAZONES DE FUEGO ("Hearts of Fire") was a Colombian television anthology drama series, broadcast three times a week on daytime between 1992 and 1994 on the state-owned channel Cadena Uno. It was produced by Producciones Tevecine.

All episodes were self-conclusive, and many dealt, besides the typical melodrama topics, with the mysterious and supernatural, particularly in the 1992 season.
