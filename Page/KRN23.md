KRN23 is an investigational human monoclonal IgG‚ÇÅ antibody targeted against the phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).[1] Initially discovered by Kyowa Hakko Kirin, it is now being developed by Ultragenyx and is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).[2]

XLH is genetic disorder affecting phosphate metabolism within the body, which results in hypophosphatemia. The disease is characterized by overproduction of the FGF23 hormone in bone cells. The FGF23 hormone is responsible for blocking phosphate re-absorption by the kidney and the suppression of the vitamin D dependent phosphate absorption by the intestine. Due to the excess activity of FGF23, phosphate levels in the blood are abnormally low, which affects the constitution of bone.[3] Thus, KRN23 is designed to bind to the FGF23 receptor and inhibit the excess activity of the FGF23 hormone within the body.
