LEONISA is a Colombia-based global company that manufactures and sells women's lingerie, shapewear, swimwear, men’s underwear, and activewear[1] for both men and women.[2]


History

Leonisa was established in November 1956 by the Urrea brothers, Joaquin Eduardo and Julio Ernesto, who specialized in women’s innerwear.[3] After establishing their first manufacturing plant, the brothers created “The Diamond Point Bra,” which made them pioneers of South America’s intimate apparel.[4][5]

Leonisa began retail sales in 1956. These consist of Leonisa Stores, duty-free shops, factory outlets, hypermarkets, department stores and specialty apparel stores. As of 2014, there were retail stores in the United States, Spain, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal and Puerto Rico.[6]

In 1965, Leonisa built a manufacturing plant in Costa Rica to meet the demands of Central American markets.[7] In 1989, Leonisa entered the European market targeting Spain first and later expanding to the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy.[8]

In 1993, Leonisa launched the “Magic Up” brassiere.[9] The same year, they created a catalog sales channel to sell Leonisa garments directly to customers on a monthly basis. As of today, the catalog sales channel operates in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Puerto Rico.[10]

Leonisa has sponsored the Miss Colombia swimwear category since 2007. Each year Leonisa develops swimwear campaigns that are focused on Miss Colombia.[11] Leonisa also sponsored Miss Panama in 2009 and 2010.

In June 2009, Leonisa introduced their Online Store, initially intended for the US and Canadian markets. As of 2014, Leonisa had an online presence with local distribution in over twelve countries, with sales in over 120 countries.[12]


Products

Women’s intimate apparel

From the beginning, Leonisa has focused on women’s innerwear and currently has product lines for shapewear, bras and panties. Within each category of women’s innerwear are different collections that offer benefits to meet specific needs, like postpartum and post-surgical shapewear, push-up bras, and sports underwear.

In 2009, Leonisa introduced a brand that targets girls and women between the ages of 14 and 25.[13]

Leonisa is known for its shapewear, featuring four different compression levels, each employing Leonisa's trademark compression technology.[14] In 2012, the company launched a new line of smart fabric shapewear and post-surgical compression garments.[15]

Swimwear

Launched in the 1990s, the swimwear line offers basic swimwear, one-piece swimsuits, control and slimming swimwear, push up swimsuit tops and cover ups, and other products.[16]

LEO

Leonisa launched its first mens underwear collection in 1975 under the Airell brand. In the 1980s, this men’s line was re-branded as LEO. The LEO brand offers men's underwear and shapewear, including three levels of compression.[17]

Activewear

Leonisa has Activewear lines for both women and for men.[18][19] Leonisa ActiveLife and Leo ActiveLife includes breathable underwear,[20][21] leggings (often with incorporated shaping fabric such as DuraFit' and PowerSlim'),[22] and sports bras.


Campaigns

Since 2005, Leonisa has partnered with health companies in a campaign against breast cancer that seeks to raise awareness among women about the importance of early detection.[23] As a part of this campaign, Leonisa has developed educational teams in schools, universities, and shopping centers. They have conducted forums aimed at the community and primary care physicians. Leonisa developed the app “Leonisa Takes Care of You” to remind women of the right time to do their breast self-exam.[24]
