TANGUY NDOMBELE ALVARO (born 28 December 1996) is a French professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur.


Club career

Early career

Ndombele was born in France to parents of D.R. Congolese descent.[1] As a child, he played at FC Épinay Athlético, a club based in Épinay-sous-Sénart, about 20 kilometres south-east of Paris, in Essone. He then moved to Brittany when he was just 14, in order to play for Guingamp, where he spent three seasons. He wasn't offered a professional contract at the end of his development. At only 16, he made his senior debut, on 11 January 2014 with the reserves, by replacing Vital N'Simba near the final whistle.

He then signed for SC Amiens, who'd just been relegated from French Ligue 2 in June 2014, he took this as an opportunity to trial at numerous clubs (Auxerre, Caen, and Angers) but wasn't signed. The issue was that N'dombele was criticised for being "overweight", this was the main reason that he wasn't signed by clubs, even though trialists were aware that he was a good playmaker.

N'dombele played 2 seasons in Championnat National 3 with the Amiens reserve team. He only played one game during the 2014-2015 season, the 8 November 2014, once again, coming on late in the match. He becomes a regular during the 2015-2016 season, taking part in 18 matches. He starts for the first time on 5 September 2015 at the age of 18 and 9 months.

Lyon

On 31 August 2017, Ndombele moved to Lyon on a one-year loan. According to L'Équipe, Lyon paid €2 million for the loan. Lyon also secured an option to sign him permanently for €8 million, plus a possible €250,000 in bonuses and 20% of any profit made should he be transferred from Lyon to another club.[2]

Ndombele made his competitive debut for Lyon's first team in the 2–0 Ligue 1 away loss to Paris Saint-Germain on 17 September 2017; he started the match and was replaced by Christopher Martins in the 72nd minute.[3] On 15 February 2018, Ndombele scored a goal (his first career competitive goal for Lyon's first team) in the 46th minute of their 3–1 home win over Villarreal CF in the round of 32 first leg of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League.[4]

Tottenham Hotspur

On 2 July 2019, Ndombele signed for Tottenham Hotspur in a deal worth €62 million (£55.45 million) plus up to €10 million (£8.97 million) in add-ons.[5] Ndombele made his debut in the 2019 International Champions Cup against Juventus. Within a minute of being substituted on and with his first touch in a Tottenham shirt, Ndombele assisted Lucas Moura.[6] Tottenham won the game 3-2.


International career

On 11 October 2018, Ndombele made his senior France debut by coming on as a substitute for Paul Pogba in the 67th minute of the friendly match against Iceland at the Stade du Roudourou in Guingamp that ended in a 2–2 draw.[7]
