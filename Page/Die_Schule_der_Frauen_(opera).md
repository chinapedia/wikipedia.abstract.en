The opera was premiered as a 1-act work, _The Wives School_, in English in Kentucky in 1955.[1]

The full 3-act German version of the opera premiered at the Salzburg Festival in 1957 with Walter Berry as Molière (Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) who sits on the stage giving commentary but also plays three roles himself. The rest of the cast include Kurt Böhme as Arnolphe, Anneliese Rothenberger as Agnes, Christa Ludwig as Georgette, Nicolai Gedda as Horace, and Alois Pernerstorfer as Oronte, with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by George Szell.
