Reviews

_Kirkus Reviews_ seemed to like this book, in spite of pointing out a few historical errors.[2] _Book Reporter_, as well, liked this book, saying, "It reads well and reminds us of the difficulty posed in intelligence work, especially at the beginning of the Cold War with Russia."[3]

_Publishers Weekly_ has a positive view of this book, saying, "It's a testament to the authors' skill and wide experience that the pages seem to turn themselves."[4] _American Thinker_ has a story about W. E. B. Griffin and his books. Of _The Assassination Option_ this publication says, "Anyone who enjoys historical fiction and a military thriller will not want to pass this book up."[5]

If it's excitement you are looking for, this book is the wrong venue for you. The most exciting dialog in the book: Captain Cronley: "Soldier, salute when you enter the office of a superior officer!". Soldier: "Yes, sir. Sorry sir. No excuse sir.". On the other hand, if you crave reading about bureaucratic minutia, you will love it.
