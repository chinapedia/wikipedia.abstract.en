President of the University of Notre Dame

As president, he addressed the material needs of the university, particularly the debt and the lack of sufficient space for new students. When he assumed the presidency, more than 1,100 students lived off campus, only 135 students were paying for room and board, and the University had a $10,000 debt. With fund-raising money, Walsh at once concentrated his efforts on the construction of a dormitory system. He built Freshman Hall in 1922 and Sophomore Hall in 1923. During 1924 and 1925 he began construction of Morrissey, Howard and Lyons.[5] By 1925 enrollment had increased to 2,500 students, of which 1,471 lived on campus. Faculty members increased from 90 to 175 during Walsh's presidency. He also completed South Dining Hall by 1927. On the academic side, credit hours were reduced to encourage in-depth study and Latin and Greek were no longer required for a degree. Walsh also expanded the College of Commerce, which had been organized in 1920. In 1928 three years of college were made a prerequisite for the study of law.[6] He also enlarged the stadium,[7] and built the memorial and entrance transept of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.[8]
