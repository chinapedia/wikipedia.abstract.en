LUCKY ME! is an instant noodle brand first introduced in 1989 and is currently owned and marketed by Monde Nissin.


History

In 1989, the company ventured into the instant noodle segment with Lucky Me!. It launched Instant Mami, noodle with soup in pouches, in Beef and Chicken variants. Eventually, these became the fastest selling products like beef and chicken flavor. 1991 saw the introduction of Lucky Me! Pancit Canton, the first dry stir-fry pouched noodles in the Philippine market. This was then followed in 1995 by Lucky Me! Supreme in La Paz Batchoy flavor, marketed as the first Filipino dish-flavored no-cook cup noodles, and Lucky Me! Special in 2009, which consists of noodles based on local and international flavors such as Lomi (egg noodles in seafood flavor), Jjamppong (spicy Korean noodles), Curly Spaghetti, Baked Mac, and Mac & Cheez.

Kantar Worldpanel cited Lucky Me! in their 2014 Brand Footprint Report as the most chosen and purchased consumer brand in the Philippines, reaching almost all Filipino households.[1]
