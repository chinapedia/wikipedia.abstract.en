Story

Henri Betti composed the music of _Mais qu'est-ce que j'ai ?_ with the lyrics by Édith Piaf who had written them for Yves Montand. On August 18, 1947, the song was registered at the SACEM. When Henri Betti proposed the song to Yves Montand, he also proposed _C'est si bon_ that he had composed with the lyrics of André Hornez at the same time _Mais qu'est-ce que j'ai ?_ and registered at the Sacem the same day.
