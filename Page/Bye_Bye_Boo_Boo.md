Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode an A-, he explained his rating by saying, "“Bye Bye Boo Boo” is a classic, a worthy illustration of all the show can be when it takes a bunch of its characters both familiar and new, gives them all clear motivations, and lets them bounce off one another. Tina and Louise get to bond over their respective sets of crazed feelings, a bunch of excitable preteens almost drench an undersized boy singer with vomit, and said singer instantly recognizes Louise the moment she slaps him again. This is pretty much everything I could ever want from a Bob’s Burgers episode, and it’s particularly exhilarating to watch this after one of the show’s rare misfires. I didn’t doubt the show is still going to hit way, way more than it misses, but this was a damn home run."[1]

The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.31 million people.[2]
