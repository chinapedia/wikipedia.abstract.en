The JOINT DECLARATION OF POPE FRANCIS AND BISHOP MUNIB YOUNAN was signed during a service on Reformation Day, 31 October 2016, at the Lund Cathedral in Lund, Sweden, between Pope Francis, who as the Bishop of the Church of Rome is the pontiff of the Catholic Church, and Bishop Munib Younan, the President of the Lutheran World Federation. This was the first time leaders of the Roman Church and the Lutheran World Federation had met and celebrated the Reformation. The service heralded 12 months of events leading up to the 500th anniversary next year of Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses to a church door in Wittenberg, Germany.[1]
