RYE VALLEY is an unincorporated community in Baker County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.[1] It lies along Dixie Creek, a tributary of the Burnt River, about southeast of Baker City.[2] It is slightly west of Interstate 84 near Weatherby and Dixie.[3]

The community is named for a native grass used as forage for pack animals important to the region's immigrants and miners in the 1860s. A Rye Valley post office opened on September 27, 1869, and operated intermittently between then and September 14, 1935. Nayson S. Whitcomb was the first postmaster.[4]

On July 24, 2014, a wildfire started by lightning happened in Rye Valley. The lightning first struck on Bureau of Land Management lands; however, winds quickly drove it onto forestlands protected by the Oregon Department of Forestry. The fire took three days to fully contain.[5]
