_THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE_ is a 2015 documentary film by Tom Donahue that focuses on our superficial understanding of war trauma and the failed policies that result. Observing the systemic neglect, the film argues for significant internal change and offers a roadmap for hope.[1] The film premiered at DOC NYC in November 2015.[2]


Synopsis

_Thank You for Your Service_ chronicles mental health amongst U.S. military veterans. The film interweaves the stories of four struggling Iraq War veterans with candid interviews of top military and civilian leaders. Among the interviewees are Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Generals David Petraeus and Loree Sutton, Sebastian Junger, Nicholas Kristof, Dexter Filkins, General Peter Chiarelli, Gary Sinise, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, Senator Patty Murray, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Colonels Larry Wilkerson and Dave Sutherland.[3] Called “gut-wrenching” and “important” by _The New York Times_, the film is an examination of failed mental health policy in the U.S. military.[4] The film argues the creation of a Behavioral Health Corps is necessary to ensure accountability in the military chain of command toward mental health.[5]

Impact

U.S. Senator Angus King (I-ME) wrote about the film:

Legislation based on this film has been proposed to Congress in 2018 under Congressman Seth Moulton as the H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This would require an addressing of PTSD issues and the creation of mental health services in all sectors of the military[17].


Reception

In its review, _The Hollywood Reporter_ wrote, “If this film cannot spur politicians to act, nothing will.”[18]

_The Los Angeles Times_ review stated, "With the same clarity and fluency he brought to far sunnier material in _Casting By_, Donahue pinpoints the devastating intersection of personal trauma and institutional neglect in an age of perpetual war."[19]

_Film Journal International_ wrote, "Eliciting outrage and shame in equal measure, _Thank You for Your Service_ details the lack of mental-health support offered to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces—and the tragic consequence of that neglect."[20]
