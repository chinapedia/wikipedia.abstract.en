The identity of the LONGEST WORD IN ENGLISH depends upon the definition of what constitutes a word in the English language, as well as how length should be compared. In addition to words derived naturally from the language's roots (without any known intentional invention), English allows new words to be formed by coinage and construction; place names may be considered words; technical terms may be arbitrarily long. Length may be understood in terms of orthography and number of written letters, or (less commonly) phonology and the number of phonemes.

Major dictionaries

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is _pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis_, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles,[9] specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis. The word was deliberately coined to be the longest word in English, and has since been used in a close approximation of its originally intended meaning, lending at least some degree of validity to its claim.[10]

The _Oxford English Dictionary_ contains _pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism_ (30 letters).

_Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary_ does not contain _antidisestablishmentarianism_ (28 letters), as the editors found no widespread, sustained usage of the word in its original meaning. The longest word in that dictionary is _electroencephalographically_ (27 letters).[11]

The longest non-technical word in major dictionaries is _floccinaucinihilipilification_ at 29 letters. Consisting of a series of Latin words meaning "nothing" and defined as "the act of estimating something as worthless"; its usage has been recorded as far back as 1741.[12][13][14]

Ross Eckler has noted that most of the longest English words are not likely to occur in general text, meaning non-technical present-day text seen by casual readers, in which the author did not specifically intend to use an unusually long word. According to Eckler, the longest words likely to be encountered in general text are _deinstitutionalization_ and _counterrevolutionaries_, with 22 letters each.[15]

A computer study of over a million samples of normal English prose found that the longest word one is likely to encounter on an everyday basis is _uncharacteristically_, at 20 letters.[16]

The word _internationalization_ is abbreviated "i18n", the embedded number representing the number of letters between the first and the last.[17][18][19]


Creations of long words

Coinages

In his play _Assemblywomen_ (_Ecclesiazousae_), the ancient Greek comedic playwright Aristophanes created a word of 171 letters (183 in the transliteration below), which describes a dish by stringing together its ingredients:

    Lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon.

Henry Carey's farce _Chrononhotonthologos_ (1743) holds the opening line: "Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?"

Thomas Love Peacock put these creations into the mouth of the phrenologist Mr. Cranium in his 1816 romp _Headlong Hall_: _osteosarchaematosplanchnochondroneuromuelous_ (44 characters) and _osseocarnisanguineoviscericartilaginonervomedullary_ (51 characters).

James Joyce made up nine 100-letter words plus one 101-letter word in his novel _Finnegans Wake_, the most famous of which is Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk. Appearing on the first page, it allegedly represents the symbolic thunderclap associated with the fall of Adam and Eve. As it appears nowhere else except in reference to this passage, it is generally not accepted as a real word. Sylvia Plath made mention of it in her semi-autobiographical novel _The Bell Jar_, when the protagonist was reading _Finnegans Wake_.

"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", the 34-letter title of a song from the movie _Mary Poppins_, does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a proper noun defined in reference to the song title. The attributed meaning is "a word that you say when you don't know what to say." The idea and invention of the word is credited to songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman.

Agglutinative constructions

The English language permits the legitimate extension of existing words to serve new purposes by the addition of prefixes and suffixes. This is sometimes referred to as agglutinative construction. This process can create arbitrarily long words: for example, the prefixes _pseudo_ (false, spurious) and _anti_ (against, opposed to) can be added as many times as desired. A word like _anti-aircraft_ (pertaining to the defense against aircraft) is easily extended to _anti-anti-aircraft_ (pertaining to counteracting the defense against aircraft, a legitimate concept) and can from there be prefixed with an endless stream of "anti-"s, each time creating a new level of counteraction. More familiarly, the addition of numerous "great"s to a relative, e.g. great-great-great-grandfather, can produce words of arbitrary length. In musical notation, an 8192nd note may be called a _semihemidemisemihemidemisemihemidemisemiquaver_.

_Antidisestablishmentarianism_ is the longest common example of a word formed by agglutinative construction.

Technical terms

'']] A number of scientific naming schemes can be used to generate arbitrarily long words.

The IUPAC nomenclature for organic chemical compounds is open-ended, giving rise to the 189,819-letter chemical name _Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine_ for the protein also known as titin, which is involved in striated muscle formation. In nature, DNA molecules can be much bigger than protein molecules and therefore potentially be referred to with much longer chemical names. For example, the wheat chromosome 3B contains almost 1 billion base pairs,[20] so the sequence of one of its strands, if written out in full like _Adenilyladenilylguanilylcystidylthymidyl..._, would be about 8 billion letters long. The longest published word, _Acetylseryltyrosylseryliso...serine_, referring to the coat protein of a certain strain of tobacco mosaic virus (), is 1,185 letters long, and appeared in the American Chemical Society's Chemical Abstracts Service in 1964 and 1966.[21] In 1965, the Chemical Abstracts Service overhauled its naming system and started discouraging excessively long names. In 2011, a dictionary broke this record with a 1909-letter word describing the _trpA_ protein ().[22]

John Horton Conway and Landon Curt Noll developed an open-ended system for naming powers of 10, in which one __, coming from the Latin name for 6560, is the name for 10³⁽⁶⁵⁶⁰⁺¹⁾ = 10¹⁹⁶⁸³. Under the long number scale, it would be 10⁶⁽⁶⁵⁶⁰⁾ = 10³⁹³⁶⁰.

_Gammaracanthuskytodermogammarus loricatobaicalensis_ is sometimes cited as the longest binomial name—it is a kind of amphipod. However, this name, proposed by B. Dybowski, was invalidated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in 1929 after being petitioned by Mary J. Rathbun to take up the case.[23]

_Parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides_ is the longest accepted binomial name. It is a species of soldier fly.[24]

_Aequeosalinocalcalinoceraceoaluminosocupreovitriolic_, at 52 letters, describing the spa waters at Bath, England, is attributed to Dr. Edward Strother (1675–1737).[25] The word is composed of the following elements:

-   Aequeo: equal (Latin, aequo[26])
-   Salino: containing salt (Latin, salinus)
-   Calcalino: calcium (Latin, calx)
-   Ceraceo: waxy (Latin, _cera_)
-   Aluminoso: alumina (Latin)
-   Cupreo: from "copper"
-   Vitriolic: resembling vitriol


Notable long words

Place names

]] in North Wales]]

The longest officially recognized place name in an English-speaking country is _Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu_ (57 letters), which is a hill in New Zealand. The name is in the Māori language. A longer and widely recognised version of the name is Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu (85 letters), which appears on the signpost at the location (see the photo on this page). In Māori, the digraphs _ng_ and _wh_ are each treated as single letters.

In Canada, the longest place name is _Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Guilford, Harburn, Bruton, Havelock, Eyre and Clyde_, a township in Ontario, at 61 letters or 68 non-space characters.[27]

The longest non-contrived place name in the United Kingdom which is a single non-hyphenated word is Cottonshopeburnfoot (19 letters) and the longest which is hyphenated is Sutton-under-Whitestonecliffe (29 characters).

The longest place name in the United States (45 letters) is _Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg_, a lake in Webster, Massachusetts. It means "Fishing Place at the Boundaries – Neutral Meeting Grounds" and is sometimes facetiously translated as "you fish your side of the water, I fish my side of the water, nobody fishes the middle". The lake is also known as Webster Lake.[28] The longest hyphenated names in the U.S. are _Winchester-on-the-Severn_, a town in Maryland, and _Washington-on-the-Brazos_, a notable place in Texas history.

The longest official geographical name in Australia is Mamungkukumpurangkuntjunya.[29] It has 26 letters and is a Pitjantjatjara word meaning "where the Devil urinates".[30]

In Ireland, the longest English placename at 19 letters is Newtownmountkennedy in County Wicklow.

Personal names

_Guinness World Records_ formerly contained a category for longest personal name used.

-   From about 1975 to 1985, the recordholder was Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Frederick Gerald Hubert Irvin John Kenneth Lloyd Martin Nero Oliver Paul Quincy Randolph Sherman Thomas Uncas Victor William Xerxes Yancy Zeus Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorffvoralternwarengewissenhaftschaferswessenschafewarenwohlgepflegeundsorgfaltigkeitbeschutzenvonangreifendurchihrraubgierigfeindewelchevoralternzwolftausendjahresvorandieerscheinenwanderersteerdemenschderraumschiffgebrauchlichtalsseinursprungvonkraftgestartseinlangefahrthinzwischensternartigraumaufdersuchenachdiesternwelchegehabtbewohnbarplanetenkreisedrehensichundwohinderneurassevonverstandigmenschlichkeitkonntefortplanzenundsicherfreuenanlebenslanglichfreudeundruhemitnichteinfurchtvorangreifenvonandererintelligentgeschopfsvonhinzwischensternartigraum, Senior (746 letters), also known as Wolfe+585, Senior.
-   After 1985 Guinness briefly awarded the record to a newborn girl with a longer name. The category was removed shortly afterward.

Long birth names are often coined in protest of naming laws or for other personal reasons.

-   The naming law in Sweden was challenged by parents Lasse Diding and Elisabeth Hallin, who proposed the given name "Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116" for their child (pronounced , 43 characters), which was rejected by a district court in Halmstad, southern Sweden.

Words with certain characteristics of notable length

-   _Schmaltzed_ and _strengthed_ (10 letters) appear to be the longest monosyllabic words recorded in _The Oxford English Dictionary_, while _scraunched_ and _scroonched_ appear to be the longest monosyllabic words recorded in _Webster's Third New International Dictionary_; but _squirrelled_ (11 letters) is the longest if pronounced as one syllable only (as permitted in _The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ and _Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary_ at _squirrel_, and in _Longman Pronunciation Dictionary_). _Schtroumpfed_ (12 letters) was coined by Umberto Eco, while _broughammed_ (11 letters) was coined by William Harmon after _broughamed_ (10 letters) was coined by George Bernard Shaw.
-   _Strengths_ is the longest word in the English language containing only one vowel.[31]
-   _Euouae_, a medieval musical term, is the longest English word consisting only of vowels, and the word with the most consecutive vowels. However, the "word" itself is simply a mnemonic consisting of the vowels to be sung in the phrase "seculorum Amen" at the end of the lesser doxology. (Although _u_ was often used interchangeably with _v_, and the variant "Evovae" is occasionally used, the _v_ in these cases would still be a vowel.)
-   The longest word with no repeated letters is _subdermatoglyphic_.[32]
-   The longest word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight-letter _Aegilops_, a grass genus. However, this is arguably both Latin and a proper noun. There are several six-letter English words with their letters in alphabetical order, including _abhors_, _almost_, _begins_, _biopsy_, _chimps_ and _chintz_.[33] There are few 7-letter words, such as "billowy".
-   The longest words recorded in OED with each vowel only once, and in order, are _abstemiously_, _affectiously_, and _tragediously_ (OED). _Fracedinously_ and _gravedinously_ (constructed from adjectives in OED) have thirteen letters; _Gadspreciously_, constructed from _Gadsprecious_ (in OED), has fourteen letters. _Facetiously_ is among the few other words directly attested in OED with single occurrences of all six vowels (counting _y_ as a vowel).
-   The longest single palindromic word in English is _rotavator_, another name for a rotary tiller for breaking and aerating soil.

Typed words

-   The longest words typable with only the left hand using conventional hand placement on a QWERTY keyboard are _tesseradecades_, _aftercataracts_,[34] and the more common but sometimes hyphenated _sweaterdresses_.[35] Using the right hand alone, the longest word that can be typed is _johnny-jump-up_, or, excluding hyphens, _monimolimnion_[36] and _phyllophyllin_.
-   The longest English word typable using only the top row of letters has 11 letters: _rupturewort_. Similar words with 10 letters include: _pepperwort_, _perpetuity_, _proprietor_, _requietory_, _repertoire_, _tripertite_, _pourriture_ and (fittingly) _typewriter_. The word _teetertotter_ (used in North American English) is longer at 12 letters, although it is usually spelled with a hyphen.
-   The longest using only the middle row is _shakalshas_ (10 letters). Nine-letter words include _flagfalls_, _galahads_ and _alfalfas_.
-   Since the bottom row contains no vowels, no standard words can be formed. Exceptions might include _Zzz_, seen in some dictionaries to denote sleep, or _m{{`}}_, the clitic form of _my_.[37]
-   The longest words typable by alternating left and right hands are _antiskepticism_ and _leucocytozoans_ respectively.[38]
-   On a Dvorak keyboard, the longest "left-handed" words are _epopoeia_, _jipijapa_, _peekapoo_, and _quiaquia_.[39] Other such long words are _papaya_, _Kikuyu_, _opaque_, and _upkeep_.[40] _Kikuyu_ is typed entirely with the index finger, and so the longest one-fingered word on the Dvorak keyboard. There are no vowels on the right-hand side, and so the longest "right-handed" word is crwth.
