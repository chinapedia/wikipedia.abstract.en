FERNANDO DIEGO PELLEGRINO (born 31 March 1986) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Huracán, on loan from Defensa y Justicia.[1][2]


Career

Pellegrino began in the youth ranks of River Plate. He failed to make an appearance for River Plate and left in 2008. His spell with the club did include a loan spell to Italian Serie C1 side Salernitana, but, again, he didn't feature.[3][4] After returning from Salernitana and leaving River Plate, Pellegrino completed a permanent move to Instituto. However, a year later he departed after making just one league appearance.[5][6] A move to Primera B Nacional club Ferro Carril Oeste followed and he made his league debut on 5 May 2010 in a 0–1 win versus Quilmes.[7][8] Two further appearances came in 2009–10 for Ferro Carril Oeste.[9]

Later in 2010, Pellegrino spent a season on loan at Argentine Primera División team Gimnasia y Esgrima but didn't play a match.[10] After an unsuccessful spell with Gimnasia, he went back to Ferro before completing a transfer to Atlanta of Primera B Nacional.[11][12] Twenty-five league appearances followed for Atlanta. On 6 July 2012, Pellegrino joined Defensa y Justicia. His debut for the team came on 11 August against Nueva Chicago. He went on to play ninety league matches for Defensa y Justicia in three seasons, including nineteen in the Primera División after the club won promotion in 2013–14.[13]

Ahead of the 2015 Argentine Primera División season, Pellegrino joined Banfield on loan. Just seven appearances in all competitions came before he returned to his parent club. On 10 January 2016, Pellegrino agreed to join another Primera División team, Arsenal de Sarandí, on loan until 2017.[14][15] Thirty league appearances followed.[16] In July 2017, Pellegrino joined Primera B Nacional side Sarmiento on loan.[17][18] He made his Sarmiento debut in a Round of 32 Copa Argentina tie against Sacachispas on 6 September.[19] On 7 August 2018, Huracán completed the loan signing of Pellegrino.[20] He returned on 30 June 2019.[21]

On 5 July 2019, Pellegrino rejoined Huracán for a second loan stint.[22]
