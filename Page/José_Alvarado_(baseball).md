Professional career

Alvarado was signed as a pitcher out of Venezuela in 2012, when he was only 16 years old. He pitched his first two seasons in the Venezuelan Summer League, where he was used as a starter, posting a 3-11 total record with an ERA of 1.97 in 2013. In 2014, Alvarado was on the Rays rookie league team, he started 11 games, going 1-5 with a 3.79 era. In 2015, Alvarado still played in rookie league, and struggled mightily in 5 starts, posting an era of 9.53.[2] In 2016 he converted to the bullpen and improved dramatically, posting a 3.06 ERA between Low-A and High-A with an 85/55 K/BB in 71 innings. In 2017, Alvarado played for the Montgomery Biscuts, where he posted a 2-1 record in 9 games (11.1 innings) with an ERA of 2.38.[3]

Tampa Bay Rays

On May 3, Alvarado was called up directly from Double-A Montgomery to give the Rays a left-handed option out of the bullpen. He was only 21 when he received the call up. Alvarado made his debut the same day, getting hit hard and allowing 3 runs on 2 hits in his only inning of work. He calmed down after his debut, only allowing one run in his next 10 appearances.[4] On August 4, 2017, Alvarado pitched an immaculate inning against the Milwaukee Brewers in a game at Tropicana Field. He finished the season 0-3 with a 3.64 ERA in innings.

In 2018, Alvarado was a key contributor to the Rays bullpen, specifically in late, high leverage situations. Overall, Alvarado finished the season with a 2.39 earned run average (second on team), 8 saves (third on team), 31 holds (tied with teammate Chaz Roe for most in the American League), an 11.3 strikeout per nine (highest on team) in 64 innings over 70 games (second most on team).[5]
