MIN HLA HTUT (, ; also known as SAW MIN PHYU (စောမင်းဖြူ); b. 1388/89) was a princess of Ava. She was the only daughter of King Tarabya of Ava and Queen Min Hla Myat of Ava and sister of King Min Nyo of Ava.[1]

Hla Htut was the first wife of her half cousin Prince Thihathu of Ava. They were married by King Minkhaung I.[2] Her marriage to Thihathu, who was six years her junior, did not last. In 1415, Thihathu divorced her before marrying his then widowed sister-in-law Saw Min Hla. King Minkhaung then married Hla Htut to Saw Shwe Khet, her half cousin, twice removed.[3][4] They had a daughter named Shin Yun, who later became wife of Gov. Min Maha of Prome.[5]
