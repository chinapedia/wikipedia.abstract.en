The ERAWIRUNG. otherwise known as _Yirau,_ were an Indigenous Australian people group whose traditional territory was located in what is today South Australia.


Language

They appear to have spoken a dialect of the Yuyu language common to their neighbours.


Country

According to Norman Tindale, Erawirung traditional lands covered about , around the eastern bank of the Murray River, reaching from north of Paringa past Loxton into the sandy stretches some 15Â miles to its south. Their western boundary reached from Rufus Creek into the vicinity of the Overland Corner.


Social organization and economy

The Erawirung were divided into hordes, of which the following are known:

-   _Jeraruk._
-   _Rankbirit._ (totem = eaglehawk)
-   _Wilu._

They practiced circumcision alone, but not dental avulsion in initiation rites.

chert mining in two of their localities, at Springcart Gully and at a site south of Renmark formed an important element of the Erawirung economy, and the areas were jealously defended from neighbouring tribes.


History

Early ethnographers often classified the small Erawirung tribe as one of a collective group named the _Meru_ people. The Erawirung had slipped from the memory of the nearby Jarildekald by the time Ronald Murray Berndt interviewed the latter in the late 1930s-early 1940s.
