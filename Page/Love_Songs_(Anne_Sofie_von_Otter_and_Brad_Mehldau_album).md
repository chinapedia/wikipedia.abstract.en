_LOVE SONGS_ is an album by the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and the pianist Brad Mehldau. The album was released on October 26, 2010.


Background

Carnegie Hall awarded Mehldau a commission to write the song cycle _Love Songs_ for von Otter; they premiered it together in 2009.[1] His music is for love poems – five by Sara Teasdale, and one each by Philip Larkin and E. E. Cummings.[2]


Music and recording

The double album is in two parts: a seven-song cycle written by Mehldau;[3] and songs by Jacques Brel, Michel Legrand, Joni Mitchell, Lennon and McCartney and others, sung in various languages.[4]


Reception

The BBC reviewer commented that "Von Otter's performances emphasise vocal purity over the content of the verses, giving them a chilly beauty".[5] The AllMusic reviewer's opinion was that von Otter's "tone is full and pure, and her investment in the songs is absolute. Mehldau's exceptionally sensitive and inventive accompaniments contribute immeasurably to the success of the album."[6]
