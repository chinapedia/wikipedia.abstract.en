POPE-ELECT STEPHEN (died 26 March 752) was a Roman priest elected pope in March 752 to succeed Zachary; he died of a stroke a few days later, before being consecrated a bishop.[1][2] Therefore, he is not listed as a pope in the _Annuario Pontificio_.

In 745, Pope Zachary had made him a cardinal-priest, with the titulus of San Crisogono, the same titulus later held by Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine, who became Pope Stephen IX.


Regnal numbering of popes named Stephen

The regnal numbering of popes named Stephen has changed over the centuries. Regnal numbering was not used for popes until the 10th century, and any numbering attached to earlier popes has been applied retroactively.

Until the 10th century, from 752 to 942, eight men who bore the name Stephen, including this priest Stephen, were elected pope, but only seven reigned as pope. The _Annuario Pontificio_ attaches to its mention of Pope Stephen II a footnote mentioning Pope-elect Stephen: "On the death of Zachary the Roman priest Stephen was elected; but, since he died three days later and before his _consecratio_, which according to the canon law of the time was the true commencement of his pontificate, his name is not registered in the _Liber Pontificalis_ nor in other lists of the popes."[3]

The first pope to take the name "Stephen" after regnal numbering became customary was called Stephen IX during his lifetime and signed all his documents "_Stephanus Papa Nonus_", Latin for "Pope Stephen IX".

Later canon law, in force until 1 October 1975,[4] considered that a man became pope at the moment when he accepted his election to the papacy, and this Stephen was then anachronistically called Pope Stephen II. Some writers, but not all, consequently increased the numbering of later Popes of that name, making them Popes Stephen III-X.[5] This Pope-elect Stephen's name was removed from the list of popes in the _Annuario Pontificio_ in 1961.[6]

Divergent usage led to the use of a dual numbering for these popes, so that they are sometimes referred to as Popes Stephen II (III)–IX (X). This practice is found in the _Catholic Encyclopedia_,[7] the _Annuario Pontificio_[8] and the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.[9]

[4] On that date, Pope Paul VI changed the law, laying down in his apostolic constitution _Romano Pontifici eligendo_ that (to quote an English version of the document), "88. After his acceptance, the person elected, if he be a bishop, is straightway bishop of Rome, true pope, and head of the episcopal college. He possesses and can exercise full and supreme power over the universal Church. If, however, the elected person does not possess the episcopal character, he is to be immediately ordained a bishop." Pope Paul VI's change of the law was incorporated into the 1983 Code of Canon Law: "Can. 332 §1 The Roman Pontiff acquires full and supreme power in the Church when, together with episcopal consecration, he has been lawfully elected and has accepted the election. Accordingly, if he already has the episcopal character, he receives this power from the moment he accepts election to the supreme pontificate. If he does not have the episcopal character, he is immediately to be ordained Bishop."
