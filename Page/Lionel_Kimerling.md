LIONEL C. KIMERLING is an American materials scientist, known for his work in the field of semiconductor materials and their processing. As of 2016, he is the Thomas Lord Professor of Materials Science & Engineering at the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He headed the Materials Physics Research Department of AT&T Bell Laboratories from 1981 to 1990.

Research under his direction has included silicon microphotonics, and the development of the earliest 1MB DRAM as well as long-lasting telecommunications lasers. His group has also developed semiconductor diagnostic methods including deep-level transient spectroscopy, SEM-electron beam-induced current and RF-PCD. Silicon processing is a focus of his research, encompassing integrated circuit fabrication, microphotonic materials and devices, solar energy conversion and environmentally benign integrated circuit manufacturing. The aim of his group's microphotonics research is to integrate optical interconnection with integrated microelectronic circuit chips.
