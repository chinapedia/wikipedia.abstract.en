PHILIP KINDRED DICK (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American writer known for his work in science fiction. His work explored philosophical, social, and political themes, with stories dominated by monopolistic corporations, alternative universes, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness. His writing also reflected his interest in metaphysics and theology, and often drew upon his life experiences, addressing the nature of reality, identity, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences. Dick produced 44 published novels and approximately 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.[1]

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1951, at the age of 22. His stories initially found little commercial success,[2] but his 1962 alternative history novel _The Man in the High Castle_ earned Dick early acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel.[3] He followed with science fiction novels such as _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ (1968) and _Ubik_ (1969). His 1974 novel _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[4] Following a series of paranormal experiences in February 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, philosophy, and the nature of reality, as in such novels as _A Scanner Darkly_ (1977) and _VALIS_ (1981).[5] A collection of his nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as _The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick_ (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke.

A variety of popular Hollywood films based on Dick's works have been produced, including _Blade Runner_ (1982), _Total Recall_ (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), _Minority Report_ (2002), _A Scanner Darkly_ (2006), and _The Adjustment Bureau_ (2011). Meanwhile, the novel _The Man in the High Castle_ (1962) was made into a multi-season television series by Amazon, starting in 2015.

In 2005, _Time_ magazine named _Ubik_ (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.[6] In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer ever to be included in The Library of America series.[7][8][9]


Early life

Philip Kindred Dick and his twin sister, Jane Charlotte Dick, were born six weeks prematurely on December 16, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (née Kindred; 1900–1978) and Joseph Edgar Dick (1899–1985), who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture.[10][11] His paternal grandparents were Irish.[12] The death of Philip's twin Jane six weeks after their birth, on January 26, 1929, profoundly affected Philip's life, leading to the recurrent motif of the "phantom twin" in his books.[13]

His family later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. When Philip was five, his father was transferred to Reno, Nevada; when Dorothy refused to move, she and Joseph divorced. Both parents fought for custody of Philip, which was awarded to the mother. Dorothy, determined to raise Philip alone, took a job in Washington, D.C., and moved there with her son. Philip was enrolled at John Eaton Elementary School (1936–1938), completing the second through fourth grades. His lowest grade was a "C" in Written Composition, although a teacher remarked that he "shows interest and ability in story telling". He was educated in Quaker schools.[14] In June 1938, Dorothy and Philip returned to California, and it was around this time that he became interested in science fiction.[15] Dick stated that he read his first science fiction magazine, _Stirring Science Stories_ in 1940 at the age of 12.[16] Dick attended Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He and fellow science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin were members of the same graduating class (1947) but did not know each other at the time. After graduation, he briefly attended the University of California, Berkeley, (September 1949 to November 11, 1949) with an honorable dismissal granted January 1, 1950. Dick did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality; he described himself as "an acosmic panentheist," believing in the universe only as an extension of God.[17] After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, Dick came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real and there is no way to confirm whether it is truly there. This question from his early studies persisted as a theme in many of his novels. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She also says he disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, Dick befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language. Dick claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947.[18] From 1948 to 1952, Dick worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue.


Career

Early writing

_, illustrated by Ed Emshwiller]] _]] '' originally appeared in the December 1956 issue of _Satellite Science Fiction_ as "A Glass of Darkness"]] Dick sold his first story, “Roog”, in 1951, about “a dog who imagined that the garbagemen who came every Friday morning were stealing valuable food which the family had carefully stored away in a safe metal container”[19], and from then on wrote full-time. During 1952, his first speculative fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of _Planet Stories_, edited by Jack O'Sullivan, and in _If_ and _The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction_ that year.[20] His debut novel was _Solar Lottery_, published in 1955 as half of Ace Double #D-103 alongside _The Big Jump_ by Leigh Brackett.[21] The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, "We couldn't even pay the late fees on a library book." He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre, but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction.[22] During the 1950s, he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels. In 1960, he wrote that he was willing to "take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer". The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of these works, _Confessions of a Crap Artist_, was published during Dick's lifetime.

In 1963, Dick won the Hugo Award for _The Man in the High Castle_.[23] Although he was hailed as a genius in the science fiction world, the mainstream literary world was unappreciative, and he could publish books only through low-paying science fiction publishers such as Ace. Even in his later years, he continued to have financial troubles. In the introduction to the 1980 short story collection _The Golden Man_, Dick wrote:

Flight to Canada and suicide attempt

In 1971, Dick's marriage to Nancy Hackett broke down, and she moved out of their house in Santa Venetia, California. Having struggled with amphetamine abuse for much of the past decade (stemming in part from his need to maintain a prolific writing regimen due to the financial exigencies of the science fiction field), he allowed other drug users to move into the house. Following the release of 21 novels between 1960 and 1970, these developments were exacerbated by unprecedented periods of writer's block, with Dick ultimately failing to publish new fiction until 1974.[24]

One day in November, Dick returned to his home to discover that it had been burglarized, with his safe blown open and personal papers missing. The police were unable to determine the culprit, and even suspected Dick of having done it himself.[25] Shortly afterwards, he was invited to be guest of honor at the Vancouver Science Fiction Convention in February 1972. Within a day of arriving at the conference and giving his speech _The Android and the Human_, he informed people that he had fallen in love with a woman named Janis whom he had met there and announced that he would be remaining in Vancouver.[26] An attendee of the conference, Michael Walsh, movie critic for local newspaper _The Province_, invited Dick to stay in his home, but asked him to leave two weeks later due to his erratic behavior. This was followed by Janis ending her and Dick's relationship and moving away. On March 23, 1972, Dick attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the sedative potassium bromide.[27] Subsequently, after deciding to seek help, Dick became a participant in X-Kalay (a Canadian Synanon-type recovery program), and was well enough by April to return to California.[28]

Upon relocating to Orange County, California at the behest of California State University, Fullerton professor Willis McNelly (who initiated a correspondence with Dick during his X-Kalay stint), he donated manuscripts, papers and other materials to the University's Special Collections Library, where they are archived in the Philip K. Dick Science Fiction Collection in the Pollak Library. During this period, Dick befriended a circle of Fullerton State students that encompassed several aspiring science fiction writers, including K. W. Jeter, James Blaylock and Tim Powers.

Dick returned to the events of these months while writing his 1977 novel _A Scanner Darkly_,[29] which contains fictionalized depictions of the burglary of his home, his time using amphetamines and living with addicts, and his experiences of X-Kalay (portrayed in the novel as "New-Path"). A factual account of Dick's recovery program participation was portrayed in his posthumously released book _The Dark Haired Girl_, a collection of letters and journals from the period.

Paranormal experiences

On February 20, 1974, while recovering from the effects of sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When he opened the door, he was struck by the beauty of the dark-haired girl and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. "This is a sign used by the early Christians," she said, and then left. Dick called the symbol the "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile) which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.[30]

Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a "pink beam" of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, Dick was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam. It imparted the information to him that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where his suspicion was confirmed by professional diagnosis.[31]

After the woman's departure, Dick began experiencing strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to side effects from medication, he considered this explanation implausible after weeks of continued hallucinations. "I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, as if I had been insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane," Dick told Charles Platt.[32]

Throughout February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of hallucinations, which he referred to as "2-3-74",[33] shorthand for February–March 1974. Aside from the "pink beam", Dick described the initial hallucinations as geometric patterns, and, occasionally, brief pictures of Jesus and ancient Rome. As the hallucinations increased in length and frequency, Dick claimed he began to live two parallel lives, one as himself, "Philip K. Dick", and one as "Thomas", a Christian persecuted by Romans in the first century AD. He referred to the "transcendentally rational mind" as "Zebra", "God" and "VALIS". Dick wrote about the experiences, first in the semi-autobiographical novel _Radio Free Albemuth_ and then in _VALIS_, _The Divine Invasion_ and the unfinished _The Owl in Daylight_ (the VALIS trilogy).

In 1974, Dick wrote a letter to the FBI, accusing various people, including University of California, San Diego professor Frederic Jameson, of being foreign agents of Warsaw Pact powers.[34] He also wrote that Stanisław Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion.[35]

At one point, Dick felt that he had been taken over by the spirit of the prophet Elijah. He believed that an episode in his novel _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ was a detailed retelling of a biblical story from the Book of Acts, which he had never read.[36] Dick documented and discussed his experiences and faith in a private journal he called his "exegesis", portions of which were later published as _The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick_. The last novel Dick wrote was _The Transmigration of Timothy Archer_; it was published shortly after his death in 1982.


Personal life

Dick was married five times:

-   Jeanette Marlin (May to November 1948)
-   Kleo Apostolides (June 14, 1950 to 1959)
-   Anne Williams Rubinstein (April 1, 1959 to October 1965)
-   Nancy Hackett (July 6, 1966 to 1972)
-   Leslie "Tessa" Busby (April 18, 1973 to 1977)

Dick had three children, Laura Archer Dick (born February 25, 1960 to Dick and his third wife, Anne Williams Rubenstein), Isolde Freya Dick (now Isa Dick Hackett) (born March 15, 1967 to Dick and his fourth wife, Nancy Hackett), and Christopher Kenneth Dick (born July 25, 1973 to Dick and his fifth wife, Leslie "Tessa" Busby).

In 1955, he and his second wife, Kleo Apostolides, received a visit from the FBI, which they believed to be the result of Kleo's socialist views and left-wing activities. The couple briefly befriended one of the FBI agents.[37]

He was physically abusive with his third wife, Anne Williams Rubinstein; after one argument in 1963, he attempted to push her off a cliff in a car, then later claimed she was trying to kill him, and convinced a psychiatrist to commit her involuntarily. After filing for divorce in 1964, he moved to Oakland to live with a fan, Grania Davis. Shortly after, he attempted suicide by driving off the road while she was a passenger.[38]

Dick tried to stay out of the political scene because of high societal turmoil from the Vietnam War; however, he did show some anti-Vietnam War and anti-governmental sentiments. In 1968, he joined the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest",[39][40] an anti-war pledge to pay no U.S. federal income tax, which resulted in the confiscation of his car by the IRS.


Death

On February 17, 1982, after completing an interview, Dick contacted his therapist, complaining of failing eyesight, and was advised to go to a hospital immediately, but did not. The following day, he was found unconscious on the floor of his Santa Ana, California, home, having suffered a stroke. On February 25, Dick suffered another stroke in the hospital, which led to brain death. Five days later, on March 2, he was disconnected from life support and died. After his death, Dick's father, Joseph, took his son's ashes to Riverside Cemetery in Fort Morgan, Colorado, (section K, block 1, lot 56), where they were buried next to his twin sister Jane, who died in infancy. Her tombstone had been inscribed with both of their names at the time of her death, 53 years earlier.[41][42][43] He died months before the release of the first _Blade Runner_ film.


Style and works

Themes

Dick's stories typically focus on the fragile nature of what is real and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies, as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion assembled by powerful external entities, such as the suspended animation in _Ubik_,[44] vast political conspiracies or the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. "All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality", writes science fiction author Charles Platt. "Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely."[45]

Alternate universes and simulacra are common plot devices, with fictional worlds inhabited by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. "There are no heroes in Dick's books", Ursula K. Le Guin wrote, "but there are heroics. One is reminded of Dickens: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people."[46] Dick made no secret that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung.[47][48] The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick seem to be the archetypes of the collective unconscious, group projection/hallucination, synchronicities, and personality theory.[49] Many of Dick's protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms (see _Lies Inc._).

Dick identified one major theme of his work as the question, "What constitutes the authentic human being?"[50] In works such as _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, beings can appear totally human in every respect while lacking soul or compassion, while completely alien beings such as Glimmung in _Galactic Pot-Healer_ may be more humane and complex than their human peers.

Mental illness was a constant interest of Dick's, and themes of mental illness permeate his work. The character Jack Bohlen in the 1964 novel _Martian Time-Slip_ is an "ex-schizophrenic". The novel _Clans of the Alphane Moon_ centers on an entire society made up of descendants of lunatic asylum inmates. In 1965, he wrote the essay titled "Schizophrenia and the Book of Changes".[51]

Drug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) was also a theme in many of Dick's works, such as _A Scanner Darkly_ and _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_. Dick himself was a drug user for much of his life. According to a 1975 interview in _Rolling Stone_,[52] Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. "_A Scanner Darkly_ (1977) was the first complete novel I had written without speed", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_, which _Rolling Stone_ dubs "the classic LSD novel of all time", before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.[53]

Summing up all these themes in _Understanding Philip K. Dick_, Eric Carl Link discussed eight themes or 'ideas and motifs':[54] Epistemology and the Nature of Reality, Know Thyself, The Android and the Human, Entropy and Pot Healing, The Theodicy Problem, Warfare and Power Politics, The Evolved Human, and 'Technology, Media, Drugs and Madness'.[55]

Pen names

Dick had two professional stories published under the pen names Richard Phillipps and Jack Dowland. "Some Kinds of Life" was published in October 1953 in _Fantastic Universe_ under byline Richard Phillipps, apparently because the magazine had a policy against publishing multiple stories by the same author in the same issue; "Planet for Transients" was published in the same issue under his own name.[56]

The short story "Orpheus with Clay Feet" was published under the pen name Jack Dowland. The protagonist desires to be the muse for fictional author Jack Dowland, considered the greatest science fiction author of the 20th century. In the story, Dowland publishes a short story titled "Orpheus with Clay Feet" under the pen name Philip K. Dick.

The surname Dowland refers to Renaissance composer John Dowland, who is featured in several works. The title _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ directly refers to Dowland's best-known composition, "Flow My Tears". In the novel _The Divine Invasion_, the character Linda Fox, created specifically with Linda Ronstadt in mind, is an intergalactically famous singer whose entire body of work consists of recordings of John Dowland compositions.

Selected works

_The Man in the High Castle_ (1962) is set in an alternate history in which the United States is ruled by the victorious Axis powers. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. In 2015 this was adapted into a television series by Amazon Studios.

_The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_ (1965) utilizes an array of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick's first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the Solar System's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using "Perky Pat" dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based "P.P. Layouts". The company also secretly creates "Can-D", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to "translate" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.

_Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ (1968) is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth de-populated of almost all animals and all "successful" humans; the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. The 1968 novel is the literary source of the film _Blade Runner_ (1982).[57] It is both a conflation and an intensification of the pivotally Dickian question: What is real, what is fake? What crucial factor defines humanity as distinctly "alive", versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?

_Ubik_ (1969) employs extensive psychic telepathy and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. A group of psychics is sent to investigate a rival organisation, but several of them are apparently killed by a saboteur's bomb. Much of the following novel flicks between different equally plausible realities and the "real" reality, a state of half-life and psychically manipulated realities. In 2005, _Time_ magazine listed it among the "All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels" published since 1923.[58]

_Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ (1974) concerns Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopian near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (manned by "pols" and "nats", the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick's first published novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[59] It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated for both a Hugo and a Nebula Award.

In an essay written two years before his death, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopal priest that an important scene in _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ – involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in _Acts of the Apostles_,[60] a book of the New Testament. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film _Waking Life_, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, _Time Out of Joint_.

_A Scanner Darkly_ (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels; in its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality after falling victim to the same permanently mind-altering drug, Substance D, he was enlisted to help fight. Substance D is instantly addictive, beginning with a pleasant euphoria which is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. In this novel, as with all Dick novels, there is an underlying thread of paranoia and dissociation with multiple realities perceived simultaneously. It was adapted to film by Richard Linklater.

_The Philip K. Dick Reader_[61] is an introduction to the variety of Dick's short fiction.

_VALIS_ (1980) is perhaps Dick's most postmodern and autobiographical novel, examining his own unexplained experiences. It may also be his most academically studied work, and was adapted as an opera by Tod Machover.[62] Later works like the VALIS trilogy were heavily autobiographical, many with "two-three-seventy-four" (2-3-74) references and influences. The word VALIS is the acronym for _Vast Active Living Intelligence System_. Later, Dick theorized that VALIS was both a "reality generator" and a means of extraterrestrial communication. A fourth VALIS manuscript, _Radio Free Albemuth_, although composed in 1976, was posthumously published in 1985. This work is described by the publisher (Arbor House) as "an introduction and key to his magnificent VALIS trilogy".

Regardless of the feeling that he was somehow experiencing a divine communication, Dick was never fully able to rationalize the events. For the rest of his life, he struggled to comprehend what was occurring, questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. He transcribed what thoughts he could into an eight-thousand-page, one-million-word journal dubbed the _Exegesis_. From 1974 until his death in 1982, Dick spent many nights writing in this journal. A recurring theme in _Exegesis_ is Dick's hypothesis that history had been stopped in the first century AD, and that "the Empire never ended". He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism and despotism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground, had kept the population of Earth enslaved to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had communicated with him, and anonymously others, to induce the impeachment of U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor of Rome incarnate.

In a 1968 essay titled "Self Portrait", collected in the 1995 book _The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick_, Dick reflects on his work and lists which books he feels "might escape World War Three": _Eye in the Sky_, _The Man in the High Castle_, _Martian Time-Slip_, _Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb_, _The Zap Gun_, _The Penultimate Truth_, _The Simulacra_, _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_ (which he refers to as "the most vital of them all"), _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, and _Ubik_.[63] In a 1976 interview, Dick cited _A Scanner Darkly_ as his best work, feeling that he "had finally written a true masterpiece, after 25 years of writing".[64]

In the 1973 science fiction short story, _The Pre-persons_, he criticizes American pro-abortion law.

Adaptations

Films

Several of Dick's stories have been made into films. Dick himself wrote a screenplay for an intended film adaptation of _Ubik_ in 1974, but the film was never made. Many film adaptations have not used Dick's original titles. When asked why this was, Dick's ex-wife Tessa said, "Actually, the books rarely carry Phil's original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn't write good titles. If he could, he would have been an advertising writer instead of a novelist."[65] Films based on Dick's writing had accumulated a total revenue of over US $1 billion by 2009.[66]

-   _Blade Runner_ (1982), based on Dick's 1968 novel _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford. A screenplay had been in the works for years before Scott took the helm, with Dick being extremely critical of all versions. Dick was still apprehensive about how his story would be adapted for the film when the project was finally put into motion. Among other things, he refused to do a novelization of the film. But contrary to his initial reactions, when he was given an opportunity to see some of the special effects sequences of Los Angeles 2019, Dick was amazed that the environment was "exactly as how I'd imagined it!", though Ridley Scott has mentioned he had never even read the source material.[67] Following the screening, Dick and Scott had a frank but cordial discussion of _Blade Runner's_ themes and characters, and although they had wildly differing views, Dick fully backed the film from then on, stating that his "life and creative work are justified and completed by _Blade Runner_".[68] Dick died from a stroke less than four months before the release of the film.
-   _Total Recall_ (1990), based on the short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
-   _Confessions d'un Barjo_ (1992), titled _Barjo_ in its English-language release, a French film based on the non-science-fiction novel _Confessions of a Crap Artist_.
-   _Screamers_ (1995), based on the short story "Second Variety", directed by Christian Duguay and starring Peter Weller. The location was altered from a war-devastated Earth to a distant planet. A sequel, titled _Screamers: The Hunting_, was released straight to DVD in 2009.
-   _Minority Report_ (2002), based on the short story "The Minority Report", directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise.
-   _Impostor_ (2002), based on the 1953 story "Impostor," directed by Gary Fleder and starring Gary Sinise, Vincent D'Onofrio and Madeleine Stowe. The story was also adapted in 1962 for the British television anthology series _Out of This World_.
-   _Paycheck_ (2003), directed by John Woo and starring Ben Affleck, based on Dick's short story of the same name.
-   _A Scanner Darkly_ (2006), directed by Richard Linklater and starring Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Robert Downey Jr., based on Dick's novel of the same name. The film was produced using the process of rotoscoping: it was first shot in live-action and then the live footage was animated over.
-   _Next_ (2007), directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Nicolas Cage, loosely based on the short story "The Golden Man".
-   _Radio Free Albemuth_ (2010), directed by John Alan Simon loosely based on the novel _Radio Free Albemuth_.
-   _The Adjustment Bureau_ (2011), directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon, loosely based on the short story "Adjustment Team".
-   _Total Recall_ (2012), directed by Len Wiseman and starring Colin Farrell, second film adaptation of the short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale".
-   _Blade Runner 2049_ (2017), directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, a sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner, based on _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_.

Future films based on Dick's writing include an animated adaptation of _The King of the Elves_ from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which was set to be released in the spring of 2016 but is currently still in preproduction; and a film adaptation of _Ubik_ which, according to Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, is in advanced negotiation.[69] Ubik was set to be made into a film by Michel Gondry.[70] In 2014, however, Gondry told French outlet Telerama (via Jeux Actu), that he was no longer working on the project.

The _Terminator_ series prominently features the theme of humanoid assassination machines first portrayed in _Second Variety_. The Halcyon Company, known for developing the _Terminator_ franchise, acquired right of first refusal to film adaptations of the works of Philip K. Dick in 2007. In May 2009, they announced plans for an adaptation of _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_.[71]

Television

It was reported in 2010 that Ridley Scott would produce an adaptation of _The Man in the High Castle_ for the BBC, in the form of a mini-series.[72] A pilot episode was released on Amazon Prime in January 2015 and Season 1 was fully released in ten episodes of about 60 minutes each on November 20, 2015.[73] Premiering in January 2015, the pilot was Amazon's "most-watched since the original series development program began." The next month Amazon ordered episodes to fill out a ten-episode season, which was released in November, to positive reviews. A second season of ten episodes premiered in December 2016, with a third season announced a few weeks later to be released in 2018. In July 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a fourth season.[74]

In late 2015, Fox aired _Minority Report_, a television series sequel adaptation to the 2002 film of the same name based on Dick's 1956 short story "The Minority Report". The show was cancelled after one 10 episode season.

In May 2016, it was announced that a 10-part anthology series was in the works. Titled _Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams_, the series was distributed by Sony Pictures Television and premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and Amazon Video in the United States.[75] It was written by executive producers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Dinner, with executive input from Dick's daughter Isa Dick Hackett, and stars Bryan Cranston, also an executive producer.[76]

Stage and radio

Four of Dick's works have been adapted for the stage.

One was the opera _VALIS_, composed and with libretto by Tod Machover, which premiered at the Pompidou Center in Paris on December 1, 1987, with a French libretto. It was subsequently revised and readapted into English, and was recorded and released on CD (Bridge Records BCD9007) in 1988.

Another was _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_, adapted by Linda Hartinian and produced by the New York-based avant-garde company Mabou Mines. It premiered in Boston at the Boston Shakespeare Theatre (June 18–30, 1985) and was subsequently staged in New York and Chicago. Productions of _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ were also staged by the Evidence Room [77] in Los Angeles in 1999[78] and by the Fifth Column Theatre Company at the Oval House Theatre in London in the same year.[79]

A play based on _Radio Free Albemuth_ also had a brief run in the 1980s.

In November 2010, a production of _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, adapted by Edward Einhorn, premiered at the 3LD Art and Technology Center in Manhattan.[80]

A radio drama adaptation of Dick's short story "Mr. Spaceship" was aired by the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yleisradio) in 1996 under the name _Menolippu Paratiisiin_. Radio dramatizations of Dick's short stories _Colony_ and _The Defenders_[81] were aired by NBC in 1956 as part of the series _X Minus One_.

In January 2006, a _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_ (English for _Trzy stygmaty Palmera Eldritcha_) theatre adaptation premiered in Stary Teatr in Cracov, with an extensive use of lights and laser choreography.[82][83]

In June 2014 the BBC broadcast a two part adaptation of 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?' on Radio 4, starring James Purefoy as Rick Deckard.[84]

Comics

Marvel Comics adapted Dick's short story "The Electric Ant" as a limited series which was released in 2009. The comic was produced by writer David Mack (_Daredevil_) and artist Pascal Alixe (_Ultimate X-Men_), with covers provided by artist Paul Pope.[85] "The Electric Ant" had earlier been loosely adapted by Frank Miller and Geof Darrow in their 3-issue mini-series _Hard Boiled_ published by Dark Horse Comics in 1990-1992.[86]

In 2009, BOOM! Studios started publishing a 24-issue miniseries comic book adaptation of _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_[87] _Blade Runner_, the 1982 film adapted from _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, had previously been adapted to comics as _A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner_.

In 2011, Dynamite Entertainment published a 4-issue miniseries "Total Recall," a sequel to the 1990 film _Total Recall_, inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale".[88] In 1990, DC Comics published the official adaptation of the original film as a _DC Movie Special: Total Recall_.[89]

Alternative formats

In response to a 1975 request from the National Library for the Blind for permission to make use of _The Man in the High Castle_, Dick responded, "I also grant you a general permission to transcribe any of my former, present or future work, so indeed you can add my name to your 'general permission' list."[90] Some of his books and stories are available in braille and other specialized formats through the NLS.[91]

As of December 2012, thirteen of Philip K. Dick's early works in the public domain in the United States are available in ebook form from Project Gutenberg. As of April 4, 2012, Wikisource has one of Philip K. Dick's early works in the public domain in the United States available in ebook form which is not from Project Gutenberg.


Influence and legacy

Lawrence Sutin's 1989 biography of Dick, _Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick_, is considered the standard biographical treatment of Dick's life.[92]

In 1993, French writer Emmanuel Carrère published _Je suis vivant et vous êtes morts_ which was first translated and published in English in 2004 as _I Am Alive and You Are Dead: A Journey Into the Mind of Philip K. Dick_, which the author describes in his preface in this way:

  The book you hold in your hands is a very peculiar book. I have tried to depict the life of Philip K. Dick from the inside, in other words, with the same freedom and empathy – indeed with the same truth – with which he depicted his own characters.[93]

Critics of the book have complained about the lack of fact checking, sourcing, notes and index, "the usual evidence of deep research that gives a biography the solid stamp of authority."[94][95][96] It can be considered a non-fiction novel about his life.

Dick has influenced many writers, including Jonathan Lethem[97] and Ursula K. Le Guin.[98] The prominent literary critic Fredric Jameson proclaimed Dick the "Shakespeare of Science Fiction", and praised his work as "one of the most powerful expressions of the society of spectacle and pseudo-event".[99] The author Roberto Bolaño also praised Dick, describing him as "Thoreau plus the death of the American dream".[100] Dick has also influenced filmmakers, his work being compared to films such as the Wachowskis' _The Matrix_,[101] David Cronenberg's _Videodrome_,[102] _eXistenZ_,[103] and _Spider_,[104] Spike Jonze's _Being John Malkovich_,[105] _Adaptation_,[106] Michel Gondry's _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_,[107][108] Alex Proyas's _Dark City_,[109] Peter Weir's _The Truman Show_,[110] Andrew Niccol's _Gattaca_,[111] _In Time_,[112] Terry Gilliam's _12 Monkeys_,[113] Alejandro Amenábar's _Open Your Eyes_,[114] David Fincher's _Fight Club_,[115] Cameron Crowe's _Vanilla Sky_,[116] Darren Aronofsky's _Pi_,[117] Richard Kelly's _Donnie Darko_[118] and _Southland Tales_,[119] Rian Johnson's _Looper_,[120] Duncan Jones' _Source Code_, and Christopher Nolan's _Memento_[121] and _Inception_.[122]

The Philip K. Dick Society was an organization dedicated to promoting the literary works of Dick and was led by Dick's longtime friend and music journalist Paul Williams. Williams also served as Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and wrote one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled _Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick_.

The Philip K. Dick estate owns and operates the production company Electric Shepherd Productions,[123] which has produced the films _Adjustment Bureau_ (2011) and the upcoming Walt Disney Company film _King of the Elves_, the TV series _The Man in the High Castle_[124] and also a Marvel Comics 5-issue adaptation of _Electric Ant_.[125]

Dick was recreated by his fans in the form of a simulacrum or remote-controlled android designed in his likeness.[126][127][128] Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick's works. The Philip K. Dick simulacrum was included on a discussion panel in a San Diego Comic Con presentation about the film adaptation of the novel, _A Scanner Darkly_. In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android's head, and it has not yet been found.[129] In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.[130]

Contemporary philosophy

Postmodernists such as Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Laurence Rickels and Slavoj Žižek have commented on Dick's writing's foreshadowing of postmodernity.[154] Jean Baudrillard offers this interpretation:

  It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move "through the mirror" to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.[155]

For his anti-government skepticism, Philip K. Dick was afforded minor mention in _Mythmakers and Lawbreakers_, a collection of interviews about fiction by anarchist authors. Noting his early authorship of _The Last of the Masters_, an anarchist-themed novelette, author Margaret Killjoy expressed that while Dick never fully sided with anarchism, his opposition to government centralization and organized religion has influenced anarchist interpretations of gnosticism.[156]
