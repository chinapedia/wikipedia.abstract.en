TEVIN FARMER (born July 30, 1990) is an American professional boxer who has held the IBF super featherweight title since 2018. Farmer, who is right handed but fights in a southpaw stance, is known for his old school style and slick, defensive skills.


Professional boxing career

Farmer started his boxing career when he was 19, at first admitting that he did not take boxing seriously.

On July 30, 2016, Farmer fought Ivan Redkach in a lightweight bout and won a unanimous decision with a score of 98 - 90, 98 - 90, and 99 - 89 all in favor of Farmer.[1]

Farmer lost to Kenichi Ogawa for the IBF super featherweight world title, which was later switched to a no contest. On August 3, 2018 he captured the IBF world title by defeating former featherweight champion Billy Dib. In October 2018, he retained his title against James Tennyson via knockout in the 5th round.

Personal life

Farmer's great uncle is Joe Gans.[3]
