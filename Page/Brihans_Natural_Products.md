BRIHANS NATURAL PRODUCTS LTD. is an Indian natural cosmetics and consumer products company based in Shaniwar Peth, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The company manufactures skin care, hair care and health care products.[1]


History

In 1998, Brihans Pharmaceuticals, under Mandar Agashe, set up a research and development center to develop Ayurvedic products. In August 1999, the company conducted test marketing of its products in Andhra Pradesh. By February 2000, it went national, setting up 19 branches across India,[2] with the formal formation of Brihans Natural Products on 20 April 2000.[3] The company went international by 2001, exporting to the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Malaysia and the Maldives.[4][5]

Between 2002 and 2004, the company launched _Cleancomb_, an anti-hair loss lotion and _Oraheal_, a mouth ulcer tablet, along with a Hibiscus based hair gel to its roster of products.[6][7][8][9] During this time, the company also planned to expand to the European and American markets.[10]

In 2006, the company launched Aloe vera based health juices under the brand _Brimune_.[11][12] That same year, the company launched its Turmeric face wash and Aloe foot cream product lines under the _Greenleaf_ brand.[13][14][15] By 2007, the company sold majority of its skincare and hair care products under the _Greenleaf_ brand.[16]

As of 2016, the company shipped its products across India, RÃ©union, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore,[17] and is headquartered in Shaniwar Peth, Pune.[18] In 2017, _Business Insider_ reported that the company was a major manufacturer of Aloe vera products in India.[19][20][21] In 2018, a report published by a San Francisco based market research firm, included the company as a major contributor to the Indian Aloe vera industry.[22][23][24]


Research and development

The company has been noted for using a variety of _Aloe Barbadensis_ for its products; this allows for better standardization between batches, and reduces the use of potentially contaminated aloe in their products.[25]


Controversies

In April 2014, the company's advertisement of their product _Cleancomb_ was complained against for being misleading, thus violating the Advertising Standard Council of India's Consumer Complaints Council's Code. It was one of 44 health care companies that were complained against at the time.[26] A similar complaint was upheld with the company's advertisements in December 2017.[27][28]
