OPERATION LEGACY was a British Colonial Office (later Foreign Office) program to destroy or hide files, to prevent them being inherited by its ex-colonies.[1][2] It ran from the 1950s until the 1970s, when the decolonisation of the British Empire was at its height.[3]

As decolonisation progressed, British officials were keen to avoid a repeat of the embarrassment that had been caused by the overt burning of documents that took place in Delhi in 1947, which had been covered by local Indian news sources. On May 3, 1961, Iain Macleod from the UK Colonial Office, wrote a telegram to all British embassies to advise them on the best way to retrieve and dispose of sensitive documents.[4]

All secret documents in the colonial administrations were vetted by MI5 or Special Branch agents to ensure those that might embarrass the British government or show racial or religious bias, were destroyed or sent to the United Kingdom.[5] Precise instructions were given for methods to be used for destruction, including burning and dumping at sea.[6] Some of the files detailed torture methods used against opponents of the colonial administrations, _e.g._, during the Mau Mau Uprising.[7]

Academic study of the end of the British Empire has been assisted in recent years by the declassification of the _migrated archives_ in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 141 series. After the UK government admitted in 2011 that it had secret documents related to the Mau Mau case, it began to declassify documents and by November 2013 some 20,000 files had been declassified. These documents can now be accessed at the National Archives in Kew, London.[8]
