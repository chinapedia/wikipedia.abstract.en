"Bal u starego Joska" (Bal na Gnojnej) is a waltz ballad by the Polish-Russian composer, Fanny Gordon, and lyricists, Julian Krzewiński and Leopold Brodziński. It is a popular Polish song in the _piosenka apaszowska_ or _apache songs_ genre which arose in the Polish underworld of the 1930s. The song was written around 1934 for one of Warsaw's literary cabaret theatres. The theatres were frequented by the Polish intelligentsia.


Background

The song belongs to a genre called _piosenki apaszowskie_ which has its origin in the street songs of the French Apaches underworld. The Polish word _apasz_ describes a member of the Warsaw underworld. The lyrics are in stylized Warsaw slang similar to Parisian argot. The French singer, Aristide Bruant was a proponent of the _Los Apaches_ genre.

The song describes a violent party at a café on Gnojna Street in Warsaw (now 7 Rynkowa (Market street)). The street was in the heart of the vibrant Warsaw Jewish district. The café was run by Gruby Josek until 1932. It was popular among traders and porters from the nearby Hala Mirowska (food market). Writers and politicians would also visit late at night after Warsaw's exclusive restaurants were closed.

The text was written for one of Warsaw theatres or cabaret revues. Both the composer Fanny Gordon and the lyricists Julian Krzewiński and Leopold Brodziński were creators of the first Polish operetta, _Yacht of Love_ (English title, _New York Baby_), which played at the "8.30 pm Theatre".

In January 1933, the Morskie Oko theatre presented _Dodatek Nadzwyczajny_ (_Special Edition_) which was set in the alleys and taverns of Warsaw. One scene took place at the _U Joska na Gnojnej_ cafe.

The song remains a popular Polish underground ballad, often sung in the specific dialect of the Praga district.


Lyrics

Sleepless nights in Warsaw's quarter I still trace them on my lips At the Fatty Josek's tavern on the Dung Street Gathered flower of the night.

Without food and without sleep, as long as there is a drink When the music plays its song You have to dance and have to live!

Its notes, accordion, at three-quarter plays, The gang is dancing, move away! With reverence 'cause it won't be all that good, When the Dung Street dances hard

Who knows Tony feels respect There was one who did not know And he ended for this reason Finished in the darkly, darkly grave.

Lanterns in the dark are lit Watchman sadly whistles song Hangman close to gallows waits For Tony's fate is coming soon

Its notes accordion on three-quarter sobs The gang is dancing I am not Why are they dancing on the Dung Street When more than one pair is gone?


Recordings

The first recording of the song was performed by Tadeusz Faliszewski. It was published in about 1934 by the leading Polish record company of that time, Syrena Rekord. Ron Davis recorded jazz versions of "Bal u starego Joska" on his album, _My Mother's Father's Song_ (2010).[1]
