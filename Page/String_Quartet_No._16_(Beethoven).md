The STRING QUARTET NO. 16 in F major, Op. 135, by Ludwig van Beethoven was written in October 1826[1] and was the last major work he completed. Only the final movement of the Quartet Op. 130, written as a replacement for the _Große Fuge_, was composed later. The op. 135 quartet was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1828, one year after Beethoven's death.

The work is on a smaller scale than the other late quartets. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript "_Muß es sein?_" (Must it be?) to which he responds, with the faster main theme of the movement, "_Es muß sein!_" (It must be!). The whole movement is headed "_Der schwer gefaßte Entschluß_" ("The Difficult Decision").

It is in four movements:

The performance of the work takes around 22–25 minutes.
