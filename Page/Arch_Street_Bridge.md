ARCH STREET BRIDGE is Parker truss bridge over the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. It was built in 1907 and rehabilitated in 1997. It was the third structure built at the location within a few years, the other having been destroyed by floods in 1902 and 1903.[1][2] The bridge was once a crossing for the Public Service trolley lines.

A historic bridge survey conducted by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) from 1991–1994 determined that the bridge was eligible for listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. In June 1995, the State Historic Preservation Office concurred. It was listed on the state register January 30, 2018[3] and the federal register on March 22, 2018.[4]
