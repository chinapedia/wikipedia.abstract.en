ANNIKA HERNROTH-ROTHSTEIN (born 29 May 1981) is a Swedish political adviser, writer and activist. She is a contributor to _Israel Hayom_, _The Jerusalem Post_, Ricochet, _Washington Examiner_, _Commentary Magazine_, and _Mosaic Magazine_, where she writes on the Middle East, religious affairs, and global anti-Semitism.[1][2] She is also a strong pro-Israeli activist in Sweden and organizes annual solidarity with Israel parades in that country.[3]


Political activism

She frequently writes on the issues of antisemitism both in Sweden and abroad.[4][5][6] In 2013 in order to draw attention to antisemitism in Sweden and to protest a series of measures in Sweden banning kosher slaughter, ritual circumcision, and possibly even the importation of kosher meat, she filed for asylum in her own country.[7]

In 2015 during a speech in Washington, DC on European Islamic immigration and anti-Semitism, she stated "I am afraid of Muslims".[8]

Her topics of writing are "Jews and the Temple", "Jihadi Tourism", "Anti-Semitism in Europe" and "Rediscovering Jewish Identity".[9]


Trip to Iran

In 2016 she visited Iran during parliamentary elections. She visited several synagogues in Tehran and Hamedan and reported on the condition of Iranian Jews. She reported that Iranian authorities were aware of her Israeli ties and her political Zionist activities on the visa application but still granted her a visa easily. During interview with Israel Hayom she reported that she was invited to the office of Supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, during the elections. She further reported that she was greeted personally by the President Hassan Rouhani several times.[10] She reported her trip in an article entitled "Totalitarian terror in Iran" in _The Tower Magazine_.[11][12] In another article in _The Tower Magazine_, she reported meeting with several government officials, one of whom described the relationship between Iran, Israel and the United States as follows:


Personal life

She was married to a non-Jewish husband and has two sons. Later when she became religious she asked her husband to convert, which he declined. After their divorce, she maintained a totally Jewish lifestyle and keeps a kosher home. Since kosher meat is not available in Sweden, she imports her kosher meat from Belgium. She sends her sons to Jewish camps in Israel and she visits Israel five times per year. She has two degrees in Middle Eastern studies and communications which she obtained after her divorce. She started her journalism by starting her blog which became popular in Jewish circles and was offered the opportunity to write for several Israeli papers such as _Israel Hayom_.[13]
