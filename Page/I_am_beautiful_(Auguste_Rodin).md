_I AM BEAUTIFUL_, also known as _THE ABDUCTION_,[1] is an 1882 sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, inspired in a fragment from Charles Baudelaire's collection of poems _Les Fleurs du mal_.

The sculpture appears in _The Gates of Hell_, specifically in the right pilaster, made from joining _Crouching Woman_ and _The Falling Man_. This group shows the woman with her back to the audience, in a round-like shape, and the man holding her in a manner reminiscent of the mythological deity Atlas.[2] In this and several other pieces, Rodin wants to express a morbid and erotic vision in which sexual satisfaction is unreachable.[3]

_I am beautiful_ was part of an 1886 exhibition at the Georges Petit Gallery, where it caused commotion due to its audacity: the union of the aforementioned pieces form a symbolic expression of joy and passion that could not be achieved by its component parts, showcasing both suffering— in a figure that crouches folds unto itself— and an excess of reach in an overextended figure.[4]
