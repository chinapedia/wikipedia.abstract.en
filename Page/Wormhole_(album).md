WORMHOLE is the debut album by the English drum and bass act Ed Rush & Optical. Recorded between 1997 and 1998, the album was issued on November 16, 1998 through their self-run Virus Recordings label[1] on vinyl and CD formats. The CD edition was a double disc, the second disc containing an hour-long continuous mix while the LP was a five-disc boxset, with a single track per side. On November 26, 2012, the album was reissued on both formats with new artwork, the LP edition being pressed on green vinyl.

Since the album's initial release in 1998, it has gained praise amongst critics, with some even considering it as one of the best drum and bass albums of all time.[2] _Wormhole_ is also considered to be the first neurofunk (a subgenre of drum and bass) album recorded.[3]

In 2016, Optical left a YouTube comment stating, "Half the drums were my original recordings of drummers I know...other half were taken from 70's funk tunes and resampled many times to get them to sound unique and solid...none of them were sped up as I always cut my drums into individual hits, reprogram them in my sequencer and use them at original pitch to keep their chunky sound intact."[4]
