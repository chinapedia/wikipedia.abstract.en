History

Haws Companies began to buy land for Station Park in 1996. Then they worked with Farmington city from 2000-2006 to develop the land before selling it to CenterCal properties in 2007. Development of Station Park began in 2008.[2] In 2013 Haws Companies filed a lawsuit against Farmington city citing discrimination against Haws Companies and failure to follow through on previous agreements.[3][4] In 2014 Haws Companies dropped the suit against Farmington city.[5] Station Park opened in 2011.
