History

An early variant name was Partlow, after J. W. Partlow, a railroad promoter.[3] A post office called Partlow was established in 1886, the name was changed to Bidwell in 1895, and the post office closed in 1915.[4] The present name of Bidwell was the wife's maiden name of an early postmaster.[5]
