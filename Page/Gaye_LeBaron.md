GAYE THERESA LEBARON (born 1935)[1] is an American newspaper columnist, author, teacher, and local historian of Sonoma County, California. She wrote more than 8,000 columns for _The Press Democrat_ from 1961 until her semi-retirement in 2001. She also co-authored two books on the history of Santa Rosa, California.


Early life and education

Gaye Andrews was born in a small town by the Eel River in Humboldt County, California. She moved with her mother to her stepfather's home in Boyes Hot Springs, Sonoma County, when she was 14. She was named for her father, Guy Andrews, who died when she was seven.[2][3]

She graduated from Sonoma Valley High School. She then attended Santa Rosa Junior College and transferred to the UC Berkeley, earning her B.A. in English and history.[4]


Career

During her college years, she interned at _The Press Democrat_ in Santa Rosa for three summers. She planned to teach high school in Redding after graduation, but when a staff position opened at the newspaper in September 1957, she opted to take that instead.[5] Initially she worked as a general assignment reporter. She wrote her first column for the November 23, 1959 issue, and in 1961 became the official community columnist.[6] Between 1970 and 1974 she stayed home to raise her children,[7] then renewed her daily column until her semi-retirement in January 2001.[8] As of 2004 she was writing two Sunday columns a month.[9][10]

By 2001, LeBaron had produced more than 8,000 columns for _The Press Democrat_, ranging from human interest to cultural events to ethnic history to local politics.[11][12] At one point she published six columns a week.[13] She was considered the "premier columnist" of the paper,[14] and a readership survey confirmed that hers was "the most popular feature in the paper".[15] She became a local celebrity.[16] She was even mentioned by a fictional character in Greg Sarris' 1998 novel _Watermelon Nights_:[17][18]

  "Patrick's studying journalism," I said, then thought of Mother's limitations. "He wants to be a writer," I translated.

  "I know, he told me," she said, "Like Gaye LeBaron. She tells about the goings-on."
