Felicia_Rice_self-portrait_from_the_artists_book,_DocUndoc.png FELICIA RICE (born 1954) is an American book artist, typographer, letterpress printer, fine art publisher, and educator. She lectures and exhibits internationally, and her books can be found in collections from Special Collections, Cecil H. Green Library (Stanford University) to the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) to the Bodleian Library (University of Oxford). Work from the Press is included in exhibitions and collections both nationally and internationally, and has been the recipient of numerous awards and grants.

Rice arrived in Santa Cruz in 1974 to study with San Francisco printer Jack Stauffacher and poet/printer William Everson at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Motivated to undertake nontraditional women’s work and gain access to the power of the press, Rice learned to handset type, run a hot lead typecasting machine, operate old style letterpresses, and began to publish books of contemporary art and literature. Since establishing Moving Parts Press in Santa Cruz, CA in 1977, Rice has collaborated with and published notable writers and artists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. A student of the history of the book and typography, she utilizes digital technology to produce letterpress artists books and prints.[1] The Moving Parts Press archives are held in Special Collections, University of California, Santa Barbara.


Early life

As a daughter of artist Miriam C. Rice (founding faculty of the Mendocino Art Center, founder of the IMDI.htm International Mushroom Dye Institute, and author of _Mushrooms for Color_) and artist Ray Rice (painter, mosaicist, and animator of experimental films), Felicia grew up immersed in the modern art scene of San Francisco and Mendocino during the 1950s–60s.

Her parents’ circle included former apprentices of Diego Rivera and friends of Frida Kahlo. Rice wrote, “As a young child I would sneak into my father’s studio to study José Guadalupe Posada’s prints sensationalizing fire, murder, freakish births. I grew up in California with the legacy of the Spanish land grants, the Californios, the Mexican muralists and their saints (San Francisco, Santa Cruz). I am a member of a hybrid community of immigrants and artists; we use multiple languages.”[2] As a university student in the 1970s, Rice worked with and learned from master printers Everson, Stauffacher, Adrian Wilson, and Sherwood Grover. Rice earned a BA with Highest Honors from UCSC in 1978.[3]


Artistic activity

Since 1977, Felicia Rice has published books, broadsides and prints under the Moving Parts Press imprint. These editions of new literature, works in translation, and contemporary art explore the relationship of word and image, typography and the visual arts, the fine arts, politics and popular culture. Since 1991, the Press's editorial focus has been on Latinx arts and literature.

Commenting on Rice’s work, Guillermo Gómez-Peña wrote, “Felicia is not just a book artist. She is also what insiders call a 'letterpress printer,' which means that she masterfully utilizes raised metal type and combines it with new digital tools. In this sense Felicia’s praxis extends from ancient book making techniques all the way to cyber-art. Her collaborative projects create book structures in which word and image meet and merge into a total experience."[4]

Through the process of developing the artists’ book, DOC/UNDOC, Rice experienced a profound transformation that led to an ongoing exploration of the book artist as performance artist.
