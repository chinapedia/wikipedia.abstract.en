Selected works[6]

The following are short descriptions of a few selected Bai's projects and series. Not described here include her Cellnoid project and numerous exhibitions.[7]

Porn Flower Series

One of her most well-known works is her series of _Porn Flowers—_a collection of paintings that use pornography magazines to generate unassuming images of flowers. Drawing her inspiration from working in the adult entertainment industry, critics note that the crude nature of the pornography and erotic imagery are imperceptible, and the flowers appear innocent and charming.[8] In this series, Bai wishes to express her sentiment that "all women are flowers."[9] In this statement, she expresses that beautiful things can manifest from situations that appear difficult to many.

Nipple Secret Project

In intimate person-to-person interactions, friends and Bai indulge their secrets. As a mock science experiment, women are asked "If you could only represent yourself through your nipple, how would you do it?" Bai considers this project to be a basic, scientific experiment in which the stimuli were the questions, the control group were the nine women ranging from 23 to 45 years old, and the resulting pattern of responses was one possible outcome.[10] The women were asked to share one secret and decorate their nipples as a form of self representation. Some allowed the artist to share enlarged images of their exposed nipples for exhibition.

Comfort Colors Series

In this series, Bai explicitly points to the first five years of a child's life as vital in the development of character and interests, preferences and curiosities. To Bai, The first five years of her life was spent in Beijing was a time of discovery, innocence, and playfulness. Bai intends to focus the series on Bai's childhood memories and emotional associations with her comfort colors.

Fusion Series

Bai's artist statement shared that Chaos, Order, Fusion, and Existence are abstract paintings reflective of elements in structure which counteract and stabilize chaotic occurrences.[11]

Personal life

Born in Beijing, China, Bai migrated to the United States when she was age 6.[14] Bai was raised in the deep South; she lived in Tallahassee, Florida for 12 years until she was awarded an achievement scholarship of $28,000 from August 1997 to May 2001 to pursue a degree at Agnes Scott College, a private, liberal arts women's college in Atlanta, Georgia.[15] In May 2001, Bai graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Studio Art (Painting) from Agnes Scott College.[16]

During Bai's college years, her mother was diagnosed with cancer, and her parents filed for bankruptcy; as a result, she worked as an exotic dancer to pay for the rest of her undergraduate education.[17] As a contemporary feminist artist, Bai works with explicit materials to create messages of female empowerment in her work.
