He continued his studies in Germany with Marie-Luise Neunecker before he received his master in music industry marketing in 2008 and his PhD in coaching/performance in 2012, both degrees at the University of Porto. During his training he played with the Portuguese Youth Orchestra, Ibero-American Youth Orchestra, Mediterranean Youth Orchestra, European Union Youth Orchestra, and attended master classes with Radovan Vlatkoviæ, Jeffrey Bryant, Stefan Dohr, Dale Clevenger and Hermann Baumann.[8]


Career as horn player

Pereira was the guest soloist at the 36th International Horn Symposium in Valencia, Spain, in 2004. In 2007, he was the artistic director of the First National Horn Congress in Porto. Between 2010 and 2012, he was the guest principal horn in the London Philharmonic Orchestra.[9]

Pereira had his first concert with the Berlin Philharmonic in September 2013 as guest principal horn. He also acted as guest principal horn with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra.[13][14]

Washington's National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) hired Pereira as principal horn in 2014, during the tenure of Christoph Eschenbach.[15]

One of the high points of Pereira's years in the NSO was the spring 2015 performance of Mahler's 9th Symphony, in which he produced "exquisite and always accurate solos"[16] while leading a horn section with "particularly ebullient and solid playing (...) with almost military precision."[17]

His performance was praised as being "in top form (...) with a consistently elegiac tone, unwavering breath support and power when needed."[18]

Describing his role in the NSO, Anne Midgette wrote: "Pereira, the principal horn player, has been a motivating force; other players are encouraged simply that the orchestra was able to win someone of his caliber. (...) Pereira would make a good poster boy for a new NSO, one representing the very best of musical quality."[19]

He performed more than 50 solo concerts with many internationally renowned orchestras, and played and taught at international music festivals such as Festival de Música do Estoril, Festival de Música de Sintra, Festival de Música da Póvoa de Varzim, CCB Summer Fest, Miami Summer Music Festival, HALCYON New Hampshire, Stellenbosch Chamber Music Festival, Festival de Artes de Maputo, Festival de Musique de Besançon, Ossiacher Festspiel Austria, Salzburger Festspiel, BBC Proms, Diaghilev Festival Perm, Athens Music Fest, Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, Berliner Festspiel, National Orchestra Institute, National Youth Orchestra, and the Brazilian Horn Association.[20][21]

He was the principal horn of the Porto Symphony Orchestra, Casa da Música, for 14 years. Pereira has been hailed as "one of the most renowned Portuguese interpreters of all time".[22][23][24]
