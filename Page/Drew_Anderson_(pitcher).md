Career

Anderson attended Galena High School in Reno, Nevada, and was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 21st round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft.[1] In 2013, he was an MiLB Philadelphia Phillies Organization All Star.[2] He missed the 2015 season recovering from Tommy John surgery, that April 2.

The Phillies added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season.[3] In 2017 as he played for Reading, he was the Eastern League Pitcher of the Week on both May 14 and June 4, and was an Eastern League Mid-Season All Star.[4]

Anderson received his MLB call-up on August 1, 2017, to fill the open roster spot after the Phillies traded away Joaqu√≠n Benoit.[5] After making his debut that day (on the road, against the Angels), he was optioned back to the AA Reading Fightin Phils the very next day.[6][7] He appeared in one more major league game that season, August 26, at home against the Cubs. Over his two 2017 Phillies appearances, he pitched a total of 2.1 innings and allowed 6 earned runs.[8]

In 2018 with the Phillies, he was 0-1 with a 4.97 ERA, and 11 strikeouts in 12.2 innings pitched.[9]
