COMROCK is the name of a record label created in Mexico in the 1980s that was dedicated to promoting rock bands. It was coordinated by Ricardo Ochoa, guitar player of Kenny y los Eléctricos, and brought a wide audience to many Mexican bands. Five finalist bands were selected to obtain a recording contract for an LP. Two songs from each of these finalist bands were included on the compilation disk.

The name of the label came from a fusion of the words "compañía" (company) and "rock", and meant "the rock company".

The groups were:

-   RITMO PELIGROSO
-   KENNY Y LOS ELÉCTRICOS
-   MASK
-   LOS CLIPS
-   PUNTO Y APARTE
-   LUZBEL
-   EL TRI

Both Ritmo Peligroso and Kenny y los Eléctricos changed their names; originally they were named Dangerous Rhythm and Kenny & the Electrics. But Mexican groups began to be criticized for using English names.


The compilation disk

-   RITMO PELIGROSO

Ritmo Peligroso and vocalist Piro found commercial success. Their contributions to the album were _Marielito_ and _Modern Minds_.

-   KENNY Y LOS ELÉCTRICOS

Kenny, the primary singer, and the other members of the group Kenny y los Eléctricos also participated in concerts in Los Angeles and in the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. _Me quieres cotorrear_ and _A woman in love_ were those included in the final cut from this group.

-   MASK

Another of the groups that participated in the recording of the disk was Mask, which contributed _I'm the Fox_ and _Going Down_, a very fine heavy metal cut. Its vocalist, José Fors, in 1989 founded La Cuca.

-   LOS CLIPS

Los Clips contributed the song titled _El Final_; this song has been interpreted by Rostros Ocultos, a group fronted by singer Cala, who was a vocalist for the Clips, as _Una Buena Leccion_.

-   PUNTO Y APARTE

Punto y Aparte contributed the song titled _Don´t Cry for the Radio_ considered by many an excellent pop rock cut, fresh and fine. Its other contribution to the disk was _Heart Break_.

-   PURPLE HAZE

With its songs _No More Wars! Life!_ and others, this has become one of the most recognized groups in the state of Mexico.

In the 2000s, the musical compilation recorded on vinyl discs, had a cult following among fans of the genre. In 2006 the commercial value of the vinyl disc was estimated at US $50-80 depending on condition and whether inner sheath and the liner notes with letters and photos of the groups were included.

In 2005 the album was remastered as _No por Suerte Studio_ and launched as a CD. Alejandro Fanghänel was involved in this new project as marketing director for the re-issue; Alejandro Giacomán remastered the album; Sol Sancristóbal (graphic design); with special thanks to Jesús Iturralde.

-   LUZBEL

Luzbel was one of the most representative Mexican rock bands, although the label only released their first three albums. _Metal caído del cielo, Pasaporte al infierno_ and _Luzbel_, left a huge legacy for all of their fans since the quality of their music was always very high. They became famous in the 80s and 90s, becoming one of the best and most successful metal bands of their time, with songs that became classics, like _El loco_, _La gran ciudad_, _Pasaporte al infierno_, _Por piedad_, _Criaturas de la noche_, _Souvenir_ and _Paradoja_, among others.
