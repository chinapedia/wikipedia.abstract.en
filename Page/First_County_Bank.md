History

On September 20, 1851, First County Bank was founded as the Stamford Savings Bank and elected its first president, Theodore Davenport. Stamford Savings Bank made loans for the construction and purchase of homes as well as safeguarded and invested the money of Stamford's residents. [3][4]

In 1875, Judge John Clason was elected a corporator of Stamford Savings Bank and was immediately made a director. He donated $10,000 to the Ferguson Library and $43,000 in securities to build a hospital in Stamford.

In 1883, the Bank's board voted to build the first Stamford Savings Bank. The building was called "The Old Red Bank" and was constructed by architect Warren R. Briggs.

In 1909, Schuyler Merritt, who became a U.S. Congressman, was elected a corporator of Stamford Savings Bank. The Merritt Parkway, a historic limited-access parkway in Fairfield County, Connecticut, was named after him.

In 1961, Stamford Savings Bank opened its first branch office in Darien. The bank opened a second branch in 1968 and continued to open branches throughout the early 1980s. [5]

In 1989, the bank changed its name from the Stamford Savings Bank to First County Bank, to better serve other growing towns in Fairfield County. [6]
