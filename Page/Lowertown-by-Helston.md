Railway_viaduct_over_the_River_Cober_-_geograph.org.uk_-_867107.jpg Lowertown_Methodist_Chapel_-_geograph.org.uk_-_867103.jpg LOWERTOWN-BY-HELSTON is a large hamlet in the civil parish of Sithney in Cornwall. The hamlet is one mile north of the centre of Helston. The hamlet is built around the River Cober. The hamlet used to be an industrial village, with mills, mines, train stations, shops and churches; all of which have been closed down. The hamlet used to be described as one of the "worst and dirtiest places you could imagine". Lowertown is now said to be one of the nicest places.

Because Lowertown is built on the side of the River Cober it is vulnerable to flooding. The hamlet is not known to have terrible floods but the river can overflow onto the road and path along it. The hill going down into Lowertown can also flood, but has never had a dramatic flood.

There are still remains of the mills and mines at Lowertown. The mills have been turned into houses as well as the other historic features and the old mines have now been taken away; however there are still remnants such as leats and other mine workings.

The hamlet of Gwavas is joined onto Lowertown. The Helston railway also went through Lowertown and there are two bridges in the hamlet and a 90-foot viaduct.
