Controversies

Nick Kyrgios was fined nearly US$17,000 for 'lack of best efforts' in his second round match against Mischa Zverev. Kyrgios threw the match 6-3 6-1, at one point asking the umpire, "Can you call time so I can finish this match and go home?" When later asked during a press conference if he thought he owed the fans a better effort, he responded: "What does that even mean? I'm good at hitting a tennis ball at the net. Big deal. I don't owe them anything. If you don't like it, I didn't ask you to come watch. Just leave."[1]
