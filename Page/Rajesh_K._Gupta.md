RAJESH K. GUPTA (born 1961) is a computer scientist and engineer, currently the Qualcomm Professor in Embedded Microsystems at University of California, San Diego.[1][2] His research concerns design and optimization of Cyber-physical systems (CPS). He is a Principal Investigator in the NSF MetroInsight project [3] and serves as Associate Director of the Qualcomm Institute (also known as California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology). His research contributions include SystemC[4] and SPARK Parallelizing High-level Synthesis. Earlier he led NSF Expeditions on Variability in Microelectronic circuits.[5]

He was the inaugural co-director of the UC San Diego Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute[6] along with Cognitive Science professor Jeffrey Elman. In addition, he chaired the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego until 2016 [7] during a time of extraordinary growth in Computer Science nationwide.[8]

He holds INRIA International Chair at the French international research institute in Rennes, Bretagne Atlantique. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery[9] and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science[10]. In 2019 he received the IEEE W. Wallace McDowell Award[11] for his "seminal contributions in design and implementation of Microelectronic Systems-on-Chip and Cyberphysical Systems."
