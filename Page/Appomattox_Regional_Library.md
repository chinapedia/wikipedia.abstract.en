History

The Appomattox Regional Library system started in 1930.[3] Thomas B. Robertson created a library association. Hopewell city took over the library and hired Maude Langhorne Nelson to be the library's first librarian. The library was then called John Randolph library, now the United Virginia Bank. The library was then moved in 1957 to the Municipal Building, the name changed to Maude Langhorne Nelson Library.

In 1974, the library became Appomattox Regional Library system when Prince George and Dinwiddie counties joined the city of Hopewell to form the regional library system. The library was named after the Appomattox River that runs through all of the areas within the libraries' boundaries.
