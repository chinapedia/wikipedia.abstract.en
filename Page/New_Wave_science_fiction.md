The NEW WAVE is a movement in science fiction produced in the 1960s and 1970s and characterized by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, a "literary" or artistic sensibility, and a focus on "soft" as opposed to hard science. New Wave writers often saw themselves as part of the modernist tradition and sometimes mocked the traditions of pulp science fiction, which some of them regarded as stodgy, adolescent and poorly written.[1]


Overview

The New Wave science fiction of the 1960s emphasized stylistic experimentation and literary merit over scientific accuracy or prediction. It was conceived as a deliberate break from the traditions of pulp SF, which many of the writers involved considered irrelevant and unambitious. It was, according to academic Brian McHale, the edge of science fiction which gave it the ambition of reaching literary status, making it a case, among all of the arts, which were to constitute the emergence of postmodernism.

The most prominent source of New Wave science fiction was the magazine _New Worlds_ under the editorship of Michael Moorcock, who assumed the position in 1964. Moorcock sought to use the magazine to "define a new avant-garde role" for science fiction[2] by the use of "new literary techniques and modes of expression."[3] It was also a period marked by the emergence of a greater variety of voices in science fiction, most notably the rise in the number of female writers, including Joanna Russ, Ursula K. Le Guin and James Tiptree, Jr..


Name

The term "New Wave" is borrowed from the French film movement the _nouvelle vague_.[4]

Gary K. Wolfe, professor of humanities and English at Roosevelt University, identifies the introduction of the term New Wave to science fiction[5] as occurring in 1966 in an essay[6] for _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_ written by Judith Merril, who was indirectly yet it seems unambiguously referring to that term in order to comment on the experimental fiction that had begun to appear in the English magazine _New Worlds_, after Michael Moorcock assumed editorship in 1964. However, Judith Merril denied she ever used that term.[7]

Merril later popularized this fiction in the United States through her edited anthology _England Swings SF: Stories of Speculative Fiction_ (Doubleday 1968), although an earlier anthology (Harlan Ellison's _Dangerous Visions_ [Doubleday 1967]) is a key harbinger of New Wave science fiction in the US.[8][9]


History

Influences and predecessors

Though the New Wave began in the 1960s, some of its tenets can be found in H. L. Gold's editorship of _Galaxy_, a science fiction magazine which began publication in 1950. James Gunn described Gold's focus as being "not on the adventurer, the inventor, the engineer, or the scientist, but on the average citizen,"[10] and according to SF historian David Kyle, Gold's work would lead to the New Wave.[11]

Algis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the "recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940's—the implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface".[12] The New Wave did not define itself as a development from the science fiction which came before it, but initially reacted against it. New Wave writers did not operate as an organized group, but some of them felt the tropes of the pulp and Golden Age periods had become worn out, and should be abandoned: J. G. Ballard stated in 1962 that "science fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars",[13] and Brian Aldiss said in _Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction_ that "the props of SF are few: rocket ships, telepathy, robots, time travel...like coins, they become debased by over-circulation."[14] Harry Harrison summarised the period by saying "old barriers were coming down, pulp taboos were being forgotten, new themes and new manners of writing were being explored".[15]

New Wave writers began to look outside the traditional scope of science fiction for influence; some looked to the example of beat writer William S. Burroughs – New Wave authors Philip José Farmer and Barrington J. Bayley wrote pastiches of his work ("The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod" and "The Four Colour Problem", respectively), while J. G. Ballard published an admiring essay in an issue of _New Worlds_.[16] Burroughs' use of experimentation such as the cut-up technique and his appropriation of science fiction tropes in radical ways proved the extent to which prose fiction could prove revolutionary, and some New Wave writers sought to emulate this style.

Ursula K. Le Guin, one of the writers to emerge in the 1960s, describes the transition to the New Wave era thus:

Critic Rob Latham identifies three trends that linked the advent of the New Wave in the 1960s to the emergence of cyberpunk in the 1980s. He said that changes in technology as well as an economic recession constricted the market for science fiction, generating a "widespread" malaise among fans, while established writers were forced to reduce their output (or, like Isaac Asimov, shifted their emphasis to other subjects); finally, editors encouraged fresh approaches that earlier ones discouraged.[17]

Movement

There is no consensus on a precise starting point of the New Wave – Adam Roberts refers to Alfred Bester as having singlehandedly invented the genre,[18] and in the introduction to a collection of Leigh Brackett's short fiction, Michael Moorcock referred to her as one of the genre's "true godmothers".[19] Budrys said that in New Wave writers "there are echoes ... of Philip K. Dick, Walter Miller, Jr. and, by all odds, Fritz Leiber".[20] However, it is widely accepted among critics that the New Wave began in England with the magazine _New Worlds_ and Michael Moorcock. who was appointed editor in 1964 (first issue number 142, May and June[21]) For example:

1) Luckhurst, Roger. _Science Fiction_ (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2005)

"What became known as the New Wave in SF was centred in England on the Magazine _New Worlds_, edited with missionary zeal by Michael Moorcock between 1964 and 1970 …"

2) James, Edward. _Science Fiction in the 20th century_ (Oxford University Press, 1994)

"In April 1963 Michael Moorcock contributes a guest editorial to John Carnell's _New Worlds_, Britain's leading SF magazine, which effectively announced the onset of the New Wave."

3) Roberts, Adam. _The History of Science Fiction_ (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005)

"It [the New Wave] was initially associated with the London magazine _New Worlds_, … which was reconfigured as a venue for experimental and unconventional fiction in the 1960s, particularly under the editorship of Michael Moorcock from 1964 …"

While the American magazines _Amazing Stories_, with Cele Goldsmith as editor, and _Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_ had from the start printed unusually literary stories, Moorcock turned that into a concerted policy. No other science fiction magazine sought as consistently to distance itself from traditional science fiction as much as _New Worlds_. By the time it ceased regular publication it had backed away from the science fiction genre itself, styling itself as an experimental literary journal.

Under Moorcock's editorship "galactic wars went out; drugs came in; there were fewer encounters with aliens, more in the bedroom. Experimentation in prose styles became one of the orders of the day, and the baleful influence of William Burroughs often threatened to gain the upper hand."[22] Judith Merril observed:

As an anthologist and speaker Merril with other authors advocated a reestablishment of science fiction within the literary mainstream and higher literary standards. Her "incredible controversy" is characterized by David Hartwell in the opening sentence of a book chapter entitled "New Wave: The Great War of the 1960s": "Conflict and argument are an enduring presence in the SF world, but literary politics has yielded to open warfare on the largest scale only once."[23] The heresy was beyond the experimental and explicitly provocative as inspired by Burroughs. In all coherence with the literary _nouvelle vague_ although not in close association to it, and addressing a much less restricted pool of readers, the New Wave was reversing the standard hero's attitude toward action and science. It illustrated egotism - by depriving the plot of all motivation toward a rational explanation.[24]

In 1963 Moorcock wrote:

In 1962 Ballard wrote:

Moorcock, Ballard, and others engendered much animosity from the established SF community. When reviewing _2001: A Space Odyssey_, Lester del Rey described it as "the first of the New Wave-Thing movies, with the usual empty symbolism".[25] Budrys in _Galaxy_, when reviewing a collection of recent stories from the magazine, said in 1965 that "There is this sense in this book ... that modern science fiction reflects a dissatisfaction with things as they are, sometimes to the verge of indignation, but also retains optimism about the eventual outcome". When reviewing _World's Best Science Fiction: 1966_ he mocked Ellison's "'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman" and two other stories as "rudimentary social consciousness ... deep stuff" and insufficient for "an outstanding science-fiction story".[26] Hartwell noted Budrys's "ringing scorn and righteous indignation" that year in "one of the classic diatribes against Ballard and the new mode of SF then emergent":[27]

Despite his criticism of Ballard and Aldiss ("the least talented" of the four), Budrys called them, Roger Zelazny, and Samuel R. Delany "an earthshaking new kind" of writers. Asimov said in 1967 of the New Wave, "I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction", but Budrys that year warned that the four would soon leave those "still reading everything from the viewpoint of the 1944 _Astounding_ ... nothing but a complete collection of yellowed, crumble-edged bewilderment". While acknowledging the New Wave's "energy, high talent and dedication", and stating that it "may in fact be the shape of tomorrow's science fiction generally — hell, it may be the shape of today's science fiction", as examples of the movement Budrys much preferred Zelazny's _This Immortal_ to Thomas Disch{{'}}s _The Genocide_. Predicting that Zelazny's career would be more important and lasting than Disch's, he described the latter's book as "unflaggingly derivative of" the New Wave and filled with "dumb, resigned victims" who "run, hide, slither, grope and die", like Ballard's _The Drowned World_ but unlike _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ ("about people who do something about their troubles").[28] Writing in _The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of_, Disch observed that:

Roger Luckhurst pointed out that Ballard's essay "Which Way to Inner Space?"[29] "showed the influence of media theorist Marshall McLuhan and the 'anti-psychiatry' of R. D. Laing."[30] Luckhurst traces the influence of both these thinkers in Ballard's fiction, in particular _The Atrocity Exhibition_ (1970)[31]

Another central concern of the New Wave was a fascination with entropy – that the world (and the universe) must tend to disorder, to eventually run down to 'heat death'. Ballard provided

Like other writers for _New Worlds_ Zoline uses "science-fictional and scientific language and imagery to describe perfectly 'ordinary' scenes of life", and by doing so produces "altered perceptions of reality in the reader."[32]

Judith Merril, "whose annual anthologies were the first heralds of the coming of the [New Wave] cult,"[33] writing in 1967 in _The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction_ contrasts the SF New Wave (which she here terms 'The New Thing') in England and the United States:

Judith Merril's annual anthologies (1957–1968[34]), Damon Knight's _Orbit_ series, and Harlan Ellison's _Dangerous Visions_ featured American writers inspired by British writers (although some of the writers anthologized were British).[35] Brooks Landon, professor of English at the University of Iowa, says of _Dangerous Visions_ that it

The New Wave also had a political subtext:

Eric S. Raymond, looking at the New Wave with an even narrower political focus, observed:

For example, Judith Merril, "one of the most visible -- and voluble -- apostles of the New Wave in 1960s sf"[36] remembers her return from England to the United States:

Merril said later "At the end of the Convention week, the taste of America was sour in all our mouths,"[37] and "by the end of the Sixties, Merril was a political refugee living in Canada."[38]

Roger Luckhurst disagreed with those critics (he gives the example of Thomas Clareson) who perceived the New Wave in terms of rupture, suggesting that such a model

Caution is needed when assessing any literary movement. Science fiction writer Bruce Sterling, reacting to his association with another SF movement in the 1980s, remarked:

Similarly Rob Latham observed:

Bearing this proviso in mind it is still possible to sum up the New Wave in terms of rupture as is done for example by Darren Harris-Fain of Shawnee State University:

Decline and lasting influence

In the opening paragraph of an essay[39] on the New Wave Rob Latham relates that

Latham remarks that this analysis by Harlan Ellison "obscures Ellison's own prominent role – and that of other professional authors and editors such as Judith Merril, Michael Moorcock, Lester Del Rey, Frederik Pohl, and Donald A. Wollheim – in fomenting the conflict, …"

[40]

In the early 1970s a number of writers and readers pointed out that

The closing of New Worlds magazine in 1970 "marked the containment of New Wave experiment with the rest of the counter-culture. The various limping manifestations of New World across the 1970s … demonstrated the posthumous nature of its avant-gardism.[41]

In an essay _The Alien Encounter_ Professor Patrick Parrinder stated that "any meaningful act of defamiliarization can only be relative, since it is not possible for man to imagine what is utterly alien to him; the utterly alien would also be meaningless."[42] He continues later:

Veteran science fiction writer Jack Williamson (1908–2006) when asked in 1991: "Did the [New] Wave's emphasis on experimentalizm and its conscious efforts to make SF more 'literary' have any kind of permanent effects on the field?" replied:

It has been observed that

Hartwell maintained that after the New Wave, science fiction had still managed to retain this "marginality and tenuous self-identity":

Scientific accuracy was more important than literary style to Campbell, and top _Astounding_ contributors Asimov, Heinlein, and L. Sprague de Camp were trained scientists and engineers.[43] Asimov said in 1967 "I hope that when the New Wave has deposited its froth and receded, the vast and solid shore of _science_ fiction will appear once more".[44][45] Asimov himself was to illustrate just how that "SF shore" did indeed re-emerged, vast, solid—but changed. A biographer noted that during the 1960s

Darren Harris-Fain observed on this return to writing SF by Asimov that

Other themes dealt with in the novel are concerns for the environment and "human stupidity and the delusional belief in human superiority", both frequent topics in New Wave SF.[46]

Commenting in 2002 on the publication of the 35th Anniversary edition of the _Dangerous Visions_ anthology edited by Harlan Ellison, the critic Greg L. Johnson remarked that

Asimov agreed that "on the whole, the New Wave was a good thing".[47] He described several "interesting side effects" of the New Wave. Non-American SF became more prominent and the genre became international phenomenon. Other changes noted were that

The noted academic writer on science fiction Edward James described the New Wave and its impact as follows:


Authors

John Brunner is a primary exponent of dystopian New Wave science fiction.[48] Critic John Clute wrote of M. John Harrison's early writing that it "... reveals its New-Wave provenance in narrative discontinuities and subheads after the fashion of J. G. Ballard".[49] Brian Aldiss, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Norman Spinrad, Roger Zelazny are writers whose work, though not considered New Wave at the time of publication, later became to be associated with the label.[50] Of later authors, the work of Joanna Russ is considered by scholar Peter Nicholls to bear stylistic resemblance to New Wave.[51] Thomas M. Disch repudiated the "new wave" label: "If you mean to ask--do I feel solidarity with all writers who have ever been lumped together under that heading--certainly I do not."[52]
