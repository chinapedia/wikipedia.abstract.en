_FALLING AWAKE_ is the second studio album by Canadian indie-rock band Goodnight, Sunrise, released worldwide on September 30, 2016.[1]

Like the band's debut album Create/Destroy/Create, Falling Awake is a concept album. It describes a journey of self-exploration that moves through songs of uncertainty, fear, and chaos, towards self-knowledge.[2] The album release was preceded by the first single "Familiar Faces" on July 6, 2016.[3]
