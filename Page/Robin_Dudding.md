Robin_Dudding_New_Zealand_literary_editor_1990s.jpg ROBIN NELSON DUDDING (7 December 1935 – 21 April 2008) was a New Zealand literary editor and journalist who founded the influential literary journal _Islands_ (1972–1988).

He was also editor of the literary journals _Landfall_ (1966–1972) and _Mate_ (1957–1966), and publisher of a number of novels and poetry and essay collections. He has been called the “most gifted and significant literary editor” of his generation, having given many New Zealand writers their first prominent outlet.[1]


Background

Dudding was born in Hastings in the Hawke’s Bay, son of Ernest, a baker, and Winifred (née Hinton) a schoolteacher. He attended Hastings High School, where he developed an interest in writing and literature.


Career

Dudding was a cadet reporter at the _Hawke's Bay Herald-Tribune_ from 1952 until moving to Auckland in the mid 1950s. He joined the _Auckland Star_, after a short time working as a freelance “seagull” labourer on the wharves. In 1959 he left the _Star_ to train as a primary schoolteacher.

While still a reporter, Dudding fell in with the Auckland literary set, whose gatherings revolved around the Queen’s Ferry pub in the central city. In 1957 he took over the co-editorship, and then full editorship, of the magazine _Mate_, whose first edition had been edited by the poet Kevin Ireland. Contributions to _Mate_ 2 included Barry Crump’s first published story,[2] as well as writing by Maurice Gee, Frank Sargeson and Ireland. _Mate_ was produced from Dudding’s home in Torbay on Auckland’s North Shore, and he supported his unpaid literary endeavours and his growing family with full-time work as a reporter, and later teacher.

In 1966 Dudding moved to Christchurch to take over the editorship of literary journal _Landfall_ from founder Charles Brasch, and to be general editor of the Caxton Press. In 1972 he was fired from Caxton and founded his own magazine, _Islands_, once again supporting literary editing with other work, including freelance editing, teaching and gardening. The magazine was swiftly recognised as the “pre-eminent literary periodical of the 1970s”,[3] and was published by Dudding, with occasional pauses, until 1988. There were 38 issues in all.

From the mid-1980s Dudding wrote the _Bookmarks_ column for the _New Zealand Listener_ and was later a subeditor for the magazine. In 2003 he was guest editor of the annual online anthology _Best New Zealand Poems_.[4]


Awards and prizes

In 1976, an issue of _Islands_ was devoted to the Ian Wedde novel _Dick Seddon’s Great Dive_, which won the 1977 Book Award for Fiction.[5] The following year, Dudding published Kevin Ireland’s poetry collection _Literary Cartoons_, which won the 1979 Book Award for Poetry.[6] Dudding was awarded Auckland University’s first Literary Fellowship in 1979.[7]

In April 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate for literature by Auckland University, but died of emphysema two days before the ceremony. His award was received on his behalf by his family.[8]


Personal

Dudding married Lois Yvonne Miller in 1958. They had five daughters and a son. He was an enthusiastic gardener and chicken breeder. He was a heavy smoker until his late 50s.

In November 2016 Victoria University Press published a memoir about Dudding by his journalist son Adam Dudding, entitled _My Father's Island_,[9][10] which is shortlisted in the general non-fiction category of the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards.[11]
