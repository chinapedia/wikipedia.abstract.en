INFINITIVE (abbreviated ) is a grammatical term referring to certain verb forms existing in many languages, most often used as non-finite verbs. As with many linguistic concepts, there is not a single definition applicable to all languages. The word is derived from Late Latin _[modus] infinitivus_, a derivative of _infinitus_ meaning "unlimited".

In traditional descriptions of English, the infinitive is the basic dictionary form of a verb when used non-finitely, with or without the particle _to_. Thus _to go_ is an infinitive, as is _go_ in a sentence like "I must go there" (but not in "I go there", where it is a finite verb). The form without _to_ is called the BARE INFINITIVE, and the form with _to_ is called the FULL INFINITIVE or _TO_-INFINITIVE.

In many other languages the infinitive is a single word, often with a characteristic inflective ending, like _morir_ ("(to) die") in Spanish, _manger_ ("(to) eat") in French, _portare_ ("(to) carry") in Latin, _lieben_ ("(to) love") in German, etc. However, some languages have no infinitive forms. Many Native American languages, and some languages in Africa and Australia do not have direct equivalents to infinitives or verbal nouns. Instead, they use finite verb forms in ordinary clauses or various special constructions.

Being a verb, an infinitive may take objects and other complements and modifiers to form a verb phrase (called an INFINITIVE PHRASE). Like other non-finite verb forms (like participles, converbs, gerunds and gerundives), infinitives do not generally have an expressed subject; thus an infinitive verb phrase also constitutes a complete non-finite clause, called an INFINITIVE (INFINITIVAL) CLAUSE. Such phrases or clauses may play a variety of roles within sentences, often being nouns (for example being the subject of a sentence or being a complement of another verb), and sometimes being adverbs or other types of modifier. Many verb forms known as infinitives differ from gerunds (verbal nouns) in that they do not inflect for case or occur in adpositional phrases. Instead, infinitives often originate in earlier inflectional forms of verbal nouns.[1] Unlike finite verbs, infinitives are not usually inflected for tense, person, etc. either, although some degree of inflection sometimes occurs; for example Latin has distinct active and passive infinitives.


Phrases and clauses

An _infinitive phrase_ is a verb phrase constructed with the verb in infinitive form. This consists of the verb together with its objects and other complements and modifiers. Some examples of infinitive phrases in English are given below – these may be based on either the full infinitive (introduced by the particle _to_) or the bare infinitive (without the particle _to_).

-   (to) sleep
-   (to) write ten letters
-   (to) go to the store for a pound of sugar

Infinitive phrases often have an implied grammatical subject making them effectively clauses rather than phrases. Such _infinitive clauses_ or _infinitival clauses_, are one of several kinds of non-finite clause. They can play various grammatical roles like a constituent of a larger clause or sentence; for example it may form a noun phrase or adverb. Infinitival clauses may be embedded within each other in complex ways, like in the sentence:

-   I want to tell you that Brett Favre is going to get married.

Here the infinitival clause _to get married_ is contained within the finite dependent clause _that Brett Favre is going to get married_; this in turn is contained within another infinitival clause, which is contained in the finite independent clause (the whole sentence).

The grammatical structure of an infinitival clause may differ from that of a corresponding finite clause. For example, in German, the infinitive form of the verb usually goes to the end of its clause, whereas a finite verb (in an independent clause) typically comes in second position.


Clauses with subject in the accusative case

Following certain verbs or prepositions, infinitives commonly _do_ have an expressed subject, e.g.,

-   I want THEM TO EAT THEIR DINNER.
-   For HIM TO FAIL NOW would be a disappointment.

As these examples illustrate, the subject of the infinitive is in the objective case (them, him) in contrast to the nominative case that would be used with a finite verb, e.g., "They ate their dinner." Such accusative and infinitive constructions are present in Latin and Ancient Greek, as well as many modern languages. The unusual case for the subject of an infinitive is an example of exceptional case-marking, where the infinitive clause's role being an object of a verb or preposition (want, for) overpowers the pronoun's subjective role within the clause.


Marking for tense, aspect and voice

In some languages, infinitives may be marked for grammatical categories like voice, aspect, and to some extent tense. This may be done by inflection, like with the Latin perfect and passive infinitives, or by periphrasis (with the use of auxiliary verbs), like with the Latin future infinitives or the English perfect and progressive infinitives.

Latin has present, perfect and future infinitives, with active and passive forms of each. For details see .

English has infinitive constructions that are marked (periphrastically) for aspect: perfect, progressive (continuous), or a combination of the two (perfect progressive). These can also be marked for passive voice (as can the plain infinitive):

-   _(to) eat_ (plain infinitive, active)
-   _(to) be eaten_ (passive)
-   _(to) have eaten_ (perfect active)
-   _(to) have been eaten_ (perfect passive)
-   _(to) be eating_ (progressive active)
-   _(to) be being eaten_ (progressive passive)
-   _(to) have been eating_ (perfect progressive active)
-   _(to) have been being eaten_ (perfect progressive passive, not often used)

Further constructions can be made with other auxiliary-like expressions, like _(to) be going to eat_ or _(to) be about to eat_, which have future meaning. For more examples of the above types of construction, see .

Perfect infinitives are also found in other European languages that have perfect forms with auxiliaries similarly to English. For example, _avoir mangé_ means "(to) have eaten" in French.


English

Regarding English, the term "infinitive" is traditionally applied to the unmarked form of the verb (the "plain form") when it forms a non-finite verb, whether or not introduced by the particle _to_. Hence _sit_ and _to sit_, as used in the following sentences, would each be considered an infinitive:

-   I can SIT here all day.
-   I want TO SIT on the other chair.

The form without _to_ is called the _bare infinitive_; the form introduced by _to_ is called the _full infinitive_ or _to-infinitive_.

The other non-finite verb forms in English are the gerund or present participle (the _-ing_ form), and the past participle – these are not considered infinitives. Moreover, the unmarked form of the verb is not considered an infinitive when it is forms a finite verb: like a present indicative ("I _sit_ every day"), subjunctive ("I suggest that he _sit_"), or imperative ("_Sit_ down!"). (For some irregular verbs the form of the infinitive coincides additionally with that of the past tense and/or past participle, like in the case of _put_.)

Certain auxiliary verbs are defective in that they do not have infinitives (or any other non-finite forms). This applies to the modal verbs (_can_, _must_, etc.), as well as certain related auxiliaries like the _had_ of _had better_ and the _used_ of _used to_. (Periphrases can be employed instead in some cases, like _(to) be able to_ for _can_, and _(to) have to_ for _must_.) It also applies to the auxiliary _do_, like used in questions, negatives and emphasis like described under _do_-support. (Infinitives are negated by simply preceding them with _not_. Of course the verb _do_ when forming a main verb can appear in the infinitive.) However, the auxiliary verbs _have_ (used to form the perfect) and _be_ (used to form the passive voice and continuous aspect) both commonly appear in the infinitive: "I should HAVE finished by now"; "It's thought TO HAVE been a burial site"; "Let him BE released"; "I hope TO BE working tomorrow."

Huddleston and Pullum's _Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_ (2002) does not use the notion of the "infinitive" ("there is no form in the English verb paradigm called 'the infinitive'"), only that of the _infinitival clause_, noting that English uses the same form of the verb, the _plain form_, in infinitival clauses that it uses in imperative and present-subjunctive clauses.[2]

A matter of controversy among prescriptive grammarians and style writers has been the appropriateness of separating the two words of the _to_-infinitive (as in "I expect _to_ happily _sit_ here"). For details of this, see split infinitive. Opposing linguistic theories typically do not consider the _to_-infinitive a distinct constituent, instead regarding the scope of the particle _to_ as an entire verb phrase; thus, _to buy a car_ is parsed like _to [buy [a car]]_, not like _[to buy] [a car]_.

Uses of the infinitive

The bare infinitive and the _to_-infinitive have a variety of uses in English. The two forms are mostly in complementary distribution – certain contexts call for one, and certain contexts for the other; they are not normally interchangeable, except in occasional instances like after the verb _help_, where either can be used.

The main uses of infinitives (or infinitive phrases) are like follows:

-   As complements of other verbs. The bare infinitive form is a complement of the dummy auxiliary _do_, most modal auxiliary verbs, verbs of perception like _see_, _watch_ and _hear_ (after a direct object), and the verbs of permission or causation _make_, _bid_, _let_, and _have_ (also after a direct object). The _to_-infinitive is used after many intransitive verbs like _want_, _aim_, _like_, _fail_, etc., and like a second complement after a direct object in the case of verbs like _want_, _convince_, _aim_, etc.
-   In various particular expressions, like _had better_ and _would rather_ (with bare infinitive), _in order to_, _as if to_, _am to/is to/are to_.
-   As a noun phrase, expressing its action or state in an abstract, general way, forming the subject of a clause or a predicative expression: "TO ERR is human"; "TO KNOW me is TO LOVE ME". The bare infinitive can be used in such sentences like "What you should do is MAKE a list." A common construction with the _to_-infinitive involves a dummy pronoun subject (_it_), with the infinitive phrase placed after the predicate: "It was nice TO MEET you."
-   Adverbially, to express purpose, intent or result – the _to_-infinitive can have the meaning of "in order to..." (I closed the door (in order) to block out any noise).
-   As a modifier of a noun or adjective. This may relate to the meaning of the noun or adjective ("a request TO SEE someone"; "keen TO GET on"), or it may form a type of non-finite relative clause, like in "the man TO SAVE us"; "the method TO USE"; "nice TO LISTEN to".
-   In elliptical questions (direct or indirect): "I don't know where TO GO." After _why_ the bare infinitive is used: "Why REVEAL it?"

The infinitive is also the usual dictionary form or citation form of a verb. The form listed in dictionaries is the bare infinitive, although the _to_-infinitive is often used in referring to verbs or in defining other verbs: "The word 'amble' means 'to walk slowly'"; "How do we conjugate the verb _to go_?"

For further detail and examples of the uses of infinitives in English, see Bare infinitive and _To_-infinitive in the article on uses of English verb forms.


Other Germanic languages

The original Proto-Germanic ending of the infinitive was _-an_, with verbs derived from other words ending in _-jan_ or _-janan_.

In German it is _-en_ ("sagen"), with _-eln_ or _-ern_ endings on a few words based on -l or -r roots ("segeln", "ändern"). The use of _zu_ with infinitives is similar to English _to_, but is less frequent than in English. German infinitives can form nouns, often expressing abstractions of the action, in which case they are of neuter gender: _das Essen_ means _the eating_, but also _the food_.

In Dutch infinitives also end in _-en_ (_zeggen_ — _to say_), sometimes used with _te_ similar to English _to_, e.g., "Het is niet moeilijk te begrijpen" → "It is not hard to understand." The few verbs with stems ending in _-a_ have infinitives in -n (_gaan_ — _to go_, _slaan_ — _to hit_). Afrikaans has lost the distinction between the infinitive and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs "wees" (to be), which admits the present form "is", and the verb "hê" (to have), whose present form is "het".

In North Germanic languages the final _-n_ was lost from the infinitive as early as 500–540 AD, reducing the suffix to _-a_. Later it has been further reduced to _-e_ in Danish and some Norwegian dialects (including the written majority language bokmål). In the majority of Eastern Norwegian dialects and a few bordering Western Swedish dialects the reduction to _-e_ was only partial, leaving some infinitives in _-a_ and others in _-e_ (å laga vs. å kaste). In northern parts of Norway the infinitive suffix is completely lost (å lag’ vs. å kast’) or only the _-a_ is kept (å laga vs. å kast’). The infinitives of these languages are inflected for passive voice through the addition of _-s_ or _-st_ to the active form. This suffix appearance in Old Norse was a contraction of _mik_ (“me”, forming _-mk_) or _sik_ (reflexive pronoun, forming _-sk_) and was originally expressing reflexive actions: (hann) _kallar_ (“(he) calls”) + _-sik_ (“himself”) > (hann) _kallask_ (“(he) calls himself”). The suffixes _-mk_ and _-sk_ later merged to _-s_, which evolved to _-st_ in the western dialects. The loss or reduction of _-a_ in active voice in Norwegian did not occur in the passive forms (_-ast_, _-as_), except for some dialects that have _-es_. The other North Germanic languages have the same vowel in both forms.


Latin and Romance languages

The formation of the infinitive in the Romance languages reflects that in their ancestor, Latin, almost all verbs had an infinitive ending with _-re_ (preceded by one of various thematic vowels). For example, in Italian infinitives end in _-are_, _-ere_, _-rre_ (rare), or _-ire_ (which is still identical to the Latin forms), and in _-arsi_, _-ersi_, _-rsi_, _-irsi_ for the reflexive forms. In Spanish and Portuguese, infinitives end in _-ar_, _-er_, or _-ir_ (Spanish also has reflexive forms in _-arse_, _-erse_, _-irse_), while similarly in French they typically end in _-re_, _-er_, _oir_, and _-ir_. In Romanian, both short and long-form infinitives exist; the so-called "long infinitives" end in _-are, -ere, -ire_ and in modern speech are used exclusively as verbal nouns. Verbs that cannot be converted into the nominal long infinitive are very rare[3]). The "short infinitives" used in verbal contexts (e.g., after an auxiliary verb) have the endings _-a_,_-ea_, _-e_, and _-i_ (basically removing the ending in "-re"). In Romanian, the infinitive is usually replaced by a clause containing the conjunction _să_ plus the subjunctive mood. The only verb that is modal in common modern Romanian is the verb _a putea_, to be able to. However, in popular speech the infinitive after _a putea_ is also increasingly replaced by the subjunctive.

In all Romance languages, infinitives can also form nouns.

Latin infinitives challenged several of the generalizations about infinitives. They did inflect for voice (_amare_, "to love", _amari_, to be loved) and for tense (_amare_, "to love", _amavisse_, "to have loved"), and allowed for an overt expression of the subject (_video Socratem currere_, "I see Socrates running"). See .

Romance languages inherited from Latin the possibility of an overt expression of the subject (as in Italian _vedo Socrate correre_). Moreover, the "INFLECTED INFINITIVE" (or "personal infinitive") found in Portuguese and Galician inflects for person and number. These, alongside Sardinian, are the only Indo-European languages that allow infinitives to take person and number endings. This helps to make infinitive clauses very common in these languages; for example, the English finite clause _in order that you/she/we have..._ would be translated to Portuguese like _para terES/ela ter/terMOS..._ (Portuguese is a null-subject language). The Portuguese personal infinitive has no proper tenses, only aspects (imperfect and perfect), but tenses can be expressed using periphrastic structures. For instance, _even though you sing/have sung/are going to sing_ could be translated to _apesar de cantares/teres cantado/ires cantar_.

Other Romance languages (including Spanish, Romanian, Catalan, and some Italian dialects) allow uninflected infinitives to combine with overt nominative subjects. For example, Spanish _al abrir YO los ojos_ ("when I opened my eyes") or _sin YO saberlo_ ("without my knowing about it").[4][5]


Hellenic languages

Ancient Greek

In Ancient Greek the infinitive has four tenses (present, future, aorist, perfect) and three voices (active, middle, passive). Present and perfect have the same infinitive for both middle and passive, while future and aorist have separate middle and passive forms.

+---------+--------+--------+---------+
|         | active | middle | passive |
+=========+========+========+=========+
| present |        |        |         |
+---------+--------+--------+---------+
| future  |        |        |         |
+---------+--------+--------+---------+
| aorist  |        |        |         |
+---------+--------+--------+---------+
| perfect |        |        |         |
+---------+--------+--------+---------+

Thematic verbs form present active infinitives by adding to the stem the thematic vowel and the infinitive ending , and contracts to , e.g., . Athematic verbs, and perfect actives and aorist passives, add the suffix instead, e.g., . In the middle and passive, the present middle infinitive ending is , e.g., and most tenses of thematic verbs add an additional between the ending and the stem, e.g., .

Modern Greek

The infinitive _per se_ does not exist in Modern Greek. To see this, consider the ancient Greek _ἐθέλω γράφειν_ “I want to write”. In modern Greek this become _θέλω να γράψω_ “I want that I write”. In modern Greek, the infinitive has thus changed form and function and is used mainly in the formation of periphrastic tense forms and not with an article or alone. Instead of the Ancient Greek infinitive system _γράφειν, γράψειν, γράψαι, γεγραφέναι_, Modern Greek uses only the form _γράψει_, a development of the ancient Greek aorist infinitive _γράψαι_. This form is also invariable. The modern Greek infinitive has only two forms according to voice: for example, _γράψει_ for the active voice and _γραφ(τ)εί_ for the passive voice (coming from the ancient passive aorist infinitive _γραφῆναι_).


Balto-Slavic languages

The infinitive in Russian usually ends in _-t’_ (ть) preceded by a thematic vowel, or _-ti_ (ти), if not preceded by one; some verbs have a stem ending in a consonant and change the _t_ to _č’_, like _*mogt’ → moč’_ (*могть → мочь) "can". Some other Balto-Slavic languages have the infinitive typically ending in, for example, _-ć_ (sometimes _-c_) in Polish, _-t’_ in Slovak, _-t_ (formerly _-ti_) in Czech and Latvian (with a handful ending in -s on the latter), _-ty_ (-ти) in Ukrainian, -ць (_-ts_') in Belarusian. Lithuanian infinitives end in -_ti_, Slovenian end on -_ti_ or -_či_, and Croatian on -_ti_ or -_ći_.

Serbian officially retains infinitives -_ti_ or -_ći_, but is more flexible than the other slavic languages in breaking the infinitive through a clause. The infinitive nevertheless remains the dictionary form.

Bulgarian and Macedonian have lost the infinitive altogether except in a handful of frozen expressions where it is the same as the 3rd person singular aorist form. Almost all expressions where an infinitive may be used in Bulgarian are listed here; neverthess in all cases a subordinate clause is the more usual form. For that reason, the present first-person singular conjugation is the dictionary form in Bulgarian, while Macedonian uses the third person singular form of the verb in present tense.


Hebrew

Hebrew has _two_ infinitives, the infinitive absolute and the infinitive construct. The infinitive construct is used after prepositions and is inflected with pronominal endings to indicate its subject or object: _bikhtōbh hassōphēr_ "when the scribe wrote", _ahare lekhtō_ "after his going". When the infinitive construct is preceded by (_lə-_, _li-_, _lā-_, _lo-_) "to", it has a similar meaning to the English _to_-infinitive, and this is its most frequent use in Modern Hebrew. The infinitive absolute is used for verb focus and emphasis, like in _mōth yāmūth_ (literally "a dying he will die"; figuratively, "he shall indeed/surely die").[6] This usage is commonplace in the Bible, but in Modern Hebrew it is restricted to high-flown literary works.

Note, however, that the _to_-infinitive of Hebrew is not the dictionary form; that is the third person singular perfect form.


Finnish

The Finnish grammatical tradition includes many non-finite forms that are generally labeled as (numbered) infinitives although many of these are functionally converbs. To form the so-called first infinitive, the strong form of the root (without consonant gradation or epenthetic 'e') is used, and these changes occur:

1.  the root is suffixed with _-ta/-tä_ according to vowel harmony
2.  consonant elision takes place if applicable, e.g., _juoks+ta_ → _juosta_
3.  assimilation of clusters violating sonority hierarchy if applicable, e.g., _nuol+ta_ → _nuolla_, _sur+ta_ → _surra_
4.  't' weakens to 'd' after diphthongs, e.g., _juo+ta_ → _juoda_
5.  't' elides if intervocalic, e.g., _kirjoitta+ta_ → _kirjoittaa_

As such, it is inconvenient for dictionary use, because the imperative would be closer to the root word. Nevertheless, dictionaries use the first infinitive.

There are also four other infinitives, plus a "long" form of the first:

-   The long first infinitive is _-kse-_ and must have a personal suffix appended to it. It has the general meaning of "in order to [do something], e.g., _kirjoittaakseni_ "in order for me to write [something]".
-   The second infinitive is formed by replacing the final _-a/-ä_ of the first infinitive with _e_. It can take the inessive and instructive cases to create forms like _kirjoittaessa_ "while writing".
-   The third infinitive is formed by adding _-ma_ to the first infinitive, which alone creates an "agent" form: _kirjoita-_ becomes _kirjoittama_. The third infinitive is technically a noun (denoting the act of performing some verb), so case suffixes identical to those attached to ordinary Finnish nouns allow for other expressions using the third infinitive, e.g., _kirjoittamalla_ "by writing".
    -   A personal suffix can then be added to this form to indicate the _agent participle_, such that _kirjoittamani kirja_ = "The book that I wrote."
-   The fourth infinitive adds _-minen_ to the first to form a noun that has the connotation of "the process of [doing something]", e.g., _kirjoittaminen_ "[the process of] writing". It, too, can be inflected like other Finnish nouns that end in _-nen_.
-   The fifth infinitive adds _-maisilla-_ to the first, and like the long first infinitive, must take a possessive suffix. It has to do with being "about to [do something]" and may also imply that the act was cut off or interrupted, e.g., _kirjoittamaisillasi_ "you were about to write [but something interrupted you]". This form is more commonly replaced by the third infinitive in adessive case, usually also with a possessive suffix (thus _kirjoittamallasi_).

Note that all of these must change to reflect vowel harmony, so the fifth infinitive (with a third-person suffix) of _hypätä_ "jump" is _hyppäämäisillään_ "he was about to jump", not _*hyppäämaisillaan_.


Seri

The Seri language of northwestern Mexico has infinitival forms used in two constructions (with the verb meaning 'want' and with the verb meaning 'be able'). The infinitive is formed by adding a prefix to the stem: either _iha-_ (plus a vowel change of certain vowel-initial stems) if the complement clause is transitive, or _ica-_ (and no vowel change) if the complement clause is intransitive. The infinitive shows agreement in number with the controlling subject. Examples are: _icatax ihmiimzo_ 'I want to go', where _icatax_ is the singular infinitive of the verb 'go' (singular root is _-atax_), and _icalx hamiimcajc_ 'we want to go', where _icalx_ is the plural infinitive. Examples of the transitive infinitive: _ihaho_ 'to see it/him/her/them' (root _-aho_), and _ihacta_ 'to look at it/him/her/them' (root _-oocta_).


Translation to languages without an infinitive

In languages without an infinitive, the infinitive is translated either as a _that_-clause or as a verbal noun. For example, in Literary Arabic the sentence "I want to write a book" is translated as either _urīdu an aktuba kitāban_ (lit. "I want that I write a book", with a verb in the subjunctive mood) or _urīdu kitābata kitābin_ (lit. "I want the writing of a book", with the _masdar_ or verbal noun), and in Levantine Colloquial Arabic _biddi aktub kitāb_ (subordinate clause with verb in subjunctive).

Even in languages that have infinitives, similar constructions are sometimes necessary where English would allow the infinitive. For example, in French the sentence "I want you to come" translates to _Je veux que vous veniez_ (lit. "I want that you come", with _come_ being in the subjunctive mood). However, "I want to come" is simply _Je veux venir_, using the infinitive, just as in English. In Russian, sentences such as "I want you to leave" do not use an infinitive. Rather, they use the conjunction чтобы "in order to/so that" with the past tense form (most probably remnant of subjunctive) of the verb: _Я хочу, чтобы вы ушли_ (literally, "I want so that you left").
