JOHN HEAVEY was a Roman Catholic bishop in Queensland, Australia. From 1941 to 1948, he was Roman Catholic Bishop of Cairns.


Early life

John Heavy was born in County Wicklow, Ireland.[1]


Religious life

Heavey was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in Rome as a member of the Augustinian Order in 1891. He served as professor and prior of the order in County Wexford, Ireland, before being appointed in 1914 as Vicar-Apostolic of Cooktown (then expected to be the major town of Northern Queensland, Australia).[2]

In 1941, the Vicariate of Cooktown was elevated to the Diocese of Cairns with Heavey as its first Bishop.[3][4] The renaming reflected that Cairns had overtaken Cooktown as the major town in Northern Queensland.


Death

On 12 June 1948, Heavey died in Cairns. His funeral was held at St Monica's Cathedral in Cairns with the panegyric preached by Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig.[5]
