The CHARLESTON ROCKETS were a professional American football team based in Charleston, West Virginia. They began play in 1964 as a member of the United Football League, and became a charter franchise in the Continental Football League in 1965. In their first season in the CFL, the Rockets finished with a perfect 14-0 record and won the league championship over the Toronto Rifles, 24-7. After an ownership change in 1968, the team announced that it was suspending operations in January 1969.[1] Its place in the league's lineup was replaced by the Jersey Jays, returning the CFL to North Jersey after the departure of the Newark Bears to Orlando three seasons prior.
