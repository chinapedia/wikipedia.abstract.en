_DESIRE_ (aka _The Magic Skin_) is a 1920 British silent fantasy film directed by George Edwardes-Hall, produced by Edward Godal, and starring Dennis Neilson-Terry, Yvonne Arnaud and Christine Maitland[1]. The film was known in England as _The Magic Skin_. The screenplay was based on the 1831 Honore de Balzac novel _Le Peau de Chagrin_, which strangely was adapted to film three different times in 1920 alone, the other two being released as _The Dream Cheater_ and _Narayama_[2].

Born in 1872, director Hall relocated from his birthplace Brooklyn, New York to England later in life, then moved to California where he died in 1922. He actually did more screenwriting than directing during his career, and also wrote a number of plays and short stories[3].


Plot
