_The Real Housewives of Auckland_

In 2016, Gilda signed on for _The Real Housewives of Auckland_.[7] One of her quotes "Do you know what I've heard about you, not a f*****g thing" made her an internet meme. Gilda and fellow cast member Angela Stone occasionally had arguments throughout the series. Gilda also stated in an interview "I also had a good conversation with Kylie Washington, the producer from Australia. She came to my house and I admired her as a woman. She explained that sometimes people aren’t happy with the programme – but if you be yourself then you’ll have no regrets. Plus she said that they wanted to hang onto us for a second series. So if you’re unhappy it’s no good for us".[8]

As of 2019 there is no agreement for a second season of the show.

_Astarons_ is a series of educational books, written in the sci-fi comic genre, for kids aged seven and over. The books are about eight super heroes going on a journey through the solar system, exploring the galaxy and further galaxies to the edge of the universe.[9]
