ANDREA TONOLI (born Gandellino, 6 February 1991) is an Italian composer and musician, active in different genres including contemporary classical music, film music and post-rock.


Early life

Born in Gandellino, near Bergamo, Italy, Tonoli started his music career at the age of 15. Refusing to learn music from teachers and conservatory, he continued to play for many years as a self taught musician.


Career

Listening to Yiruma, Yann Tiersen and Ludovico Einaudi led Tonoli to compose a few songs, which in 2012 were released as his first album, _Human_.

In 2013, he lost his father due to a serious disease and that led him to stay out of the music world for a while. After some months of loneliness, he wrote and recorded his 2nd album, _Human B-Side_. He started a netlabel the same year. His work was played at several concerts while he was working on his third album.

In 2014, he played some pieces of classical music and published them as his first side-album, under the title of "IrideScent Past". He went to London in April that year to play at "Ont'Sofa" at the Gibson HQ.

Tonoli released his first music video on December 19, 2014 for the song "Aurora". This song was the first track from his fourth album, _Met by the Moonlight_, which was released the same month. From the beginning of 2015, he started touring Italy with _Met by the Moonlight_, and in February he released his first official collection _Ace of Hearts_. In February 2015, he earned his first nomination for an international award,[1][2] the Hollywood Music in Media Awards 2015[3] as the best New Age Artist of the Year with the song "Aurora".

Tonoli stayed in Hollywood for the entire month of November, composing his new album and attending the awards. On December 21, 2015, he released a Special Edition of _Met by the Moonlight_. In 2016 he started a "comeback" tour in Italy, starting from Gandellino.[4]

From 2014 to 2016, he was a member of the Post-Rock Italian band L.E.D. In 2017 he released his new album _AnarchAngel Vol.1_ which he took on tour for the entire year in Europe.
