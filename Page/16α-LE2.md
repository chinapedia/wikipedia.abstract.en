16Α-LE2, or 16Α-LACTONE-ESTRADIOL, also known as 3,17Β-DIHYDROXY-19-NOR-17Α-PREGNA-1,3,5-(10)-TRIENE-21,16Α-LACTONE, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen featuring a estradiol core. It is a highly potent and selective agonist of the ERα that is used in scientific research to study the function of the ERα.[1][2] It has 265-fold higher potency in transactivation assays of the ERα relative to the ERβ and 70-fold preference in binding affinity for the ERα over the ERβ.[3]

In rodents, 16α-LE2 has no effect on ovarian follicle development, whereas the highly ERβ-selective agonist 8β-VE2 stimulates follicular growth and to a comparable extent as estradiol, indicating that the ERβ and not the ERα is involved in the effects of estrogen on ovarian follicles.[4][5] In contrast, 16α-LE2 stimulates uterine weight, whereas 8β-VE2 has no effect, indicating that the ERα and not the ERβ is involved in the effects of estrogen on the uterus.[6] Research has determined through experimental rodent studies with estradiol, 16α-LE2, and 8β-VE2 that the positive, protective effects of estrogens on bone formation resorption and bone mineral density are mediated via the ERα, whereas the ERβ does not appear to be involved.[7]
