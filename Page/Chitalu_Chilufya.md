Biography

Chilufya grew up in the Kaunda Square area of Lusaka.[1] He studied medicine at the University of Zambia and worked as a physician.[2] He was chosen as the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy candidate to contest the Mansa Central seat in the 2011 general elections. However, he was defeated by Kennedy Sakeni of the Patriotic Front.[3] Sakeni died in 2013 and Chilufya was adopted as the Patriotic Front candidate for the subsequent by-election, despite the party having labelled him as a thief in the 2011 election campaign,[4] and was elected to the National Assembly with an 8,392-vote majority.[5]

In February 2015 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Health. After retaining his seat in the 2016 general elections and increasing his majority to over 22,000,[6] he was promoted to Minister of Health.

Chilufya is married with two children.[7]
