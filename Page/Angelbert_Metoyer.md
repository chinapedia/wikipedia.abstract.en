ANGELBERT METOYER (born in July 1977 in Houston, Texas) (AN-gel-bər MUH-twy-ər) is an American visual artist on the forefront of afrofuturism.[1][2] Metoyer began his artistic career through Rick Lowe's Project Row Houses in Houston, Texas and held his first solo exhibition there in 1994. He subsequently moved to Atlanta to study drawing and painting at the Atlanta College of Art. Although a bit of a nomad having lived in various parts of the world, Metoyer currently lives with his wife and son in Houston and Rotterdam.[3]

Metoyer's art explores memory and social history through the lenses of science, philosophy, and religion. He works in various media, including drawing, painting, installation, and sound.[4] He appropriates unusual art materials, which he calls "excrements of industry," that include coal, glass, debris, oil, tar, mirrors, and gold dust.[5][6]

Metoyer's work is in the permanent collections of the US Department of State, Houston Museum of Fine Art, The Charles, H. Wright Museum, African American Museum of Contemporary Art, the ACE Collection, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Leipzig, Germany. He has shown at the Venice Biennale, Art Basel Miami, and a renegade show Art Basel Switzerland.

In addition, his artwork has been used in many album and book covers, including Mike Ladd's _Negrophilia_, Saul Williams' _Niggy Tardust_, Bilal's _In Another Life_, and Marcus Guillery's _Red Now and Laters_.
