DR. HILDA H. KROEGER (1903-1993)[1] was an American physician of Pittsburgh. A specialist in maternity treatment, Kroeger assisted in designing “an efficient labor and delivery-room suite,” nearly 20 years before the development of the Alternative Birth Centers (ABC’s) for women. This was developed in the Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospital in her home city. Because of this outstanding achievement, Dr. Kroeger was named one of the “Medical Women of the Year” in 1955.[2] She also became the director of the Division of Maternal and Child’s Health for the State Department of Health since 1941 and was awarded a two-year fellowship by the U.S. Public Health Service to study hospital administration at Yale University, New Haven, Conn.[3] She has given short talks to schools in Arizona on health, athletic, and recreation subjects.[4] Kroeger also backed up a large amount of work that went towards re-decorating the hospital sunrooms in the E-Wing of Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospital published in the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_ on November 14, 1956. The article included descriptions of baby blue and pink color schemes, coral pink shades, hand-block printed draperies, and much more.[5]
