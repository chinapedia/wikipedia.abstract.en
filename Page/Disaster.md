, remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States.]]

A DISASTER is a serious disruption occurring over a relatively short period of time, affecting the functioning of a community or a society as it causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.[1][2]

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.[3]

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of GDP) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.[4][5]


Etymology

The word _disaster_ is derived from Middle French _désastre_ and that from Old Italian _disastro_, which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek pejorative prefix δυσ-, (_dus-_) "bad"[6] and ἀστήρ (_aster_), "star".[7] The root of the word _disaster_ ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an astrological sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.[8]


Classification

Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years disaster research. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate emergency management measures.[9] Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in developing countries. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an earthquake that causes a tsunami, resulting in coastal flooding.

Natural disasters

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural disasters that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable landforms, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for disaster prevention and management. es and terrorist attacks are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the September 11 attacks in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

Man-made disasters

Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include stampedes, fires, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills, nuclear explosions/nuclear radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.

Other types of man-made disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic global warming, nuclear war, and bioterrorism.

The following table categorizes some disasters and notes first response initiatives. Note that whereas the sources of a disaster may be natural (for example, heavy rains) or man-made (for example, a broken dam), the results may be similar (flooding).[10]


Responses

  Natural                           Disaster
  --------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Example                           Profile
  Avalanche                         The sudden, drastic flow of snow down a slope, occurring when either natural triggers, such as loading from new snow or rain, or artificial triggers, such as explosives or backcountry skiers, overload the snowpack
  Blizzard                          A severe snowstorm characterized by very strong winds and low temperatures
  Earthquake                        The shaking of the earth's crust, caused by underground volcanic forces of breaking and shifting rock beneath the earth's surface
  Fire (wild)                       Fires that originate in uninhabited areas and which pose the risk to spread to inhabited areas
  Flood                             Flash flooding: Small creeks, gullies, dry streambeds, ravines, culverts or even low-lying areas flood quickly
  Freezing Rain                     Rain occurring when outside surface temperature is below freezing
  Heat wave                         A prolonged period of excessively hot weather relative to the usual weather pattern of an area and relative to normal temperatures for the season
  Hurricane                         Heavy rains and high winds
  Landslide                         Geological phenomenon which includes a range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows
  Lightning strike                  An electrical discharge caused by lightning, typically during thunderstorms
  Limnic eruption                   The sudden eruption of carbon dioxide from deep lake water
  Tornado                           Violent rotating columns of air which descent from severe thunderstorm cloud systems
  Tsunami                           A series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, typically an ocean or a large lake, usually caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water
  Volcanic eruption                 The release of hot magma, volcanic ash and/or gases from a volcano
  Man-made                          Bioterrorism
  Civil unrest                      A disturbance caused by a group of people that may include sit-ins and other forms of obstructions, riots, sabotage and other forms of crime, and which is intended to be a demonstration to the public and the government, but can escalate into general chaos
  Fire (urban)                      Even with strict building fire codes, people still perish needlessly in fires
  Hazardous material spills         The escape of solids, liquids, or gases that can harm people, other living organisms, property or the environment, from their intended controlled environment such as a container.
  Nuclear and Radiation Accidents   An event involving significant release of radioactivity to the environment or a reactor core meltdown and which leads to major undesirable consequences to people, the environment, or the facility
  Power Failure                     Caused by summer or winter storms, lightning or construction equipment digging in the wrong location
