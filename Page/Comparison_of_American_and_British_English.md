The English language was first introduced to the Americas by British colonization, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The language also spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonisation and the spread of the former British Empire, which, by 1921, included about 470–570 million people, about a quarter of the world's population. Written forms of British and American English as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional noticeable differences.[1]

Over the past 400 years, the forms of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now often referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary (lexis), spelling, punctuation, idioms, and formatting of dates and numbers. However, the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than in other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A few words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from Noah Webster, who wrote the first American dictionary (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from those spoken in the UK, much like a regional accent.[2]

This divergence between American English and British English has provided opportunities for humorous comment: e.g. in fiction George Bernard Shaw says that the United States and United Kingdom are "two countries divided by a common language";[3] and Oscar Wilde says that "We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language" (_The Canterville Ghost_, 1888). Henry Sweet incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible (_A Handbook of Phonetics_). Perhaps increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and globalization has tended to reduce regional variation. This can lead to some variations becoming extinct (for instance _the wireless_ being progressively superseded by _the radio_) or the acceptance of wide variations as "perfectly good English" everywhere.

Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassment—for example, in American English a _rubber_ is usually interpreted as a _condom_ rather than an _eraser_;[4] and a British _fanny_ refers to the female pubic area, while the American _fanny_ refers to an _ass_ (US) or an _arse_ (UK).


Word derivation and compounds

-   Directional suffix _-ward(s)_: British _forwards_, _towards_, _rightwards_, etc.; American _forward_, _toward_, _rightward_. In both dialects distribution varies somewhat: _afterwards_, _towards_, and _backwards_ are not unusual in America; while in the United Kingdom _upward_ and _rightward_ are the more common options, as is _forward_, which is standard in phrasal verbs such as _look forward to_.[5][6][7] The forms with _-s_ may be used as adverbs (or preposition _towards_) but rarely as adjectives: in the UK, as in America, one says "an upward motion". The Oxford English Dictionary in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with _-wards_ having a more definite directional sense than _-ward_; subsequent authorities such as Fowler have disputed this contention.
-   American English (AmE) freely adds the suffix _-s_ to _day_, _night_, _evening_, _weekend_, _Monday_, etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: _I used to stay out evenings_; _the library is closed Saturdays_. This usage has its roots in Old English but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels _nights_ "now chiefly N. Amer. colloq." in constructions such as _to sleep nights_, but _to work nights_ is standard in British English).
-   In British English (BrE), the agentive _-er_ suffix is commonly attached to _football_ (also _cricket_; often _netball_; occasionally _basketball_ and _volleyball_). AmE usually uses _football player_. Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both dialects: for example, _golfer_, _bowler_ (in Ten-pin bowling and in Lawn Bowls), and _shooter_. AmE appears sometimes to use the BrE form in _baller_ as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game _NBA Ballers_. However, this is derived from slang use of _to ball_ as a verb meaning to play basketball.
-   English writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases; for example, _health care_ is now being replaced by _healthcare_ on both sides of the Atlantic. However, AmE has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in BrE.
-   In compound nouns of the form , sometimes AmE prefers the bare infinitive where BrE favours the gerund. Examples include (AmE first): _jump rope_/_skipping rope_; _racecar_/_racing car_; _rowboat_/_rowing boat_; _sailboat_/_sailing boat_; _file cabinet_/_filing cabinet_; _dial tone_/_dialling tone_; _drainboard_/_draining board_.
-   Generally AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus preferring clipped forms: compare _cookbook_ v. _cookery book_; _Smith, age 40_ v. _Smith, aged 40_; _skim milk_ v. _skimmed milk_; _dollhouse_ v. _dolls' house_; _barber shop_ v. _barber's shop_.[8]
-   Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and _vice versa_. For example, the UK has a _drugs problem_, while the United States has a _drug problem_ (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the _sports_ section of a newspaper; the British are more likely to read the _sport_ section. However, BrE _maths_ is singular, just as AmE _math_ is: both are abbreviations of _mathematics_.
-   Some British English words come from French roots, while American English finds its words from other places, e.g. AmE _eggplant_ and _zucchini_ are _aubergine_ and _courgette_ in BrE.
-   Similarly, American English has occasionally replaced more traditional English words with their Spanish counterparts. This is especially common in regions historically affected by Spanish settlement (such as the American Southwest and Florida) as well as other areas that have since experienced strong Hispanic migration (such as urban centers). Examples of these include grocery markets' preference in the U.S. for Spanish names such as cilantro and manzanilla over coriander and camomile respectively.


Vocabulary

The familiarity of speakers with words and phrases from different regions varies, and the difficulty of discerning an unfamiliar definition also depends on the context and the term. As expressions spread with the globalization of telecommunication, they are often but not always recognized as foreign to the speaker's dialect, and words from other dialects may carry connotations (deserved or not) with regard to register, social status, origin, and intelligence.

Words and phrases with different meanings

Words such as _bill_ and _biscuit_ are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but can mean different things in each form. The word "bill" has several meanings, most of which are shared between AmE and BrE. However, in AmE "bill" often refers to a piece of paper money (as in a "dollar bill") which in BrE is more commonly referred to as a note. In AmE it can also refer to the visor of a cap.[9] In AmE a biscuit (from the French twice baked as in biscotto) is what in BrE is called a scone and a biscuit in BrE is in AmE a cookie (from the Dutch 'little cake'). As chronicled by Winston Churchill, the opposite meanings of the verb _to table_ created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces;[10] in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to _open it up_ for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to _remove_ it from discussion, or at times, to suspend or delay discussion.

The word "football" in BrE refers to association football, also known as soccer. In AmE, "football" means American football. The standard AmE term "soccer", a contraction of "association (football)", is of British origin, derived from the formalization of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until relatively recently; it has lately become perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. In international (i.e. non-American) context, particularly in sports news outside English-speaking North America, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies also use "football" to mean "soccer", especially in direct quotes.

Similarly, the word "hockey" in BrE refers to field hockey and in AmE, "hockey" means ice hockey.

Words with completely different meanings are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, _smart_, _clever_, _mad_).

Some differences in usage and/or meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example, the word _fanny_ is a slang word for vulva in BrE but means buttocks in AmE—the AmE phrase _fanny pack_ is _bum bag_ in BrE. In AmE the word _pissed_ means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, _pissed off_ means irritated).

Similarly, in AmE the word _pants_ is the common word for the BrE _trousers_ and _knickers_ refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term "shorts" rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand _pants_ to mean _underpants_ and _knickers_ to mean _female underpants_.

Sometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word _quite_ used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement: for example, "I'm quite hungry" means "I'm very hungry". In BrE _quite_ (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in "quite right" or "quite mad", but it more commonly means "somewhat", so that in BrE "I'm quite hungry" can mean "I'm somewhat hungry". This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.

Different terms in different dialects

Most speakers of American English are aware of some uniquely British terms, It is generally very easy to guess what some words, such as "driving licence", mean. However, use of many other British words such as _naff_ (slang but commonly used to mean "not very good") are unheard of in American English.

Speakers of BrE are likely to understand most common AmE terms, examples such as "sidewalk (pavement)", "gas (gasoline/petrol)", "counterclockwise (anticlockwise)" or "elevator (lift)", without any problem, thanks in part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Certain terms that are heard less frequently, especially those likely to be absent or rare in American popular culture, e.g., "copacetic (satisfactory)", are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.

Other examples:

-   In the UK the word _whilst_ is commonly used as a conjunction (as an alternative to _while_, especially prevalent in some dialects). In AmE _while_ is more commonly used in both contexts.[11] Other conjunctions with the _-st_ ending are also found even in AmE as much as in BrE, despite being old-fashioned or an affection. _Whilst_ tends to appear in non-temporal senses, as when used to point out a contrast.
-   In the UK generally the term _fall_ meaning "autumn" is obsolete. Although found often from Elizabethan literature to Victorian literature, continued understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.[12]
-   In the UK the term _period_ for a full stop is not used; in AmE the term _full stop_ is rarely, if ever, used for the punctuation mark. For example, Tony Blair said, "Terrorism is wrong, full stop", whereas in AmE, "Terrorism is wrong, period."[13] The use of the interjection: _period_ to mean _"and nothing else; end of discussion"_ is beginning to be used in colloquial British English, though sometimes without conscious reference to punctuation.

Holiday greetings

It is increasingly common for Americans to say "Happy holidays", referring to all, or at least multiple, winter (in the Northern hemisphere) or summer (in the Southern hemisphere) holidays (Christmas, Hanukkah, Winter solstice, Kwanzaa, etc.) especially when one's religious observances are not known; the phrase is rarely heard in the UK. In the UK, the phrases "holiday season" and "holiday period" refer to the period in the summer when most people take time off from work, and travel; AmE does not use _holiday_ in this sense, instead using _vacation_ for recreational excursions.

In AmE, the prevalent Christmas greeting is "Merry Christmas", which is the traditional English Christmas greeting, famously found in the English Christmas carol "We Wish You a Merry Christmas," and which appears several times in Charles Dickens' _A Christmas Carol_.[14] In BrE,"Happy Christmas" is a common alternative to "Merry Christmas".

Idiosyncratic differences

Ommission of "and" and "on"

Generally in English numbers over one hundred have the word "and" inserted before the last two digits. For example, the number 115 would be written or said, "One hundred and fifteen". This would be written or said, "One hundred fifteen" in the USA.

Likewise, in the USA, the word "on" is left out when referring to weekdays. The US, "The Cowboys won the game, Saturday" would have the equivalent in the UK of, "Derby County won the match on Saturday."

Figures of speech

Both BrE and AmE use the expression "I couldn't care less" to mean the speaker does not care at all. Some Americans use "I could care less" to mean the same thing. This variant is frequently derided as sloppy, as the literal meaning of the words is that the speaker _does_ care to some extent; the full expression is, "I could care less, but I'd have to try".

In both areas, saying, "I don't mind" often means, "I'm not annoyed" (for example, by someone's smoking), while "I don't care" often means, "The matter is trivial or boring". However, in answering a question such as "Tea or coffee?", if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, "I don't care", while a British person may answer, "I don't mind". Either sounds odd to the other.

Equivalent idioms

A number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:

  : The naming of school years in British (except Scotland) and American English

The US has a more uniform nationwide system of terms than does the U.K., but the division by grades varies somewhat among the states and even among local school districts. For example, _elementary school_ often includes kindergarten, and may include sixth grade, with _middle school_ including only two grades or extending to ninth grade.

In the UK the US equivalent of a _high school_ is often referred to as a "secondary school" regardless of whether it is state funded or private. Secondary education in the United States also includes _middle school_ or _junior high school_, a two- or three-year transitional school between elementary school and high school. "Middle school" is sometimes used in the UK as a synonym for the younger _junior school_, covering the second half of the primary curriculum—current years four to six in some areas. However, in Dorset (South England) it is used to describe the second school in the three-tier system, which is normally from year five to year eight. In other regions, such as Evesham and the surrounding area in Worcestershire, the second tier goes from year six to year eight, and both starting secondary school in year nine. In Kirklees, West Yorkshire in the villages of the Dearne Valley there is a three tier system: first schools year reception to year five, middle school (Scissett/Kirkburton Middle School) year six to year eight and high school ([23])year 9 to year 13.

A _public school_ has opposite meanings in the two countries. In AmE this is a government-owned institution open to all students, supported by public funding. The BrE use of the term is in the context of "private" education, i.e., to be educated privately with a tutor.[24] In England and Wales the term strictly refers to an ill-defined group of prestigious private independent schools funded by students' fees, although it is often more loosely used to refer to any independent school. Independent schools are also known as "private schools", and the latter is the term used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for all such fee-funded schools. Strictly, the term _public school_ is not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same sense as in England, but nevertheless Gordonstoun, the Scottish private school, is sometimes referred to as a _public school_, as are some other Scottish private schools. Government-funded schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are properly referred to as "state schools"—but are sometimes confusingly referred to as "public schools" (with the same meaning as in the US); whereas in the US, where most public schools are administered by local governments, a _state school_ is typically a college or university run by one of the states.

Speakers in both the United States and the United Kingdom use several additional terms for specific types of secondary school. A US _prep school_ or _preparatory school_ is an independent school funded by tuition fees; the same term is used in the UK for a private school for pupils under thirteen, designed to prepare them for fee-paying public schools. In the US, _catholic schools_ cover costs through tuition and have affiliations with a religious institution, most often a Catholic church or diocese. In England, where the state-funded education system grew from parish schools organized by the local established church, the Church of England (C. of E., or C.E.), and many schools, especially primary schools (up to age 11) retain a church connection and are known as _church schools_, _C.E. schools_ or _C.E. (aided) schools_. There are also _faith schools_ associated with the Roman Catholic Church and other major faiths, with a mixture of funding arrangements.

In the US, a _magnet school_ receives government funding and has special admission requirements: in some cases pupils gain admission through superior performance on admission tests, while other magnet schools admit students through a lottery. The UK has city academies, which are independent privately sponsored schools run with public funding and which can select up to 10% of pupils by aptitude. Moreover in the UK 36 local education authorities retain selection by ability at 11. They maintain grammar schools (state funded secondary schools), which admit pupils according to performance in an examination (known as the 11+) and comprehensive schools that take pupils of all abilities. Grammar schools select the most academically able 10% to 23% of those who sit the exam. Students who fail the exam go to a secondary modern school, sometimes called a "high school", or increasingly an "academy". In areas where there are no grammar schools the comprehensives likewise may term themselves high schools or academies. Nationally only 6% of pupils attend grammar schools, mainly in four distinct counties. Some private schools are called "grammar schools", chiefly those that were grammar schools long before the advent of state education.

University

In the UK a university student is said to "study", to "read" or, informally, simply to "do" a subject. In the recent past the expression 'to read a subject' was more common at the older universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. In the US a student _studies_ or _majors in_ a subject (although _concentration_ or _emphasis_ is also used in some US colleges or universities to refer to the major subject of study). _To major in_ something refers to the student's principal course of study; _to study_ may refer to any class being taken.

BrE:

AmE:

At university level in BrE, each _module_ is taught or facilitated by a _lecturer_ or _tutor_; _professor_ is the job-title of a senior academic (in AmE, at some universities, the equivalent of the BrE lecturer is instructor, especially when the teacher has a lesser degree or no university degree, though the usage may become confusing according to whether the subject being taught is considered technical or not; it is also different from adjunct instructor/professor). In AmE each _class_ is generally taught by a _professor_ (although some US tertiary educational institutions follow the BrE usage), while the position of _lecturer_ is occasionally given to individuals hired on a temporary basis to teach one or more classes and who may or may not have a doctoral degree.

The word _course_ in American use typically refers to the study of a restricted topic or individual subject (for example, "a course in Early Medieval England", "a course in integral calculus") over a limited period of time (such as a semester or term) and is equivalent to a _module_ or sometimes _unit_ at a British university. In the UK, a _course of study_ or simply _course_ is likely to refer to the entire programme of study, which may extend over several years and be made up of any number of _modules,_ hence it is also practically synonymous to a degree programme. A few university-specific exceptions exist: for example, at Cambridge the word _paper_ is used to refer to a _module_, while the whole course of study is called _tripos_.

A _dissertation_ in AmE refers to the final written product of a doctoral student to fulfil the requirement of that program. In BrE, the same word refers to the final written product of a student in an undergraduate or taught master's programme. A dissertation in the AmE sense would be a thesis in BrE, though _dissertation_ is also used.

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word _college_. (See a full international discussion of the various meanings at college.) In the US this refers to a post-high school institution that grants either associate's or bachelor's degrees, while in the UK it refers to any post-secondary institution that is not a university (including _sixth form college_ after the name in secondary education for years 12 and 13, the _sixth form_) where intermediary courses such as A levels or NVQs can be taken and GCSE courses can be retaken. College may sometimes be used in the UK or in Commonwealth countries as part of the name of a secondary or high school (for example, Dubai College). In the case of Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, London, Lancaster, Durham, Kent and York universities, all members are also members of a college which is part of the university, for example, one is a member of King's College, Cambridge and hence the university.

In both the US and UK _college_ can refer to some division within a university that comprises related academic departments such as the "college of business and economics" though in the UK "faculty" is more often used. Institutions in the US that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word _college_ as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a _university_. (There are exceptions: Boston College, Dartmouth College and the College of William & Mary are examples of colleges that offer advanced degrees, while Vincennes University is an unusual example of a "university" that offers only associate degrees in the vast majority of its academic programs.) American students who pursue a _bachelor's degree_ (four years of higher education) or an _associate degree_ (two years of higher education) are _college students_ regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as _colleges._ A student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is in AmE a _graduate student_; in BrE a _postgraduate student_ although _graduate student_ is also sometimes used. Students of advanced professional programs are known by their field (_business student_, _law student_, _medical student_). Some universities also have a residential college system, the details of which may vary but generally involve common living and dining spaces as well as college-organized activities. Nonetheless, when it comes to the LEVEL of education, AmE generally uses the word _college_ (e.g., going to college) whereas BrE generally uses the word _university_ (e.g., going to university) regardless of the institution's official designation/status in both countries.

In the context of higher education, the word _school_ is used slightly differently in BrE and AmE. In BrE, except for the University of London, the word school is used to refer to an academic department in a university. In AmE, the word school is used to refer to a collection of related academic departments and is headed by a dean. When referring to a division of a university, school is practically synonymous to a college.

"Professor" has different meanings in BrE and AmE. In BrE it is the highest academic rank, followed by reader, senior lecturer and lecturer. In AmE "professor" refers to academic staff of all ranks, with (full) professor (largely equivalent to the UK meaning) followed by associate professor and assistant professor.

"Tuition" has traditionally had separate meaning in each variation. In BrE it is the educational content transferred from teacher to student at a university. In AmE it is the money (the fees) paid to receive that education (BrE: tuition fees).

General terms

In both the US and the UK, a student _takes_ an exam, but in BrE a student can also be said to _sit_ an exam. When preparing for an exam students _revise_ (BrE)/_review_ (AmE) what they have studied; the BrE idiom _to revise for_ has the equivalent _to review for_ in AmE.

Examinations are supervised by _invigilators_ in the UK and _proctors_ (or _(exam) supervisors_) in the US (a _proctor_ in the UK is an official responsible for student discipline at the University of Oxford or Cambridge). In the UK a teacher _sets_ an exam, while in the US, a teacher _writes_ (prepares) and then _gives_ (administers) an exam.

BrE:

AmE:

In BrE, students are awarded _marks_ as credit for requirements (e.g., tests, projects) while in AmE, students are awarded _points_ or "grades" for the same. Similarly, in BrE, a candidate's work is being _marked_, while in AmE it is said to be _graded_ to determine what mark or grade is given.

There is additionally a difference between American and British usage in the word _school_. In British usage "school" by itself refers only to primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and to _sixth forms_ attached to secondary schools—if one "goes to school", this type of institution is implied. By contrast an American student at a university may talk of "going to school" or "being in school". US and British law students and medical students commonly speak in terms of going to "law school" and "med[ical] school", respectively. However, the word is used in BrE in the context of higher education to describe a division grouping together several related subjects within a university, for example a "School of European Languages" containing _departments_ for each language and also in the term "art school". It is also the name of some of the constituent colleges of the University of London, for example, School of Oriental and African Studies, London School of Economics.

Among high-school and college students in the United States, the words _freshman_ (or the gender-neutral terms _frosh_ or _first year_, sometimes _freshie_), _sophomore_, _junior_ and _senior_ refer to the first, second, third, and fourth years respectively. For first-year students, "frosh" and "freshie" are another gender-neutral terms that can be used as a qualifier, for example "Frosh class elections". It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established or else it must be stated directly (that is, _She is a high school freshman_. _He is a college junior._). Many institutes in both countries also use the term _first-year_ as a gender-neutral replacement for _freshman_, although in the US this is recent usage, formerly referring only to those in the first year as a graduate student. One exception is the University of Virginia; since its founding in 1819 the terms "first-year", "second-year", "third-year", and "fourth-year" have been used to describe undergraduate university students. At the United States service academies, at least those operated by the federal government directly, a different terminology is used, namely "fourth class", "third class", "second class" and "first class" (the order of numbering being the reverse of the number of years in attendance). In the UK first-year university students are sometimes called _freshers_ early in the academic year; however, there are no specific names for those in other years nor for school pupils. Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study, such as a "second-year medical student" or a "fifth-year doctoral candidate." Law students are often referred to as "1L", "2L", or "3L" rather than "nth-year law students"; similarly, medical students are frequently referred to as "M1", "M2", "M3", or "M4".

While anyone in the US who finishes studying at any educational institution by passing relevant examinations is said to _graduate_ and to be a _graduate_, in the UK only degree and above level students can _graduate_. _Student_ itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying at any educational institution or level, whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution and the term _pupil_ is more widely used for a young person at primary or secondary school, though the use of "student" for secondary school pupils in the UK is increasingly used, particularly for "sixth form" (years 12 and 13).

The names of individual institutions can be confusing. There are several "University High Schools" in the United States that are not affiliated with any post-secondary institutions and cannot grant degrees, and there is one public high school, Central High School of Philadelphia, which does grant bachelor's degrees to the top ten per cent of graduating seniors. British secondary schools occasionally have the word "college" in their names.

When it comes to the admissions process, applicants are usually asked to solicit _letters of reference_ or reference forms from referees in BrE. In AmE, these are called _letters of recommendation_ or recommendation forms. Consequently, the writers of these letters are known as _referees_ and _recommenders_, respectively.

In the context of education, for AmE, the word _staff_ mainly refers to school personnel who are neither administrators nor have teaching loads or academic responsibilities; personnel who have academic responsibilities are referred to as members of their institution's _faculty._ In BrE, the word _staff_ refers to both academic and non-academic school personnel. As mentioned previously, the term _faculty_ in BrE refers more to a collection of related academic departments.

Government and politics

In the UK, political candidates _stand for election_, while in the US, they _run for office_. There is virtually no crossover between BrE and AmE in the use of these terms. Also, the document which contains a party's positions/principles is referred to as a _party platform_ in AmE, whereas it is in BrE commonly known as a _party manifesto_. The term _general election_ is used slightly differently in British and American English. In BrE, it refers exclusively to a nationwide parliamentary election and is differentiated from local elections (mayoral and council), EU Parliamentary Elections and by-elections; whereas in AmE, it refers to an election for any government position in the US, in AmE the term is differentiated from the term _primary_ (an election that determines a party's candidate for the position in question).

In AmE, the term _swing state_, _swing county_, _swing district_ is used to denote a jurisdiction/constituency where results are expected to be close but crucial to the overall outcome of the general election. In BrE, the term _marginal constituency_ is more often used for the same and _swing_ is more commonly used to refer to how much one party has gained (or lost) an advantage over another compared to the previous election.

In the UK, the term _government_ only refers to what is commonly known in America as the _executive branch_.

Business and finance

In financial statements, what is referred to in AmE as _revenue_ or _sales_ is known in BrE as _turnover._

A bankrupt firm _goes into administration_ in BrE; in AmE it _goes bankrupt_, or _files for Chapter 7_ (liquidation) or _Chapter 11_ (reorganization). An insolvent individual or partnership _goes bankrupt_ in both jurisdictions.

If a finance company takes possession of a mortgaged property from a debtor, it is called _foreclosure_ in AmE and _repossession_ in BrE. In some, limited scenarios, _repossession_ may be used in AmE, but it is much less common compared to _foreclosure_. One common exception in AmE is for automobiles, which are always said to be _repossessed_. Indeed, an agent who collects these cars for the bank is colloquially known in AmE as a _Repoman_.

Employment and recruitment

In BrE, the term _curriculum vitae_ (commonly abbreviated to _CV_) is used to describe the document prepared by applicants containing their credentials required for a job. In AmE, the term _résumé_ is more commonly used, with _CV_ primarily used in academic or research contexts, and is usually more comprehensive than the _résumé_.

Transport

Americans refer to _transportation_ and British people to _transport_.[25] (_Transportation_ in the UK has traditionally meant the punishment of criminals by deporting them to an overseas penal colony.) In AmE, the word _transport_ is mainly used only as a verb, seldom as a noun or adjective except in reference to certain specialized objects, such as a _tape transport_ or a _military transport_ (e.g., a troop transport, a kind of vehicle, not an act of transporting).

Road transport

Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of roads. The British term _dual carriageway_, in American parlance, would be _divided highway_ or perhaps, simply _highway_. The _central reservation_ on a _motorway_ or _dual carriageway_ in the UK would be the _median_ or _center divide_ on a _freeway_, _expressway_, _highway_ or _parkway_ in the US. The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are known as _slip roads_ in the UK but in the US, they are typically known as _ramps_ and both further distinguish between _on-ramps_ or _on-slips_ (for entering onto a highway/carriageway) and _off-ramps_ or _exit-slips_ (for leaving a highway/carriageway). When American engineers speak of _slip roads_, they are referring to a street that runs alongside the main road (separated by a berm) to allow off-the-highway access to the premises that are there; however, the term, _frontage road_ is more commonly used, this term is the equivalent of _service road_ in the UK. However, it is not uncommon for an American to use _service road_ as well, in the stead of _frontage road_.

In the UK, the term _outside lane_ refers to the higher-speed _overtaking lane_ (_passing lane_ in the US) closest to the centre of the road, while _inside lane_ refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road. In the US _outside lane_ is used only in the context of a turn, in which case it depends in which direction the road is turning (i.e., if the road bends right the left lane is the "outside lane" but if the road bends left it is the right lane). Both also refer to _slow_ and _fast_ lanes (even though all actual traffic speeds may be at or around the legal speed limit).

In the UK _drink driving_ is against the law, while in the US, where the action is also outlawed, the term is _drunk driving_. The legal term in the US is _driving while intoxicated_ (DWI) or _driving under the influence (of alcohol)_ (DUI). The equivalent legal phrase in the UK is _drunk in charge of a motor vehicle_ (DIC) or more commonly _driving with excess alcohol_.[26]

In the UK, a hire car is the US equivalent of a rental car. The term "hired car" can be especially misleading for those in the US, where the term "hire" is generally only applied to people and the term "rent" is applied to goods. To an American, a "hired car" would therefore imply a driver is being hired with the car, such as a taxi, limousine, Uber driver, etc.

In the UK, a saloon is a vehicle that is equivalent to the American sedan. This is particularly confusing to Americans, because in the US the term _saloon_ is used in only one context: describing an old bar (UK pub) in the American West (a Western saloon). _Coupé_ is used by both to refer to a two-door car, but is usually pronounced with two syllables in the UK (coo-pay) and one syllable in the US (coop).

In the UK, a silencer is the equivalent to the US muffler. In the US, the word silencer has only one meaning: an attachment on the barrel of a gun designed to stop the distinctive crack of a gunshot.

Specific auto parts and transport terms have different names in the two dialects, for example:
{| class="wikitable sortable" |- !UK !US |- |accelerator |gas [pedal], accelerator |- |bonnet |hood[27] |- |boot |trunk[28][29] |- |mudguard, wheel arch, wing |fender[30] |- |hood, soft/hard top |convertible top, soft/hard top |- |car park |parking lot[31] |- |driving licence |driver's license[32] |- |dual carriageway |divided highway[33] |- |estate car |station wagon[34] |- |flyover |overpass,[35] flyover |- |gearbox |transmission[36] |- |hard shoulder |shoulder |- |hired car, hire car |rental car, rental |- |juggernaut, lorry |semi, semi-truck, 18 wheeler, tractor-trailer[37] |- |lorry |truck[38] |- |articulated lorry |trailer truck, semi[39] |- |manual |stick shift, manual |- |- |motorway |freeway,[40] highway or expressway |- |pavement |sidewalk[41] |- |roadworks |construction zone, roadwork |- |petrol |gasoline or gas[42] |- |saloon |sedan[43] |- |silencer |muffler[44] |- |spanner |wrench[45][46] |- |ticking over |idling[47] |- |windscreen |windshield[48] |- |car valeting |auto detailing |}

Rail transport

There are also differences in terminology in the context of rail transport. The best known is _railway_ in the UK and _railroad_ in America, but there are several others. A _railway station_ in the UK is a _railroad station_ or _train station_ in the US; trains have _drivers_ (often called _engine drivers_) in the UK, while in America trains are driven by _engineers_; trains have _guards_ in the UK and _conductors_ in the US; a place where two tracks meet is called a set of _points_ in the UK and a _switch_ in the US; and a place where a road crosses a railway line at ground level is called a _level crossing_ in the UK and a _grade crossing_ in America. In the UK, the term _sleeper_ is used for the devices that bear the weight of the rails and are known as _ties_ or _crossties_ in the United States. The British term _platform_ in the sense "The train is at Platform 1" would be known in the US by the term _track_, and used in the phrase "The train is on Track 1". Also, the British term _Brake Van_ or _Guard's Van_, is a _Caboose_ in the US. Finally the American English phrase "All aboard!" when getting on a train is rarely used in the UK; the nearest British equivalent is "Take your seats!", and when the train reaches its final stop, in the UK the phrase used by announcers is "All change!" while in America it is "All out!"

Television

Traditionally, a _show_ on British television would have referred to a light-entertainment program (BrE _programme_) with one or more performers and a participative audience, whereas in American television, the term is used for any type of program. British English traditionally referred to other types of program by their type, such as drama, serial etc., but the term _show_ has now taken on the American meaning. In American television the episodes of a program first broadcast in a particular year constitute a _season_, while the entire run of the program—which may span several seasons—is called a _series_. In British television, on the other hand, the word _series_ may apply to the episodes of a program in one particular year, for example, "The 1998 series of _Grange Hill_", as well as to the entire run. However, the entire run may occasionally be referred to as a "show". The term _telecast_, meaning television broadcast, is not used in British English. A television program would be _broadcast_, _aired_ or _shown_ in the UK.

Telecommunications

A long-distance call is a "trunk call" in British English, but is a "toll call" in American English. The distinction is a result of historical differences in the way local service was billed; the Bell System traditionally flat-rated local calls in all but a few markets, subsidising local service by charging higher rates, or tolls, for intercity calls, allowing local calls to appear to be free. British Telecom (and the British Post Office before it) charged for all calls, local and long distance, so labelling one class of call as "toll" would have been meaningless.

Similarly, a toll-free number in America is a freephone number in the UK. The term "freefone" is a BT trademark.


Style

Use of _that_ and _which_ in restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses

Generally, a non-restrictive relative clause (also called non-defining or supplementary) is one that contains information that is supplementary, i.e. does not change the meaning of the rest of the sentence, while a restrictive relative clause (also called defining or integrated) is, one which contains information essential to the meaning of the sentence, effectively limiting the modified noun phrase to a subset that is defined by the relative clause.[49] An example of a restrictive clause is "The dog that bit the man was brown." An example of a non-restrictive clause is "The dog, which bit the man, was brown." In the former "that bit the man" identifies which dog the statement is about. In the latter, "which bit the man" provides supplementary information about a known dog. A non-restrictive relative clause is typically set off by commas, whereas a restrictive relative clause is not, but this is not a rule that is universally observed.[50] In speech, this is also reflected in the intonation.[51] Writers commonly use _which_ to introduce a non-restrictive clause, and _that_ to introduce a restrictive clause. _That_ is rarely used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause in prose. _Which_ and _that_ are both commonly used to introduce a restrictive clause; a study in 1977 reported that about 75 percent of occurrences of _which_ were in restrictive clauses.[52]

H. W. Fowler, in _A Dictionary of Modern English Usage_ of 1926 followed others in suggesting that it would be preferable to use _which_ as the non-restrictive (what he calls non-defining) pronoun and _that_ as the restrictive (what he calls defining) pronoun, but he also stated that this rule was observed neither by most writers nor by the best writers.[53] He implied that his suggested usage was more common in American English.[54] Fowler notes that his recommended usage presents problems, in particular that _that_ must be the first word of the clause, which means, for instance, that _which_ cannot be replaced by _that_ when it immediately follows a preposition (e.g. "the basic unit _from which_ matter is constructed")[55] – though this would not prevent a stranded preposition (e.g. "the basic unit _that_ matter is constructed _from_").[56]

Style guides by American prescriptivists, such as Bryan Garner, typically insist, for stylistic reasons, that _that_ be used for restrictive relative clauses and _which_ be used for non-restrictive clauses, referring to the use of _which_ in restrictive clauses as a "mistake".[57] According to the 2015 edition of _Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage_, "In AmE _which_ is "not generally used in restrictive clauses, and that fact is then interpreted as the absolute rule that only _that_ may introduce a restrictive clause", whereas in BrE "either _that_ or _which_ may be used in restrictive clauses", but many British people "believe that _that_ is obligatory".[58]


Writing

Spelling

Before the early 18th century English spelling was not standardized. Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential dictionaries. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of Samuel Johnson's _Dictionary of the English Language_ (1755), while AmE spellings follow those of Noah Webster's _An American Dictionary of the English Language_ (1828). In the United Kingdom, the influences of those who preferred the French spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE spelling deviated from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were popularized, although often not created, by Noah Webster. Webster chose already-existing alternative spellings "on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".[59] Webster did attempt to introduce some reformed spellings, as did the Simplified Spelling Board in the early 20th century, but most were not adopted. Later spelling changes in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.

Punctuation

Full stops and periods in abbreviations

There have been some trends of transatlantic difference in use of periods in some abbreviations. These are discussed at _Abbreviation § Periods (full stops) and spaces_. Unit symbols such as kg and Hz are never punctuated.[60]

Parentheses/brackets

In British English, "( )" marks are often referred to as brackets, whereas "[ ]" are called square brackets and "{ }" are called curly brackets. In formal British English and in American English "( )" marks are parentheses (singular: parenthesis), "[ ]" are called brackets or square brackets, and "{ }" can be called either curly brackets or curly braces.[61] Despite the different names, these marks are used in the same way in both dialects.

Quoting

British and American English differ in the preferred quotation mark style, including the placement of commas and periods.

Commas in headlines

American newspapers commonly use a comma as a shorthand for "and" in headlines. For example, _The Washington Post_ had the headline "A TRUE CONSERVATIVE: For McCain, Bush Has Both Praise, Advice."[62]


Numerical expressions

There are many differences in the writing and speaking of English numerals, most of which are matters of style, with the notable exception of different definitions for billion.

The two countries have different conventions for floor numbering. The UK uses a mixture of the metric system and Imperial units, where in the US, United States customary units are dominant in everyday life with a few fields using the metric system.

Monetary amounts

Monetary amounts in the range of one to two major currency units are often spoken differently. In AmE one may say _a dollar fifty_ or _a pound eighty_, whereas in BrE these amounts would be expressed _one dollar fifty_ and _one pound eighty_. For amounts over a dollar an American will generally either drop denominations or give both dollars and cents, as in _two-twenty_ or _two dollars and twenty cents_ for $2.20. An American would not say _two dollars twenty_. On the other hand, in BrE, _two-twenty_ or _two pounds twenty_ would be most common.

It is more common to hear a British-English speaker say _one thousand two hundred dollars_ than _a thousand and two hundred dollars_, although the latter construct is common in AmE. In British English, the "and" comes after the hundreds (_one thousand, two hundred and thirty dollars_). The term _twelve hundred dollars_, popular in AmE, is frequently used in BrE but only for exact multiples of 100 up to 1900. Speakers of BrE very rarely hear amounts over 1900 expressed in hundreds, for example twenty-three hundred.

In BrE, particularly in television or radio advertisements, integers can be pronounced individually in the expression of amounts. For example, _on sale for £399_ might be expressed _on sale for three nine nine_, though the full _Three hundred and ninety-nine pounds_ is at least as common. An American advertiser would almost always say _on sale for three ninety-nine_, with context distinguishing $399 from $3.99. In British English the latter pronunciation implies a value in pounds and pence, so _three ninety-nine_ would be understood as £3.99.

In spoken BrE the word _pound_ is sometimes colloquially used for the plural as well. For example _three pound forty_ and _twenty pound a week_ are both heard in British English. Some other currencies do not change in the plural; yen and rand being examples. This is in addition to normal adjectival use, as in _a twenty-pound-a-week pay-rise_. The euro most often takes a regular plural -s in practice despite the EU dictum that it should remain invariable in formal contexts; the invariable usage is more common in Ireland, where it is the official currency.

In BrE the use of _p_ instead of _pence_ is common in spoken usage. Each of the following has equal legitimacy: _3 pounds 12 p_; _3 pounds and 12 p_; _3 pounds 12 pence_; _3 pounds and 12 pence_; as well as just _8 p_ or _8 pence_. In everyday usage the amount is simply read as figures (£3.50 = three pounds fifty)as in AmE.

AmE uses words such as _nickel_, _dime_, and _quarter_ for small coins. In BrE the usual usage is _a 10-pence piece_ or _a 10p piece_ or simply _a 10p_, for any coin below £1, but _pound coin_ and _two-pound coin_. BrE did have specific words for a number of coins before decimalisation. Formal coin names such as _half crown_ (2/6) and _florin_ (2/-), as well as slang or familiar names such as _bob_ (1/-) and _tanner_ (6d) for pre-decimalization coins are still familiar to older BrE speakers but they are not used for modern coins. In older terms like _two-bob bit_ (2/-) and _thrupenny bit_ (3d), the word _bit_ had common usage before decimalisation similar to that of _piece_ today.

In order to make explicit the amount in words on a check (BrE cheque), Americans write _three and _ (using this solidus construction or with a horizontal division line): they do not need to write the word _dollars_ as it is usually already printed on the check. On a cheque UK residents would write _three pounds and 24 pence_, _three pounds ‒ 24_, or _three pounds ‒ 24p_ since the currency unit is not preprinted. To make unauthorized amendment difficult, it is useful to have an expression terminator even when a whole number of dollars/pounds is in use: thus, Americans would write _three and _ or _three and _ on a three-dollar check (so that it cannot easily be changed to, for example, _three million_), and UK residents would write _three pounds only_.[63]

Dates

Dates are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 or 25.12.00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the US, although the formats 25/12/2000, 25.12.2000, and 12/25/2000 now have more currency than they had before Y2K. Occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the ISO 8601 2000-12-25, popular among programmers, scientists and others seeking to avoid ambiguity, and to make alphanumerical order coincide with chronological order. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding, especially when using software or equipment that uses the foreign format. For example 06/04/05 could mean either June 4, 2005 (if read as US format), 6 April 2005 (if seen as in UK format) or even 5 April 2006 if taken to be an older ISO 8601-style format where 2-digit years were allowed.

When using the name of the month rather than the number to write a date in the UK, the recent standard style is for the day to precede the month, e. g., 21 April. Month preceding date is almost invariably the style in the US, and was common in the UK until the late twentieth century. British usage often changes the day from an integer to an ordinal, i.e., 21st instead of 21. In speech, "of" and "the" are used in the UK, as in "the 21st of April". In written language, the words "the" and "of" may be and are usually dropped, i.e., 21 April. The US would say this as "April 21st", and this form is still common in the UK. One of the few exceptions in American English is saying "the Fourth of July" as a shorthand for the United States Independence Day. In the US military the British forms are used, but the day is read cardinally, while among some speakers of New England and Southern American English varieties and who come from those regions but live elsewhere, those forms are common, even in formal contexts.

Phrases such as the following are common in the UK but are generally unknown in the US: "A week today", "a week tomorrow", "a week Tuesday" and "Tuesday week"; these all refer to a day more than a week in the future. "A fortnight Friday" and "Friday fortnight" refer to a day two weeks after the coming Friday). "A week on Tuesday" and "a fortnight on Friday" could refer either to a day in the past ("it's a week on Tuesday, you need to get another one") or in the future ("see you a week on Tuesday"), depending on context. In the US the standard construction is "a week from today", "a week from tomorrow", etc. BrE speakers may also say "Thursday last" or "Thursday gone" where AmE would prefer "last Thursday". "I'll see you (on) Thursday coming" or "let's meet this coming Thursday" in BrE refer to a meeting later this week, while "not until Thursday next" would refer to next week.

Time

The 24-hour clock (_18:00_, _18.00_ or _1800_) is considered normal in the UK and Europe in many applications including air, rail and bus timetables; it is largely unused in the US outside military, police, aviation and medical applications. British English tends to use the full stop or period (.) when telling time, compared to American English which uses colons (:) (i.e., 11:15 PM or 23:15 for AmE and 11.15 pm or 23.15 for BrE).[64] Usually in the military (and sometimes in the police, aviation and medical) applications on both sides of the Atlantic _0800_ and _1800_ are read as _(oh/zero) eight hundred_ and _eighteen hundred_ hours respectively.

Fifteen minutes after the hour is called _quarter past_ in British usage and _a quarter after_ or, less commonly, _a quarter past_ in American usage. Fifteen minutes before the hour is usually called _quarter to_ in British usage and _a quarter of_, _a quarter to_ or _a quarter 'til_ in American usage; the form _a quarter to_ is associated with parts of the Northern United States, while _a quarter 'til_ is found chiefly in the Appalachian region. Thirty minutes after the hour is commonly called _half past_ in both BrE and AmE; _half after_ used to be more common in the US. In informal British speech, the preposition is sometimes omitted, so that 5:30 may be referred to as _half five_. The AmE formations _top of the hour_ and _bottom of the hour_ are not used in BrE. Forms such as _eleven forty_ are common in both dialects. To be simple and direct in telling time, no terms relating to fifteen or thirty minutes before/after the hour are used; rather the time is told exactly as for example _nine fifteen_, _ten forty-five_.


Demographics

Linguist Braj Kachru, quoted by the _Christian Science Monitor_ in 1996, stated that "American English is spreading faster than British English". The _Monitor_ stated that English taught in Europe, India, and parts of Asia and Africa is more British-influenced, while English taught in Latin America, Japan, Mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea is more American-influenced; however, most English use outside the classroom is more influenced by the United States: Americans greatly outnumber Britons; in addition, as of 1993, the United States originated 75 percent of the world's TV programming.[65] A BBC columnist assessed in 2015 that "American English is the current dominant force globally, like it or not".[66]
