JANE ELLEN PANTON or JANE ELLEN FRITH PANTON; JANE ELLEN FRITH (18 October 1847 – 13 May 1923) was an English writer.


Life

Panton was born as Jane Ellen Frith in Regents Park in 1847. Her father, William Powell Frith was a successful painter and Panton reports that he showed very little interest in his children. After her mother, Isabelle Jane, died in 1880 she found out that her father had a mistress and further children. At this point her father married his former mistress.

Panton appeared as a model in the 1859 painting trilogy Past and Present by Augustus Egg which incidentally deals with a spouse being unfaithful. She also appeared in other two paintings; one by her father and the other by Alfred Elmore. Her father's house would host visits by Charles Dickens and John Ruskin.[1]

She married James Albert Panton.[2] at All Saints' Church in Kensington on 10 August 1869. Her husband was a partner in a family brewery business and he was bought out by his brother's widow in 1882. They lived briefly in Bournemouth before moving to Bromley. Panton's friend was the writer Dinah Craik who lived nearby. Panton decided to write to raise money and she pitched the idea of articles on home furnishing to the _Ladies Pictorial_ magazine. She showed originality in her articles and in the idea of writing about interior design. In addition, Panton earned substantial sums as an interior design consultant.

Panton's novels were numerous, but "undistinguished".[3] They included _Having and Holding. A Story of Country Life_, which deals with rural politics in a fictional Southern English county.[4]

Jane Ellen Panton died in Bloomsbury in 1923.
