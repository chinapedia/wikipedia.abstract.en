LYANGCHA or LANGCHA or LEMCHA () is an Indian sweet dish prepared in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and in the eastern regions of India. It is made from flour and milk powder by frying it and dipping it into sugar syrup for a long time. The origin of the Bengali sweet is in Bardhaman, West Bengal, India.


Preparation

Traditionally, lyangcha is made from khoya (a form of solid milk). But due to unavailability of khoya at times, often milk powder is used instead of it.

Lyancha is made from flour, milk powder. The flour and milk powder is mixed thoroughly with soda and water and made into a dough. Ghee is added making the dough at constant intervals. Mixed well, the dough is kept untouched for few hours. Then the dough is divided into cylindrical shaped pieces with hand. The cylindrical pieces are then deep fried in oil until a brown crust is formed around and they turn stiff and hard. The fried cylindrical pieces are then boiled into sugar syrup. Once done, they are brought back to a tub containing cold rose flavored or elaichi flavored sugar syrup. Kept for few hours untouched, these hard pieces become soft and juicy, ready to be served on the plates.


History

The origin of the delicacy is said to be in the towns of Burdwan, in West Bengal, India. The genesis of _lyangcha_ actually goes back to a sweet maker in Burdwan (a district in West Bengal) who used to make _Pantua_ (fried sweetmeat made of flour and milk solids dipped in sugar syrup) of huge sizes. _Lyangcha_ – a sweetmeat in popular parlance – was created by the sweet makers of the region in Bengal.

According to local stories, the credit of lyangcha goes to a sweet maker named Lyangcha Dutta of Saktigarh. The noted novelist Narayan Sanyal in his novel _Rupamanjari_ actually tells a story. Goutam Dhoni, a journalist and correspondent of _Ekdin_ a Bengali Daily, tells another tale about _Nikhuti_ (a sweet famous in Krishnanagar). In his latest article in _Nadia Darpan (a local Bengali Daily)_ Dhoni brings to our attention how _Lyangcha_ has travelled from Krishananagar ( a town in Nadia District) to Burdwan and Shaktigarh. The genesis of _Lyangcha_ actually goes back to the matrimony alliance between the two super power kings in two different districts of present-day West Bengal. A matrimonial alliance between the royal families of Krishnanagar and Burdwan changed the genesis of _Lyangcha._

The story goes that the princess from the then Krishnanagar royal household was married to the prince of the Burdwan royal household. When she became pregnant she lost her appetite and refused to eat any food. She continued this for a long time even though she was requested to break her fast and even medical treatments were started. During this time, she expressed a desire to eat lyangcha – a sweetmeat that artisans from her maternal home used to prepare.

The then ruler of Krishnanagar made arrangements to find out who prepared _lyangcha_ but none of the _Modaks/ Moiras_ (The Bengali confectioner) in Krishnanagar were little familiar to _lyangcha_. Apparently, even the lady did not remember the name of the sweet. She had mentioned _Langcha_ because the sweet maker who used to prepare this specific sweetmeat could not walk properly (in Bengali, _Langcha_ means the one who limps). Then the sweet maker was called forth to the ruler of Krishnanagar in Krishnagar court, he was immediately sent off to Burdwan. He was given lands and other properties to settle in Burdwan so that he could prepare delicacies for the royalty. Currently Shaktigarh, Burdwan district of Bengal, is credited with huge _lyangchas_, but the shops in Krishnanagar take a special pride in how _Langcha_ has travelled from Krishnanagar to Burdwan.

Burdwan, a town in West Bengal is extremely famous for its lyangcha. Dipped in sweet sugar syrup, this serves as one of the most popular items in the dessert list of common people. Tarapith, a small village in West Bengal known for its Ma Tara temple, is also famous for its lyangcha. The large sized lyangchas made from flour and Khoya add to the sweetness of Bengal.

Lyangchas are of different taste there, black in color, fried more deeply and much sweeter than the ones found in any other parts of Bengal. These are also banana-shaped instead of cylindrical.
