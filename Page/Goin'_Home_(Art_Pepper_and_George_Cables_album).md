_GOIN' HOME_ is a duet album by saxophonist Art Pepper and pianist George Cables recorded in 1982 and released on the Galaxy label.[1][2][3]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow noted "Pepper never did decline on record, and although he died in June 1982 (just a month after the last of these duets), he is prime form throughout the emotional performances".[4]
