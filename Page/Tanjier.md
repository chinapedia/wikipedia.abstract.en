Tanjier.jpg TANJIER are an alternative synth-pop four-piece based in Dublin, Ireland. Formed in autumn 2015, the group have risen quickly through the ranks generating a substantial fan-base in a relatively short space of time. They were the overall winners of the RTÃ‰ 2FM and Oxfam's _Play the Picnic_ competition 2016[1] [2] having beaten four hundred odd entries. They have been selected as an _Irish Artist of the Week_ [3] by Dublinconcerts.ie and were selected by Whelans and _State Magazine_ as one of the thirty acts to watch in 2016. Tanjier are described as 'an incredible live act' [4] with a sound that is 'so dark and alluring, haunting and rife with meaning'. They blend synth-pop, indie-rock, electro-pop, and funk, 'resulting in a sound that feels both modern and yet has the elegance and grace of a bygone era'.
