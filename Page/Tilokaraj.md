Early life

According to the Chiang Mai Chronicle, he was the sixth child of King Sam Phraya (also known as Samfangkaen).[1] The 'lok' part of his name means sixth.


King of Lan Na

Location_Lanna_(under_King_Tilok).png He became king in 1443 by deposing his father, and within a year had imposed control over Nan and Phrae. He also attacked Luang Prabang, Chiang Rung, and the Shan region several times but could not impose control. He faced several revolts. He had his favorite son, Bunruang, executed on suspicion of disloyalty. While clearly a warlike ruler, he was also a vigorous patron of Sri Lankan-style Buddhism, building several monasteries including Wat Chet Yot and Wat Pa Daeng, and enlarging Wat Chedi Luang to house the Emerald Buddha.[2]
