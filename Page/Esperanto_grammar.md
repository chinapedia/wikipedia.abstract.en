ESPERANTO is a constructed language. It is designed to have a highly regular grammar, and as such is considered an easy language to learn.

Each part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with _‑o_; adjectives with _‑a_; present‑tense indicative verbs with _‑as_, and so on.

It is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 "meaning words", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.

Reference grammars include the _Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo)_ () by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien, and the _Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko_ () by Bertilo Wennergren.


Grammatical summary

Esperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the indicative has three tenses, and are derived for several aspects, but do not agree with the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects information flow and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.


Script and pronunciation

Esperanto uses the Latin alphabet with six additional lettersĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭand does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.

Zamenhof suggested Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation.


The article

Esperanto has a single definite article, _la_, which is invariable. It is similar to English "the".

_La_ is used:

    For identifiable, countable objects:

        _Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon._

            "I found a bottle and took off the lid."

    For representative individuals:

        _La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj._

            "The cheetah is the fastest of the animals."

        _La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi._

            "Bees have fur, but they're no good for petting."

    For adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:

        _la blua_

            "the blue one"

        _la angla_

            "English" (i.e. "the English language")

    For possessive pronouns, when definite:

        _La mia bluas, la via ruĝas._

            "Mine is blue, yours is red".

The article is also used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a possessive adjective:

    _Ili tranĉis la manon._

        "They cut their hands." [one hand each]

The article _la_, like the demonstrative adjective _tiu_ (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the noun phrase.

There is no grammatically required indefinite article: _homo_ means either "human being" or "a human being", depending on the context, and similarly the plural _homoj_ means "human beings" or "some human beings". The words _iu_ and _unu_ (or their plurals _iuj_ and _unuj_) may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to "some" and "a certain" than to English "a". This use of _unu_ corresponds to English "a" when the "a" indicates a specific individual.[1]


Parts of speech

The suffixes _‑o_, _‑a_, _‑e_, and _‑i_ indicate that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word _vidi_ (to see) are _vida_ (visual), _vide_ (visually), and _vido_ (vision).

Each root word has an inherent part of speech: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix _‑o_ indicates an abstraction: _parolo_ (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root _paroli_ (to speak); _belo_ (beauty) from the adjectival root _bela_ (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix _‑a_: _reĝa_ (royal), from the nominal root _reĝo_ (a king); _parola_ (spoken). The various verbal endings mean _to be [__]_ when added to an adjectival root: _beli_ (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean "to act as" the noun, "to use" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: _reĝi_ (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in _-e_ are derived: _bele_ (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a prepositional phrase: _parole_ (by speech, orally); _vide_ (by sight, visually); _reĝe_ (like a king, royally).

The meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, _brosi_ (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry _brosO),_ whereas _kombi_ (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under _kombI)._ Change the suffix to _-o,_ and the similar meanings of _brosi_ and _kombi_ diverge: _broso_ is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas _kombo_ is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal _kombi_ (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix _-ilo_ is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: _kombilo_ (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root _broso_ (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, _brosi_ (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix _-ado_ will change a derived verb back to a noun: _brosado_ (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix _-eco,_ as in _infaneco_ (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal _-o: belo_ (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as _beleco_ are acceptable and widely used.

A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with _-e,_ but with an undefined part-of-speech ending _-aŭ_. Not all words ending in _-aŭ_ are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in _-aŭ_ have other functions, such as _hodiaŭ_ "today" [noun or adverb] or _ankoraŭ_ "yet, still" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as _nun_ "now", _tro_ "too, too much", not counting the adverbs among the correlatives. (See special Esperanto adverbs.)

Other parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions _(al_ "to"), conjunctions _(kaj_ "and"), interjections _(ho_ "oh"), numerals _(du_ "two"), and pronouns _(mi_ "I"—The final _-i_ found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical "particles" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as _ne_ (not), _ankaŭ_ (also), _nur_ (only), _eĉ_ (even).


Nouns and adjectives

A suffix _-j_ following the noun or adjective suffixes _-o_ or _-a_ makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a countable noun is understood to be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix _-n,_ which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence _-ojn_ rhymes with English _coin,_ and _-ajn_ rhymes with _fine.)_

Adjectives agree with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they modify are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare _bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn_ (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in subject–object–verb or verb–subject–object clauses:

    _la knabino feliĉaN knaboN kisis_ (the girl kissed a happy boy)
    _la knabino feliĉa knaboN kisis_ (the happy girl kissed a boy).

Agreement clarifies the syntax in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:

    _ruĝaJ domo kaj aŭto_ (a red house and [a red] car)
    _ruĝa domo kaj aŭto_ (a red house and a car).

A predicative adjective does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:

    _mi farbis la pordoN ruĝaN_ (I painted the red door)
    _mi farbis la pordoN ruĝa_ (I painted the door red).


Pronouns

There are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal _(vi_ "you plural"), demonstrative _(tio_ "that", _iu_ "someone"), and relative/interrogative _(kio_ "what"). According to the fifth rule[2] of the _Fundamento de Esperanto_:

Personal pronouns

The Esperanto PERSONAL PRONOUN system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a reflexive pronoun.

+---------------+----------------------+---------+
|               | singular             | plural  |
+===============+======================+=========+
| first person  | MI (I)               | NI (we) |

: Personal pronouns

Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun _ci_ to be used in translations from languages where the T–V distinction is important, and added it in the _Dua Libro_ in 1888 clarifying that "this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used".[3] It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didn't include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the _Fundamento_[4] and in his 28th _Lingva Respondo_, published in 1908, recommended to use only _vi_.[5] The normal usage is to use _vi_ regardless of number or formality.[6][7] However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use _ci_ in practical speech.

Personal pronouns take the accusative suffix _-n_ as nouns do: _min_ (me), _lin_ (him), _ŝin_ (her). Possessive adjectives are formed with the adjectival suffix _-a: mia_ (my), _ĝia_ (its), _nia_ (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: _ni salutis liajn amikojn_ (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: _la mia_ (mine).

The reflexive pronoun is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:

    _li lavis sin_ "he washed" (himself)
    _ili lavis sin_ "they washed" (themselves or each other)
    _li lavis lin_ "he washed him" (someone else)
    _li manĝis SIAN panon_ "he ate his bread" (his own bread)
    _li manĝis LIAN panon_ "he ate his bread" (someone else's bread).

The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject _it_ with a passive verb,

    _oni diras, ke ..._ "One says that...", meaning: "they say that ..." or "it's said that ..."

With "impersonal" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:

    _pluvas_ "rains; is raining; it's raining".

The rain is falling by itself, therefore the subject pronoun is omitted.

_Ĝi_ ("it"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an epicene (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.[8] However, this proposal is not generally accepted.

In popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:

    _La infano estas ploranta, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi_ "the child is crying, because it wants to eat".

When speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun _tiu_ ("that thing or person that is already known to the listener") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence

    _Iu ĵus diris, ke TIU malsatas_ "Someone just said that _that thing/person_ is hungry",

the word _tiu_ would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns _this_ or _that_ but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of _ĝi_, _li_ or _ŝi._

Other pronouns

The demonstrative and relative pronouns form part of the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in _-o_ (simple pronouns) and _-u_ (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in _-n,_ but the genitive case ends in _-es,_ which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases _lia domo_ (his house) and _ties domo_ (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural _liaJ domoJ_ (his houses) and _ties domoJ_ (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive _liaN domoN_ and _ties domoN._[9]


Prepositions

Although Esperanto word order is fairly free, prepositions must come at the beginning of a noun phrase. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various cases (accusative, dative, _and so on),_ in Esperanto all prepositions govern the nominative: _por Johano_ (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is _replaced_ by the accusative.

Prepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition _je_ should be used:

    _ili iros JE la tria de majo_ (they'll go on the third of May: the "on" isn't literally true).

Alternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:

    _ili iros la triaN de majo._

Note that although _la trian_ (the third) is in the accusative, _de majo_ (of May) is still a prepositional phrase, and so the noun _majo_ remains in the nominative case.

A frequent use of the accusative is in place of _al_ (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion (allative construction). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:

    _la kato ĉasis la muson EN la domo_ (the cat chased the mouse IN [inside of] the house)
    _la kato ĉasis la muson EN la domoN_ (the cat chased the mouse INTO the house).

The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:

    _li iris AL sia hejmo_ (he went to his home)
    _li iris hejmeN_ (he went home)

Both _por_ and _pro_ often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish _for a goal_ (looking forward in time, or causing: _por_) and _for a cause_ (looking back in time, or being caused by: _pro_): To vote _por_ your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote _pro_ your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.

The preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps _de_, which corresponds to English _of, from, off,_ and _(done) by_:

    _libro DE Johano_ (John'S book)
    _li venis DE la butiko_ (he came FROM the shop)
    _mordita DE hundo_ (bitten BY a dog)

However, English _of_ corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: _de, el_ (out of, made of), and _da_ (quantity of, unity of form and contents):

    _tablo EL ligno_ (a table OF wood)
    _glaso DA vino_ (a glass OF wine)
    _listo DA kondiĉoj DE la kandidatoj_ (a list OF conditions FROM the candidates)

The last of these, _da_, is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.[10]

Occasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare root may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from _fari_ (to do, to make) we get the preposition _far_ (done by).


Verbs

All verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the indicative mood. The other moods are the infinitive, conditional, and jussive. No aspectual distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of Aktionsart are common.

Verbs do not change form according to their subject. _I am, we are,_ and _he is_ are simply _mi estas, ni estas,_ and _li estas,_ respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: _pluvas_ (it is raining); _estas muso en la domo_ (there's a mouse in the house).

Most verbs are inherently transitive or intransitive. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes _-ig-_ (the transitivizer/causative) and _-iĝ-_ (the intransitivizer/middle voice):

    _akvo bolas je cent gradoj_ (water boils at 100 degrees)
    _ni bolIGas la akvoN_ (we boil the water).

The verbal paradigm

The tenses have characteristic vowels. _A_ indicates the present tense, _i_ the past, and _o_ the future.

            Indicative   Active participle   Passive participle   Infinitive   Jussive (volitive)   Conditional
  --------- ------------ ------------------- -------------------- ------------ -------------------- -------------
  Past      -is          -inta               -ita                 -i           -u                   -us
  Present   -as          -anta               -ata
  Future    -os          -onta               -ota

The verbal forms may be illustrated with the root _esper-_ (hope):

    _esperi_ (to hope)
    _esperas_ (hopes, is hoping)
    _esperis_ (hoped, was hoping)
    _esperos_ (shall hope, will hope)
    _esperu_ (hope!; a command)
    _esperus_ (were to hope, would hope)

A verb can be made emphatic with the particle _ja_ (indeed): _mi ja esperas_ (I do hope), _mi ja esperis_ (I did hope).

Tense

As in English, Esperanto present tense may be used for generic statements such as "birds fly" (_la birdoj flugas_).

The Esperanto future is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English "(I'll give it to you) when I see you" the verb "see" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: _(Mi donos ĝin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin_.

Esperanto tense is relative. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a subordinate verb is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, "John said that he would go" is in Esperanto _Johano diris, ke li iros_ (lit., "John said that he will go"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as "John said that he will go" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.

Mood

The conditional mood is used for such expressions as _se mi povus, mi irus_ (if I could, I would go) and _se mi estus vi, mi irus_ (if I were you, I'd go).

The jussive mood, is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the imperative and subjunctive:

    _Iru!_ (Go!)
    _Mi petis, ke li venu._ (I asked him to come.)
    _Li parolu._ (Let him speak.)
    _Ni iru._ (Let's go.)
    _Benu ĉi tiun domaĉon._ (Bless this bad house.)
    _Mia filino belu!_ (May my daughter be beautiful!)

Copula

The verb _esti_ (to be) is both the copula ("X is Y") and the existential ("there is") verb. As a copula linking two noun phrases, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with _esti_ can be semantically important: compare _hundoj estas personoj_ (dogs are people) and _personoj estas hundoj_ (people are dogs).

It is becoming increasingly common to replace _esti_-plus-adjective with a verb: _la ĉielo estas blua_ or _la ĉielo bluas_ (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.[11]


Participles

Participles are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:

-   three aspects: past (or "perfective"), present (or "progressive"), and future (or "predictive")

times

-   two voices: active (performing an action) and passive (receiving an action)

The participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: I, A, O. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing voice, with either NT or T following the vowel (see next section).

Adjectival participles

The basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb _fali_ (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are _falOnta_ (about to fall). As they drop, they are _falAnta_ (falling). After they hit the ground, they are _falInta_ (fallen).

Active and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb _haki_ (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is _hakONTa_ (about to chop) and the tree is _hakOTa_ (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is _hakANTa_ (chopping) and the tree _hakATa_ (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is _hakINTa_ (having chopped) and the tree _hakITa_ (chopped).

Adjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:

    _ili ŝparis la arbojn HAKOTAJN_ (they spared the trees [that were] TO BE CHOPPED DOWN).

Compound tense

Compound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus _esti_ (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:

-   Present progressive: _mi estas kaptanta_ (I am catching [something]), _mi estas kaptata_ (I am being caught)
-   Present perfect: _mi estas kaptinta_ (I have caught [something]), _mi estas kaptita_ (I have been caught, I am caught)
-   Present prospective: _mi estas kaptonta_ (I am going to catch / about to catch), _mi estas kaptota_ (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)

These are not used as often as their English equivalents. For "I _am_ go_ing_ to the store", you would normally use the simple present _mi iras_ in Esperanto.

The tense and mood of _esti_ can be changed in these compound tenses:

    _mi estis kaptinta_ (I had caught)
    _mi estus kaptonta_ (I would be about to catch)
    _mi estos kaptanta_ (I will be catching).

Although such periphrastic constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [_esti_ + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:

    _mi estas kaptinta_ or _mi kaptintas_ (I have caught)
    _mi estis kaptinta_ or _mi kaptintis_ (I had caught)

The active synthetic forms are:

+------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|                  | Simple verb     | Progressive           | Perfect               | Prospective                 |

|                  | (I catch)       | (I am catching)       | (I have caught)       | (I am about to catch)       |

+------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+

: Synthetic compound tenses (active voice)

Infinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably _-intus_ and _-atas_, entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.[12]

Nominal participles

Participles may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix _-a_ with _-e_ or _-o._ This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.

A nominal participle indicates _one who participates_ in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, _esperinto_ is a "hoper" (past tense), or _one who had been hoping._

Adverbial participles

Adverbial participles are used with subjectless clauses:

    _Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen_ (Having caught the ball, he started running for the goal).

Conditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)

Occasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel _u (-unt-, -ut-)._[13] If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be _hakunta_ and the tree _hakuta_ (he, the one "who would chop", and the tree, the one that "would be chopped").

This can also be illustrated with the verb _prezidi_ (to preside). Just after the recount of the 2000 United States presidential election:

-   then-president Bill Clinton was still _prezidAnto_ (current president) of the United States,
-   president-elect George W. Bush was declared _prezidOnto_ (president-to-be),
-   the previous president George H. W. Bush was a _prezidInto_ (former president), and
-   the contending candidate Al Gore was _prezidUnto_ (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).[14]

The tense-neutral word _prezidEnto_ is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb _prezidi._


Negation

A statement is made negative by using _ne_ or one of the negative _(neni-)_ correlatives. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:

    _Mi ne faris ion ajn._ I didn't do anything.

Two negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.

    _Mi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion._ It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.

The word _ne_ comes before the word it negates:

    _Mi ne skribis tion_ (I didn't write that)
    _Ne mi skribis tion_ (It wasn't I who wrote that)
    _Mi skribis ne tion_ (It wasn't that that I wrote)

The latter will frequently be reordered as _ne tion mi skribis_ depending on the flow of information.


Questions

"Wh" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative _(ki-_) correlatives. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:

    _Li scias, kion vi faris_ (He knows what you did.)
    _Kion vi faris?_ (What did you do?)
    _Vi faris kion?_ (You did _what?)_

Yes/no questions are marked with the conjunction _ĉu_ (whether):

    _Mi ne scias, ĉu li venos_ (I don't know whether he'll come)
    _Ĉu li venos?_ (Will he come?)

Such questions can be answered _jes_ (yes) or _ne_ (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or _ĝuste_ (correct) or _malĝuste_ (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:

    _Ĉu vi ne iris?_ (Did you not go?)
    _— Ne, mi ne iris_ (No, I didn't go); _— Jes, mi iris_ (Yes, I went)
    _— Ĝuste, mi ne iris_ (Correct, I didn't go); _— Malĝuste, mi iris_ (Incorrect, I did go)

Note that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.


Conjunctions

Basic Esperanto conjunctions are _kaj_ (both/and), _aŭ_ (either/or), _nek_ (neither/nor), _se_ (if), _ĉu_ (whether/or), _sed_ (but), _anstataŭ_ (instead of), _krom_ (besides, except for), _kiel_ (like, as), _ke_ (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:

    _Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon_ (I saw both him and his friend)
    _Estis nek hele nek agrable_ (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)
    _ĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo_ (whether by whim, or by natural language development)
    _Li volus, ke ni iru_ (he would like us to go)

However, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from Don Harlow:

    _Li traktis min kiel princon_ (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)
    _Li traktis min kiel princo_ (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)


Interjections

Interjections may be derived from bare affixes or roots: _ek!_ (get going!), from the perfective prefix; _um_ (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; _fek!_ (shit!), from _feki_ (to defecate).


Word formation

Esperanto derivational morphology uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root _vid-_ (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: _see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant_ etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.


Numbers

Numerals

The cardinal numerals are:

    _nul_ (zero)
    _unu_ (one)
    _du_ (two)
    _tri_ (three)
    _kvar_ (four)
    _kvin_ (five)
    _ses_ (six)
    _sep_ (seven)
    _ok_ (eight)
    _naŭ_ (nine)
    _dek_ (ten)
    _cent_ (one hundred)
    _mil_ (one thousand)

These are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, _unu_ (and only _unu_) is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning "a certain", and in such cases it may take the plural affix _-j,_ just as the demonstrative pronoun _tiu_ does:

    _unuJ homoJ_
    "certain people";
    _ili kuris unuJ post la aliaj_
    "they ran some after others".

In such use _unu_ is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix _-n_ in the singular, but does in the plural:

    _iaN unu ideoN_
    "some particular idea",

but

    _unuj objektoj venis en unuJN manoJN, aliaj en aliajn manojn_
    "some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands".

Additionally, when counting off, the final _u_ of _unu_ may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:

    _Un'! Du! Tri! Kvar!_

Higher numbers

At numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots _miliono_ (million) and _miliardo_ (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A _billion_ in most English-speaking countries is different from a _billion_ in most other countries (10⁹ _vs._ 10¹² respectively; that is, a thousand million _vs._ a million million). The international root _biliono_ is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix _-iliono_ to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix _-iliardo:_[15]

    10⁶: _miliono_
    10⁹: _miliardo_ (or _mil milionoj_)
    10¹²: _duiliono_
    10¹⁵: _duiliardo_ (or _mil duilionoj_)
    10¹⁸: _triiliono_
    10²¹: _triiliardo_ (or _mil triilionoj_)
    _etc._

Note that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: _mil homojn_ (a thousand people [accusative]) but _milionon da homoj_ (a million people [accusative]).

Compound numerals and derivatives

Numerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (_dudek_ 20, _dek du_ 12, _dudek du_ 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix _-a,_ quantities with the nominal suffix _-o,_ multiples with _-obl-,_ fractions with _‑on‑_, collectives with _‑op‑_, and repetitions with the root _‑foj‑_.

    _sescent sepdek kvin_ (675)
    _tria_ (third [as in _first, second, third_])
    _trie_ (thirdly)
    _dudeko_ (a score [20])
    _duobla_ (double)
    _kvarono_ (one fourth, a quarter)
    _duope_ (by twos)
    _dufoje_ (twice)

The particle _po_ is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the logogram @ is not used (except in email addresses, of course):

    _mi donis al ili po tri pomojn_ or _pomojn mi donis al ili po tri_ (I gave [to] them three apples each).

Note that particle _po_ forms a phrase with the numeral _tri_ and is not a preposition for the noun phrase _tri pomojn,_ so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.


Comparisons

Comparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives _tiel ... kiel_ (as ... as), the adverbial roots _pli_ (more) and _plej_ (most), the antonym prefix _mal-,_ and the preposition _ol_ (than):

    _mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi_ (I write as well as you)
    _tiu estas pli bona ol tiu_ (this one is better than that one)
    _tio estas la plej bona_ (that's the best)
    _la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via_ (mine is less expensive than yours)

Implied comparisons are made with _tre_ (very) and _tro_ (too [much]).

Phrases like "The more people, the smaller the portions" and "All the better!" are translated using _ju_ and _des_ in place of "the":

    _JU pli da homoj, DES malpli grandaj la porcioj_ (The more people, the smaller the portions)
    _DES pli bone!_ (All the better!)


Word order

Esperanto has a fairly flexible word order. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle _ne_ generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):

    _mi ne iris_ 'I didn't go'
    _mi ne iris, mi revenis_ 'I didn't go, I came back'
    _ne mi iris_ or _iris ne mi_ 'it wasn't me who went'
    _mi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen_ 'I went not to the shop but home'.

However, when the entire clause is negated, the _ne_ may be left till last:

    _mi iris ne_ 'I went not'.

The last order reflects a typical topic–comment (or theme–rheme) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, _ne iris mi_, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and _mi_ is given as an example of one who did not go.

Compare:[16]

    _Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo_

        'Last year I vacationed in Italy' (Italy was the place I went on holiday)

    _En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare_

        'I vacationed in Italy last year' (last year was when I went)

    _En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis_

        'In Italy last year I went on vacation' (a vacation is why I went)

    _En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi_

        (I am the one who went)

The noun phrase

Within a noun phrase, either the order _adjective–noun_ or _noun–adjective_ may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with _numeral–noun_ and _demonstrative–noun_ being the norm, as in English.

    _blua ĉielo_ 'a blue sky'
    _tiu ĉielo_ 'that sky'
    _tiu blua ĉielo_ 'that blue sky'
    _sep bluaj ĉieloj_ 'seven blue heavens'

Adjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:[17]

    _homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara_ 'a petty and extremely greedy person'
    _vizaĝo plena de cikatroj_ 'a face full of scars'
    _ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa_ 'a fantastic but still interesting idea'

Adjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:

    _okazis io stranga_ 'something strange happened'
    _ne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto_ 'not everything shiny is a diamond'

Changing the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative _nenio_ 'nothing':

    _li manĝis nenion etan_ 'he ate nothing little'
    _li manĝis etan nenion_ 'he ate a little nothing'

With multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–(adjective/noun):

    _miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj_ 'my two great friends'.

However, the article _la_ precedes a noun phrase:

    _la blua ĉielo_ "the blue sky"

In prepositional phrases, the preposition is _required_ to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article _la_), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:

    _al la ĉielo_ 'to the sky' or _ĉielen_ 'skywards', never _*ĉielo al_

Constituent order

Constituent order _within_ a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.

The default order is subject–verb–object, though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon_ 'the dog chased/hunted the cat'
    _la katon ĉasis la hundo_
    _ĉasis la hundo la katon_
    _ĉasis la katon la hundo_
    _la hundo la katon ĉasis_
    _la katon la hundo ĉasis_

The expectation of a topic–comment (theme–rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in _la katon ĉasis la hundo_, the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in _la hundo la katon ĉasis_, the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in _ĉasis la hundo la katon_, the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.

Context is required to tell whether

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno_

means the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno_

        'The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden'

and

    _en la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon_

        'In the garden, the dog chased the cat'.

Of course, if it chases the cat in_to_ the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardenoN_, _en la ĝardenoN la hundo ĉasis la katon_, etc.

Within copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. Copulas are words such as _esti_ 'be', _iĝi_ 'become', _resti_ 'remain', and _ŝajni_ 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.[18]

Generally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:

    _sovaĝa estas la vento_ 'wild is the wind', _la vento estas sovaĝa_ 'the wind is wild'

However, _la vento sovaĝa estas_ is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.

Attributive phrases and clauses

In the sentence above, _la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno_ 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the relative pronoun _kiu_ 'which' is restricted to a position _after_ the noun 'cat'. In general, relative clauses and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.

Attributive prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (_la libro de Johano_ 'John's book') as well as _la kato en la ĝardeno_ 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither _*la de Johano libro_ nor _*la en la ĝardeno kato_ is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both _ĉasis en la ĝardeno_ and _en la ĝardeno ĉasis_ are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.

Relative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a relative pronoun such as _kiu_ 'which':

    _fuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis_ 'the cat which it chased fled'
    _mi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon_ 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'

Note that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs.[19] However, they do agree in number:

    _fuĝis la katoJ, kiuJn ĝi ĉasis_ 'the catS which it chased fled'

Other word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:

    _fuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi_ 'the cat which it chased fled'
    _vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis_ 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'

Clause order

Coordinate clauses allow flexible word order, but tend to be iconic. For example, in

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis_ 'the dog chased the cat and the cat fled',

the inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:

    _la kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin_ 'the cat fled, and the dog chased it'

This distinction is lost in subordinate clauses such as the relative clauses in the previous section:

    _la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis_ 'the dog chased the cat(,) which fled'

In written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.

Non-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the conjunction _ke_ 'that', as in,

    _Mi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson_ 'I am certain that you will have a brilliant success'.


Non-Indo-European aspects

Esperanto's vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically Romance or Germanic in origin. The semantics shows a significant Slavic influence.

It is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is _song sing sang sung._ However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as _cat, cats_ and _walk, walked_ do in English. (This is the so-called strong–weak dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as _pli_, _plej_, _plu_ (more, most, further), _tre_, _tro_ (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes _‑as_, _‑anta_, _‑ata_; _‑is_, _‑inta_, _‑ita_; _‑os_, _‑onta_, _‑ota_; and _‑us_.

Other features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the _-o_ suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian.[20] More pertinent is the accusative plural in _-jn_. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European Hungarian and Turkish languages—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed "non-European" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.

East Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as _la ĉielo bluas_ (the sky is blue) for _la ĉielo estas blua_ and _mia filino belu!_ (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the _mia filino estu bela!_ mentioned above.


Sample text

The Pater noster, from the first Esperanto publication in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:

    ''Patro nia, kiu estas en la ĉieloj,
    ''sanktigata estu Via nomo.
    ''Venu Via regno,
    ''fariĝu Via volo,
    ''kiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.
    ''Nian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.
    ''Kaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,
    ''kiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.
    ''Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,
    ''sed liberigu nin de la malbono.
    ''(Ĉar Via estas la regno kaj la potenco
    ''kaj la gloro eterne.)
    _Amen._

The morphologically complex words (see Esperanto word formation) are:

    {| class=wikitable

[9] An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition _na_ has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun _(ties,_ accusative _na ties)_. The purposefully ambiguous preposition _je_ may be so used as well (accusative _je ties)_, though normally the _-es_ words are simply not inflected for case.

See the entry for _da_ at Wiktionary.

[11] However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: _Morti_ (to die) does not have the same meaning as _esti morta_ (to be dead).

[14] This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for 'president' (of a country) is the tense-neutral word _prezidEnto._ _PrezidAnto_ is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and _prezidInto_ is used for former presidents in such contexts.

[19] This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between 'who' and 'whom'. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: _fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin_ 'the dog which chased it fled'; _mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis_ 'I saw the cat, which the dog chased'.

[20] For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular _-o_ and _-a,_ adjectives in _-oje_ and _-aja,_ adverbs in _-o_ and _-e,_ etc.; _cf._ also Provençal _la fenestro_ (the window), which is identical to Esperanto _la fenestro_.
