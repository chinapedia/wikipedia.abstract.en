Cape_Palmas_mission.jpg In 1830 Elizabeth Mars Johnson and her husband volunteered as missionaries for Liberia. They trained at the African Mission School in Hartford;[3] by 1834 they were in Liberia. Elizabeth and her second husband established a Sunday school at Monrovia and Elizabeth taught at the school at Cape Palmas from 1835 until 1845, under the authority of the Episcopal Mission Board.[4] She took a furlough journey back to the United States, and then returned to Liberia, where she continued teaching for many years.[5] Her school at Mount Vaughan in Cape Palmas was burned down in 1856 during an outbreak of violence. She went back to work after the school was rebuilt, until she experienced declining health and left the classroom in 1862.[6]
