_ATH.LON_ is the sixth studio album by Greek synthpop duo Marsheaux. After covering Depeche Mode's album _A Broken Frame_ in 2015, Marsheaux released new original tracks on this album. The name _Ath.Lon_ is a combination of Athens and London where the album was produced.[1]


Reception

The reviewer for _Release Magazine_ lauded the production and found that the album contained influences of Chvrches and Ladytron.[2] According to _The Arts Desk_, _Ath.Lon_ was remiscent of Philip Glass and New Order but suffered from a "weedy" production.[3] _The Electricity Club_ noted "excellently layered sounds" with motorik beats similar to early Depeche Mode releases.[4]
