BALA-PRASADA (IAST: Bālaprasāda, r. c. 1055-1070 CE) was an Indian king belonging to the Naddula Chahamana dynasty. He ruled the area around Naddula (present-day Nadol in Rajasthan).


Reign

Balaprasada was the eldest son of his predecessor Anahilla. According to an inscription, he defeated other rulers even as a child. This suggests that he ascended the throne at a young age.

According to the Chahamana records, the Chaulukya king Bhima I had imprisoned another ruler named Krishnadeva; Balaprasada forced Bhima to release Krishnadeva. Historian D. C. Ganguly identified Krishnadeva with Krishnaraja, a ruler of the Paramara branch of Bhinmal. According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Balaprasada _requested_ (not forced) Bhima release Krishnaraja, which indicates that he accepted Bhima's suzerainty.

Balaprasada appears to have died without issue, as he was succeeded by his younger brother Jendraraja.
