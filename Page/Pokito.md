POKITO is a type of collapsible, reusable coffee cup designed by Canadian inventor Andrew Brooks in the United Kingdom.[1] The cup is manufactured in England. Brooks is marketing the pokito cup though his company, Pocket Enterprises UK, and has completed a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund initial production. The Pokito Kickstarter campaign is in the top 1% of all time Kickstarter campaigns.

The cup adjusts to three sizes.[2][3] It flattens to about 4.5 cm in height when not in use, and so can be stored in a pocket or purse.[4] Remaining dregs of coffee are kept inside without leakage.[5][6]

The pokito is designed to reduce the usage of disposable cups.[7] It also saves energy if the cup is used more than 15 times.[8] [9] It is made of a rubbery plastic called thermoplastic elastomer which is FDA approved.[10]

By the end of the campaign Brooks had raised £100,500 multiple times the original Kickstarter goal.[11]

In 2018 the Pokito cup is manufactured by Omega Plastics in Hartlepool, United Kingdom.[12]
