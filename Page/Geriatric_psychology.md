GERIATRIC PSYCHOLOGY is a subfield of psychology that specializes in the mental and physical health of individuals in the later stages of life. These specialized psychologists study a variety of psychological abilities that deplete as aging occurs such as memory, learning capabilities, and coordination. Geriatric psychologists work with elderly clients to conduct the diagnosis, study, and treatment of certain mental illnesses in a variety of workplace settings. Common areas of practice include loneliness in old age, depression, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease.


Geriatric Psychology vs. Geriatric Psychiatry

_Geriatric Psychology_

Geriatric psychology is based upon the study of mental functions with aging. The psychologist's purpose is to observe how the neurological and physiological process of an elderly adults brain affects their behaviors in daily life. When a psychologist is specialized in geriatrics they provide care for declining brain functions to make life better.

_Geriatric Psychiatry_

Geriatric psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry dealing with the research, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in the later stages of life.[1][2][3] The field composes of the diagnosis, treatment, and management of areas such as depression, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. A geriatric psychiatrist is also a licensed doctor that can prescribe medications for elderly patients. Psychiatrists require education and degree from a medical school. [4]


Role of the Geriatric Psychologist

A geriatric psychologist specializes in the treatment of the elderly. This treatment can include mental health problems or aid in understanding and coping with the aging process. In order to become a geriatric psychologist, one must obtain a doctoral degree in psychology and specialize in adult development and aging. Once the degree is obtained, geriatric psychologists will usually work in hospitals, mental health clinics, rehab centers, nursing homes, and research centers.

Geriatric psychologists spend most of their workday addressing mental health issues in older adults and counseling those that need it. They also aid in the diagnosis of age-related problems. In order to check for mental health issues, geriatric psychologists will conduct clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests and behavioral observations.[5]


History

Geriatric psychology began in 1978 with a spike in interest in mental health and the effects of aging. There was a slow increase in the number of aging adults in the U.S. population. There was a small group of 11 people who met together to talk about late-life mental health needs and the field of geriatrics. This meeting later created the American Association of Geriatric Psychology (AAGP). As time has gone on the small group has turned into a very large group of people dedicated to the well being of the aging population.[6]


Common Areas of Practice

Loneliness in Elderly People

Loneliness is an emotional response to the process of social isolation. It typically entails the feelings of anxiousness due to the lack of social connectedness or communication with others. Research has shown that loneliness has negative impacts on biological, cognitive and immune functioning. It is prevalent throughout all age groups from childhood to old age.

Nurses and other individuals who work in association with the elderly learn the various theories of loneliness, as they may need to implement these perspectives into enhancing the lives of their patients. They are particularly problematic in old age due to the changes an individual goes through such as decreasing economic stability and resources, changes in family structures, reduced social communication and the death of a relative or spouse.[7]

The most researched outcomes of loneliness are depression and cardiovascular health. Lonely individuals have found to have increased arterial stiffness, decreased blood circulation and associated with elevated blood pressure.[8]

Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are also major risk factors for poor cognitive and physical health. A poor sense of social connectedness has a negative impact on neural processing and cognitive abilities. In a 4-year prospective study of initially dementia-free old-age adults, the risk of Alzheimer’s was more than twice in lonely individuals compared to non-lonely. The study concluded that loneliness led to lower cognitive abilities and a rapid decline in cognition during the 4-year course.

Depression

Depression in the elderly community can have severe consequences, which is why it is an important public health problem and research area. Older adults facing this debilitating condition are less likely to endorse affective symptoms and are more likely to instead display cognitive changes, somatic symptoms, and loss of interest than are younger adults. It is comorbid with “morbidity, increased risk of suicide, decreased physical, cognitive and social functioning, and greater self-neglect”, all of which are associated with an increase in mortality.[9]

_Risk factors_

A common pathway to depression in older adults may consist of predisposing risks as well as the life changes experienced in old age. The development of late-life depression has several risk factors that likely compose of "cognitive diathesis, age-associated neurobiological changes, genetic vulnerabilities, and stressful life events".

Insomnia is often an overlooked factor in late-life depression. Impacts of sleep deprivation are reduced glucose tolerance, elevated evening cortisol levels, and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Sleep quality at an old age is just as important as sleep duration to avoid lack of sleep. Research shows that feelings of loneliness and depression can result in poor sleep quality and daytime dysfunctions. These daytime impairments include physical and intellectual fatigue, irritability, and low cognitive abilities. [10]

Dementia

Dementia is a variety of symptoms that apply to a decline in mental ability, not a specific disease. Geriatric psychologists work with dementia by aiding in the diagnosis of this disease. This is done through various cognitive tests and assessments. They will also look at research and potential treatment for dementia.[11]

Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60-80 percent of dementia cases. Similar to dementia, a geriatric psychologist's role regarding Alzheimer's disease is the assessment, treatment, and research of the disease.[12]

Vascular dementia

Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia, is the result of a stroke.[13] A geriatric psychologist aids in the assessment, diagnosing, treatment, and research of vascular dementia.[14]

Parkinson's disease

Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder that has symptoms like tremors, slowing down, stiffness, and impaired balance. A geriatric psychologist's role for those with Parkinson's disease would be helping the person diagnosed deal with the stress they may encounter regarding Parkinson's Disease. Since it is not a brain disorder, the geriatric psychologist would not help with diagnosing or the treatment of the disease.[15]
