History

TransferMate was launched in 2010 by Terry Clune and Sinead Fitzmaurice, a company under The Taxback Group, which includes 6 other sister companies.[6] Starting in 2010, the company expanded to 185 employees by late 2017.[7]

Instead of using intermediary banks to make transfers, TransferMate set up their own accounts, with the intent to allow the company to transfer funds through their own banking network.[8] According to the company, TransferMate is regulated in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.[9]

The company created a FinTech (financial technology) system to allow their customers to make cross border transfers online,[10] this allows them to receive funds locally and make payments locally with the intention to eliminate the need for intermediary banks and international transfer fees.[11] TransferMate’s technology has been incorporated in to other financial systems such as QuickBooks, SAP Concur and Tradeshift.[12][13][14] Its clients also include Airbus, Harvard University and RSM International.

In November 2017, Allied Irish Banks invested €30m in the organisation.[15]

In July 2018, ING Bank invested €21m, valuing TransferMate at €350m. ING Bank is also a partner, introducing TransferMate payment solutions to ING corporate clients. [16]
