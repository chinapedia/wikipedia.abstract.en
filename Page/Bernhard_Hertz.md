Biography

Bernhard Hertz was born in 1834.[1] He completed his studies as a goldsmith in 1858. His graduation piece, an arm ring, was acquired by Frederick VII for 300 Danish rigsdaler. The king gave it to Countess Danner. The arm ring is now on display in the Danish Design Museum.

Hertz used the money from the sale to set up his own business the same year. He specialized in modern jewellery with flower motifs and replica of ancient jewellery.

To make his jewellery accessible to a wider customer base, Hertz began to produce the replica of contemporary jewellery in silver instead of gold and introduced machine power in the production for rolling and frosting. In 1887, he constructed a multi-storey factory building in a courtyard in Store Kongensgade.[2] Hertz died in 1909.


Legacy

The company Bernhard Hertz A&S was in 1985 acquired by Lund Copenhagen.[3]

Gertz' former silver factory in Store Kongensgade was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1985. The factory was built by Hertz' own design. The older building fronting the street, which was also owned by the company, is also a part of the heritage listing. It is from 1850 and was designed by C.O. Aagaard.[4]
