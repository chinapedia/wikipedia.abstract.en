The WEED SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA (WSSA) is a nonprofit, learned society focused on weed science. It was founded in 1956.[1] The organization promotes research, education, and extension outreach, provides science-based information to the public and policy makers, and fosters awareness of weeds and their impact on both managed and natural ecosystems.[2] President for 2018-19 is Scott Senseman from the University of Tennessee.[3]

WSSA has started the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds initiative to collect herbicide resistances.[4] The WSSA classifies all herbicides by the mode of action.[5]

In 2017, WSSA began a partnership with Cambridge University Press to continue publication of the three WSSA journals: _Weed Science_ , _Weed Technology_ , and _Invasive Plant Science and Management_ .[6]
