Plot

In The Monkey King 3, Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang (William Feng Shaofeng) and his disciples – Wukong the Monkey King (Aaron Kwok Fu-shing), pig demon Bajie (Xiao Shenyang) and the blue-skinned sand demon Wujing (Him Lo Chung-him) – inadvertently enter the Womanland of Western Liang, a nation populated by women raised to believe that men are fatally deceptive in matters of the heart.

Love nevertheless blossoms between Tang Sanzang and the Womanland’s young queen (Zhao Liying), even though her royal preceptor (Gigi Leung Wing-kei) is hell-bent on sentencing the men to death. As Wukong and Co. search for a way out of this nation surrounded by a vast magical net, it soon transpires, conveniently, that romantic love is the only key to opening the gate. So will Tang Sanzang give up on his sacred mission and stay with the queen?

The third sequel was released in China on February 16, 2018.[5] During the event it was announced that the film will be released on 16 February 2018, the first day of the Chinese New Year holiday period, which is also the first day of the Year of the Dog.


Reception

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33% based on 6 reviews, and an average rating of 3.5/10.[6] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[7] On Tianjin Maoyan Culture Media's ticketing website the film has received a 7.8/10 from the audience based on over 240,000 reviews.[8]

Elizabeth Kerr from The Hollywood Reporter believes that the film is "bonker(s), but in a charming, delirious sort of way" with "enough eye-catching set pieces." But the movie may not necessary to be 3D. As for actors, Aaron Kwok delivers a "strong performance......that's far more nuanced than it needs to be," while "Feng and Zhao are a less than riveting couple, making their dilemmas leaden soap opera instead of compelling crises of conscience or identity." She also points out that even the Queen's still "begging for the men’s help." The Monkey King 3 misses a great timing and opportunity to make the female characters "active-not-reactive." [9]

China's noted film critic Raymond Zhou regards _The Monkey King 3_ as inferior than its previous one, "_The Monkey King 2._ He criticizes on his personal Weibo that the CGI effect is far from credible than the story is. Both of two romantic lines have no chemistry. Feng Shaofeng's performance is reliable among leads.[10]

Senior film critic Derek Elley, however, credits _The Monkey King 3_ as "the most engaging of the three films on a character level, with a relaxed tone and often silly humour that also help to bolster its “human” face." Xuanzang's role is "always a difficult one to bring off amid such colourful company (Aaron Kwok, Xiaoshenyang, and Luo Zhongqian)", but Feng Shaofeng "manages to make Xuanzang sympathetic"; Zhao fails to "dominate the film as her character should"; Gigi Leung "grabs the spotlight" while her character is not "fully-drawn"; Lin Zhiling "has a couple of memorable moments in the CGI-heavy finale[11]."
