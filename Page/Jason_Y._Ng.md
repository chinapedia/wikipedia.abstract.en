Ng contributes opinion columns to the _South China Morning Post_ and Hong Kong Free Press and news pieces and commentary to _the Guardian_. Between 2014 and 2016, he was a classical music and opera critic for _Hong Kong Time Out_.

Between October 2016 (inception) and April 2019, Ng served as the inaugural President of PEN Hong Kong,[3] the local chapter of PEN International that promotes literature and defends freedom of expression around the world. He is also an ambassador for Shark Savers Hong Kong and frequent advocate for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, the freedom of expression, and the rights of foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong.[4] In 2019, Ng was elected Co-convenor of the Progressive Lawyers Group, a group of Hong Kong-based lawyers dedicated to promoting rule of law and human rights.
