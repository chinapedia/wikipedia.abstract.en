History

The history of Viswema, according to oral history begins with the founding of Kipizwü, some two km west of the village by Viswe. Viswe was a descendent of Tenyiu.

The ancestors lived there for several generations till the invasion of the Burmese-Karens, who were known to Viswemi's as Kherenümi. The defeat inflicted on the Burmese invaders gave a sense of confidence and Viswemi became more assertive and grew in great numbers. They began to move out in search of suitable environment for permanent settlement. They therefore came down to the present site of the village.

WORLD WAR II

When the Japanese and INA soldiers entered Naga Hills in early April 1944, many of them stayed at the outskirt of the village. They dug trenches and built strong bunkers everywhere in the vicinity of the village. Since the Allies operation against Japanese occupation of Kohima, Viswema was continuously hit by explosive missiles which were fired by cannons from Kohima and later on from Kigwema as launching pads. Many people were killed and injured. On 10 June 1944, a message from the Allies sources was conveyed to the village elders telling them to evacuate their village. The village was evacuated the next day. Bombings on 14 June continued till the village which had more than 600 houses at that time was completely razed to the ground. The same evening the Japanese forces at Viswema retreated to the route by which they had entered Naga Hills two months back. Viswema was then taken over by the Allies.[1]
