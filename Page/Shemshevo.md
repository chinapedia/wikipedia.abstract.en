HISTORY

The valley of the Yantra River near the village of Shemshevo was inhabited since ancient times.

Until 1861 the religious needs of the village are served by monks - ascetics from neighboring monasteries. The village's church "St. Dimitar" was built in 1861 with volunteer work and donations from the villagers.
