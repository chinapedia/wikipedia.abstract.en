FISKER INC. is an American electric vehicle automaker founded by Henrik Fisker. Launched in 2016 and based in Southern California, Fisker Inc. is the relaunch of the Fisker brand previously known as Fisker Automotive (founded in 2007 by Henrik Fisker), which produced the Fisker Karma. Fisker Inc. is developing the EMotion, an all-electric sedan that will have a 400-mile electric range;[1] an autonomous, all-electric shuttle called the Orbit; and an as-of-yet unnamed mass-market electric vehicle SUV.

In addition to designing and developing electric vehicles, Fisker Inc. has filed patents pertaining to solid-state battery technology for use in automotive, consumer electronics, and other industries.[2]


History

Fisker_Inc_Car_Prototype_2016.jpg In 2007, Henrik Fisker and Bernhard Koehler founded Fisker Automotive.[3] The company produced the Fisker Karma, one of the world's first production luxury plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which debuted in 2008 and was first delivered in 2011.[4] Production was suspended in 2012 due to the bankruptcy of its battery supplier A123 Systems,[5] after approximately 2,000 of the vehicles had been sold worldwide.[6] In 2014, Fisker Automotive's assets were purchased by Wanxiang Group, which renamed its new company Karma Automotive. Henrik Fisker retained the Fisker trademarks and the Fisker brand.[7]

On October 3, 2016, chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker announced the formation of Fisker Inc., an American automaker designing and developing innovative electric vehicles with a longer range, autonomous driving capability, and advanced battery technology,[8][9][10] with Geeta Fisker as president and CFO.[11] Fisker first stated in July 2016 that he was planning on designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look,[12] and that for the past two years he had been working "in stealth mode" designing "electric cars of the future."[13] On October 31, 2016, Fisker Inc. released the design and specifications of the forthcoming electric vehicle, the Fisker EMotion.[14] In November 2017, the company announced the development of the Orbit, a fully autonomous, connected, electric shuttle, intended to service smart cities, public airports and campuses.[15] That month, Fisker Inc. announced it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs, with the batteries expected to be produced on a mass scale around 2020.[16] In September 2018, the company announced the development of a mass-market all-electric luxury SUV.[17] In April 2019 it was announced that Don Jackson, a former manufacturing executive at Volkswagen and Toyota, will join Fisker as a senior adviser as the company ramps up efforts to produce the electric SUV.[18]


Vehicles

Fisker Electric SUV

On March 18, 2019, Fisker announced an all-electric SUV to be launched in 2021. The luxury vehicle is intended to be the first of three in a lineup of mass-market all-electric vehicles designed by Henrik Fisker and produced in the US.[19] Fisker SUV will have a range of "close to 300 miles", available on the lowest-cost option, with a base price of under $40,000.[20][21] The SUV will be offered in both rear- and all-wheel drive. Power will be supplied by a lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of around 80 kWh.[22]

The look of the SUV is "dramatically sculpted" with a "futuristic, elegant muscular look" and "captivating design touches that have been traditionally reserved for supercars." By pressing a button, the roof opens in some way to create "an extended open-air atmosphere."[23] The fascia includes styling that makes it look like a traditional grille made of a small, center high-mounted radar, behind glass where a parametric pattern dominates the lower front.[24][25] The inlets in the corners send cool air to the brakes and other areas.[26] There will be a spacious interior with a large display and a dashboard with an intuitive user interface.[27]

Fisker plans to sell directly to consumers without dealers.[28] More details about the SUV will be announced closer to the vehicle's 2021 launch, while drivable prototypes will be on the road by the end of 2019, according to the company.[29]

Fisker EMotion

The Fisker EMotion is an all-electric sports sedan designed by Henrik Fisker for Fisker Inc.,[30][31] with a full-length panorama-style sunroof and "wide sculptural shoulders, thin taillight tubes, wide trunk opening, and aggressive lower rear diffuser to improve aerodynamics."[32][33] Fisker called it "our high-tech private luxury vehicle."[34] The EMotion is stated to run on a single charge.[35] It is to have a top speed of ,[36] and will go from 0 to 60 in three seconds.[37] The car will be equipped with a solid-state battery being developed by Fisker Inc.[38][39] The solid-state battery is expected to yield ranges over 400 miles per charge, with a one-minute charge time,[40] which would be a longer range than any electric vehicle to date.[41][42] The vehicle will have autonomous features, so that self-driving mode may be activated at a future date.[43] The first photos of the EMotion were released on June 6, 2017,[44] and the car itself was unveiled in January 2018 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.[45] It was named Best Car at CES 2018 by _PC Magazine_.[46]

In January 2018, Fisker stated that the price of the EMotion will start at $129,000 for the base model.[47] The four-door vehicle seats five passengers, has smartphone-controlled butterfly doors, a carbon fiber exterior, and a panoramic screen system. It also has 24-inch carbon fiber wheels, and a tinted roof made from electrochromic smart glass.[48][49] It will support level 4 autonomous driving (where it can be employed in most driving situations), using advanced LiDAR-based autonomous driving sensors developed through a partnership with Quanergy.[50][51][52] Fisker Inc. is working with Pirelli to create advanced low rolling resistance tires for the EMotion. They will be produced in Rome, Georgia.[53]

Fisker Orbit

On November 30, 2017, the Fisker Orbit was announced as an autonomous, connected, electric shuttle designed for smart cities.[54] Fisker Inc. partnered with Jack Wong of Chinese company Hakim Unique Group on the self-driving electric shuttle, as well as with motor technology company Protean Electric.[55] The shuttle will be fully connected, with two different areas with room to sit or stand. The interior design maximizes passenger space, with a large exterior digital display to inform commuters when the shuttle departs and what the next stop will be. The shuttles are intended to be used for short, shared trips, in college and corporate campuses, airports, resorts, and smart city centers.[56][57][58] It will hold between 8 and 12 people depending on its configuration, with standing and sitting room.[59] Fisker is developing an app that passengers can use to request the shuttle.[60] The first test vehicle is projected to run at a corporate campus in the US in 2019.[61]


Technology

Fisker Nanotech

In 2016, Fisker Inc. teamed up with Nanotech Energy to create a joint venture called Fisker Nanotech, with Jack Kavanaugh as chairman.[62][63][64] They worked on developing a next-generation supercapacitor technology using graphene.[65][66][67] The proposed hybrid battery using graphene supercapacitors had the potential for improved energy conducting and charging capabilities, and a better cycle life, so that the battery would not need to be swapped out as often as a pure lithium-ion battery.[68] In July 2017, Fisker Inc. ended its joint venture with Nanotech Energy to produce batteries using graphene.[69]

Solid-state battery

On November 13, 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs, expecting the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2023.[70] A prototype of the battery, which included 21700 NCM cells from LG Chem, debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018.[71] By July 2018 the company’s scientists were ahead of schedule and had a revised target year of 2020.[72] On Fisker Inc.'s development team is Dr. Fabio Albano, one of the founders of Sakti3, the solid-state battery startup sold to Dyson in 2015.[73][74] Solid-state batteries have greater energy density and faster charging times than lithium-ion batteries.[75] Fisker states the batteries they are developing will have an energy density 2.5 times that of current batteries, at a smaller size and lower cost than conventional lithium-ion batteries, and will be capable of providing a 750-km (466-mile) driving range with a one-minute charge time.[76][77][78][79][80] The batteries will operate in temperatures as cold as -20 Fahrenheit.[81]

Fisker Inc. is developing their own technology, with partners building the cells. They are working to define their charging standard that will work with other standards of superchargers.[82] The solid-state batteries will last "well over 1,000" charge cycles.[83] Fisker says the batteries will take less than 10 days to produce, far less than the 50 to 60 days it takes to produce lithium ion batteries.[84]

In October 2018, Fisker Inc. announced new funding through Caterpillar Venture Capital, a subsidiary of the Caterpillar Inc. heavy-machinery manufacturing company, with the money going toward development of Fisker Inc.'s new solid-state battery technology. Caterpillar believes the battery will have applications in construction, energy storage, transportation and mining industries.[85][86]
