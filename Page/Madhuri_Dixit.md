Acting career

Debut and career struggles (1984–88)

Dixit made her cinema debut in 1984 with Rajshri Productions' drama _Abodh_, opposite Bengali actor, Tapas Paul.[16] Upon release, the film failed commercially but Dixit's performance earned her positive reviews from critics. Aakash Barvalia of Gomolo wrote, "Madhuri excels in her role as a young bride who acquits herself well as the naive village girl and does not realise what marriage actually entails."[17] Her only release of 1985 - _Awara Baap_ — flopped at the box office.[18] During this time, a monochrome photograph of hers, shot by Gautam Rajadhyaksha was featured on the cover of the then popular magazine _Debonair_[19] and she appeared as the cover girl of Filmfare in April 1986.[20]

Chandra's action romance _Tezaab_ opposite Anil Kapoor.[23] The movie was the highest-grossing film of the year and she received her first Filmfare Best Actress Award nomination; the film's success established Dixit as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and marked a significant turning point in her career.[24] It proved to be Dixit's first commercial success. Akshay Shah of Planet Bollywood wrote, "Madhuri Dixit gives a fine-tuned performance. Though she is more remembered for her crowd pleasing dance act _Ek Do Teen_, her acting needs to be noted, especially in the scenes where she is pitted against Anupam Kher. She looks and dances like a dream."[25]

Her first release of 1989, _Vardi_, did fairly well at the box office. She next re-united with Anil Kapoor for Subhash Ghai's _Ram Lakhan_. She played Radha Shastri, a girl who falls in love with her childhood friend, Kapoor's character, however, she finds it hard to convince her father (Anupam Kher). Finishing up as the second highest-grossing film of the year, Ram Lakhan emerged as a "super-hit" at the box office.[26] Dixit's next release was the romantic drama _Prem Pratigyaa_, in which she was paired opposite Mithun Chakraborty. Her portrayal of Laxmi Rao, a distraught woman who influences a local underworld don letting him give up his bad habits, earned her a second nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award. Dixit collaborated for the first time with Trimurti Films for the action thriller _Tridev_ in which she was paired opposite Sunny Deol. The film featured an ensemble cast (Sunny Deol, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sangeeta Bijlani, Sonam and Amrish Puri), finishing up as one of the biggest hits of the year. It emerged as the third highest-grossing film of the year.[27]

Her next release of the year, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's drama _Parinda_, co-starring Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff and Nana Patekar was another box office hit. She played Paro, who is killed on her wedding night along with Karan (played by Kapoor) by a gangster (played by Patekar). Aniket Joshi wrote, "Madhuri Dixit, the only female character in the film, has a small role as Paro (Karan´s love interest and Prakash´s sister) yet still does well in the few scenes she has."[28] Also that year, she starred in _Ilaaka_, _Mujrim_ (both opposite Mithun Chakrobarty), _Kanoon Apna Apna_ (opposite Sanjay Dutt) and _Paap Ka Ant_ (opposite Govinda).

In 1990, Dixit appeared in nine films. Five of them—_Maha-Sangram_, _Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin_, _Jeevan Ek Sanghursh_, _Sailaab_ and _Jamai Raja_—were commercially unsuccessful. Her first hit that year was Rakesh Roshan's action comedy film _Kishen Kanhaiya_ (alongside Anil Kapoor and Shilpa Shirodkar). It tells the story of twin brothers who are separated at birth and re-unite in their youth. Dixit and Shirodkar played the love interests of Kapoor's characters. Dixit next played a strong-willed woman in the box-office average action drama _Izzatdaar_.[29] She won her first Filmfare Best Actress Award for portraying Madhu, a rich and arrogant girl who falls in love with a poorer boy, in Indra Kumar's romantic drama _Dil_ opposite Aamir Khan. It emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year.[30] Dixit's final release of the year was the action drama _Thanedaar_, alongside Dutt, Jeetendra, Jaya Prada, which was critically and commercially successful.[31]

In 1991, Dixit had five film releases, the first of which was the romance _Pyar Ka Devta_. She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff in the psychological thriller _100 Days_ which emerged as "above average" at the box-office. She played Devi, a clairvoyant woman who has a vision of a murder and sets out to uncover the truth. She next starred in _Saajan_ opposite Dutt and Salman Khan. A major critical and commercial success, the film earned Dixit praise for her portrayal of Pooja Saxena, who is in love with her idol - Sagar. She received her fourth Best Actress nomination for her work in the film.[32] Tatineni Rama Rao's _Pratikar_ and Nana Patekar's _Prahaar_ failed to do well at the box-office but were critical successes.

Dixit's first release of 1992 was Kumar's drama _Beta_, opposite Anil Kapoor. Dixit's portrayal of Saraswati, an educated woman who rebels against her manipulative mother-in-law, earned her critical acclaim. Upperstall.com commented, "She made Beta her own film totally stealing a march over the film's hero, Anil Kapoor. While the highlight of the film was undoubtedly Dhak Dhak Karne Laga – probably the sexiest and most popular dance of Madhuri's career, her blazing performance – that of a woman married to an illiterate, well-meaning man and who exposes her scheming mother-in-law whom her husband dotes on – had film reviewers gushing with several people jokingly saying the film should have been called Beti instead!"[33] The film finished up as the biggest hit of the year[34] and won her a second Filmfare Best Actress Award. Following the film's success, Dixit became famously known as the "Dhak Dhak Girl". _Zindagi Ek Jua_, _Prem Deewane_, _Khel_ and _Sangeet_ were her other releases of the year.

In 1993, Dixit reunited with Sanjay Dutt and Jackie Shroff in Subhash Ghai's crime drama _Khalnayak_. Her portrayal of Ganga, a police officer, who volunteers to go undercover, to trap an escaped criminal, garnered her critical acclaim. Shahid Khan of Planet Bollywood wrote, "In any other film, the heroine would not have much to do with a plot like this. So immense is the star-power of Madhuri Dixit that Subhash Ghai actually carved out a solid role for her in this macho tale of a bad boy and his shenanigans. She gives real competition to Sanjay Dutt. The audiences ran in droves to witness the Madhuri Dixit magic. In every scene, she holds you captive with her stunning beauty, demanding screen presence, expressive acting and excellent dancing skills. Saroj Khan's dance choreography is entertaining to watch, particularly in "Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai". Madhuri's entrance is a riot with a prison inmate asking her, 'Kaisi aurat hai tu? (What kind of a woman are you?)' and she responds by slapping her and saying, 'Aisi aurat hoon main! (This is the kind of woman I am!)'".[35] Dixit's performance in Khalnayak earned her a sixth nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award and became the second highest grossing film of the year.[36] Sudhir Mishra's _Dharavi_, Ramesh Talwar's _Sahibaan_, Singeetam Srinivasa Rao's _Phool_ and Lawrence D'Souza's _Dil Tera Aashiq_ were her other releases of the year.

The film emerged as one of the biggest hits in the history of Hindi cinema and made 1.35 billion worldwide, breaking the record of the film _Sholay_ (1975). It became the highest grossing Bollywood film in Hindi cinema history after its theatrical run and held the record for 7 years till the release of _Gadar: Ek Prem Katha_ (2001). Dixit's portrayal of Nisha, who falls in love with Prem (Khan's character) but their plans to be together are put in jeopardy when Nisha's sister dies, fetched her a third Filmfare Best Actress Award. Critics believed the film to be "too sweet" but appreciated Dixit's performance.[38] In the Millennium Edition of the "Guinness Book of World Records", _Hum Aapke Hain Kaun_ became the Bollywood's highest-grossing film.[39] Upperstall.com wrote, "Madhuri Dixit, reunited with the banner that launched her, stands out and is undoubtedly the life of the film as Nisha. Be it the mischievous but strong-minded, independent girl who gives it to Prem as good as she gets or the woman willing to sacrifice her love believing she is doing the right thing, Madhuri is absolutely spot on creating one of the more memorable female characters of Hindi Cinema."[40]

Dixit achieved further success when she reunited with Indra Kumar for the romantic drama _Raja_ opposite Sanjay Kapoor. She portrayed Madhu, a rich girl who falls for her childhood friend (played by Kapoor), however, she finds it tough to convince her two brothers of this relationship.

The film underperformed at the box office. Both the films earned her nominations for the Filmfare Best Actress Award.

The following year, both her films _Prem Granth_ and _Rajkumar_ flopped at the box office. In 1997, Dixit received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Ketki Singh, a village woman who struggles to confront and defeat the forces of oppression and male domination in Prakash Jha's _Mrityudand_ alongside Shabana Azmi and Shilpa Shirodkar.[42] Upperstall.com wrote, "Madhuri gives a wonderful, insightful performance as the self-respecting educated woman married into a family of male chauvinistic upper class landlords and who is humiliated by her husband when she objects to his misdeeds, never hitting a false note. She more than matches up to seasoned artists like Shabana and Om Puri in their scenes together. In a word, she is mesmerizing."[43] She next starred in the dramas _Koyla_, _Mahaanta_ and _Mohabbat_. With the exception of Koyla, none of these films performed well either critically or commercially.[44]

Dixit's fifth and final release of 1997 was Yash Chopra's musical romantic drama Dil To Pagal Hai. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Karisma Kapoor, the film depicts the love stories of the dancers in a musical dance troupe. Her role of Pooja, a woman faced with a moral dilemma in a love triangle fetched her a fourth Filmfare Best Actress Award.[45][46] Dil To Pagal Hai emerged as a blockbuster at the box office and proved to be the second highest-grossing film of the year.[47]

Devdas and hiatus (1998–2006)

She next starred in the N.Chandra- directed drama _Wajood_ (1998) opposite Nana Patekar and Mukul Dev. She played Apoorva, a very rich girl who is misunderstood by Malhar, played by Patekar. Suparn Verma of _Rediff_ commented: "..She nevertheless shows that even a weak role cannot stifle her as she animates the screen like only she can. Truly, the coming together of Nana, Madhuri and Chandra in one film is a tour de force."[48] Her next and only release of 1999 was the romance _Aarzoo_ (1999) opposite Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. Upon release, the film emerged commercially unsuccessful.[49]

In 2000, Dixit starred in Rajkumar Santoshi's _Pukar_ opposite Anil Kapoor. A love story based on the backdrop of the Indian Army, the film was shot over a course of 350 days.[50] Dixit's portrayal of Anjali, a heartbroken and jealous woman who swears revenge on Jai (played by Kapoor) for rejecting her, earned her the twelfth nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award.[51] She then played the title character in _Gaja Gamini_, the first feature film directed by painter M. F. Husain. Hussain got fixated with Dixit, and watched her movie _Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!_ several times, and was certain that he would make a film only with her.[52] The film followed the story of Gaja Gamini, who appears in various incarnations as Mona Lisa, Shakuntala and others.[53] _Pukar_ was an average grosser, while the latter underperformed at the box office.[54][55] Madhuri_Dixit.jpg'' in 2001]] In 2001, Dixit starred in Deepak Shivdasani's love triangle _Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke_ opposite Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta.[56] Subsequently, Dixit reunited with Rajkumar Santoshi for the social drama _Lajja_ (2001). Dealing with the issue of gender inequality, Dixit played Janki, a theatre actress who gets pre-maritally pregnant. Anita Bora of Rediff.com wrote: "Madhuri slips into her role as Janaki..with consummate ease..and..dazzles us with a class act."[57] The film was a box-office failure in India but was an overseas success[58][59] and fetched Dixit a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination.[60] Dixit's first release of 2002 was the love triangle _Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam_ opposite Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan, where she played Radha whose married life blemishes when she gets obsessed with the career of her friend. A remake of director K. S. Adhiyaman's own Tamil film _Thotta Chinungi_ (1995), the film took six years in making, with huge sabbaticals in between shoots due to several production problems.[61] The film emerged successful at the Indian box office.[62] Few critics noted that the delay made the film look outdated.[63][64]

Dixit's next release was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance _Devdas_, co-starring Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name.[65] She portrayed Chandramukhi, a courtesan who is in love with the title character.[66] Sita Menon of Rediff.com wrote: "The most understated role and perhaps the one that is most lingering, in terms of virtuosity, is that played by Madhuri Dixit. As Chandramukhi, she is simply stunning, lending passion, fire and gentleness with such consummate ease that watching her perform is sheer delight."[67] The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by _Time_ in their listing of the "10 best films of the millennium".[68][69] The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over .[70][71] _Devdas_ was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[72] Dixit won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for her work in the film.[73] Post Devdas, Dixit shifted to Denver with her family.

A box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Dixit's portrayal.[81] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticised the plot, while he wrote about Dixit's performance: "It's hard to take your eyes off the screen when she's up there, dazzling you with her spontaneity, her easy charm and her 100-watt smile."[82] Her performance earned her another nomination for the Filmfare Best Actress Award.[83] In 2011, Dixit was felicitated by Filmfare with a special jury recognition for completing 25 years in the Indian film industry.[84]

She played a con-woman "Begum Para" opposite Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi and Huma Qureshi and expressed that she agreed to do the film because of the "unapologetic way" director Abhishek Chaubey presented Vidya Balan's character" in _Ishqiya_.[85] The film opened to positive response from critics who called it "one of the year's most important releases".[86][87] Anupama Chopra called Dixit "compelling", while Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost wrote "She's still capable of keeping an audience glued to their seats when the credits start rolling, all because she's dancing on screen.".[88][89] The film won Dixit her fourteenth Filmfare nomination for Best Actress.[90]

Her next release of the year was debutant director Soumik Sen's _Gulaab Gang_, alongside Juhi Chawla.[91] Dixit portrayed Rajjo, the leader of a women's activist group.

Jha labelled Dixit's performance and demeanour "inconsistent".[97] However, Sampat Pal claimed that in Dixit's character she finds a "reflection of her own life so stark" that it makes her feel "it was she on screen".[98]

Writing for the NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee wrote, "In the blinding glow of Dixit's presence as a nautch girl who can turn on the magic at will, the younger cast members pale somewhat in comparison.
