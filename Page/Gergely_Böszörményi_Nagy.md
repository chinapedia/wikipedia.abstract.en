GERGELY BÖSZÖRMÉNYI-NAGY (born August 1, 1984) is an entrepreneur and former public servant who founded Brain Bar.

Böszörményi-Nagy is also executive director of Design Terminal, a private business based in Budapest, Hungary that helps startups to reach the global marketplace.[1]


Education

Böszörményi-Nagy studied International relations at Corvinus University of Budapest. He pursued a Master of Business Administration at Central European University and participated at the Executive Program in Social Entrepreneurship of Stanford Graduate School of Business.


Career

From 2010 to 2012, Böszörményi-Nagy was deputy head of strategic communication for the Government of Hungary. Among other campaigns, he led the public outreach of Hungary's first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

In 2012 Böszörményi-Nagy joined Design Terminal, the government agency responsible for design and innovation as strategic director, where he was subsequently promoted to general director in January, 2014. During his leadership, the company launched an extensive portfolio of early stage, non-equity incubation services for innovative enterprises, for which Design Terminal was awarded the European Enterprise Promotion Awards by the European Commission in 2014,[2] and was also named the "best startup accelerator in Hungary" two years later.[3] In 2015, UNESCO selected Budapest for its global Creative Cities network,[4] mostly in recognition of the services and projects of Design Terminal.[5] In 2016, Böszörményi-Nagy and his team was appointed to prepare the country's official startup strategy, the government's legislative package to stimulate the innovation ecosystem by incentives for entrepreneurial education, business incubation and angel investment.[6] Later in 2016, following a general restructuring in the Hungarian public administration, Design Terminal made a transition to the private sector, and continues its operations as an independent nonprofit that relies mostly on financing from the Hungarian government.[7]


Brain Bar

In June, 2015 Böszörményi-Nagy founded Brain Bar, a global festival focused on the future.[8] The annual event revolves around a two-day concentration of talks and debates on business, social, cultural, technological and political trends[9], and attracts thousands of visitors per year with past speakers including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, historian Niall Ferguson, three Michelin star restaurateur Massimo Bottura, WPP plc founder Sir Martin Sorrell, EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, best-selling futurist Kevin Kelly, Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde, geopolitical analyst George Friedman, sociologist Philip Zimbardo, astronaut and former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield and the world's first humanoid robot citizen, Sophia.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] In its fourth year of operation, with WIRED as media partner [20], Brain Bar's strategic partners include Magyar Telekom, MOL, BMW, and KPMG.[21][22] As part of its social impact policy, Brain Bar is free to attend for a group of outstanding teachers and students based on pre-selection.

CRITICISM

Many critics note that Brain Bar, not unlike Design Terminal is mostly using public money (100 million HUF in 2015 ) for a festival that attracts very few people outside of the organizers' circles (in the same year, 2015 only 143 tickets were actually sold). The money is mostly spent on star performers who, even unwittingly legitimate officials of the Hungarian right-wing government like the unorthodox president of the Hungarian national Bank, Gyorgy Matolcsy.


Awards

In 2014, the Hungarian edition of Forbes named Böszörményi-Nagy in its '30 under 30' list of successful young leaders,[23] and Google, the _Financial Times_ and the International Visegrad Fund named Böszörményi-Nagy among the 'New Europe 100', a list of Central Europe's key figures in the digital economy.[24]
