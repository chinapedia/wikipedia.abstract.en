NORMAN OHLER (born 1970) is a German _New York Times_ bestselling author, novelist and screenwriter, best known for his book _Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany_, which has been published in over 25 languages.[1][2][3]


Overview

Ohler was born in Zweibrücken, West Germany in 1970 and attended journalism school in Hamburg. In 1995 he published _Die Quotenmaschine_, the world's first hypertext novel in German.[4] His second novel, _Mitte_, was published in 2001 and praised by _Der Spiegel_ as his 'masterpiece', followed by his third, _Ponte City_, in 2002.[5] These three novels form Ohler's _City Trilogy_.

In 2004, Ohler was invited by the German Goethe-Institut to act as writer-in-residence in Ramallah. There, Ohler wrote about the life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and published the last interview Yassir Arafat gave, shortly before his death.[6] Ohler has also worked as writer-in-residence in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

In 2008, he co-wrote the movie _Palermo Shooting_ with Wim Wenders, starring Dennis Hopper.[7]

In September 2015, Kiepenheuer & Witsch published Ohler's first non-fiction work, _Der totale Rausch: Drogen im Dritten Reich_, and the following year the book appeared in English as _Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany_.[8][9] Upon publication in the US, it became a _New York Times_ bestseller.[10] In the book, Ohler researches what role psychoactive drugs, particularly stimulants such as methamphetamine, played in the military history of World War II, concluding that many of the German military and political leadership—especially Adolf Hitler—abused psychoactive drugs during the war.[11][12][13]

The book was praised by some historians: Antony Beevor calls _Blitzed_ 'a remarkable work of research. Ohler's account makes us look at this densely studied period rather differently'; Ian Kershaw describes it as 'very good and extremely interesting ... a serious piece of scholarship very well-researched'; and Hans Mommsen, one of Germany's leading historians, refers to _Blitzed_ as 'changing the overall picture'.[14][15][16]

However, other historians disagreed with Ohler's approach. Nicholaus Waschmann wrote that 'Ohler's hyperbole stands in the way of sober understanding (...) [he] appears to mix fact and fiction.'; Dagmar Herzog expressed the view that 'Ohler's analysis does not withstand close scrutiny. (…) Anyone seeking a deepened understanding of the Nazi period must be wary of a book that provides more distraction and distortion than clarification'; and James Pugh judged that while the book is an 'engaging and entertaining piece of journalistic history', it was 'troubling based on its tone, scholarship and engagement with the literature'.[17][18][19] Richard J. Evans, Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge from 2008 to 2014, author of _History of the Third Reich_, called _Blitzed_ 'a crass and dangerously inaccurate account'[20] He also wrote that the book is 'morally and politically dangerous', because it implies that Hitler was not responsible for his actions. Ohler rejected this claim.[21] Evans replied: "′Blitzed′ belongs not in the world of serious history, but in the new landscape of ‘post-truth’ and ‘alternative facts’".[22]

At a sitting in March of 2019 of the renowned Dublin based book club known as BBC enthusiasts a number of learned Irish businessmen and scholars awarded Blitzed an overall score of 7.6 out of ten.
