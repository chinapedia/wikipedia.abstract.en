Reception

_Publishers Weekly_ called it a "robust book" and wrote "this is a powerful collection that should enthrall readers of _The Joy Luck Club_ and Tan's other novels."[1] _Kirkus_ wrote "her prose is thoughtful, never maudlin or self-pitying. Tan writes as easily and unpretentiously about herself as about others." and described it as "An examined life recalled with wisdom and grace."[2]
