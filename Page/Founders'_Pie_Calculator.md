The FOUNDER'S PIE CALCULATOR is a tool for distributing shares when starting a business venture. It was first described in an article by Frank Demmler, who is an Adjunct Teaching Professor of Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University.[1][2]

In contrast to popular notion, the shares are not distributed equally (because "it's fair") but using a system of 5 important aspects of any business venture, assigning a relative weight to them and then rating the founders in each of these aspects.[3]
