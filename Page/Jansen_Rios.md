Personal life

Basketball was not his first sport. Jansen played center forward for his elementary and high school teams. And growing up, he rooted for Liverpool FC where aside from Steven Gerrard, he observed the techniques of former striker, the 6’8” Peter Crouch. Watching Crouch closely, Rios, standing at 6’2” used his height advantage in winning headers and corners to score goals.[1]
