Biography

Early life

Mills was born in Wallace, North Carolina in August 1912.[1][2] She was part of family of eleven children and was the granddaughter of slaves.[3] Mills was raised in nearby Watha.[4] Poor weather conditions in the early 1910s forced many African-American families to migrate to the Northern United States, although Mills' family remained in North Carolina and her father worked as a farm laborer. She planned to study law but later decided to focus on nursing after reading a letter that suggested it would provide an income that would allow her to do what she desired.[5] Mills was educated in segregated one-room schools across the county.[6] She educated other students after her teacher discovered that Mills was a quick learner.[7] She moved to Durham at age 18 to attend Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing.[8] She graduated with a degree in nursing in 1934 and became a registered nurse.

Mills became the guardian of an eighteen-month old child after she nursed him through an illness. She was awarded an scholarship to further her skill in Arabic at School For International Studies and took her classes in Washington, D.C.[23] Mills later adopted a second child.[24] She later was assigned to South Vietnam, Cambodia and Chad where she provided health education, nursing care, and worked in smallpox and malaria eradication campaigns. Additionally, she taught sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and health education programs and founded maternal-child health clinics.[25]
