11Β-METHYL-19-NORTESTOSTERONE (11Β-MNT) is a synthetic and orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) which was developed by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and has not been marketed at this time.[1][2][3]

The C17β dodecylcarbonate ester of 11β-MNT, 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC) (CDB-4754), is a prodrug of 11β-MNT.[4][5][6] Along with the closely related AAS dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone; CDB-1321) and its ester prodrug dimethandrolone undecanoate (CDB-4521), 11β-MNT and 11β-MNTDC are under investigation as potential male contraceptives and to treat male hypogonadism.[7][8][9]

Pharmacology

Pharmacodynamics

11β-MNT does not undergo aromatization into the corresponding estrogenic metabolite 11β-methylestradiol, and for this reason, has no potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia.[10] In addition, unlike testosterone, 11β-MNT does not appear to undergo 5α-reduction into the corresponding 5α-dihydrogenated metabolite 5α-dihydro-11β-MNT (5α-DHMNT).[11] This conclusion is based on the fact that 5α-DHMNT is 4 to 8 times as potent as 11β-MNT in terms of androgenicity in animal bioassays, yet the co-administration of the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride with 11β-MNT had no influence on its potency in assays using tissues that express 5α-reductase like the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles.[12] Due to lack of potentiation by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, 11β-MNT may have a lower risk of certain side effects such as oily skin, acne, androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss), prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer than testosterone and certain other AAS.[13]

Similarly to nandrolone, dimethandrolone, and other 19-nortestosterone derivatives, 11β-MNT has been found to possess progestogenic activity.[14] Because of its dual activity as an AAS and progestogen, 11β-MNT may have greater efficacy in suppression of spermatogenesis and hence male fertility than pure AAS like testosterone.[15]

Oral 11β-MNT has shown little to no potential for hepatotoxicity in animals, similarly to testosterone but unlike 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone.[16] The drug notably shows a much lower hepatotoxic potential than dimethandrolone and trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT), which may have an increased risk due to their shared C7α methyl group (although a risk that is still significantly lower than that of 17α-alkylated AAS).[17]


Chemistry

11β-MNT, or 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone, also known as 11β-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a non-17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).[18]
