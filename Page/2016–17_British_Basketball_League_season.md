Notable occurrences

Assistant coach Ben Thomas took the reins for the remainder of the season.
-   Sheffield Sharks head coach Atiba Lyons sparked controversy after the signing of three players from a combine for prospective players he held in the United States. Forward Marquis Mathis didn't play a single game for the club, before signing for English Basketball League side Solent Kestrels, and forward Shaheed Davis lasted only 4 competitive matches. Only point guard Jordan Davis, who had previous professional experience, lasted the season, which was spent mostly on the sidelines due to injury.

-   Glasgow Rocks set a franchise record of 12 consecutive wins during October, November and December.
