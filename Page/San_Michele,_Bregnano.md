SAN MICHELE is a Roman Catholic parish church in Bregnano, province of Como, region of Lombardy, Italy.


History

This church was a chapel subsidiary to the Pieve of Fino Mornasco by the 13th century. The chapel was expanded in the 16th century. A separate parish was not established in the commune until the 1650s. In 1651, the town gained the dedication to San Giorgio and Michele.[1] The church underwent further restorations in the 20th century.[2]
