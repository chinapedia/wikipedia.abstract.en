_HWY 62_ is an album by American singer-songwriter Peter Case, released in 2015.[1]


Critical reception

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Mark Deming wrote of the album "HWY 62 finds Peter Case rockin' the blues a little bit and singing with serious heart, soul, and wisdom all the time, and nearly three decades into his solo career he remains one of our best and most compelling singer/songwriters, with this album as proof."[2]
