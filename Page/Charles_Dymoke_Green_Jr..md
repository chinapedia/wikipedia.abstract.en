CHARLES DYMOKE GREEN JR. (10 February 1907 â€“ 23 October 1988) served as a Commonwealth Scout Commissioner for the Scout Association until 1970, and as the Chairman of the World Scout Committee.

He was "born in Scouting", as his father Charles Dymoke Green Senior was a close friend of Robert Baden-Powell and a personality of the Scout movement in Great Britain.

In 1941, he was Rover Commissioner in Colombo, Ceylon, and organized a unit of mounted Scouts. Kingsley C. Dassanaike worked to promote Scouting for the deaf and blind with Green's support.[1]

In 1971, Green was awarded the 63rd _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting,[2] the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award,[3] and the first Silver World Award.[4]
