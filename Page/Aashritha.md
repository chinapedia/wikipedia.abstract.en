Career

Aashritha was born in Madurai to a Tamil family. She had modelled for many print advertisements, while also winning the Vivel Miss South Indiaâ€™s Beautiful Face pageant and finishing runner up in the Miss Andhra Pradesh contest.[1][2] Following appearances in beauty pageants, Aashritha made her acting debut in the low-budget village-centric film _Isakki_ (2013), where she portrayed a teacher. A critic from The Times of India noted that "Aashrita makes a decent debut as a strong and independent woman who stands up to her father".[3][4] In 2015, she played the lead female role opposite Ramesh Thilak in Vijay Sethupathi's production _Orange Mittai_ (2015), portraying a town girl called Kavya.[5] The film opened to positive reviews, but did not perform well at the box office.[6][7]

Aashritha then moved on to work on Nagaraj's _Azhahendra Sollukku Amudha_, playing the titular role, after auditioning successfully for the film.[8][9]
