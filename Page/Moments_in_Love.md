"MOMENTS IN LOVE" is the third single by Art of Noise and written by Anne Dudley, Trevor Horn, J. J. Jeczalik, Gary Langan, and Paul Morley. Although the original 10-minute version appeared on both the _Into Battle with the Art of Noise_ release in 1983 and the _Who's Afraid of the Art of Noise?_ album in 1984, "Moments In Love" wasn't released globally as a commercial single until 1985, when the song was featured on the "Pumping Iron II: The Women" soundtrack. The version that was used on this soundtrack was "Moments in Love (Beaten)". Reissues followed in 1986 and 1987, in some markets. Copyright dates indicate the edits & remixes were prepared in 1984.

Singles generally featured shortened edits of the album version. The 12-inch remixes were "Moments In Love (Beaten)" and the slower "Love Beat". On the Daft compilation, the former was retitled "Love", and an edit of the latter was called "(Three Fingers Of) Love". 12-inch and CD singles also included an edit of "Beat Box (Diversion One)", listed on the releases either as "Beatbox Diversion 10" or just "Beat Box".

The 1999/2000 remixes were triggered by Rob Searle's bootleg mix "Moments In Time" and would eventually end in a cancelled release under the 'Vision' moniker.
