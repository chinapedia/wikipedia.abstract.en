SWEDEN is an unincorporated community in Douglas County, Missouri, United States.[1] Sweden lies in the south-central part of the county.

History

A post office called Sweden was established in 1896, and remained in operation until 1956.[3] The community's name was supposed to honor a resident with the surname Sweten (a recording error accounts for the error in spelling, which was never corrected).[4]
