STENDHAL SYNDROME, STENDHAL'S SYNDROME or FLORENCE SYNDROME is a psychosomatic condition involving rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations, allegedly occurring when individuals become exposed to objects or phenomena of great beauty.[1]


History

Stendhal.jpg.]] The affliction is named after 19th-century French author Stendhal (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to Florence in his book _Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio_. When he visited the Basilica of Santa Croce, where Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo Galilei are buried, he was overcome with profound emotion. Stendhal wrote:

Although psychologists have long debated whether Stendhal's syndrome exists, the apparent effects on some individuals are severe enough to warrant medical attention.[2] The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to tourists suffering from dizzy spells or disorientation after viewing the statue of David, the artworks of the Uffizi Gallery, and other historic relics of the Tuscan city.[3]

Though there are numerous accounts of people fainting while taking in Florentine art, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979; when it was described by Italian psychiatrist Graziella Magherini, who observed over a hundred similar cases among tourists in Florence. There exists no scientific evidence to define Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; however there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional responses are activated during exposure to art.[4] The syndrome is not listed as a recognised condition in the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_.
