JULIE MASON is a journalist and the host of "The Press Pool" on SiriusXM radio's POTUS channel.[1]

She has been a White House correspondent for the _Houston Chronicle_,[2] _Washington Examiner_ and Politico during the George W. Bush administration and the first term of Barack Obama's administration. She was with the _Chronicle_ for twenty years.[3]

Mason grew up in Acton, Massachusetts, graduated from Lawrence Academy at Groton and attended American University in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s. Her first job was as a clerk in the Washington bureau of the _Dallas Morning News,_ and In 1988 she went to Texas to work as a reporter with the _Houston Chronicle._ She was transferred to the newspaper's Washington bureau in 2001 but was laid off in 2008[4] while serving as the paper's White House correspondent. She worked at the _Washington Examiner_ as a White House reporter until 2010, when she joined Politico's White House team.[5][6] She joined SiriusXM in 2011.[7][8] In 2014, Mason received the Gracie Award from the Alliance for Women in the Media for outstanding achievement as a radio talk show host.[9] She has been the secretary and a board member of the White House Correspondents' Association.[10][11]

She has been noted for her impressions of notable figures such as Laura Bush, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren and John Boehner.[12][13] Readers of FishbowlDC in 2012 voted Mason "class clown" of the Washington press corps.[14]

One report said that Mason is known for her "bawdy personality and quick wit."[15] Television commentator Bill O'Reilly in 2014 called her a "loon" because, according to him, she suggested that he and Glenn Beck may have damaged the Fox News "brand."[16]

In 2011, White House press secretary Jay Carney called one of Mason's stories "partisan, inflammatory and tendentious," and U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor sent her an e-mail that included an animated picture of a crying mime, a "visual suggestion that she was whining," according to _Washington Post_ columnist Paul Farhi.[17]

She lives in Washington, in the Dupont-Logan-U Street-Columbia Heights area.[18]
