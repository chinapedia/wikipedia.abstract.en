The GULF OF OMAN or SEA OF OMAN ( _khalīj ʿumān_; _daryâ-ye omân_) is a gulf that connects the Arabian Sea with the Strait of Hormuz, which then runs to the Persian Gulf. It borders Iran and Pakistan on the north, Oman on the south, and the United Arab Emirates on the west.


Extent

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Oman as follows:[1]


Bordering countries

-   Iran
-   Oman
-   Pakistan
-   United Arab Emirates


Major ports

-   Port of Fujairah, Fujairah, United Arab Emirates
-   Khor Fakkan Container Terminal, Khor Fakkan, United Arab Emirates
-   Port of Chabahar, Chabahar, Iran
-   Port Sultan Qaboos, Muttrah, Oman


International trade

The area is near the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route through which a third of the world's liquefied natural gas and 20% of global oil consumption passes from Middle East producers.[2]


Ecology

In 2018, scientists confirmed the Gulf of Oman contains one of the world's largest marine dead zones, where the ocean contains little or no oxygen and marine wildlife cannot exist. The dead zone encompasses nearly the entire 63,700-square-mile Gulf of Oman. The cause is a combination of increased ocean warming and increased runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers.[3]
