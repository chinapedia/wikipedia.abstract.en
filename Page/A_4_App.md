_A 4 APP_ is a live album by American recording artist Anastacia. It has been released on December 16, 2016 through the PledgeMusic website by Sony Music.[1] The album features a collection of non-album singles, B-Sides and unreleased tracks that were performed live during the _Ultimate Collection Tour_ in 2016.[2]

As part of the tour, Anastacia wanted her fans to choose which songs they'd like to hear (besides tracks already featured on the Ultimate Collection).[3] The Anastacia App allowed her fans to vote for a particular song 24 hours prior to each concert.[4] The most popular song each night was then added to the setlist and recorded for the album.


Background

In September 2016, it was announced on PledgeMusic website that a new album would be released and that the fans could pre-order it in a signed version. 2 weeks later (October 31), the singer announced that the album would in fact be a live album with the tracks the fans voted on the Anastacia App. On a Facebook Live Q&A, the singer also said the album cover would be designed by a fan.
