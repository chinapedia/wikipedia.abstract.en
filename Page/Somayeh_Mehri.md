SOMAYEH MEHRI was an Iranian woman who died on April 13, 2015 as a result of complications due to an acid attack.


Circumstances of the acid attack

Somayeh Mehri was seeking a divorce from her husband, who was a drug smuggler.[1]

One night in 2011, Mehri's husband cut the electricity to their house.[2] Then, while Mehri and her infant child, Rana, were asleep, he threw acid on both their faces.

Mehri screamed for help. She was badly burnt and went to the yard and washed her face. However, her skin and hair were melting off her face. At that point, her husband ran off to Mehri's father's house to notify him that she had been hurt by an electric shock.

Following the attack, Mehri lost sight in both her eyes. Her one-year-old daughter lost sight in one eye. Another daughter, Nazanin, was also injured in the attack but her injuries were less severe[3]


Aftermath of the attack and death

They traveled repeatedly to Tehran for treatments. However, she succumbed to respiratory infection due to her lungs being burnt.[4]

Her husband was arrested a few days later along with his brother for committing the attack. As of 2015, the husband was still in jail while his conspirator brother was released on bail.
