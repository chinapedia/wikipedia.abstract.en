The SPEEDWAY GREAT BRITAIN (SGB) PREMIERSHIP is the top division of speedway league competition in the United Kingdom, governed by the Speedway Control Bureau (SCB) in conjunction with the British Speedway Promoters' Association (BSPA). It was introduced for 2017 following a restructuring of British speedway.[1]


League format

The league contains nine teams who meet each other twice at home and twice away. The top four teams at the end of the regular season go into playoffs to decide the champions.

Unlike the previous leagues, there is relegation and promotion between the Premiership and the new second tier, the SGB Championship, with the bottom team from the Premiership going into a playoff with the Championship winners.[2][3]

Six of the teams from the previous Elite League competed in the Premiership for 2017, along with two teams who raced in the Premier League in 2016.[4]


Teams

Team building

At the start of the season, teams are built up to a maximum points limit. The combined Calculated Match Average (CMA) of the riders declared in the team must not be higher than an agreed figure set at the British Speedway Promoters' Association (BSPA) Annual General Meeting. For the 2017 season, the total was not to be higher than 50.[5]
