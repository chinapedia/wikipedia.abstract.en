_ELEMENTE DER MATHEMATIK_ is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering mathematics. It is published by the European Mathematical Society Publishing House on behalf of the Swiss Mathematical Society. It was established in 1946 by Louis Locher-Ernst, and transferred to the Swiss Mathematical Society in 1976.[1] Rather than publishing research papers, it focuses on survey papers aimed at a broad audience.[2]
