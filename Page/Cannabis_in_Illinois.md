CANNABIS IN ILLINOIS is legal for medicinal use and will become legal for recreational usage on January 1, 2020. As of July 2019, nearly 79,000 qualifying patients participate in the state's medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs.[1][2] Since legalization in November 2015, retail sales in Illinois have reached nearly $364 million at 55 dispensaries across the state.

On May 31, 2019 the Illinois General Assembly passed the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act to legalize recreational marijuana use, which was signed by Governor J.B. Pritzker on June 25, 2019.[3][4] Recreational-use revenue in Illinois is expected to reach an estimated $1.6 billion a year.[5] Illinois became the first state in the nation to legalize cannabis for recreational sale and use through a state legislature rather than ballot initiative.[6] Overall, Illinois is the 11th state in the US to allow recreational marijuana.[7]


Prohibition (1931)

In 1931, Illinois prohibited recreational use of cannabis, as part of a nationwide trend across 29 states in the early 20th century.[8]


Cannabis Control Act (1978)

Illinois passed the Cannabis Control Act in 1978, which technically allows for medical marijuana. However, in order for it to become an actuality, action was required from two state departments: Human Services and the State Police. Neither department took action.[9][10]


Medical cannabis (2013)

The Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act in 2013.[11] The law legalizes the use of medical cannabis in tightly controlled circumstances.[12] In August 2013, Governor Patrick Quinn signed into law the state's medical marijuana program, which would take effect on January 1. making it the 20th state to do so.[13]

"Legally registered patients" may, with a prescription from a medical caregiver, apply for an ID card that allows the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The law lists over 30 specific medical conditions that may be legally treated using cannabis, and allows the Department of Public Health to add other conditions to the list via administrative rulemaking. Applications for patients, growers, and vendors began in September 2014.[14]

As of April 2019, over 62,000 qualifying patients participate in the state's medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs.


Decriminalization (2016)

In July 2016, Illinois reduced punishment for under 10 grams of cannabis to a $100â€“200 fine; it was a misdemeanor previously. The law also sets the requirement for DWI at 5 nanograms/ml of THC in the blood.[15][16]


Proposed recreational use (2017)

On March 22, 2017, Illinois lawmakers proposed legalizing recreational marijuana in the state.[17] The measure would also allow residents to possess up to 28 grams of cannabis, or about an ounce, and to grow five plants. Early estimates found that legalized marijuana would generate between $350 to $700 million in annual sales.[18] The _Chicago Tribune_ reported legislation was "widely expected to pass" in 2019, following election of pro-legalization governor JB Pritzker and a favorable state legislature.[19]


Medical cannabis expansion (2018)

On August 28, 2018, Illinois' medical cannabis program greatly expanded becoming available as an opioid painkiller replacement.[20] The legislation also eased the application process as applicants will no longer have to be fingerprinted or undergo criminal background checks. Some estimate the expansion could bring in up to 365,000 new patients into the medical marijuana program generating an additional $425 million in revenue for the state.[21]


Recreational legalization (2019)

On May 31, 2019, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing recreational marijuana starting on January 1, 2020. The bill was signed by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday June 25, 2019. [22]
