Whilst playing at the 2017 Grand Slam of Darts, Van Peer suffered a severe case of dartitis during his match with 2 time World Champion Gary Anderson. Former player and now Sky Sports pundit Wayne Mardle has talked about his struggles with dartitis and has thrown his support behind the young tyro, even touting him as a future champion despite his struggles with the condition. Despite his visible struggles on stage, Van Peer defeated both Simon Whitlock and Cameron Menzies in the group stage, before losing out to Mensur Suljović in the second round.
