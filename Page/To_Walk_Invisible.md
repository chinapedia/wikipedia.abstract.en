_TO WALK INVISIBLE_ is a British television film about the Brontë family that aired on BBC One on 29 December 2016.[1] The drama was written and directed by Sally Wainwright and focused on the relationship of the three Brontë sisters; Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and their brother, Branwell.[2]

In the United States, it aired on 26 March 2017 on PBS as part of Masterpiece Theater, under the title: "_To Walk Invisible: The Bronte Sisters._"[3]


Title

The title of the drama comes from a letter that Charlotte Brontë had written to her publisher about once meeting a clergyman who did not realise that she was Currer Bell. It suited her and her sisters that they were not famous; "What author would be without the advantage of being able to walk invisible?"[4]

Production

Writing

BAFTA-winning writer Sally Wainwright, whose other credits include crime drama _Happy Valley_ and comedy-drama _Last Tango in Halifax_, both set in Yorkshire, said she was "thrilled beyond measure" to have been asked by the BBC to "bring to life these three fascinating, talented, ingenious Yorkshire women." [6]

Filming

The drama was filmed mostly in Yorkshire with Haworth being used extensively during filming.[7] A replica of the Parsonage at Haworth was constructed on the moorland in Penistone Hill Country Park, just west of Haworth. This allowed external scenes to be filmed away from the real Parsonage in the village. The replica parsonage was also added to with other buildings and a street to make a small set of how Haworth looked at the time of the Brontës, with at least one local councillor pointing out that in their time, the Parsonage was not shaded by trees as it is now.[8]

Interior scenes were filmed in studios at Manchester as filming in the actual Parsonage itself was not possible. Other external scenes were filmed within the city of York[9] and the Calder Valley in West Yorkshire.[10]


Critical reception

On review aggregating web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has achieved a score of 83% based on six reviews, for an average rating of 7.5/10.[11]

Lucy Mangan, writing in _The Guardian_, described the drama as "bleak, beautiful and brilliant; like everything that Wainwright and her repertory company does". She also praised Nagaitis' performance as "a blazing performance [which] conveys the inner torment as well as the selfishness and keeps our sympathy even as he drives us up the wall".[12]

_The Telegraph_{{'}}s Jasper Rees gave the drama five stars out of five describing the episode as "the Brontë sisters brought to fizzing, furious life," and similarly praised Adam Nagaitis' acting, noting that it was excellent.[13]

The programme also attracted numerous comments on social media, with many viewers expressing their displeasure about a fine performance ruined by the quality of the audio.[14]

The characterization of the Brontë family was criticized by Peggy Hewitt, a member of the Brontë Society whose own biography about the family, _These Lonely Mountains,_ is "widely regarded as the definitive book about the Haworth moors and their links to the Brontës".[15] Hewitt was critical of Branwell's character being overplayed, Charlotte's "constant mean pinched look" and the representation of Patrick Brontë as "mild and ineffectual" when she claims he was a "fiery Irishman, Cambridge graduate, [and a] forward-looking social reformer."[16]
