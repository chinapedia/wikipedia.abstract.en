The church of SANTA MARIA IMMACOLATA IN GROTTAROSSA is a church in Rome, Grottarossa area, in Via Flaminia.


History

It was built in 1935 by Ettore Molinario to meet the spiritual needs of all the workers of the former farm that has given rise to Grottarossa village. It is set along Via Flaminia, "to Saxa Rubra", where, in the year 312, there was the historic battle between the armies of Constantine I and Maxentius. On 2 November 1986, the church received the visit of John Paul II, who at that time solemnly crowned a new image of Our Lady Immaculate. The church is home to the parish, which was established on June 4, 1937. It also is home to the cardinal's title of "Immaculate Conception of Mary in Grottarossa", instituted by Pope John Paul II May 5, 1985 by Papal Bull _Purpuratis Patribus_. Henryk Gulbinowicz has been the cardinal-protector since 1985.
