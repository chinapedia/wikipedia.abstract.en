FLSTFB_Fat_Boy.jpg The '''Harley-Davidson Fat Boy, ''' is a popular[1] V-twin softail cruiser motorcycle with solid-cast disc wheels.[2]. Designed by Willie G. Davidson and Louie Netz, Harley-Davidson built a prototype Fat Boy in Milwaukee for the Daytona Bike Week rally at Daytona Beach in 1988 and 1989.[3][4] Fat Boys produced from 1990-2017 are coded FLSTF, and _' FLFB_' (& _' FLFBS_') from 2018.

The name is said to come from the bike's "massive presence", and that the name gave a link to the earlier Harley-Davidson "Fat Bob" model.[5][6]


History & development

The Fat Boy's frame is derived from the 1984 "Softail" which appears to have a rigid hardtail chassis but which in fact has a swinging arm with concealed springs that was originally designed in a Missourian garage in the 1970's by "a mechanical engineer" named Bill Davis and later Patented in 1976.[7] Willie G the grandson of Harley-Davidson co-founder William A. Davidson originally turned down engineer Bill Davis' softail concept; but the company later relented, buying the rights and designing its own softail frame in-house.[8]

-   After 1994, the Fat Boy was fitted with a seamless exhaust.
-   In 1996 the master cylinder and switch gear were revised.
-   1999 saw a new Twin Cam 1450cc engine for the 2000 model year. This necessitated a bespoke engine variant and changes to the frame to account for the new engine.
-   In 2002 bullet-style indicators, alarm and immobiliser were added.[9]
-   In 2005 a "15th Anniversary" version was available with a "Screamin' Eagle" engine and extras including special paint and custom wheels.[10]
-   In 2006 the engine was upgraded to a larger twin cam 1584cc model[11] and a six speed gearbox.[12]
-   The 2010 "Fat Boy Lo" _' FLSTFB_' had the lowest ever Harley seat height.[13]

The 2018 Fat Boys have a redesigned softail frame with Showa front and rear suspension and new twin-counterbalanced Milwaukee-Eight engines. The two 2018 variants comprise:

-   The FLFB with , and
-   The FLFBS with [14]

The 2018 Softail frame has a modified swingarm with a Showa rear monoshock suspension mounted beneath the seat (replacing earlier twin shocks). So as to provide a more comfortable and better controlled ride with improved handling, the front forks contain a Showa "Dual Bending Valve" (SDBV),[15] a cartridge simulator using two valves to control compression and rebound damping, giving linear damping characteristics proportional to fork stroke speed. Harley-Davidson claims the 2018 chassis is stiffer and lighter than earlier Softail and Dyna platforms.[16] Further upgrades include an LED headlight and 18-inch “Lakester” rims, with wider 160mm front and 240mm rear rubber.[17][18]


Media appearances

The Fat Boy gained mainstream visibility via the _Terminator 2_ and _Terminator: Genisys_ films. The motorcycle used in _Terminator 2_ is displayed at the Harley-Davidson Museum.[19] [20][21] A Fat Boy has also appeared in _Sons of Anarchy_, _Wild Hogs_ and CSI: Miami''[22][23][24]
