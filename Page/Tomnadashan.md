Tomnadashan_Copper_Mine_-_geograph.org.uk_-_28792.jpg TOMNADASHAN was a hamlet southwest of Ardtalnaig in Scotland. John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane tried to mine copper, gold and sulphur there in the 19th century but was unsuccessful.[1][2] The copper mine is best known as the filming location for the Cave of Caerbannog scene in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.

It seems silver may also have been mined at this site. The 1851 census record shows a Cornishman Benjamin Gribble and family staying at Tomnadashan with his occupation being described as a mining agent for silver and copper. His son's occupation was described as being a copper miner. The fact that Benjamin Gribble was noted as a mining agent for silver and copper might just be his title, however given that silver is often associated with copper in the west country, it suggests it was present at Tomnashadan as well.
