[1] was the 54th emperor of Japan,[2] according to the traditional order of succession.[3] Ninmyō's reign lasted from 833 to 850.[4]


Traditional narrative

Ninmyō was the second son of Emperor Saga and the Empress Tachibana no Kachiko. His personal name (_imina_) was .[5] After his death, he was given the title .

Ninmyō had nine Empresses, Imperial consorts, and concubines (_kōi_); and the emperor had 24 Imperial sons and daughters.[6]

Emperor Ninmyō is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Ninmyō's mausoleum.[7]

Events of Ninmyō's life

Ninmyō ascended to the throne following the abdication of his uncle, Emperor Junna.

-   6 JANUARY 823[8] (): Received the title of Crown Prince at the age of 14.
-   22 MARCH 833 (): In the 10th year of Emperor Junna's reign, the emperor abdicated; and the succession (_senso_) was received by his adopted son. Masara_-shinnō_ was the natural son of Emperor Saga, and therefore would have been Junna's nephew.[9] Shortly thereafter, Emperor Ninmyo is said to have acceded to the throne (_sokui_).[10]

Shortly after Ninmyo was enthroned, he designated an heir. He named as Prince Tsunesada, a son of former Emperor Junna, as the crown prince.[11]

-   835 (): Kūkai (known posthumously as Kōbō-Daishi) died. This monk, scholar, poet, and artist had been the founder of the Shingon or "True Word" school of Buddhism.[12]
-   838-839 (_Jōwa 5-6_): Diplomatic mission to Tang China headed by Fujiwara no Tsunetsugu.[13]
-   842: Following a coup d'état called the Jōwa Incident, Tsunesada the crown prince was replaced with Ninmyō's first son, Prince Michiyasu (later Emperor Montoku) whose mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Junshi, a daughter of _sadaijin_ Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu. It is supposed that this was the result of political intrigue planned by Ninmyō and Fujiwara no Yoshifusa.[14] The first of what would become a powerful line of Fujiwara regents,[15] Yoshifusa had numerous family ties to the imperial court; he was Ninmyō's brother in law (by virtue of his sister who became Ninmyō's consort), the second son of _sadaijin_ Fuyutsugu, and uncle to the new crown prince.[16]

In his lifetime, Ninmyō could not have anticipated that his third son, Prince Tokiyasu, would eventually ascend the throne in 884 as Emperor Kōkō.[17]

-   6 MAY 850 (''): Emperor Ninmyō died at the age of 41.[18][19] He was sometimes posthumously referred to as "the Emperor of Fukakusa", because that was the name given to his tomb.[20]
