is a platform game by Taito, first released in arcades in 1986[1] and later ported to home systems.[2] The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob, tasks players with travelling through one hundred stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, jumping on and off blown bubbles to navigate level obstacles, dodging and eliminating enemies, and collecting a variety of items including some that carry power-ups and significant bonuses.[3] For example, the red shoe allows Bub and Bob to move faster, while wrapped candies cause Bub and Bob to blow bubbles faster, and blow bubbles at greater distances. Other items, such as umbrellas, allow to skip numerous levels, moving closer to the final level.[4] The game became popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from the Cave of Monsters. The game has multiple endings, which depend on the player's performance and discovery of secrets.[5]

The creator of _Bubble Bobble_, Fukio Mitsuji (MTJ), went on to create other games such as _Rainbow Islands_, _Syvalion_ and _Volfied_. He died on December 11, 2008.[6]


Gameplay

In the game's plot, "Baron Von Blubba" has kidnapped the brothers Bubby and Bobby's girlfriends and turned the brothers into Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. Bub and Bob have to finish 100 levels in the Cave of Monsters in order to rescue them.[7]

In the game, each player controls one of the two dragons. Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.[8] Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form EXTEND, he/she earns a bonus life and both players immediately advance to the next level.

A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles). Enemies turn "angry"—turning pink in color and moving faster—if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.

In the 100th and final level, players face a boss.[9][10][11] This game was one of the first to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: "Come here with your friend." If two players complete the game, they see a "Happy End," in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult "Super" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second "Happy End" is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence. The brothers return to normal and are reunited with their parents and girlfriends.[12]


Reception

_Mean Machines_ gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge".[13] The four reviewers of _Electronic Gaming Monthly_ stated that the Game Gear version is a faithful conversion of the original which works well in portable form. They particularly praised the simplicity of the gameplay concept and the graphics, and the two-player link option.[14]

The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the _Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time_.[15] _GamesRadar_ ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings.[16]


Legacy

Ports

.]] The popularity of _Bubble Bobble_ led Taito (or its licensees) to port the game to many home systems. Ports of the game were released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST, MSX2, Amstrad CPC, X68000, MS-DOS, Apple II, FM Towns Marty, Master System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Saturn, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Gear, mobile phone (Sprint PCS) and UltraCade's Taito Arcade Classics.

Of the original 8- and 16-bit ports, the MSX2, NES/Famicom Disk System, Game Boy and Master System ones were made by Taito itself (though the Master System version was published by Sega instead of Taito). The Game Gear port (which emulates the Master System version of _Bubble Bobble_) was done by South Korean developer Open Corporation. The Commodore 64, Spectrum and Amiga versions were developed by Software Creations and published in the UK by Firebird Software. Most of the other computer ports were made by US-based Novalogic with the exception of the X68000 game in Japan that was done by Dempa Shinbunsha. The Game Boy Color version was co-created by the video game developers Dreams and I.T.L.

Commodore 64 coder Steve Ruddy recalled in Retro Gamer:

The Master System/Game Gear version is noted for having two hundred levels (in effect the normal and super modes consecutively) and is considered one of the best conversions available.[17] This version was originally released as _Final Bubble Bobble_ in 1988 for the Master System in Japan. When it arrived in Europe three years later, the title was shortened to _Bubble Bobble_. The game was never released for the Master System in North America (the Game Gear being instead the platform in that region for this particular version of _Bubble Bobble_).

The MSX2 port, like Master System/Game Gear version, features one hundred levels in normal mode and another set of hundred for the super mode.[18] Unlike the Master System/Game Gear version, the super mode in the MSX2 game is an alternative to the normal mode rather than succeeding it, and can only be accessed by entering a special code (similar to the Konami Code) on the 1 or 2 player select screen.

The X68000 version of _Bubble Bobble_ includes a secret "Sybubblun" mode, which contains 20 very difficult levels with the characters changed to those from _Syvalion_, another game designed by Fukio Mitsuji.[19]

In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code.[20] As Probe Entertainment was in charge of the home conversions, Taito sent them a _Bubble Bobble_ arcade PCB so they could play the original game and reproduce its mechanics. This led to the release of _Bubble Bobble also featuring Rainbow Islands_ for Saturn, PlayStation and PC in 1996, published by Acclaim Entertainment.

In the Game Boy and Game Boy Color versions, since the Game Boy is in its nature a single player device, the storyline involves Bub looking for "Moon Water" to cure his brother. They are known as _Bubble Bobble_ and _Classic Bubble Bobble_ respectively.[21]

In October 2005, a version was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC as part of the _Taito Legends_ compilation of classic arcade games.

At the end of 2006, a new port for mobile phones in Europe and Japan was released.

On December 24, 2007, the NES version of _Bubble Bobble_ was released in North America on Nintendo's Virtual Console service for the Wii.[22] It costs 500 Wii Points, the equivalent of US$5. The Famicom version of _Bubble Bobble_ was also released for the Nintendo eShop on October 16, 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS and on January 29, 2014 for the Wii U.[23][24]

On November 11, 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the NES Classic Edition (known as the Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).[25]

Clones

The arcade version of _Bubble Bobble_ was widely bootlegged in its day, but due to a security chip installed by Taito (known as the PS4, based on a Motorola 6800) none of the bootlegs played exactly like the original. Through a technique called "decapping", the MAMEDEV team has been able to reverse engineer the workings of the chip and emulate it perfectly.[27] Following that, project Bubble Bobble REDUX has been able to implement an exact version of _Bubble Bobble_ on bootleg boards.[28]

A version also exists for the BBC Micro in the public domain though never officially released. According to one of the creators it was coded by them independently in 1988 as a clone of the C64 version, but when they approached publishers it was deemed that it would not be financially viable to release a licensed product for the BBC Micro at that time.[29]

In 2002 a homebrew version for the Texas Instruments TI-8x series of calculators was released. [30]

The _Bubble Bobble: Lost Cave_ fan project added new levels that runs on the original arcade hardware.[31]


Other media

The _Bubble Bobble_ characters have made cameo appearances in the manga _Gamest Nª49: Gasmest Island Mokushiroku_[32] on October 1992 created by Shinseisha. Bub, from _Bubble Bobble_ and Chack, from _Chack'n'Pop_, appeared in the manga [33] on May 2009. _Bubble Bobble_ was featured in Episode 4, Season 3 of Black Mirror, "San Junipero" as a video game played by Yorkie in 1987 at the Tucker club. Bubblun from Bubble Bobble makes cameo in the manga _High Score Girl_ by Rensuke Oshikiri, Published by Gangan Comics, on 2010.
