The DANUBE ARENA[1] (in Hungarian: _Duna Aréna_, unofficially _Dagály Budapest Aquatics Complex_) is an aquatics complex located in Budapest, Hungary. It was planned by Marcell Ferenc and built between 2015 and 2017. The facility has two full course swimming pools, a diving pool and a short course training pool.

DunaArenaFotoThalerTamas.jpg The venue had been planned to be the home of the World Aquatics Championships in 2021 but after the original host of the 2017 venue, Guadalajara withdrew in February 2015, it was announced that Budapest would host the 2017 Championships.[2] After that, the building was re-planned, because the building was too small to be a venue of the 2024 Summer Olympics, and also because of the earlier deadline.

The venue has 5,000 seats, with an additional 8,000 temporary seats for the 2017 Aquatics Championships. These will be dismantled afterwards.
