WAT PA DAENG (, literally "red forest temple") is a Buddhist temple located in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Wat Pa Daeng historically served as the center for the Araññavasi forest-dwelling monks, who established a new sect at this monastery.[1][2] The temple is near Wat Umong.

The temple's main chedi incorporates both Mon Haripunjaya and Sinhalese styles.[3] The ubosot was built by King Tilokaraj in 1452, but the temple's foundation was laid by his mother in 1447.[4] Tilokaraj's parents were cremated at this temple.[5]
