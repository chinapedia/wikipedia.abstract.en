The CLE CANISTER was a standardized cylindrical container used by the British during World War 2 to airdrop supplies to troops on the ground. The name initially derived from the Central Landing Establishment that developed them, although this was later backronymed to _Container Light Equipment_.[1]

Initially, the canisters were of wood and metal construction. The Mark 1 canister weighted around empty and when filled. It was cylindrical, long and in diameter. The Mark 1T canister was similar except it was of metal construction and slightly heavier, weighing empty and again when filled. The Mark III canister was similar, but slightly longer .[2]

One end of the canister carried a parachute pack. The parachute was deployed by a static line, which opened a pilot parachute, which in turn opened the main canopy. The other end of the canister was fitted with a pan-like structure that cushioned the impact of landing.[3] The canisters' attachment system allowed them to be carried from the bomb-racks of bomber aircraft.[4]


Use and deployment

The canisters could contain food, ammunition, weapons or other equipment - the Mark 1 canister could carry 12 rifles and 1000 rounds of ammunition.[5] A cylindrical fuel can was also developed to fit the CLE Canister, with a canister able to accommodate three of the cans.[6] Some loads, such as radios, weren't dropped in CLE Canisters and required special containers to carry and protect them.[7]

Prepacked canisters were allocated code numbers according to their load; a unit requiring resupply simply had to communicate the code and the number of canisters required. The type of load was indicated by the colour of the parachute, although the colours used were periodically changed to confuse the enemy.[8] During Operation Market Garden, for example, the colours used were red for ammunition, green for rations, white for medical supplies, blue for fuel and yellow for communication equipment. [9]

As well as World War II, the canisters saw use in Operation Musketeer - the 1956 Anglo-French invasion of the Suez Canal zone.[10]
