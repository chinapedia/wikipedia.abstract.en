Club career

Born in Stoke on Trent and raised in the Chesterton[1] area of Newcastle under Lyme, Ramsdale joined Sheffield United in 2013.[2] After graduating from Sheffield United's youth academy,[3] Ramsdale signed a scholarship with the club in May 2014.[4] Ramsdale appeared twice as an unused substitute during the 2015–16 season against Coventry City and Scunthorpe United.[5] In May 2016, he signed his first professional contract with the club.[6]

Ramsdale made his professional début starting in a 6–0 home victory over Leyton Orient in the FA Cup, keeping a clean-sheet in the process.[7] He also made another appearance in the FA Cup against Bolton Wanderers but lost 3–2.[8]

AFC Bournemouth

On 31 January 2017, he was signed by Premier League club AFC Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £800,000.[9] However, the move was reported to cost £1 million.[10]

Ramsdale was on the bench for the final game of the 2016–17 season against Leicester City.[11]

Chesterfield (loan)

In the January transfer window, Ramsdale was loaned out to Chesterfield for the rest of the 2017–18 season.[12]

Ramsdale made his Chesterfield debut against Accrington Stanley on 6 January 2018, but scored an own goal after he _"allowed a seemingly harmless Jackson strike from the right to squirm into the net"_, in a 4–0 loss.[13] In a follow-up match against Luton Town on 13 January 2018, he kept a clean sheet, in a 2–0 win.[14]

AFC Wimbledon (loan)

On 4 January 2019, Ramsdale joined AFC Wimbledon on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.[15] The next day, Ramsdale made his debut for the Dons in a 3–2 Third Round FA Cup victory over Fleetwood Town at Highbury Stadium.[16] His league debut came a week later in a 1–1 draw with Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena.[17] He won the club's Young Player of the Season Award[18] for his performances in goal, as Wimbledon achieved survival in League One despite being 10 points from safety in February.[19]
