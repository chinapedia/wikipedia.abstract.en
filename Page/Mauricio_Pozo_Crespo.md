Ministerial post

Mauricio Pozo was appointed Minister of Economy and Finance of Ecuador in January 2003, when Lucio Gutiérrez became president.[11] Pozo was described as an "orthodox economist"[12] who advocated dollarization of the national currency.[13] He maintained a policy of using much of the country's oil revenues to repay debt[14] and sought new loans from the IMF.[15][16] He resigned his post on 1 June 2004, for reasons not clarified at the time.[17][18] The austerity policies adopted by Pozo and Gutierrez were criticized by representatives of Indigenous people for their impact on poverty, but government supporters linked these policies to a 3.5% growth rate in 2003 and an inflation rate below 3%.[19]
