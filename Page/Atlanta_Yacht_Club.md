The ATLANTA YACHT CLUB is a private yacht club located in Acworth, Georgia (United States), on the southwest shore of Lake Allatoona.


History

In the spring of 1950, the Allatoona Reservoir was completed in the valley of the Etowah River east of Cartersville, and a group of sailing enthusiasts determined to organize a sailing club. On June 14 provisional officers were appointed for the purpose of incorporation, and on July 19, 1950, the Atlanta Yacht Club charter was received from the State of Georgia.[1]

One-Design racing began with a Penguin fleet the first season. The second season brought out five more organized fleets: Snipes, Thistles, Y-Flyers, a handicap fleet and a power boat fleet. Lasers and Optimists are the latest incorporations.[2]


Fleets and regattas

Current fleets at the club and their major regattas are:

-   Y-Flyer fleet 1, Beers Regatta.[3]
-   Thistle fleet 48, Dixie Regatta.[4]
-   Snipe fleet 330, Halloween Regatta.[5]


Notable Sailors

Ted Turner[6] and Tarasa Davis[7] are among Atlanta Yacht Club's most famous sailors.
