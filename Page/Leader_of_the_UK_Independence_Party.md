The LEADER OF THE UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY is the most senior member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a political party founded on 3 September 1993. The party's first leader was its founder, the historian Alan Sked, who resigned in May 1997. Its longest-serving leader was Nigel Farage, from September 2006 to November 2009 and again from November 2010 to September 2016.

The party currently has an interim leader, Piers Wauchope, elected by the party's National Executive Committee on 11 June 2019 after Gerard Batten's leadership term ended on 2 June.

After an Emergency General Meeting and membership ballot on whether incumbent leader Henry Bolton should be replaced, Batten became interim leader on 17 February 2018.[1] On 14 April 2018, Batten was elected unopposed as the leader of UKIP.[2]


Role

All registered political parties in the United Kingdom require a leader, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. According to Part VII of the UK Independence Party constitution, the party leader is voted for by postal ballot by all paid-up party members "in good standing". The winner is the candidate with the simple majority of votes cast. If there is only one valid candidate for the position, they are elected without the need for a ballot.[3]

While the default term length is four years, the leader can obtain an extension of up to a year if there is an imminent General or European Parliament election; this must be approved by at least two-thirds of the 12-person National Executive Committee (NEC).[4]

If at least nine NEC members endorse a vote of no confidence in the leader, an Emergency General Meeting (EGM) will be called.[5] When the leadership becomes vacant unexpectedly, the NEC has fourteen days to name an interim leader who exercises all leadership functions until the next leadership election.[6]

The leader has the power to name a Deputy Leader of their own choice and assign them whatever duty they choose.[7]


History

Nigel_Farage_of_UKIP.jpg led UKIP from 2006 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2016]] Eurosceptic historian Alan Sked founded the UK Independence Party on 3 September 1993, having established the Anti-Federalist League organisation two years earlier. He resigned after the 1997 general election and was replaced by Michael Holmes, who became one of its first three Members of the European Parliament in the 1999 election. He was voted out by the party's National Executive Committee in January 2000 after the party split into two camps, one backing him and the other supporting chairman Nigel Farage, also an MEP.[8] Jeffrey Titford was succeeded in October 2002 by Roger Knapman, a former Conservative whip. Under his leadership, UKIP took 16.2% of the votes and 12 seats at the 2004 European Parliament elections, and he chose not to run for a second term in 2006.[9]

The ensuing leadership election resulted in Farage winning the post; he pledged to expand UKIP from a single-issue party into one that would fill the "enormous vacuum in British politics" by picking up votes from former Conservatives.[10] In late 2009, he resigned in order to concentrate on winning the House of Commons seat of Buckingham from the Speaker, John Bercow.[11] Malcolm Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch was subsequently elected leader; he resigned within a year and Farage was re-elected with 60% of votes cast.[12] Under Farage, UKIP had its greatest success in 2014 when it won the most votes and seats in the European Parliament election, the first party outside Labour and the Conservatives to do so in a national election since the Liberal Party in the December 1910 general election.[13]

Since the British public voted to leave the European Union in the June 2016 referendum, UKIP's vote share has declined and the party has had frequent changes in leadership.[14][15][16][17][18] Sked, Holmes, Farage, James, Nuttall, Crowther and Bolton have all since left the party.
