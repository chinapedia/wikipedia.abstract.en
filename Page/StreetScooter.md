delivery van (2016)]] StreetScooter_C16.jpg STREETSCOOTER GmbH is an electric vehicle manufacturer located in Aachen, Germany. The company has been owned by Deutsche Post DHL Group since 2014.[1]


History

In June 2010, Achim Kampker, together with Günther Schuh, founded Street Scooter GmbH; (in August 2014, it was renamed StreetScooter GmbH). This was a privately organized research initiative at the RWTH Aachen University which later became an independent company in Aachen.[2] Kampker was also the founder and chairman of the European Network for Affordable and Sustainable Electromobility. In May 2014, the company announced that the city of Aachen, the city council Aachen and the savings bank Aachen had ordered electric vehicles from the company.

In December 2014, approximately 70 employees were manufacturing 200 vehicles annually in the premises of the Waggonfabrik Talbot, the former Talbot/Bombardier plant in Aachen.[3] At that time, Deutsche Post DHL Group purchased the StreetScooter company, which became its wholly owned subsidiary.[4]

The company made an announcement in April 2016 of its intention to begin larger scale production of the StreetScooter Work model with 2,000 to be produced by the end of that year. In future, electric vans with a much greater range will be required to achieve the goal of replacing the entire Deutsche Post and DHL Express fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles with electric StreetScooters.[5]

Mass production

In April 2016, Deutsche Post DHL Group announced that StreetScooter GmbH would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 of the Work vehicles annually, starting in 2017.[6]

Deutsche Post's 2016 annual report indicates that it plans to replace its fleet of delivery vehicles in Germany with the electric StreetScooter products "in the medium term".[7] Electric vans and trucks with a much greater range will be required to achieve the very long term goal of replacing the Group's entire fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles with electric StreetScooter vehicles.[8]

Some of the Deutsche Post vans to be replaced by StreetScooters are the Volkswagen Caddy models. StreetScooter showed a larger prototype, the Work L, in September 2016. The Company also announced that it was developing a Work Orange model with an "electro-hydraulic three-way dumper" for use by businesses that deal in trash or construction material handling.[9]

In October 2017 Streetscooter announced to build a second factory in Düren with a production capability of up to 10,000 vehicles per year. Operations are expected to begin in the second quarter 2018. [10] In 2018, Deutsche Post was awarded a contract to supply 200 electric trucks to the UK delivery service Milk & More.[11]

Basic work model

This vehicle is equipped with lithium-ion battery packs and is powered by 30 kW permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor. The peak/continuous output is stated as 48 kW/38 kW. The range (before the need to recharge) is said to be 50 to 80 km, depending on the weight of the load and traffic conditions. The load capacity is 710 kg.[12] The van's maximum speed is 80 or 85 km/h (about 50 mp/h). Internal volume (for cargo) is four cubic meters and the weight load is 650 kg. The body structure is made of steel and the exterior panels are made of structural plastics.[13]

Work L and Work Orange

Shown in September 2016 at the IAA Commercial Vehicles trade fair, the Work L prototype is a larger vehicle with double the cargo capacity and a load capacity of 1,000 kg. The range (before recharging is necessary) is estimated at "up to 100 km".[14]

Smaller models

StreetScooter has received a research and development contract for pedelectric bicycles and tricycles,[15] single-seaters or convertibles from Swiss Post. The prototype of the Work S bike can carry loads up to 60 kg, while the Work M trike has a payload of 90 kg.[16]
