WRAITH GAMES, originally known as MIND'S EYE GAMES,[1] is a video game developer based in Hamilton, Ohio. Founded in March 2005 by Jay Kidd, the company is known for creating the puzzle game _Collapsus_.

In 2009, Wraith Games was added to GamePro Magazine's _GamePro Labs_ video game publishing arm[2] for their game _Physix_.[3][4] As of 2016, _Physix_ has yet to be released, though as of 2015, Wraith Games has announced that the game is still in active development, although with a shifted focus toward virtual reality.[5]

The company made its first full release, the Kongregate exclusive _FlyGuy_ in December 2011. In April 2012, the company announced that _FlyGuy_ would be released on iOS and Android OS although, as of 2016, this release has yet to surface.

In 2015, their third game, _Collapsus_, was nominated for SlideDB (part of Indie DB)'s "App of the Year" awards making it into the Top 50.[6][7] In 2016, Collapsus would go on to reach 4th place in the award's "Top Upcoming" category.[8]

It was first shown to the public when Wraith Games attended the Ohio Game Development Expo in 2015.[9] When they returned in 2016, site CLE Tech named _Collapsus_ as one of their "Top Picks" for the show.[10] _Collapsus_ was also showcased at Game Masters (exhibition) when it arrived at COSI Columbus in June 2016.[11]

_Collapsus_ is notable for its unique resource management mechanic where "breaks" are lost by making clicks and regained by creating columns or rows of four or more same colored blocks;[12][13] as well as for the player's ability to rotate the device, controlling the way the blocks on screen fall.[14][15]

According to The AbleGamers Foundation, _Collapsus_ has "some of the fundamental building blocks of accessibility".[16] The game is fully colorblind accessible, featuring different modes to cater to different types of colorblindness and can even be played in full black and white.[17] As of 2016, Wraith Games has begun giving talks on the subject of accessibility in video games.[18]

In 2016, Wraith Games contributed to the Kentucky Fried Pixels game jam and game bundle with their game, _Radarkanoid_, along with 19 other developers. 50% of the profits went to Louisville Makes Games, a 501(c) organization dedicated to promoting game development as a career option in the Kentucky region.[19]
