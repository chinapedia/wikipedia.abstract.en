Plot

A nightmare of vice and corruption stretching to the very heart of the Police force to the Cabinet. Tank (Ray Winstone) is an investigative reporter and jailbird, framed on scant evidence supplied by the London mob. Helen (Amanda Donohoe) is the sensuous call-girl who offers Tank ammunition and retribution. But, retaliation is swift and brutal, in the guise of Sir Robert Knight (Peter Wyngarde) and his equally lethal lawyer, Dunboyne (Jason Connery). A series of hideous murders follow as the devil protects his own.
