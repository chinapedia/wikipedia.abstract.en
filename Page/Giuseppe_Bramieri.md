Little is known of his biography. His opus is limited to three signed works:

-   _Madonna and Two Saints_, in Santi Severino e Sossio, Naples
-   _Martyrdom of St Lawrence_ in San Francesco, Piacenza[1]

His works appear stiff, and influenced by Gian Paolo Lomazzo, Michelangelo or Denis Calvaert.[2]
