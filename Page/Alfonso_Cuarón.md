He has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won five, including two Best Director awards for _Gravity_ (2013) and _Roma_ (2018). He is the first Latin American director to receive the award for Best Director. He has also received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing for _Gravity_ and Best Cinematography for _Roma_. Cuarón's other notable films include the family drama _A Little Princess_ (1995), the erotic drama _Y Tu Mamá También_ (2001), the fantasy film _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ (2004), and the dystopian thriller _Children of Men_ (2006).


Early life

Alfonso Cuarón Orozco was born in Mexico City on 28 November 1961, the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a doctor specializing in nuclear medicine, and Cristina Orozco, a pharmaceutical biochemist.[2] He has two brothers, Carlos, also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist. Cuarón studied philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos), a school within the same university. There, he met the director Carlos Marcovich and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, and they made what would be his first short film, _Vengeance Is Mine_.


Career

Early career

Cuarón began working on television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including _La Gran Fiesta_, _Gaby: A True Story_ and _Romero_, and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.

_Sólo con Tu Pareja_

_Sólo con Tu Pareja_ is a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by Daniel Giménez Cacho) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted AIDS. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán.

The film, which also starred cabaret singer Astrid Hadad and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director Sydney Pollack hired Cuarón to direct an episode of _Fallen Angels_, a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included Steven Soderbergh, Jonathan Kaplan, Peter Bogdanovich and Tom Hanks.

American debut, _Y Tu Mamá También_ and international success

In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, _A Little Princess_, an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of Charles Dickens's _Great Expectations_ starring Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro.

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film _Y Tu Mamá También_, starring Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verdú. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother Carlos Cuarón.

In 2004, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful _Harry Potter_ series, _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_. Cuarón faced criticism from some _Harry Potter_ fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author J. K. Rowling, who had seen and loved Cuarón's film _Y Tu Mamá También_, said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.[3] Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking its new tone and for being the first _Harry Potter_ film to truly capture the essence of the novels.[4]

Cuarón's feature _Children of Men_, an adaptation of the P. D. James novel starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, received wide critical acclaim, including three Academy Award nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in Best Film Editing (with Alex Rodríguez) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj (_Esperanto Films_, named because of his support for the international language Esperanto[5]), which has credits in the films _Duck Season_, _Pan's Labyrinth_, and _Gravity_.

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for Autism Speaks that was criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.[6]

Awards recognition

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film _Gravity_, a drama set in space. He was joined by producer David Heyman, with whom Cuarón worked on _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_. Starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the film was released in the fall of 2013[7] and opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August. On 12 January 2014, Alfonso accepted the Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Director. The film received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. Cuarón won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award,[8] while he and Mark Sanger received the award for Best Film Editing.[9]

In 2013, Cuarón created _Believe_, a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that was broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry. The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television. In 2014, _TIME_ placed him in its list of "100 Most Influential People in the World" – Pioneers.[10]

In May 2015, Cuarón was announced as the President of the Jury for the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.[11]

Production began in fall 2016 for Cuarón's eighth film, _Roma_, a semi-autobiographical tale of a housekeeper for a middle class Mexican family in 1970s Mexico City. The project was produced by Cuarón, Gabriela Rodríguez and Nicolás Celis. The film debuted at 75th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion,[12] and was distributed to select theaters in Mexico and United States before its online release on Netflix. _Roma_ was highly acclaimed upon release; among its accolades are two Golden Globes (Best Foreign Language Film and Best Director for Cuarón) and three Academy Awards (Best Director, Best Foreign Language Film, and Best Cinematography for Cuarón) out of a leading ten nominations.


Personal life

Cuarón is a vegetarian[13][14] and has been living in London since 2000.[15]

Cuarón's first marriage was to Mariana Elizondo, with whom he has a son, Jonás Cuarón, born in 1981, who is also a film director, known for _Year of the Nail_ and _Desierto_.[16] His second marriage, from 2001 to 2008, was to Italian actress and freelance journalist Annalisa Bugliani, with whom he has two children.[17]

He has publicly shown his fascination for the Esperanto language and his support for the Esperanto movement[18]. In fact, he called his production company _Esperanto Filmoj_.
