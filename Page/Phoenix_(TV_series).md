_PHOENIX_ is an Australian police drama television series. Phoenix screened as two thirteen-part series on Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1992 and 1993.

At the APRA Music Awards of 1993, the soundtrack won Television or Film Theme of the Year.[1]

The first series of _Phoenix_ in 1992 recounted the investigation of the bombing of the Victorian state police headquarters, loosely based on a real case in the mid-1980s, the Russell Street Bombing. It was aided by extensive research into police techniques and was lauded as one of the most realistic depictions of police investigation techniques, including both surveillance and forensics, as well as having an involving storyline.

The series was notable for its dark visual tone and for its no-holds-barred attitude to violence and language.

It spawned a second thirteen-part series, _Phoenix II_, in 1993 as well as a spin-off series, _Janus_, in 1994 devoted to the machinations of court cases.

The series was created by Alison Nisselle and Tony McDonald and produced by Bill Hughes and screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The ABC have released Series 1 and 2 on DVD (Region 4) as a 4 DVD box set.
