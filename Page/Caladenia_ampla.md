_CALADENIA AMPLA_, commonly known as the DAINTY SPIDER ORCHID,[1] is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single flower which is sometimes yellowish-green flower with red stripes and sometimes entirely red.


Description

_Caladenia ampla_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide.[2]

A single flower (rarely two) is borne on a spike up to high. The dorsal sepal is erect, oblong to lance-shaped, long and about wide. It tapers near the end which terminates in a glandular structure long. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance-shaped, long, wide and end in a gland similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, wide and taper to a point. The labellum is a broad egg-shape, curves forward, long and wide when flattened. The labellum is cream-coloured with red veins and a dark red tip, sometimes entirely red. There are 9 to 12 pairs of calli along the edge of the labellum, decreasing in length towards its front. There are four rows of foot-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum, also smaller towards the tip. Flowering occurs in September and October.[3]Caladenia_ampla_(labelled).jpg


Taxonomy and naming

The species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name _Arachnorchis ampla_.[4][5] The description was published in _Australian Orchid Research_. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to _Caladenia ampla_ and the change was published in "The Victorian Naturalist".[6] The specific epithet (ampla) is a Latin word meaning "large",[7] referring to the unusually broad labellum of this orchid.[8]
