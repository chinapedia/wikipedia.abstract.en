ARTHUR HONEYMAN (May 10, 1940 â€“ December 8, 2008), also known as ART HONEYMAN, was a poet, author, and disability rights activist.[1][2][3] His book _Sam and his Cart_ was adapted into a movie in 1981.[4] [5] Honeyman is one of the main characters in the 2007 film _Music Within_.[6]


Early life

Honeyman was born to Elizabeth and Charles Honeyman, and was raised with three siblings in Sharon, Massachusetts. Because he had cerebral palsy Honeyman was not allowed to attend a public school. His parents kept requesting education for their son, and beginning in 1947 he was provided with a tutor for homeschooling. From 1952 until his high school graduation in 1959, Honeyman attended Massachusetts Hospital School, a school for disabled students.[7]

His mother developed schizophrenia and was committed to a care facility. Honeyman's father moved with his children to Reno, Nevada, and then to Portland, Oregon.[8]


Career

Wheelchair user Honeyman worked in house-to-house selling from age 19 for four years. People behaved rudely, complained, or even called the police.[9]

He had difficulties being accepted by a college as an undergraduate.[10][11]

In the 1960s, Honeyman experienced communal living in an urban commune and as a co-owner of a communal farm in Oregon. He participated in anti-Vietnam War and civil rights activism. He also burned his draft card, and was arrested three times as protester against the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Rainier, Oregon. As a protest action against the lack of wheelchair access on busses, he pushed his wheelchair from Portland to Salem.[12][13]

Honeyman achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in History in 1965, and a Master's degree in Literature from Portland State University in 1974.[14][15]

At the university, Honeyman met disability rights advocate Richard Pimentel, who often describes a situation in a pancake house where Honeyman was denied services as a key moment for his own activism.[16] Honeyman's positive attitude inspired Pimentel.[17]

At age 20, Honeyman had begun writing. Beginning in 1974, he published multiple poems and essays. His first book was the children's story _Sam and his Cart_, published in 1977: Sam drives in a wheelchair-like cart and sells light bulbs from door to door for living. He is confronted with tragic reactions by others.[18][19]

From 1975 to 1978 Art Honeyman worked as a teaching aide at Adams High School (Portland, Oregon), from 1979 as a research analyst for the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, serving on the Commission for the Handicapped board in 1983 and 1984.[20] He became director of Oregon's Handicap Research Project.[21]

Art Honeyman campaigned for a school board seat in Portland, and twice on a "Spastic Power" platform for the Oregon Legislative Assembly.[22][23]

A variety of publications followed until 2005. Honeyman also wrote manuscripts of his autobiography from about 2005 to 2008. They remain unfinished. He passed away in December 2008.[24]


Film adaptations

The movie _Sam and his Cart_, based on Honeyman's first book, was published in 1981.[25] The film won an American Film Festival Award.[26]

In 2007, Warner Brothers released the full-length motion picture _Music Within_ of Richard Pimentel's life story including his friendship with Arthur Honeyman, starring Michael Sheen as Art.[27][28][29]


Death

Honeyman died on December 8, 2008 in Seattle, Washington, while visiting friends.[30]
