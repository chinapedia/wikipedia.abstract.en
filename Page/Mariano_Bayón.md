MARIANO BAYÓN ÁLVAREZ (born September 25, 1942) is a Spanish architect.


Life and career

Born in Madrid, Spain, Mariano Bayón graduated from the Superior Technical School of Architecture of Madrid (ETSAM) in 1968. Some of his major works are the Red Eléctrica de España building in Seville (1992),_a sheet of white marble which draws out a rectangular space, thin and tense like a light bulb during the night; solid and weighty during the day_,[1] the Public Library in Villaverde, Madrid (1996) and the extension to the twelfth century Cistercian Poblet Monastery in Tarragona (2011).[2]

Bayon's most recent works are the Office building for the Spain's General Management of Assets in Madrid (2015) and the new Spanish Civil Guard Officers Academy in Aranjuez (2016).

From 1975 to 2008, Bayón was Professor of Architectural Design Projects at Madrid's School of Architecture (ETSAM). He is the author of many essays on contemporary architecture and historical criticism, including confirmations of his design proposals or parallel illustrations to his design activity.[3] He has organized and curated several exhibitions on twentieth century architecture[4] and has participated in monographic and collective exhibitions.

Bayón has given lectures and presentations of his work in major European cultural and academic centers[5] as well as in the United States and Brazil.
