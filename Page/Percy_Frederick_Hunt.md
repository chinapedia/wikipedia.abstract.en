Captain PERCY FREDERICK HUNT (28 May 1873 – 6 August 1901) was a British army officer who was killed during the Second Boer War. He is best known for his relationship with Breaker Morant.

Hunt was engaged to a woman whose sister was engaged to Morant. The two men served together in the Bushveldt Carbineers. Hunt's death at the hands of the Boers reportedly inspired a revenge killing from Morant which led to the latter's execution.[1][2][3][4]

In the film _Breaker Morant_, Hunt was played by Terence Donovan, although he was renamed Simon Hunt.
