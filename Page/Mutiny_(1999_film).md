Reception

The Movie Scene gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that the story behind the film needs to be told, but that "an 89 minute TV movie is not the way to do it justice". He found the atmosphere lacking and the minor characters distracting from the main plot line.[1] Diane Selkirk for Apollo Movie Guide gave the film a score of 70/100, writing that "the movie does flow well and the story comes across clearly, but it just seems weaker than you'd expect." She questioned the decision to not base any of the film's characters on actual people. She echoed The Movie Scene's sentiment that a documentary or theatrical film would be a better format to tell the story of the Port Chicago disaster.[2]

The film was nominated for the Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries or a Movie Emmy at the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards.[3]
