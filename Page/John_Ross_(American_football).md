JOHN ELLIS ROSS III (born November 27, 1994)[1] is an American football wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Washington, and was drafted by the Bengals ninth overall in the 2017 NFL Draft.


Early years

Ross attended Jordan High School in Long Beach, California. He played wide receiver and cornerback in football and ran track. As a senior, Ross finished third in the 100 metres at the 2013 CIF Southern Section Division 1 final, with a time of 10.66 seconds. He also recorded a time of 21.56 seconds in the 200m.[2]

Regarded as a four-star recruit by ESPN, Ross was ranked as the No. 49 overall prospect in the state of California.[3] He committed to the University of Washington to play college football.[4]


College career

Ross played in all 13 games as a true freshman at Washington in 2013. He finished the year with 16 receptions for 208 yards and one touchdown as a receiver and had 720 kick return yards and a touchdown.[5] In 2014, he played in 13 of 14 games, with seven starts as a receiver and four as a cornerback. That season, he had 17 receptions for 371 yards and four touchdowns as a receiver, 12 tackles and an interception as a cornerback, and had 938 return yards and two touchdowns.[6][7] Ross missed the 2015 season after suffering a torn ACL during spring practices.[8] Ross returned from the injury in 2016 and had five receptions for 90 yards with two receiving touchdowns and a kick return touchdown in his first game back against Rutgers.[9][10][11] On January 3, 2017, Ross announced his decision to forego his senior season and enter the NFL Draft.[12] On February 10, 2017, it was revealed that Ross was diagnosed with a torn labrum in his shoulder. He injured his shoulder earlier during the 2016 season, and re-aggravated it on December 31 in a loss against Alabama in the 2016 Peach Bowl in the College Football Playoff. The injury required surgery, but Ross decided to put it on hold until after the NFL Scouting Combine and pro day workouts.[13]

Professional career

Coming out of college, Ross was predicted to be selected in the first round by draft experts and analysts. He was considered one of the top wide receivers and was ranked the second best by NFL analyst Bucky Brooks before the combine.[14] As a top wide receiver prospect, he received an invitation to the NFL Combine and broke Chris Johnson's 4.24 record time in the 40-yard dash. Ross finished with a 4.22, but strained his calves while pulling up at the end of his run. The calf injuries hindered his ability to complete all the set combine drills or run his second attempt at the 40-yard dash.[15][16] Ross attended Washington's Pro Day, but only ran positional drills. The next day, he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder.[17] He was ranked as the third best wide receiver prospect in the draft by ESPN and was ranked the second best wide receiver prospect by _Sports Illustrated_ and NFLDraftScout.com.[18][19]

The Cincinnati Bengals selected Ross in the first round (9th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.[20] He was the third wide receiver to be selected after Corey Davis and Mike Williams.

On May 7, 2017, the Cincinnati Bengals signed Ross to a four-year, $17.1 million contract with a signing bonus of $10.6 million.[21][22]

Ross competed with Brandon LaFell, Cody Core, Tyler Boyd, and Josh Malone throughout training camp to be the starting wide receiver alongside A. J. Green. Although he was a first round pick, head coach Marvin Lewis named him the sixth wide receiver on the depth chart to begin the regular season.[23]

On September 14, 2017, Ross made his professional regular season debut on _Thursday Night Football_ against the Houston Texans after missing the season-opener due to a knee injury. He fumbled his first and only carry of the game, and was subsequently benched after gaining only 12 rushing yards as the Bengals lost 13–9.[24] That carry proved to be his only touch of his rookie season, as he was only active for two out of the next 10 games and did not record any statistics. A knee injury caused him to miss Weeks 3-5 while the rest were healthy scratches. He was placed on injured reserve on December 4, 2017, with a shoulder injury, ending his rookie season.[25] His debut season was variously described as "wasted",[26] "disappointing"[27] and "disastrous",[28] with Marvin Lewis coming under a lot of criticism for his management of Ross.[29]

In the 2018 season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, Ross recorded his first professional touchdown on a three-yard reception in the 34–23 victory.[30] In the 2018 season, Ross had 21 receptions for 210 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns.[31]
