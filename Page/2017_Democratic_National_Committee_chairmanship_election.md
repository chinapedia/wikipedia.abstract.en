The 2017 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP ELECTION was held on February 25, 2017 at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta to determine the next chairperson of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).[1][2][3] It was the first contested DNC chair election since 1985.

Tom Perez and Keith Ellison emerged as the favored candidates of the majority of DNC members. Other candidates included Sally Boynton Brown, Pete Buttigieg, Sam Ronan and Jehmu Greene. Perez was elected chairperson after two rounds of voting.


Background

DWS_cropped.jpg]] Following the 2016 DNC email leak, which suggested that the DNC leadership showed clear favor to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC Chairwoman, and was succeeded on an interim basis by Donna Brazile.[4]

Brazile announced that she would not run for a full term.[5] With no president to select a chair, this became the first contested DNC chair election since 1985.[6] A DNC executive committee meeting took place in December to provide further procedural clarity into the race, though the election itself was to be held at the DNC's Winter Meeting in late February 2017.[7] The 448 DNC members were the sole voting members. A quarter of the members were state level chairs and vice chairs; the remainder had been elected at the state level. To be elected as chair, a simple majority of votes was required.[8]

Results

With 447 voting members of the DNC, 224 votes were expected to be needed to win the chairmanship.[70] However, only 427 members voted in the first round (Chairperson Donna Brazile and two other members present did not vote, and one abstained), so only 214.5 votes were required to reach the threshold for victory. In the first round, Perez received 213.5 votes, while Ellison received 200, Boynton Brown received 12, Buttigieg received one, and Greene received 0.5.[71]

After the first round, Greene dropped out and endorsed Perez, while Peckarsky and Ronan dropped out and endorsed Ellison. Boynton Brown withdrew without endorsing a candidate. In the second round, 435 votes were cast: 235 for Tom Perez and 200 for Keith Ellison.[72] After Perez won, he selected Ellison as deputy chair.[73]
