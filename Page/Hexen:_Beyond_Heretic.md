_HEXEN: BEYOND HERETIC_ is a dark fantasy first-person shooter video game developed by Raven Software and published by id Software through GT Interactive Software on October 30, 1995. It is the sequel to 1994's _Heretic_, and the second game in Raven Software's "Serpent Riders" trilogy, which culminated with _Hexen II_. The title comes from the German noun _Hexen_, which means "witches", and/or the verb _hexen_, which means "to cast a spell". Game producer John Romero stated that a third, unreleased game in this series was to be called _Hecatomb_.[1]

_Hexen: Beyond Heretic_ met with highly positive reviews upon release, though the various 1997 console ports were negatively received due to issues with frame rate and controls and the aging of the game itself. Critical plaudits for the game centered on the non-linear level design and the selection of three playable characters, each offering a distinct gameplay experience.


Plot

Following the tale of D'Sparil's defeat in _Heretic_, _Hexen_ takes place in another realm, Cronos, which is besieged by the second of the three Serpent Riders, Korax. Three heroes set out to destroy Korax. The player assumes the role of one such hero. Throughout the course of his quest, he travels through elemental dungeons, a wilderness region, a mountainside seminary, a large castle, and finally a necropolis, before the final showdown with the Serpent Rider.


Gameplay

A new series feature introduced in _Hexen_ is the choice of three character classes. Players may choose to play as a fighter (Baratus), a cleric (Parias), or a mage (Daedolon). Each character has unique weapons and physical characteristics, lending an additional degree of variety and replay value to the game. The Fighter relies mainly on close quarter physical attacks with weapons both mundane and magical in nature, and is tougher and faster than the other characters. The Mage uses an assortment of long-range spells, whose reach is counterbalanced by the fact that he is the most fragile and slowest moving of the classes.[2] The Cleric arms himself with a combination of both melee and ranged capabilities, being a middle ground of sorts between the other two classes.[3] Additionally, certain items, such as the flechette (poison gas bomb), behave differently when collected and used by each of the classes, functioning in a manner better suiting their varying approach to combat.[4]

_Hexen_ introduces "hub" levels to the series, wherein the player can travel back and forth between central hub levels and connected side levels.[5] This is done in order to solve larger-scale puzzles that require a series of items or switches to be used.[6] The player must traverse through a hub in order to reach a boss and advance to the next hub.

The inventory system returns from Heretic with several new items such as the "ring of repulsion" which pushes enemies away from the player and the "icon of the defender" which provides invincibility to each class in a different manner.


Development

Like _Heretic_, _Hexen_ was developed on NeXTSTEP.[7] _Hexen_ uses a modified version of the _Doom_ engine, which allows looking up and down, network play with up to eight players, and the choice of three character classes. It also popularized the "hub system" of level progression in the genre of first-person shooter games. Unlike previous games, which had relied purely on General MIDI for music, _Hexen_ is also able to play tracks from a CD. The game's own CD contained a soundtrack in an audio format that was exactly the same as the MIDI soundtrack, but played through a high-quality sound module. However, the most significant improvement was the addition of wall translation, rotation, and level scripting.

Engine modifications

"Polyobjects" are the walls that move within the game. Because the _Doom_ engine uses the binary space partitioning system for rendering, it does not enable moving walls. _Hexen_{{'}}s moving walls are actually one-sided lines built somewhere else on the map and rendered at the desired start spot when the level is loaded. This enables a pseudo-moving wall, but does not allow moving sectors (such as seeing the tops of moving doors). This often creates problems in sectors containing more than one node, however, explaining the relatively limited use of polyobjects.

Whereas _Doom_, _Doom II_, and _Heretic_ rely on lines within the maps to perform simple actions, _Hexen_ also allows these actions to be activated by Action Code Script (ACS). These scripts use a syntactic variant of C, thus allowing special sequencing of game actions. Programming features such as randomization, variables, and intermap script activation enable smooth hub gameplay and are responsible for most of the special effects within the game: on-screen messages, random sound effects, monster spawning, sidedef texture changes, versatile control of polyobjects, level initialization for deathmatch, and even complex environment changes such as earthquakes manipulating floor textures and heights.

Source code

On January 11, 1999, the source code for _Hexen_ was released by Raven Software under a license that granted rights to non-commercial use, and was re-released under the GNU General Public License on September 4, 2008.[8] This allowed the game to be ported to different platforms such as Linux, AmigaOS, and OS/2 (EComStation).

_Hexen_ is compatible with many _Doom_ source ports; _Hexen_{{'}}s features are also compatible with _Doom_ WADs made for source ports regardless of what game they are being played on.

Music

The score was composed by Kevin Schilder. In contrast to _Heretic_, some songs in _Hexen_, in addition to MIDI versions, had higher-quality versions on CD. When playing in CD-audio mode, songs absent from CD would be replaced by some existing CD tracks.[9]


Console versions

_Hexen_ was released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64, all released by GT Interactive during the first half of 1997. While presenting several specific differences in their respective translations of the original PC game, all of them constitute essentially the same game with no major changes to level design, plot, or overall delivery.

The PlayStation version, developed by Probe Entertainment, has the FMV scenes and Redbook audio music from the PC CD-ROM version, but no multiplayer mode. The scripting and animation is slower, enemies have only their front sprites and lack gory deaths when attacked by strong hits or weapons, and the frame rate is slower. Although all levels are present in this version and feature their correct layouts, their architecture details are somewhat simplified and there is some loss in overall lighting quality. This port is based on a beta version of the original PC version of _Hexen_ as many gameplay tweaks are shared, such as the simpler level design and the Fighter's fists being weaker compared to other versions.

The Sega Saturn version, also developed by Probe,[10] inherits most of the restrictions of the PlayStation version, such as the simplified scenery architecture and the downgraded lighting, although it does feature improvements in certain aspects. The scripting is faster, and the frame rate, while not fluid or consistent, is slightly better. The enemies still have all but their front sprites missing, but they retain their gory deaths when killed by a strong hit or weapon. This version also has hidden two-player link-up cooperative and deathmatch modes, accessible only through the unlockable cheat menu.[11] While this port shares the FMV scenes and most of the Redbook audio music from the other CD-ROM versions, it also includes some new music tracks.

The Nintendo 64 version, developed by Software Creations,[12] retains all of the graphical quality and scenery architecture, has a consistent frame rate, and includes high detail and smooth filtering. This version also has four-player split-screen cooperative and deathmatch modes, although they must be played in low detail mode.[13] Due to cartridge storage limitations, the Nintendo 64 version is based on the original PC floppy version and lacks the FMV scenes and Redbook audio music introduced in the CD-ROM version, although it has new narrative introductions to the levels.


_Deathkings of the Dark Citadel_

_Deathkings of the Dark Citadel_ is an official expansion pack that was released for _Hexen_ in 1996. It features three more hubs with a total of 20 new single player levels and six new deathmatch levels. Unlike the _Shadow of the Serpent Riders_ expansion pack for _Heretic_, it had to be purchased in retail stores or by mail order. This was unusual at the time, as most non-free expansion packs also included other new or revised gameplay elements. _Deathkings of the Dark Citadel_, unlike _Shadow of the Serpent Riders_, was not packaged with the original game, meaning that both had to be purchased separately, and the expansion would not work without already having _Hexen_. This expansion pack also did not initially include nor enable any music. Music could be fully enabled by applying a patch specially released to address this issue (usually found online under the name "dkpatch").

Each of the hubs (The Blight, The Constable's Gate, and The Nave) features one secret level, and new puzzles based on the quest items from the original game (no new quest artifacts were added). Any type of enemy may spawn on the map.

The final level of the expansion, the Dark Citadel itself, is an arena-like level, which features teleporting waves of monsters and three bosses (Fighter, Cleric, and Mage clones).


Reception

_Heretic_ and _Hexen_ shipped a combined total of roughly 1 million units to retailers by August 1997.[14]

Reviewing the PC version, _Maximum_ remarked that _Hexen_ sets itself apart from other "3D slashers" with its selection of characters and novel approach to level design, which "leads to your character choosing their path rather than being guided around a rather linear series of rooms, proving that 3D games have matured". They also commented that the gameplay is consistently intense due to the difficulty of the enemies, the variety of weapons and power-ups, and the sheer size and breadth of the levels. They gave the game 5 out of 5 stars[15] and their "Maximum Game of the Month" award.[16] A reviewer for _Next Generation_ opined that "_Hexen_ takes everything that was good about _Heretic_, and makes it even better." He commented that the ability to choose between three different character classes gives the game replay value, something that had been missing from first-person shooters up until then, and though the graphics are blocky and pixelated, the "eerily lifelike" sound effects make up for it to a large extent. Like _Maximum_, he praised the non-linear level design and concluded the game to be a must-have for any first-person shooter fan.[17] Chris Hudak, citing the differing abilities of the three playable characters, called _Hexen_ "Slicker, smarter and more stylish than _Doom_---with all the killing and three times the replay value."[18]

_Computer Games Strategy Plus_ named _Hexen_ the best "First-Person Action" title of 1995.[19] It was also a runner-up for _Computer Gaming World_{{'}}s 1995 "Action Game of the Year" award, which ultimately went to _Crusader: No Remorse_. The editors called it "another _Doom_ bloodfest distinguished by its fantasy setting and the fact that it let you play as either a fighter, priest or mage, each with unique attributes and weapons".[20]

The Saturn version was far less positively received. A review in _Next Generation_ reasoned that, "Like oil and water, _Doom_-style games and console conversions don't mix well. Unless the programmers are willing to rewrite the graphics engine from scratch, PC ports suffer from getting cramped into too little memory and neglecting the console's native 3D hardware." The reviewer recommended Saturn owners instead try _PowerSlave_ or _Ghen War_, first-person shooters specifically designed for the console.[21] Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of _Electronic Gaming Monthly_ similarly said the game had not converted well from PC.[22] Others described the Saturn port as an exact conversion, and argued the problem was simply that _Hexen_ was too old a game to be released for console in 1997 without any improvements.[23][24] Though they disagreed on why, most critics agreed that the Saturn version suffers from pixelated graphics,[25][26][27][28] dramatic drops in frame rate,[29][30][31] and cumbersome controls.[32][33][34] Scary Larry of _GamePro_ gave it a mixed review, summarizing that "although it doesn't live up to _PowerSlave_{{'}}s standards, it's still decent fun."[35] John Broady of _GameSpot_ gave a slightly more dismal assessment: "Despite these glaring deficiencies, _Hexen_ nonetheless offers enough enhancements over the standard shooter to warrant a rental, especially for fans of role-playing games who thirst for real-time action. ... But for the rest, the Saturn version of _Hexen_ is a classic game of too little and too late."[36] Rich Leadbetter of _Sega Saturn Magazine_ and James Price of _Saturn Power_ defended the Saturn version, commenting that while it is not outstanding, it is far superior to the Saturn version of _Doom_, which was released at roughly the same time.[37][38] Price was particularly enthusiastic about the link cable-enabled multiplayer mode.[39]

The Nintendo 64 version also left most critics unimpressed. The four-player mode was praised as an unprecedented feature in console first person shooters,[40][41][42][43] but the visuals were considered unacceptably poor, particularly the frame rate[44][45][46][47] and the usage of the Nintendo 64's mip-mapping and anti-aliasing in a way which actually worsens the appearance of the game.[48][49] As with the Saturn version, some critics opined that _Hexen_ was too dated by this time to be receiving a straightforward port.[50][51] Joe Fielder of _GameSpot_ additionally complained of a severe bug in the save feature.[52] In a dissenting opinion, Scary Larry concluded that "Although not as polished as _Turok_ or as fun and creepy as _Doom 64_, _Hexen_ gives you three characters to choose from, and the action's addicting once you get into it." He gave it higher scores than the Saturn version in every category except sound.[53] In contrast, Matt Casamassina of _IGN_ called it "A shoddy port of a PC game that wasn't so great to begin with."[54]

The PlayStation version was still more negatively received, with critics universally razing the conversion for its poor frame rate, pixelated graphics, and sloppy platform jumping controls.[55][56][57]
