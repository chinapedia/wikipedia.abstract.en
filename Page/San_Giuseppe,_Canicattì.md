SAN GIUSEPPE is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic church located on Corso Umberto I in the town of Canicattì, province of Agrigento, region of Sicily, Italy.


History

The site was originally the home of a monastery and hospital run by the _Collegio di Maria_ (order of _Suore collegine della Sacra Famiglia_) established by Pietro Marcellino Corradini. The hospital was patronized in 1620 by the Baron Giacomo I Bonanno Colonna. The church was also called the "Hospital Church".

The church, erected in the 18th century, has undergone many modifications of the centuries, including a major reconstruction in the 20th century by Ernesto Basile, who designed the façade. He also designed the interior coffered ceiling.[1]
