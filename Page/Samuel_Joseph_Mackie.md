SAMUEL JOSEPH MACKIE FGS, FSA (21 January 1823 â€“ 31 May 1902), was a British geologist, inventor, and editor. He was a founding member of the Geologists' Association and the Anthropological Society of London, and sole editor of _The Geologist: a Popular Monthly Magazine of Geology_, a precursor to the _Geological Magazine_. Born in Dover to Samuel and Eleanor Mackie, he married Maria Kemp on 4 December 1845, and after her death married Susan Arabella in October, 1853. He edited _The Geologist_ from 1858 to 1864, at which point it was acquired by Lovell Reeve & Co. The next year he established the _Geological and Natural History Repertory_, which folded in 1869.[1]
