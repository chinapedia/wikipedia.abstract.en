RENSO PÉREZ (born 24 December 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Central Córdoba.[1][2]


Career

Pérez's career started with Primera D club Sportivo Barracas, who he remained with for three years before joining Torneo Argentino B side Atlético Policial.[3] His stay with Atlético Policial lasted just a season as he was soon on the move again as he completed a transfer to Primera C team Villa Dálmine.[4] He won the 2011–12 Primera C Metropolitana title in his debut season with the club. He scored eight goals in thirty-six appearances in his next season for Villa Dálmine in the 2012–13 Primera B Metropolitana before he departed in 2013 to join Primera B Nacional side Ferro Carril Oeste on loan.[5]

He scored his first goal for Ferro in his third match, versus Atlético Tucumán. In total, he played in twenty-six league games.[6] Pérez returned to Villa Dálmine and went on to play eighty-five times and score sixteen goals for them, including three goals in twenty-four appearances in their 2014 promotion-winning season.[7] In July 2016, Pérez joined Argentine Primera División team Arsenal de Sarandí on loan.[8] He made his Arsenal and top-flight debut on 27 August against Sarmiento. In his next game, on 13 September, he scored his first goal versus Atlético Tucumán; the same opponents he scored his first Ferro goal for.[9][10]

Central Córdoba completed the signing of Pérez in June 2018.[11] He netted in his opening appearance, scoring as the club eliminated Primera División team Vélez Sarsfield out of the Copa Argentina.[12]
