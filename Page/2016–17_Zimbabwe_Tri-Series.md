The 2016–17 ZIMBABWE TRI-SERIES was a One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament that was held in Zimbabwe in November 2016.[1][2] It was a tri-nation series between the national representative cricket teams of Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. The Sri Lankan team were originally scheduled to tour Zimbabwe for two Tests, three ODIs and one Twenty20 International (T20I). However, the ODIs and T20I were replaced by this tri-series.[3]

DRS technology was used for the first time in a limited-overs series in Zimbabwe.[4] This follows its use in the second Test in Zimbabwe's series against Sri Lanka that immediately preceded the tri-series.[5]

Sri Lanka won the tournament by beating Zimbabwe by 6 wickets in the final.[6]
