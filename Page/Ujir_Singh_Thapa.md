He was the son of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa, a nephew of the Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa and elder brother of Mathabar Singh Thapa.

Ujir Singh was born on Chaitra _Shukla Pratipada_ Tithi in the year 1852 of Bikram Samvat (1796 A.D.).[1] He was the son of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa and grandson of Sanu Sardar Amar Singh Thapa.

He had deployed 1200 troops in defenses of Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi, and Kathe Gadhi. He was famous for exploiting an advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics.[5] Henry Thoby Prinsep quoted about the Jeetgadh administered by Ujir Singh as :

Before entering the war, Ujir Singh had constructed roads, bridges, culverts and fortified garrisons in the Butwal-Palpa region.[6] The British advance began on 22 Poush, 1871 B.S.(January 1814 A.D.) to Jit Gadhi. While crossing Tinau River to attack the fortress Ujir's forces opened the fire and made them fall back. Similarly, at Tansen Bazaar the British fell back with a total loss of 300 men while 70 Nepalese lost their lives.[7]

In 1825, a complaint of border incursions was lodged at the jurisdiction of Ujir Singh's administration. Such was done to oppose the Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa in the policy of forging alliance with the Burmese government.


Sindoor Jatra procession

Ujir Singh then touched the feet of a 16 handed Mahishashur Mardini Bhagwati deity in Tansen Bazaar and took solemn vow to spread her fame by constructing a temple and initiating a Sindoor Jatra (procession of vermillion) upon the victory of Gorkhali forces in the war.[8] After the victory of the Gorkhali forces, he began the construction of a three storied temple in 1872 V.S. which was accomplished in 1876 V.S. After the completion of construction of the temple, he donated gold equivalent to his height as the Gajur (pinnacle) for the temple and constructed silver canopied Mahishashur Mardini Bhagwati whose 18 arms were built of Ashtadhatu (octo-alloy).[9] He started the Khat Jatra, together with Palpa Bhagwatiâ€™s Sindoor Jatra, on the day of Bhadra Krishna Nawami in 1877 V.S.[10] For the purpose of worship and rituals, he had invited Chandramani Gubhaju of Patan to perform Nitya Naumaitik Puja, Barsha Bandhan Puja and Tantric rituals during Kalaratri, Chaite Dashain, and others. The procession is observed till date as celebration of victory.[11]


Military Laws

Ujir Singh Thapa had issued six rules in 1879 V.S. for the purpose of both civil and military administration.[12]


Legacy

On Friday 7 April 2017, the Chief of Army Staff (Nepal) Rajendra Chhetri unveiled the life-size statue of Ujir Singh at Tansen, Palpa.[13] The statue was constructed jointly by the Palpa Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Chandi Prasad Battalion of Nepal Army.[14] Another life-size statue of Ujir Singh and the largest national flag of Nepal was also planned to be installed at the Jitgadhi Killa fort which is located at the Western bank of Tinau River in Butwal.[15] The fort was named Jeetgadh after the victory of Nepali forces against the British forces during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-1816.[16] Jeetgadh was to be developed as symbol of nationalism and landmark of Butwal as per the Butwal Mayor Shivaraj Subedi.[17]
