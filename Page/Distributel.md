-   On 31 March 2014, Matt Stein joined Distributel as CEO, while Mel Cohen maintained his role as chairman.[3]
-   In September 2016, Distributel acquires Yak Communications from Globalive.[4]
-   In January 2017, Distributel announces a partnership with jBilling aimed at providing more flexibility to its business systems.[5]
