_WIDOWS_ is a 2018 heist film directed by Steve McQueen from a screenplay by McQueen and Gillian Flynn, based upon the 1983 British television series of the same name.[1] The plot follows four Chicago women who attempt to steal $5 million from the home of a prominent local politician in order to pay back a crime boss from whom $2 million was stolen by their husbands before they are killed in a botched getaway attempt. A British-American co-production, the film features an ensemble cast consisting of Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo, Colin Farrell, Brian Tyree Henry, Daniel Kaluuya, Jacki Weaver, Carrie Coon, Robert Duvall, and Liam Neeson.

_Widows_ premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on November 6, 2018 and in the United States on November 16, by 20th Century Fox. The film grossed $76 million worldwide and received praise for its direction, screenplay and performances (particularly Davis, Debicki and Kaluuya), with critics crediting it for blending "dramatic themes with popcorn thrills".[2][3] It received several award nominations, among them one for Davis for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.


Plot

Harry Rawlings, a renowned thief, is killed alongside his partners during a botched robbery. His widow Veronica is threatened by crime boss Jamal Manning, from whom Harry and his partners stole $2 million. Jamal needs the money to finance his campaign for alderman of a South Side ward, where he is running against Jack Mulligan, the next-in-line of a dynastic family who have historically dominated the alderman position. Veronica discovers Harry's notebook which contains a detailed plan for a heist in the sum of $5 million.

She decides to carry out the plan to repay her debt to Jamal, and recruits two of the other widows, Alice and Linda, to assist her. The fourth widow, Amanda, does not show at their initial meeting. Alice acquires Glock pistols and a getaway van at a car auction while Linda is tasked with deciphering a blueprint in Harry's plan. Alice uses a real estate executive with whom she is in a transactional relationship to identify the blueprint as a safe in Jack Mulligan's home.

When Veronica's loyal chauffeur Bash is murdered by Manning's crew, Linda recruits Belle, her children’s babysitter, to be their driver. When Veronica visits Amanda and notices Harry's flask on a table, she deduces that Harry is the father of Amanda's newborn child. Devastated by Harry's infidelity, Veronica leaves. Veronica visits the Mulligan home to ask Jack for protection from Manning—a request he rebuffs—and to case the premises in advance of the heist, while Belle is busy scanning the property for cameras and security guards. Veronica acquires the code to the safe by blackmailing the CEO of the Mulligans' security company, using incriminating photos left in Harry's notebook.

The heist begins and the women obtain access to the safe with the money. But on their way out, Jack's father Tom appears and shoots Alice, wounding her. Linda quickly returns fire and shoots Tom dead. They escape but are caught by Jamal's brother Jatemme, who subsequently steals the money from them and drives away in their getaway van. The group chases down Jatemme, ramming his van off the road into a median, killing him, and retrieves the money. The group then splits up and goes their separate ways, with Veronica returning to the hideout. Harry, who had faked his death and set up his partners after being hired by Jack, arrives at the hideout to steal the money from Veronica so that he can build a new life with Amanda. Veronica shoots Harry dead before he can kill her first.

Jack wins the position of alderman on a wave of public sympathy following his father's murder. Linda reacquires the store that had been seized from her after her husband's death left her with large debts. Alice sets up her own business, while Belle moves away. With Manning no longer a threat, Veronica donates the bulk of her share to improve the school library to honor the memory of her deceased son. Veronica and Alice happen upon one another in a diner. They initially ignore each other, but Veronica warmly greets Alice outside.

Production

The project was announced as being in development on March 27, 2015, with a script written by Gillian Flynn and Steve McQueen, and with McQueen attached to direct.[4] In September 2016, Viola Davis joined the cast. It was reported that Jennifer Lawrence was approached for a role, but, due to scheduling conflicts, had to decline.[5] In November 2016, Cynthia Erivo joined the cast.[6] In January 2017, André Holland entered negotiations to co-star in the film, but does not appear in the finished product.[7] The next month, Elizabeth Debicki was cast in the role Lawrence had declined,[8][9] and Michelle Rodriguez[10] and Daniel Kaluuya were also announced as cast members.[11] In March, Liam Neeson joined the cast.[12] The following month, Colin Farrell was added along with Robert Duvall.[13][14] In May, Garret Dillahunt, Jacki Weaver, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Lukas Haas and Brian Tyree Henry were set to co-star,[15][16][17][18][19] and in June, Carrie Coon was added.[20] Michael Harney and Jon Bernthal joined the cast in August.[21][22] The British actress Ann Mitchell, who had portrayed Dolly Rawlins in the television series, has a small part as Amanda's mother.

Principal photography began on May 8, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois.[23][24]

Hans Zimmer composed the film's score with additional music provided by Steve Mazzaro. The soundtrack, released by Milan Records, includes the score as well as songs by Nina Simone, and the Cool Kids, as well as a new song "The Big Unknown" by Sade later released as a single.[25]


Release

The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018.[26][27] It was released in the United States on November 16, 2018.[28]


Reception

Box office

_Widows_ grossed $42.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $33.6 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $76 million, against a production budget of $42 million.[29]

In the United States and Canada, _Widows_ was released alongside _Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald_ and _Instant Family_, and was projected to gross $12–18 million from 2,803 theaters in its opening weekend.[30] It grossed $4.2 million on its first day, including $600,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up making $12.3 million over the weekend, finishing fifth at the box office. _Deadline Hollywood_ stated that the low debut was because of a "lack of urgency" in the advertising, and that the studio should not have relied on the good reviews alone to sell the film.[31] Other publications, including _Business Insider_, said the film should have been released outside the busy November frame, and that the perceived marketing toward specifically African-American audiences, and its R-rating, limited the film's appeal.[32] In its second weekend, the film dropped 33% to $8.2 million (and $10.5 million total over the five-day Thanksgiving frame), finishing eighth.[33]

Critical response

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 376 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "_Widows_ rounds up a stellar ensemble for a heist thriller that mixes popcorn entertainment with a message – and marks another artistic leap for director Steve McQueen."[34] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars; social media monitor RelishMix noted online responses to the film were "mixed".[36]

Owen Gleiberman of _Variety_ praised McQueen's direction and Davis' performance and wrote, "The strongest aspect of _Widows_ is the way the movie gets us — and keeps us — rooting for its desperate-living heroines. They're past the point of just wanting to have fun (the subtext of almost every heist movie); they're less concerned with comeuppance than sheer survival."[37] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an "A-", saying the film "works as well as it does due to the way McQueen juggles substance with entertainment value to such eager subversive ends. The movie engages with topics as complex as sexism, police brutality, and interracial marriage, but it still delivers on the car chases and gunplay. No superhero movie digs this deep."[38] _Dirty Movies_ considered it one of the best films of 2018, describing it as McQueen's best work since _Hunger_.[39] Representing more critical views, Leah Greenblatt at _Entertainment Weekly_ gave the film a "C+", arguing that it's "not clear exactly what kind of movie(s) _Widows_ wants to be" and that it feels like a "crazy-quilt patchwork of other, better films".[40]
