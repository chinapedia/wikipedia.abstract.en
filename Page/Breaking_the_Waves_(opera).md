Synopsis

Set in the Scottish Highlands in the early 1970s, _Breaking the Waves_ tells the story of Bess McNeill, a religious young woman with a deep love for her husband Jan, a handsome oil rig worker. When Jan becomes paralyzed in an off-shore accident, Bess's marital vows are put to the test as he encourages her to seek other lovers and return to his bedside to tell him of her sexual activities. He insists that the stories will feel like they are making love together and keep him alive. Bess's increasing selflessness leads to a finale of divine grace, but at great cost.[6]


Critical reception

"Breaking_the_Waves"_at_Opera_Philadelphia_(29865450921).jpg _Breaking the Waves_ was widely seen by critics as a major success. It won the inaugural Best New Opera Award from the Music Critics Association of North America, and was shortlisted for "Best World Premiere" Prize at the International Opera Awards.[7]

"Missy Mazzoli's _Breaking the Waves_, which had its world premiere at Opera Philadelphia on Thursday, is savage, heartbreaking and thoroughly original. The 1996 Lars von Trier film on which it is based has a disturbing undercurrent of violent misogyny, but the operatic Bess McNeill, for all her frailties, is no victim. Classic tragic opera heroines may weep and die, but Bess, as conceived by Ms. Mazzoli and librettist Royce Vavrek, and sung by the extraordinary Kiera Duffy, is an evolving, unforgettable character." Heidi Waleson, _The Wall Street Journal_[8]

"...the desperate scenario of self-destruction and redemption seems to be a projection of Bess’s will to believe, her reshaping of the fabric of the world. Mazzoli’s score supports that dynamic by wedding strong lyric invention to an unsettled, insidiously dissonant chamber-orchestra texture that evokes the jagged beauty both of Skye and of Bess’s inner landscape. Benjamin Britten is a palpable influence, particularly in thrashing orchestral tempests and some melismatic, Peter Quint-like writing for tenor. Yet Mazzoli absorbs these and other elements into her own spare, propulsive voice." Alex Ross, _The New Yorker_[9]

"It is not easy to find new operas that command attention, tell their story lucidly and create a powerful, permeating mood. Dark and daring, _Breaking the Waves_ does all this with sensitivity and style." Zachary Woolfe, _The New York Times_.[10]
