Jimmy Stuart (disambiguation)|and|James Stewart (disambiguation)}}

JAMES MAITLAND STEWART (May 20, 1908July 2, 1997) was an American actor and military officer who is among the most honored and popular stars in film history. Known for his distinctive drawl and down-to-earth persona, Stewart's film career spanned over 55 years, and included performances in 80 films. Stewart was a major Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player and often portrayed American middle-class men struggling in crisis. Many of the films in which he starred have become enduring classics.

Stewart began his career as a performer on Broadway which earned him a film contract at MGM after attracting the attention of a talent scout. He also had a noted military career and was a World War II and Vietnam War veteran and pilot, who rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the United States Air Force Reserve, becoming the highest-ranking actor in military history. In 1985, Stewart was promoted to Major General, reserve list by President Ronald Reagan, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 1949, Stewart married former model Gloria Hatrick McLean with whom he had twin daughters and adopted her two children from her previous marriage. Stewart was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for _The Philadelphia Story_ (1940), and received an Academy Honorary Award for his achievements in 1985. In 1999, Stewart was named the third-greatest male screen legend of the Golden Age of Hollywood by the American Film Institute, behind Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant.


Early life and education

(1934)]]James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania,[1] the oldest and only son of three children born to Elizabeth Ruth (_née_ Jackson; March 16, 1875August 2, 1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (May 19, 1871 – December 28, 1961)[2][3][4] Stewart's sisters Mary and Virginia were born in 1912 and 1914 respectively. The Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations; his father ran the family business, the J.M. Stewart Hardware Store, and hoped that Stewart would take over the family business after completing college. Stewart was of Scottish ancestry and was raised as a Presbyterian.[5][6] He was descended from veterans of the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. His mother was an excellent pianist, but his father discouraged Stewart's request for music lessons. When his father once accepted a gift of an accordion from a guest, Stewart quickly learned to play the instrument, which became a fixture offstage during his acting career. As the family grew, music continued to be an important part of family life. At a young age, he was prescribed glasses after being diagnosed with astigmatism. However, after being called "Specks" by schoolchildren, he threw the glasses away and didn't wear them for many years.

Stewart attended Mercersburg Academy prep school, graduating in 1928. He was active in a variety of activities. He was a member of the track team (competing as a high jumper under coach Jimmy Curran),[7] was art editor of the _KARUX_ yearbook, and a member of the choir club, glee club, and John Marshall Literary Society. Regrettably to Stewart, he was a third-string member of the football team due to his slender and non-muscular physique. During his first summer break, Stewart returned to his hometown to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads.[8] Over the following two summers, he took a job as an assistant with a professional magician. He made his first appearance onstage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play _The Wolves_.

A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after-school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing, and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of Charles Lindbergh, whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with scarlet fever, was avidly following from home, foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.[9] The scarlet fever led to a kidney infection. He was unable to finish the school year, delaying his graduation.'' (1936)]]However, he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the United States Naval Academy he attend Princeton University. Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932. He became one of the more notable members of the Princeton Charter Club. He excelled at studying architecture, so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies,[10] but he gradually became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the Princeton Triangle Club.[11] His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust and Charles Leatherbee as directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932, after he graduated.The University Players had previously included Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan. Stewart and Fonda became close friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an apartment with Joshua Logan and Myron McCormick.


Career

Theatre and early films

's comedy _You Can't Take It With You_ (1938) was one of the films that brought Stewart widespread attention.]] When Stewart came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway tryout of _Goodbye Again_, he shared an apartment with Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan. Along with fellow University Players Alfred Dalrymple and Myron McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of _Carry Nation_ and a few weeks later – again with McCormick and Dalrymple – as a chauffeur in the comedy _Goodbye Again_, in which he had two lines. _The New Yorker_ commented, "Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."

drawing of a scene from _Yellow Jack_ (Stewart is at upper left)]] The play was a moderate success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the Depression was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, "I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded." By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit _Page Miss Glory_ and his first dramatic stage role in Sidney Howard's _Yellow Jack_, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in _The Farmer Takes a Wife_ took him to Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of MGM scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of _Divided by Three_, a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance, including Irving Berlin, Moss Hart and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.

Upon Stewart's arrival by train in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted him at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to Greta Garbo. Stewart's first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an unbilled appearance in a Shemp Howard comedy short called _Art Trouble_ in 1934, his first film was the poorly received Spencer Tracy vehicle _The Murder Man_ (1935). _Rose Marie_ (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in 1936's _After the Thin Man_, and played Jean Harlow's character's frustrated boyfriend in the Clark Gable vehicle _Wife vs. Secretary_ earlier that same year.

On the romantic front, he dated newly divorced Ginger Rogers. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy _Next Time We Love_. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a week in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios. James Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in _You Can't Take It With You_. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in _Navy Blue and Gold_ (1937). The director had recently completed several well-received films, including _It Happened One Night_ (1934), and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that archetype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen." His final film of 1937 was _Vivacious Lady_ with Ginger Rogers. The production was shut down for months as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness. Stewart later revealed that he had been hospitalized and lost weight due to the illness. RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually, the project was canceled. However, Rogers's success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again. The film showed Stewart's talent for performing in romantic comedies.

, the second of which was _The Shopworn Angel_ (1938).]]_You Can't Take It With You_, starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedian Jean Arthur, won the 1938 Best Picture Academy Award. The following year saw Stewart work with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_. Stewart replaced intended star Gary Cooper in the film, playing an idealist thrown into the political arena. Upon its October 1939 release, the film garnered critical praise and became a box-office success. Stewart received the first of five Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. Stewart's father was still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life. Stewart took a secret trip to Europe to take a break and returned home in 1939 just as Germany invaded Poland.

_Destry Rides Again_, also released in 1939, became Stewart's first western film, a genre with which he would become identified later in his career. In this western parody, he is a pacifist lawman and Marlene Dietrich is the dancing saloon girl who comes to love him but does not get him. Off-screen, Dietrich did get her man, but the romance was short-lived. _Made for Each Other_ (1939) had Stewart sharing the screen with Carole Lombard in a melodrama that garnered good reviews for both stars but did less well with the public. _Newsweek_ wrote that they were "perfectly cast in the leading roles". Between movies, Stewart began a radio career and became a distinctive voice on the Lux Radio Theater's _The Screen Guild Theater_ and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.

In 1940 Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedy, _The Shop Around the Corner_, starred them as co-workers unknowingly involved in a pen-pal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life. It was Stewart's fifth film of the year and one of the rare ones shot in sequence; it was completed in only 27 days. _The Mortal Storm_, directed by Frank Borzage, was one of the first blatantly anti-Nazi films to be produced in Hollywood and featured Sullavan and Stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon Hitler's rise to power, literally hunted down by their own friends.[12][13]

for 1940's _The Philadelphia Story_. He is seen here with co-star Katharine Hepburn.]] Stewart also starred with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in George Cukor's classic _The Philadelphia Story_ (1940). His performance as an intrusive, fast-talking reporter earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category (Best Actor, 1941); he beat out his good friend Henry Fonda (_The Grapes of Wrath_). Stewart thought his performance "entertaining and slick and smooth" but lacking the "guts" of "Mr. Smith". Stewart gave the Oscar statuette to his father, who displayed it for many years in a case inside the front door of his hardware store, alongside other family awards and military medals.

During the months before he began military service, Stewart appeared in a series of screwball comedies with varying levels of success. He followed _No Time for Comedy_ (1940) with Rosalind Russell and _Come Live with Me_ (1941) with Hedy Lamarr with the Judy Garland musical _Ziegfeld Girl_ and the George Marshall romantic comedy _Pot o' Gold_, featuring Paulette Goddard. Stewart enlisted in late 1940 a situation that coincided with the lapse in his MGM contract, marking a turning point in Stewart's career, with 28 movies to his credit at that point.

Military service

James Stewart's family on both sides had deep military roots, as both grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, and his father had served during both the Spanish–American War and World War I.[14] Members of his family had previously been in the infantry, but Stewart chose to become a flier. An early interest in flying led Stewart to gain his private pilot certificate in 1935 and commercial pilot license in 1938.[15] He often flew cross-country to visit his parents in Pennsylvania, navigating by following railroad tracks.[16] Nearly two years before the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Stewart had accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.[17] Considered a highly proficient pilot, he entered a cross-country race as a co-pilot in 1939. Stewart, along with musician/composer Hoagy Carmichael, saw the need for trained war pilots and joined with other Hollywood celebrities to invest in Thunderbird Field, a pilot-training school built and operated by Southwest Airways in Glendale, Arizona.

In late 1940, Stewart attempted to enlist in the United States Army but was rejected for failing to meet the weight requirements for his height for new recruits—Stewart was under the standard. In order to gain weight, he sought out the help of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's muscle man and trainer Don Loomis, who was noted for his ability to help people gain or lose weight in his studio gymnasium.[18][19] Stewart subsequently attempted to enlist in the Air Corps, but still came in underweight, although he persuaded the enlistment officer to run new tests, this time passing the weigh-in, with the result that Stewart enlisted and was inducted into the Army on March 22, 1941.[20] He became the first major American movie star to wear a military uniform in World War II, having been enlisted prior to the USA entering the conflict.[21]

Stewart enlisted as a private[22][23] but applied for an Air Corps commission and Service Pilot rating as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Soon to be 33, he was almost six years beyond the maximum age restriction for Aviation Cadet training, the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942,[24] shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, while a corporal at Moffett Field, California. He received his Service Pilot rating at that time, under the Service Pilot program established in March 1942 for experienced former civilian pilots.[25] Stewart's first assignment was an appearance at a March of Dimes rally in Washington, D.C., but Stewart wanted assignment to an operational unit rather than serving as a recruiting symbol. He applied for and was granted advanced training on multi-engine aircraft. Stewart was posted to nearby Mather Field to instruct in both single- and twin-engine aircraft.[26][27]

Public appearances by Stewart were limited engagements scheduled by the Army Air Forces. "Stewart appeared several times on network radio with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, he performed with Orson Welles, Edward G. Robinson, Walter Huston and Lionel Barrymore in an all-network radio program called _We Hold These Truths_, dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the Bill of Rights." In early 1942, Stewart was asked to appear in a film to help recruit the 100,000 airmen the USAAF anticipated it would need to win the war. The USAAF's First Motion Picture Unit shot scenes of Lieutenant Stewart in his pilot's flight jacket and recorded his voice for narration. The short recruitment film _Winning Your Wings_ appeared in movie theaters nationwide beginning in late May and was very successful, resulting in 150,000 new recruits.[28]

Stewart was concerned that his expertise and celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties "behind the lines". His fears were confirmed when, after his promotion to first lieutenant on July 7, 1942, he was stationed from August to December 1942 at Kirtland Army Airfield in Albuquerque, New Mexico, piloting AT-11 Kansans used in training bombardiers. He was transferred to Hobbs Army Airfield, New Mexico, for three months of transition training in the four-engine B-17 Flying Fortress, then sent to the Combat Crew Processing Center in Salt Lake City, where he expected to be assigned to a combat unit. Instead, he was assigned in early 1943 to an operational training unit, the 29th Bombardment Group at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho, as an instructor.[29] He was promoted to captain on July 9, 1943, and appointed a squadron commander.[30] To Stewart, now 35, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable, and he had no clear plans for the future. However, a rumor that Stewart would be taken off flying status and assigned to making training films or selling bonds called for immediate action because what he dreaded most was "the hope-shattering spectre of a dead end". Stewart appealed to his commander, 30-year-old Lt. Col. Walter E. Arnold Jr., who understood his situation and recommended Stewart to the commander of the 445th Bombardment Group, a B-24 Liberator unit that had just completed initial training at Gowen Field and gone on to final training at Sioux City Army Air Base, Iowa.[31]

Following a mission to Ludwigshafen, Germany, on January 7, 1944, Stewart was promoted to major.[32] Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions as deputy commander of the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing on the first day of "Big Week" operations in February, and flew two other missions that week.[33] Stewart continued to go on missions uncredited, flying with the pathfinder squadron of the 389th Bombardment Group, with his two former groups and with groups of the 20th Combat Bomb Wing.[34] He received a second Distinguished Flying Cross for actions in combat and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. He also earned the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. Stewart served in a number of staff positions in the 2nd and 20th Bomb Wings between July 1944 and the end of the war in Europe and was promoted to full colonel on March 29, 1945.[35] Less than two months later, on May 10, he succeeded to command briefly the 2nd Bomb Wing, a position he held until June 15, 1945. Stewart was one of the few Americans to ever rise from private to colonel in only four years during the Second World War.[36][37] At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was the presiding officer of the court-martial of a pilot and navigator who were charged with dereliction of duty for having accidentally bombed the Swiss city of Zurich the previous March—the first instance of U.S. personnel being tried for an attack on a neutral country. The court acquitted the defendants.[38]

Stewart returned to the United States aboard RMS _Queen Elizabeth_, arriving in New York City on August 31, 1945.[39] Stewart continued to play a role in the Army Air Forces Reserve following World War II and the new United States Air Force Reserve after the official establishment of the Air Force as an independent service in 1947. Stewart received a permanent promotion to colonel in 1953 and served as Air Force Reserve commander of Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, the present day Dobbins Air Reserve Base.[40] He was also one of the 12 founders and a charter member of the Air Force Association in October 1945. Stewart rarely spoke about his wartime service, but did appear in January 1974 in an episode of the TV series _The World At War_, "Whirlwind: Bombing Germany (September 1939 – April 1944)", commenting on the disastrous mission of October 14, 1943, against Schweinfurt, Germany. At his request, he was identified only as "James Stewart, Squadron Commander" in the documentary.[41]

On July 23, 1959, Stewart was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in military history.[42][43] During his active duty periods, he remained current as a pilot of Convair B-36 Peacemaker, Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress intercontinental bombers of the Strategic Air Command.[44] On February 20, 1966, Brigadier General Stewart flew as a non-duty observer in a B-52 on an Arc Light bombing mission during the Vietnam War. He refused the release of any publicity regarding his participation, as he did not want it treated as a stunt, but as part of his job as an officer in the Air Force Reserve. His years in the service, however, took a toll on his mental health. He suffered from nightmares years afterward and his appetite was dramatically reduced. He did not like to talk about his military experiences, refusing to even discuss them with his children. Five years later, after 27 years of service, Stewart officially retired from the Air Force on May 31, 1968.[45] Stewart received a number of awards during his military service and upon his retirement was also awarded the United States Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. On May 23, 1985, President Ronald Reagan awarded Stewart the Presidential Medal of Freedom and promoted him to Major General on the Retired List.[46]

Postwar career

After the war, James Stewart took time off to reassess his career. He was an early investor in Southwest Airways, founded by Leland Hayward, and considered going into the aviation industry if his restarted film career did not prosper. Upon Stewart's return to Hollywood in the fall of 1945, he decided not to renew his MGM contract. He signed with the MCA talent agency. His former agent Leland Hayward got out of the talent business in 1944 after selling his A-list of stars, including Stewart, to MCA.

, with guardian angel Clarence, in _It's a Wonderful Life_ (1946). Stewart received an Oscar nomination for the performance, and the film is widely considered a Christmas classic.]]

For his first film in five years, Stewart appeared in his third and final Frank Capra production, ''It's a Wonderful Life ''(1946). The role was Stewart's first since returning from service in World War II, during which he experienced what is now recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder.[47] Capra paid RKO for the rights to the story and formed his own production company, Liberty Films. The female lead went to Donna Reed when Capra's perennial first choice, Jean Arthur, was unavailable, and after Ginger Rogers, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Dvorak, and Martha Scott had all turned down the role.[48][49] Stewart appeared as George Bailey, an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles. Driven to suicide on Christmas Eve, he is led to reassess his life by Clarence Odbody, an "angel, second class" played by Henry Travers.[50]

Although _It's a Wonderful Life_ was nominated for five Academy Awards,[51] including Stewart's third Best Actor nomination, it received mixed reviews and only disappointingly moderate success at the box office. However, in the decades since the film's release, it grew to define Stewart's film persona and is widely considered as a sentimental Christmas film classic and,[52] according to the American Film Institute, one of the 100 best American movies ever made.[53] In an interview with Michael Parkinson in 1973, Stewart declared that out of all the movies he had made, _It's a Wonderful Life_ was his favorite.[54] After viewing the film, President Harry S. Truman concluded, "If Bess and I had a son we'd want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart."[55] In the aftermath of the film, Capra's production company went into bankruptcy, while Stewart started to have doubts about his ability to act after his military hiatus. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, his generation of actors was fading and a new wave of actors would soon remake the town, including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift and James Dean.

_Magic Town_ (1947), a comedy film directed by William A. Wellman, starring James Stewart and Jane Wyman, was one of the first films about the then-new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received.[56][57] He completed _Call Northside 777_ (1948), and weathered a box-office disappointment with _On Our Merry Way_ (1948), a comedic musical ensemble in which Stewart and Henry Fonda were paired as two jazz musicians. He also acted in _You Gotta Stay Happy_ (1948), which was a bigeger box office success than _It's a Wonderful Life_.

He returned to the stage to star in Mary Coyle Chase's _Harvey_, which had opened to nearly universal praise in November 1944,[58] as Elwood P. Dowd, a wealthy eccentric living with his sister and niece, and whose best friend is an invisible rabbit as large as a man. Dowd's eccentricity, especially the friendship with the rabbit, is ruining the niece's hopes of finding a husband. While trying to have Dowd committed to a sanatorium, his sister is committed herself.[59] Stewart took over the role from Frank Fay and gained an increased Broadway following in the unconventional play. The play, which ran for nearly three years with Stewart as its star, was successfully adapted into a 1950 film, directed by Henry Koster, with Stewart reprising his role and Josephine Hull portraying his sister.[60] Bing Crosby was the first choice, but he declined. Stewart received his fourth Best Actor nomination for his performance.[61] Stewart also played the role on Broadway in 1970,[62] which was shot on videotape for NBC as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 1972, and on the London stage in 1975.[63]

After _Harvey_, the World War II film _Malaya_ (1949) with Spencer Tracy, and the conventional but highly successful biographical film _The Stratton Story_ in 1949, Stewart's first pairing with "on-screen wife" June Allyson, his career took another turn. During the 1950s, he expanded into the Western and suspense genres, thanks to collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann.[64]

Other performances by Stewart during this time include the critically acclaimed 1950 Delmer Daves Western _Broken Arrow_, which featured Stewart as an ex-soldier and Indian agent making peace with the Apache. Stewart took a small, supporting role as a troubled clown in Cecil B. DeMille's 1952 Best Picture _The Greatest Show on Earth_. Critics were curious why Stewart had taken such as small, out of character role; Stewart always responded that he was inspired by Lon Chaney's ability to completely disguise himself while letting his character emerge. He also played as a railroad worker named Grant McLaine in the 1957 western film _Night Passage_[65] and Stewart's role as Charles Lindbergh in Billy Wilder's 1957 _The Spirit of St. Louis_. He also starred in the Western radio show _The Six Shooter_ for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954.[66] During this time, Stewart wore the same cowboy hat and rode the same horse, "Pie", in most of his Westerns.[67][68]

Stewart was cast in _Bell, Book and Candle_ (1958) with Kim Novak. However, he felt that he was miscast, as he did not believe that he could serve as a believable love interest for Novak. He was fifty years old at the time and silver-haired (he began wearing a silver hairpiece in his movies by the 1950s)."[69]

On January 1, 1960, Stewart received news of the death of Margaret Sullavan. As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, she had a unique influence on Stewart's life. On April 17, 1961, longtime friend Gary Cooper was too ill to attend the 33rd Academy Awards ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf.[70][71] Stewart's emotional speech hinted that something was seriously wrong,[72] and the next day newspapers ran the headline, "Gary Cooper has cancer".[73] One month later, on May 13, 1961, six days after his 60th birthday, Cooper died.[74]

Collaborations with Hitchcock and Mann

In James Stewart's collaborations with director Anthony Mann, he entered the realm of the western.[75] Stewart's first appearance in a film directed by Mann came with the 1950 western _Winchester '73_. In choosing Mann (after first choice Fritz Lang declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership. The film, which became a box-office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart is a tough, vengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother (Stephen McNally).[76][77]

. Five of them were Westerns, including _The Naked Spur_ (1953).]]

Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as _Bend of the River_ (1952), _The Naked Spur_ (1953), _The Far Country_ (1954) and _The Man from Laramie_ (1955),[78] were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the American West. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws; a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.

Stewart and Mann also collaborated on other films outside the western genre. _The Glenn Miller Story_ (1954) was critically acclaimed,[79] garnering Stewart a BAFTA Award nomination,[80] and (together with _The Spirit of St. Louis_) continued Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'.[81] _Thunder Bay_, released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting, with Stewart as a Louisiana oil driller facing hostile fishermen. _Strategic Air Command_, released in 1955, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.

Stewart's starring role in _Winchester '73_ was also a turning point in Hollywood. Universal Studios, who wanted Stewart to appear in both that film and _Harvey,_ balked at his $200,000 asking price. His agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an alternate deal, in which Stewart would appear in both films for no pay, in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval. Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for _Winchester '73_ alone. Hollywood's other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying "studio system".

The second collaboration to define Stewart's career in the 1950s was with director Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart's acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires. Stewart's first movie with Hitchcock was the technologically innovative 1948 film _Rope_, shot in long "real time" takes.

'' (1954) was one of four films Stewart made with Alfred Hitchcock. Stewart became the highest-grossing star of 1954 as a result.]]

The two collaborated for the second of four times on the 1954 hit _Rear Window_, widely considered one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, loosely based on _Life_ photographer Robert Capa,[82][83] who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than he can handle, however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman (Raymond Burr) hiding evidence of a murder, and his glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery.[84] Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses.[85] It was a landmark year for Stewart becoming the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing John Wayne. Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later became the subject of a Supreme Court case _Stewart v. Abend_ (1990).[86] in _Vertigo_, 1958]] After starring in Hitchcock's remake of the director's earlier production, _The Man Who Knew Too Much_ (1956), with Doris Day, Stewart starred, with Kim Novak, in what many consider Hitchcock's most personal film, _Vertigo_ (1958).[87] The movie starred Stewart as John "Scottie" Ferguson, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing. Scottie's obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in.[88] Though the film is widely considered a classic today, _Vertigo_ met with very mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.[89] The director reportedly blamed the film's failure on Stewart looking too old to be Kim Novak's love interest, and cast Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill in _North by Northwest_ (1959), a role Stewart had very much wanted. (Grant was actually four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger.) In 2012 _Vertigo_ was ranked highest in the _Sight & Sound_ critics poll for the greatest films ever made, controversially taking the title from long-standing favorite _Citizen Kane_.[90]

Career in the 1960s and 1970s

In 1960, James Stewart received his fifth and final Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for his role in the 1959 Otto Preminger film _Anatomy of a Murder_.[91] This courtroom drama stars Stewart as Paul Biegler, the lawyer of a hot-tempered soldier (played by Ben Gazzara) who claims temporary insanity after murdering a tavern owner who raped his wife.[92][93] The film featured a career-making performance by George C. Scott as the prosecutor. The film was considered quite explicit for its time, and it was a box-office success. Stewart's nomination was one of seven for the film, and saw his transition into the final decades of his career.[94] Stewart was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.[95]

Stewart transitioned into more family-related films in the 1960s when he signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. These included the successful Henry Koster outing _Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation_ (1962),[96] and the less memorable films _Take Her, She's Mine_ (1963)[97] and _Dear Brigitte_ (1965), which featured French model Brigitte Bardot as the object of Stewart's son's infatuation.[98] Stewart starred in the Civil War period film _Shenandoah_ (1965), with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, the film was a box office success.[99][100] Another successful film, Stewart starred in the western family film _The Rare Breed_ (1966).[101]

In the early 1960s, Stewart took leading roles in three John Ford films, his first work with the director. The first, _Two Rode Together_, paired him with Richard Widmark in a Western with thematic echoes of Ford's _The Searchers_. The next, 1962's _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_, Stewart's first picture with John Wayne, is a classic "psychological" western,[102] shot in black and white film noir style featuring powerful use of shadows in the climactic sequence,[103] with Stewart as an Eastern attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (played by Lee Marvin) in a small frontier town. At story's end, Stewart's character — now a rising political figure — faces a difficult ethical choice as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The film's billing is unusual in that Stewart was given top billing over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne was listed above Stewart in the film itself.[104] The complex picture garnered mixed reviews but it became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades.[105]

'' (1962)

]] _How the West Was Won_ (which Ford co-directed, though without directing Stewart's scenes) was a western epic released in 1962. One of only a handful of movies filmed in true Cinerama, shot with three cameras and exhibited with three simultaneous projectors in theatres, _How the West Was Won_ went on to win three Oscars and reap massive box-office figures.[106][107]

_Cheyenne Autumn_ in which a white-suited Stewart played Wyatt Earp in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie, was released in 1964,[108] failed domestically and was quickly forgotten. The historical drama was Ford's final Western and Stewart's last feature film with Ford. Stewart's entertainingly memorable middle sequence is not directly connected with the rest of the film and was often excised from the lengthy film in later theatrical exhibition prints and some television broadcasts.[109][110][111]

As an aviator, Stewart was particularly interested in aviation films and had pushed to appear in several in the 1950s, including _No Highway in the Sky_ (1951), and _Strategic Air Command_ (1955) and _The Spirit of St. Louis_ (1957). He continued in this vein in the 1960s, in a role as a hard-bitten pilot in _The Flight of the Phoenix_ (1965). Subbing for Stewart, famed stunt pilot and air racer Paul Mantz was killed when he crashed the "Tallmantz Phoenix P-1", the specially made, single-engined movie airplane, in an abortive "touch-and-go".[112] Stewart also narrated the film _X-15_ in 1961.[113] In 1964, he and several other military aviators, including Curtis LeMay, Paul Tibbets, Bruce Sundlun and Arthur Godfrey, became the founding directors on the board of Executive Jet Aviation Corporation.[114]

'']] After a progression of lesser western films in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stewart transitioned from cinema to television. In the 1950s he had made guest appearances on the _Jack Benny Program_. Stewart first starred in the NBC comedy _The Jimmy Stewart Show_, on which he played a college professor. It was poorly received and Stewart was secretly upset that his wife Gloria was not granted the role of his wife on the show. He disliked the immense amount of work needed to film the show each week; it seemed like he was filming one short film per week. He was relieved when it was canceled after one season. He followed it with the CBS mystery _Hawkins_, in which he played a small town lawyer investigating cases, similar to his character in _Anatomy of a Murder._ The series garnered Stewart a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Dramatic TV Series. The TV series failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with _Shaft_, another high-quality series but with a starkly conflicting demographic, and was canceled after one season. However, author Wesley Hyatt suggested that it was canceled at the request of Stewart due to his fatigue. During this time, Stewart periodically appeared on Johnny Carson's _The Tonight Show_, sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, _Jimmy Stewart and His Poems_ (1989).[115][116] After Stewart participated in the Broadway revival of _Harvey_ in 1970, he announced his "semi-retirement" from acting in 1971.

Stewart returned to films after an absence of five years with a major supporting role in John Wayne's final film, _The Shootist_ (1976) where Stewart played a doctor giving Wayne's gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. At one point, both Wayne and Stewart were flubbing their lines repeatedly and Wayne told Don Siegel, "if you want the scene done better, you'd better get yourself a couple of better actors." Later, Wayne commented privately than Stewart knew the lines, but could not hear his cues. Stewart also appeared in supporting roles in _Airport '77_,[117] the 1978 remake of _The Big Sleep_ starring Robert Mitchum as Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe,[118] and _The Magic of Lassie_ (1978).[119] Despite mixed critical reviews, _Airport '77_ was a box office success.[120][121] _The Big Sleep_ received poor reviews and _The Magic of Lassie_ flopped at the box office.[122][123]

Later career

Following the failure of _The Magic of Lassie_, James Stewart went into semi-retirement from acting. In the 1980s and '90s, he did voiceover work for commercials for Campbell's Soups.[124]

Stewart's longtime friend Henry Fonda died in 1982, and former co-star and friend Grace Kelly died after a car crash shortly afterward. A few months later, Stewart starred with Bette Davis in _Right of Way_. He filmed several television movies in the 1980s, including _Mr. Krueger's Christmas_, which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[125] In 1991, James Stewart voiced the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the movie _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West_, which was his last film role.[126]

He made frequent visits to the Reagan White House and traveled on the lecture circuit. The re-release of his Hitchcock films gained Stewart renewed recognition. _Rear Window_ and _Vertigo_ were particularly praised by film critics, which helped bring these pictures to the attention of younger movie-goers. He was presented with an Academy Honorary Award by Cary Grant in 1985, "for his 50 years of memorable performances, for his high ideals both on and off the screen, with respect and affection of his colleagues".[127] Shortly before his 80th birthday, he was asked how he wanted to be remembered. "As someone who 'believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community.'"[128]


Personal life

from 1949 until her death in 1994.]]

Marriage and family

Stewart's first interaction his with future wife, Gloria Hatrick McLean, was at Keenan Wynn's Christmas party in 1941. He had crashed the party and became inebriated, leaving a poor impression of himself with Hatrick. A year later, Gary Cooper and his wife Veronica invited Hatrick and Stewart to a dinner party, hoping that Hatrick would cure end Stewart's bachelor life. Having conversed, Hatrick and Stewart realized they had a lot in common and began dating. A former model, Hatrick was divorced from with two children. As Stewart loved to recount in self-mockery, "I, I, I pitched the big question to her last night and to my surprise she, she, she said yes!" Stewart and Hatrick were married at Brentwood Presbyterian Church on August 9, 1949. Stewart adopted her two sons, Michael and Ronald, and with Gloria, he had twin daughters, Judy and Kelly, on May 7, 1951. The couple remained married until her death from lung cancer on February 16, 1994, at the age of 75. Ronald was killed in action in Vietnam on June 8, 1969, at the age of 24, while serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.[129][130] Daughter Kelly Stewart is an evolutionary anthropologist.[131]

Friendships, interests, and character

When Henry Fonda moved to Hollywood in 1934, he was again a roommate with James Stewart in an apartment in Brentwood, and the two gained reputations as playboys. Both men's children later noted that their favorite activity when not working seemed to be quietly sharing time together while building and painting model airplanes, a hobby they had taken up in New York years earlier.

In addition to Stewart's lucrative film career, he had diversified investments including real estate, oil wells, a charter-plane company and membership on major corporate boards, and he became a multimillionaire.[132] Stewart was active in philanthropy over the years. His signature charity event, "The Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon Race", held each year since 1982, has raised millions of dollars for the Child and Family Development Center at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.[133] He donated his papers, films, and other records to Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library in 1983.[134] He was a lifelong supporter of Scouting, having been a Second Class Scout when he was a youth, an adult Scout leader, and a recipient of the prestigious Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). In later years, he made advertisements for the BSA, which led to his being sometimes incorrectly identified as an Eagle Scout.[135] An award for Boy Scouts, "The James M. Stewart Good Citizenship Award" has been presented since May 17, 2003.[136]

Stewart was a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of California.[137] Stewart was almost universally described by his collaborators as a kind, soft-spoken man and a true professional. Joan Crawford praised the actor as an "endearing perfectionist" with "a droll sense of humor and a shy way of watching you to see if you react to that humor".[138] One of Stewart's lesser-known talents was his homespun poetry. Once, while on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_, he read a poem entitled "Beau" that he had written about his dog. By the end of this reading, Carson's eyes were welling with tears.[139] This was later parodied on a late 1980s episode of the NBC sketch show _Saturday Night Live,_ with Dana Carvey as Stewart reciting the poem on _Weekend Update_ and bringing anchor Dennis Miller to tears. He was also an avid gardener. Stewart purchased the house next door to his Beverly Hills home, had it razed, and installed his garden on the lot.[140]

Political views

on Inauguration Day, 1981, in Washington D.C.]] James Stewart was a staunch Republican[141] and actively campaigned for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. He was a hawk on the Vietnam War, and maintained that his son, Ronald, did not die in vain. Stewart actively supported Reagan's bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976.[142] In association with politicians and celebrities such as President Ronald Reagan, Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, California Governor George Deukmejian, Bob Hope and Charlton Heston, Stewart worked from 1987 to 1993 on projects that enhanced the public appreciation and understanding of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Stewart, Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck issued a statement calling for support of President Lyndon Johnson's Gun Control Act of 1968.[143][144]

In 1988, Stewart made an impassioned plea in Congressional hearings, along with, among many others, Burt Lancaster, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, and film director Martin Scorsese, against Ted Turner's decision to 'colorize' classic black and white films, including _It's a Wonderful Life_. Stewart stated, "the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It's morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should leave our film industry alone". In 1989, Stewart founded the American Spirit Foundation to apply entertainment industry resources to developing innovative approaches to public education and to assist the emerging democracy movements in the former Iron Curtain countries.[145]

One of his best friends was fellow actor Henry Fonda, despite the fact that the pair had very different political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" However, Jane Fonda told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not know whether it was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their film _The Cheyenne Social Club._ In the last years of his life, he donated to the campaign of Bob Dole for the 1996 presidential election and to Democratic Florida governor Bob Graham in his successful run for the Senate.[146]

Final years and death

Stewart's wife Gloria was diagnosed with lung cancer in fall 1993. She began chemotherapy but quit treatment soon afterward after learning that her life would only be minimally prolonged with treatment. She died on February 16, 1994, after Stewart delivered at her bedside a two-hour monologue about their life together. Stewart biographer Donald Dewey said that Gloria's death left Stewart depressed and "lost at sea". After her death, Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children. Stewart shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans but also his co-stars and friends. However, Stewart's friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said of Stewart that he was not depressed or unhappy but finally allowed to rest and be alone, which was something he liked to do anyway.

James Stewart was hospitalized after falling in December 1995.[147] In December 1996, he was due to have the battery in his pacemaker changed but opted not to, preferring to let things happen naturally. In February 1997, he was hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat. On June 25, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism one week later. Surrounded by his children on July 2, 1997, Stewart died of a heart attack at the age of 89 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, with his final words to his family being, "I'm going to be with Gloria now."[148] President Bill Clinton commented that America had lost a "national treasure ... a great actor, a gentleman and a patriot".[149] Over 3,000 mourners, mostly celebrities, attended Stewart's memorial service, which included full military honors.[150] Stewart's body was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.[151]


Legacy

According to biographer Marc Eliot, Stewart's legacy is the "image of the American idealist" preserved in his film performances. After Stewart's death, Charlton Heston observed, "He was the quintessential American face...He was a role model and inspiration." In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Stewart third on its list of the greatest American male actors.[152]

Stewart's film career spanned over fifty-five years, from 1935 to 1991. During that time, he appeared in 80 films. He cultivated a versatile career and recognized screen image in such classics as _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_, _The Mortal Storm_,[153] _The Philadelphia Story_, _Harvey_, _It's a Wonderful Life_, _Shenandoah_,[154] _The Glenn Miller Story_,[155] _Rear Window_, _Rope_, _The Man Who Knew Too Much_,[156] _The Shop Around the Corner_, _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ and _Vertigo_.[157][158] He is the most represented leading actor on the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list presented by _Entertainment Weekly_.[159] As of 2019, twelve of his films have been inducted into the United States National Film Registry.[160]

In 1972, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.[161] Two of his characters—George Bailey and Jefferson Smith—made AFI's list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, both of them heroes.[162] He worked for many renowned directors during his career, among them Frank Capra, George Cukor, Henry Hathaway,[163] Cecil B. DeMille,[164] Ernst Lubitsch, Frank Borzage, George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Billy Wilder,[165] Don Siegel,[166] and Anthony Mann.[167][168]

Stewart's legacy extends to the United States military, where he interrupted his successful film career to serve in the United States Army at a time when many actors in Hollywood were actively trying to avoid service. He was the first major movie star to serve in World War II[169], and influenced over one hundred thousand people to enlist in the military. In 1985 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.[170] A number of Stewart's film have become classics of American cinema, with five of his pictures (_It's a Wonderful Life_, _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_, _Rear Window_, _The Philidelphia Story_, and _Vertigo_) featured on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films of all time. Stewart and Robert DeNiro share the title for the most films represented on the list.[171][172] _Harvey_ and _The Philidelphia Story_ were included in the AFI's list of the Greatest American Comedies.[173] His hesitant drawl was one of his most distinctive qualities and remains instantly recognizable.[174][175][]

Memorials

On May 20, 1995, his 87th birthday, The James M. Stewart Foundation was created to honor James Stewart. In concert with his family members, the foundation also established The Jimmy Stewart Museum in his hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania. The foundation was created to "preserve, promote and enshrine the accomplishments of James M. Stewart, actor, soldier, civic leader, and world citizen..." The registered office is at 835 Philadelphia Street, Indiana, Pa, 15701 and is located within easy walking distance of his place of birth, the home in which he grew up, and the former location of his father's hardware store. A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse, just feet from the museum. The Jimmy Stewart Museum houses movie posters and photos, awards, personal artifacts, a gift shop and an intimate 1930s-era theatre in which his films are regularly shown.[176] Additionally, the Indiana County–Jimmy Stewart Airport was named in his honor.[177] In 1997, Princeton University, Stewart's alma mater, honored Stewart with the dedication of the James M. Stewart Theater along with a retrospective of Stewart's work.[178] Stewart has also been honored with his own postal stamp as part of the "Legends of Hollywood" stamp series.[179] The library at Brigham Young University houses his personal papers and movie memorabilia including letters, scrapbooks, and recordings of early radio programs.[180][181] On February 8, 1960 Stewart was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1700 Vine Street for his contribution to the film industry.[182][183]


Awards and nominations

James Stewart was the recipient of many official accolades throughout his life, receiving film industry awards, military and civilian medals, honorary degrees, and memorials and tributes for his contribution to the performing arts, humanitarianism, and military service. In February 1980, Stewart was honored by Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, along with U.S. Senator Jake Garn, U.S. Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, singer John Denver, and Tom Abraham, a businessman from Canadian, Texas, who worked with immigrants seeking to become U.S. citizens.[184] Stewart received the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1965, an award meant to honor "outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment".[185] In 1984, Stewart received the Academy Honorary Award.[186] His roles in _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_, _The Philadelphia Story_, _It's a Wonderful Life_, _Harvey_, and _Anatomy of a Murder_ earned him Academy Award nominations—with one win for _The Philadelphia Story_.[187][188]
