_HYDROCOTYLE SIBTHORPIOIDES_ is a small plant native to southeastern Asia. It is also referred to as LAWN MARSHPENNYWORT.[1] It is a dicot, traditionally placed in the family Apiaceae, but more recently suggested to belong in the Apiaceae.[2] It grows in great abundance when the conditions are right. _Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides_ originated in southeastern Asia, but is slowly spreading in the United States, along with other places around the world. It can grow in a wide variety of habitats. This plant has been used for medicinal purposes in Asia.


Description

The leaf width ranges from 0.5 to 2Â cm. The plant has a moderate growth rate[3] and produces small flowers. The flowers are a faint yellow with a hint of purple.[4] Flower clusters are simple and flat-topped or rounded. There are inconspicuous involucral bracts at the base of each flower and indistinct sepals. The leaves are simple, with small leafy outgrowth at the base, kidney-shaped to round. Leaf edges are scalloped. The leaves of _H. sibthorpioides_ are broad and alternate. The peltate leaves are often described as egg-shaped; all of the leaves are hairless and they often have five to seven shallow lobes around the edge. _H. sibthorpioides_ has fruits that are flat, and that break in half when the plant reaches maturity. Once the fruit has broken open, there is one seed on each side.[5] The fruits are elliptical to round with thin ridges and no oil tubes (vitta), which is characteristic in the fruit of umbelliferous plants.[6]


Taxonomy

_Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides_ is traditionally treated within the family Apiaceae,[7] although recent results place it in the Araliaceae.[8] A moleculary phylogeny shows _H. sibthorpioides_ to be closely related to _H. americana_, _H. bonariensis_, _H. bowlesioides_, _H. hirsute_, and _H. umbellata_, among others.[9]


Distribution and habitat

_Hydrocoytle sibthorpioides_ is most commonly found in southeastern Asia. Although is native to Asia, there are parts of the United States where this plant thrives as an introduced species, particularly in the eastern US, and some areas in California.[10] Recently, _H. sibthorpioides_ has been reported to flourish in southeast Australia, where it occurs in Brisbane and Sydney. However this plant is not found in Western Australia.[11] This species is able to grow in a wide variety of habitats, from dry areas to locations which are occasionally submerged. It can also be found between sidewalk cracks, and is increasingly occurring as a lawn weed.[12]


Culture

For the plant to reach its full growth it must have full sunlight.[13] It can tolerate temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius but grows best when the temperature stays between 20 and 28 degrees Celsius. It has a pH soil preference that ranges from 5 to 7. The propagation for this plant is mostly by cuttings.[14]


Conservation status

The conservation status for _Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides_ is of least concern; it continues to grow and spread throughout the United States along with other regions of the world such as Australia.[15]


Medical uses

_Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides_ is used to treat asthma in areas of Nepal. Bengali villagers use the entire plant to help heal bone fractures.[16] The plant extract has also been used to treat edema, fever, throat pain, psoriasis, and the hepatitis B virus.[17] The different extracts of this plant is found to be free from toxicity upto a dose of 2000 mg/kg in rats.
