KUMEYAAY ASTRONOMY OR COSMOLOGY (Kumeyaay: _My Uuyow_, "sky knowledge") comprises the astronomical knowledge of the Kumeyaay people.[1] A deeply rooted cosmological belief system was developed and followed by the Kumeyaay civilization based on this knowledge including the computing of time (Kumeyaay Matâ€™taam).[2]

The first evidence of astronomical observations and visual registration was discovered in the El Vallecito archeological zone. The "Men in a square" rupestric painting located at El Diablito area of El Vallecito depicted a square that aligns with sunlight on the Fall equinox. These paintings were made by the nomadic(?) Kumeyaay people.[3][4] Kumeyaay sand paintings and rock art modeled the passage of the sun, moon, and constellations.[5]

Observation areas were made by the Kumeyaay to watch and register astronomical events. However many were destroyed by vandals before protection measures were instituted.[6]
