HAKEEM MUATA OLUSEYI[1] (born JAMES EDWARD PLUMMER, JR.[2]) is an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, inventor, educator, science communicator, author, actor, and humanitarian.


Early life and education

Oluseyi was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. After his parents divorced when he was four years old, he and his mother moved to a different state along the southern border of the US every year. He lived in some of the country's toughest neighborhoods including the 9th Ward of New Orleans; Watts, Los Angeles, California; Inglewood, California; South Park, Houston, Texas; and Third Ward, Houston, Texas before settling in rural Mississippi a month before Oluseyi turned 13 years old. He completed middle school and high school in the East Jasper School District graduating as his high school's valedictorian in 1985. Oluseyi served in the U.S. Navy from 1984 to 1986. He credits the Navy with teaching him algebra.[3]

After leaving the Navy with an honorable discharge, Oluseyi enrolled in Tougaloo College where he earned Bachelor of Science degrees in physics and mathematics. He earned MS and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Stanford University[4] under the mentorship of the late Professor Arthur B. C. Walker Jr. from whom he learned experimental space research. Under Walker's tutelage, Oluseyi helped to design, build, calibrate, and launch the Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array, which pioneered normal incidence extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray imaging of the Sun's transition region and corona.


Career

Since 2007, he has been a professor of Physics & Space Sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology. His academic rank is Distinguished Research Professor.[5] He is temporarily stationed at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC where he is the Space Sciences Education Manager for NASA's Science Mission Directorate via the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility Program.[6]

His best known scientific contributions are research on the transfer of mass and energy through the Sun's atmosphere; the development of space-borne observatories for studying astrophysical plasmas and dark energy; and the development of transformative technologies in ultraviolet optics,[7][8][9][10] detectors,[11][12][13][14] computer chips,[15][16][17][18] and ion propulsion.[19]

Oluseyi appears as a commentator and scientific authority on Science Channel television shows including _How the Universe Works_, _Outrageous Acts of Science_, NASA's Unexplained Files, Space's Deepest Secrets, and _Strip the Cosmos_.[20] He lent his voice and scientific expertise to the award-winning science education video game _ExoTrex: A Space Science Adventure Game_ in collaboration with Dig-It! Games.[21]

He co-authored the children's popular science book _Discovery Spaceopedia: The Complete Guide to Everything Space_.[22]
