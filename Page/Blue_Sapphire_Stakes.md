The BLUE SAPPHIRE STAKES is a Melbourne Racing Club Group 3 Thoroughbred horse race held over 1200 metres at set weights for three-year-old horses at Caulfield Racecourse, Melbourne, Australia. Total prize money for the race is A$350,000.


History

The current rendition of The Blue Sapphire Stakes was inaugurated in 2012 with prizemoney of A$$250,000.[1] Originally, from 2005 the MRC scheduled a two year old race in May known as the Blue Saphhire Classic.[2] However, the MRC decided to reformat their Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival in 2012 by adding a new three year old race for sprinters. Entries which were nominated for the Blue Diamond Stakes earlier in the year as two-year-olds were automatically nominated for this event.[3]

In 2012 the race was held on Caulfield Guineas day but since 2014 the race was moved to the second day of the carnival, the Wednesday meeting.[4]
