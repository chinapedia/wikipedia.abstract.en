Mohanlal will be appearing in his fourth film as Mahadevan after _Keerthi Chakra_ (2006), _Kurukshetra_ (2008), and _Kandahar_ (2010). Ravi said in an interview in October 2015, that unlike the previous films in the series, _Beyond Borders_ will be more like his last military film _Picket 43_ (2015), that "the focus will be on the individuals rather than the war, and will portray the relationships that are forged during the war".[2] Rahul Subramaniam, Siddharth Vipin, and Najim Arshad is composing the music for the film.
