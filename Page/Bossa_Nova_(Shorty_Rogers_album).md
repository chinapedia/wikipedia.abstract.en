_BOSSA NOVA_ (also released as _RETURN TO RIO_) is an album by American jazz trumpeter, composer and arranger Shorty Rogers, released on the Reprise label in 1962.[1]


Reception

On All About Jazz Dave Rickert said: "_Bossa Nova_ must have appeared fresh at the time—it was recorded in 1962, a year before the Brazilian music craze—but now seems buried in a pack of like-minded albums. Rogers did have the presence of mind to recruit a guitarist and a few percussionists to give the music an authentic flavor, and the music is earnestly played. However, bossa nova works best with a less rambunctious approach. Rogers never seemed capable of approaching anything delicately, and he overwhelms the melodies with brassy riffs. Not bad, but when you’re tempted to reach for a big band or a bossa nova record, _Bossa Nova_ won’t come to mind in either case".[2] On Allmusic, Scott Yanow noted: "The emphasis is on ensembles with occasional statements from Rogers but surprisingly little happens. The overall results are pleasant but a bit of a disappointment".[3]
