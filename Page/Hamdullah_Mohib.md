_' Hamdullah Mohib_' (born 1983) is an Afghan diplomat. He currently serves as the National Security Adviser of Afghanistan. Mohib served as the Afghan Ambassador to the United States since September 2015 until he began his tenure as National Security Adviser on August 25, 2018. He also served as non-resident Ambassador to Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, and Colombia. During his tenure as Ambassador, Mohib has focused on redefining the country’s narrative in the United States to reflect the new realities of Afghanistan as a young democracy moving steadily on a path to prosperity and peace as a result of the social change and institutional development that has taken place over the past 16 years.

As Ambassador, he has focused on highlighting the critical yet under-credited role of cultural and peace initiatives, women, and youth in re-creating Afghanistan. To this end, his priorities have been engaging with the Afghan diaspora across the United States; elevating the efforts of Afghan women toward social, political, and economic development; engaging with active US military and veterans who have served in Afghanistan; and implementing a comprehensive cultural and public diplomacy initiative within US schools, universities, and local organizations.

In the summer of 2017, President Trump announced his administration’s policy for a renewed long-term engagement in Afghanistan, a result of months of intensive dialogue between Afghanistan and the United States.

As Ambassador, Mohib has emphasized the need to strengthen the U.S.-Afghan partnership on shared areas of interest, including economic development, anti-corruption efforts, and counterterrorism.[1]

On August 25, 2018, Mohib was appointed Afghanistan's national security adviser replacing Mohammed Haneef Atmar in Afghan president Ashraf Ghani's government.[2]
