_SOUNDBREAKING: STORIES FROM THE CUTTING EDGE OF RECORDED MUSIC_ is an 8-hour ‘mega-documentary’ series documenting the art of music production and recording, that charts a century’s worth of innovation and experimentation in the creation of recorded music. The series is the last project of legendary Beatles producer Sir George Martin. Sir George believed that the history and innovation of recorded music is one of the great untold stories of the 20th century.

Soundbreaking explores the impact and artistry of technical innovations in how sound was captured, how music recording evolved, and the impact these monumental changes had on how we make and relate to music. It combines unprecedented access to some of the most celebrated recording artists, producers and innovators with rare archival studio footage and an extensive musical soundtrack – over 40 songs per episode – to deliver the most wide-ranging series ever produced on the art of music recording. The Soundbreaking series is high-energy and driven by the music and stories of the artists, producers and innovators themselves.

Soundbreaking features more than 150 original interviews including: Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Joni Mitchell, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Linda Perry, Barry Gibb, Elton John, Debbie Harry, Quincy Jones, B.B. King, Annie Lennox, Dave Stewart, Mark Knopfler, Tom Petty, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Lindsey Buckingham, Rosanne Cash, Don Was, Steven Van Zandt, Sheila E, Questlove, Ben Harper, Billy Idol, Beck, Imogen Heap, Darryl McDaniels, RZA, Bon Iver, Nile Rodgers, Nigel Godrich, Q-tip, Brian Eno, Mark Ronson, Rick Rubin, Tony Visconti and more.

Soundbreaking was first previewed at SXSW in March 2016 and began airing publicly in the US on PBS on November 14, 2016.[1] Distributed internationally by FremantleMedia, SOUNDBREAKING has also aired in over 30 countries globally.

In September 2017, _The Hollywood Reporter_ “Power Rankings of Must-Watch Non-Fiction TV” listed it as the #2 non-fiction television series, ahead of Ken Burns’ “Vietnam War” and CNN’s “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown”.
