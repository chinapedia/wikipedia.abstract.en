ROSE STERN (17 November 1869 - October 1953) was an educator from Birmingham, England. She served as science mistress at North London Collegiate School for Ladies.[1] While a student at Mason College, she was the first woman student to become a member of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain & Ireland (later the Royal Institute of Chemistry). A proponent of grounding chemistry instruction in domestic science, she published _A method of teaching chemistry in schools_ (with Alice Maude Hughes, 1906) and _A short history of chemistry_ (1924).


Early life and education

Rose Stern was born on 17 November 1869 in Birmingham, England, to Moritz Stern (born 1833) and Fanny Schwartz (born 1845), both of German origin. Her paternal grandparents were Marcus (1797-1869) and Flora (1800-1858) Stern. Rose was the third of seven children.[2]

Stern graduated in 1889 from King Edward VI High School for Girls, Birmingham,[3] one of the rare girls schools to offer a strong science curriculum.[4] She then attended Mason College. She was the first women student to become a member of the Mason College Chemical Society. At the associate level, three women members had preceded Stern after the club's formation in 1884: Emily Lloyd, Jessie Charles and Constance Naden.[5]

Stern was also the first woman student to become a member of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain & Ireland (later the Royal Institute of Chemistry).[6][7] Stern is listed in the _Register of Fellows, Associates and Students_ of the Institute of Chemistry as having been admitted as of 17 February 1893. Her address is given as 241, Bristol Road, Birmingham.[8]

Stern received her B. Sc. from Mason College in 1894.[9][10]


Career

From 1897 to 1902, Stern worked as a science mistress at the County School, Bangor. In 1902, Stern became a science mistress at North London Collegiate School for Ladies (later "for Girls").[11] NLCS had been founded by Frances Mary Buss (1827-1894), whose father Robert Buss was the first science teacher at the school. Both Frances Mary Buss and her successor Sophie Willock (Dr. Sophie Bryant) emphasized the importance of teaching "real science."[12]

The students at NLCS had a Science Club, whose founder and first president, science mistress Grace Heath, had died in 1895.[13] Soon after her arrival in 1902, Miss Stern was elected President of the Science Club.[14] The students also published their own hand-written illustrated science magazine, _The Searchlight_.[15] This emphasis on science was extremely uncommon for girls' schools of that time.[16] NLCS became a model for other girls' schools around the world.[17]

In 1906, Stern and Alice Maude Hughes, a science mistress from L. C. C. Secondary School, Eltham, published _A method of teaching chemistry in schools_. They presented a series of experiments in chemistry that were suitable for children, requiring them to keep laboratory notebooks about their activities and questions, save samples, and work from familiar to unknown areas.[18][19]

Stern, with others including Lilian Faithfull, Ida Freund, Charlotte Laurie, Jessie Charles White, and Arthur Smithells debated the proper teaching of science to girls. Rose Stern argued for a blended approach to teaching in which pure chemistry and applied chemistry were presented using familiar substances from kitchen and food preparation. She suggested that using household chemicals in chemistry class would enable girls to better appreciate academic chemistry.[20][21]

There was considerable resistance to Stern and Smithells' idea that "domestic science" could involve enough science to be taken seriously. It is an approach that continues to be advocated.[22]

In 1924, Stern published _A short history of chemistry_. She is credited on title page as "Rose Stern, B.Sc. Senior Science Mistress, North London Collegiate School for Girls".[23]

The idea of introducing chemistry to students through the history of major people and discoveries was novel. As one reviewer noted:

Miss Stern is listed as having been a member of the staff at NLCS from 1902-1930.[24] During her career at NLCS, Stern inspired generations of young women.[25]

According to the North London Collegiate School Magazine, Miss Stern broke one of her legs during World War II. After a period of increasing disability at her home in Fairwarp, she died in October 1953.[26]
