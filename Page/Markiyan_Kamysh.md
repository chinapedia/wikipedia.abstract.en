MARKIYAN KAMYSH (, born 19 October 1988) is a Ukrainian novelist.


Biography

Markiyan Kamysh purports to represent a Chernobyl "underground" in literature.[1] He claims that, for seven years, he has been illegally investigating and writing about the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. He also claims that he has made several expeditions behind the barbed wire and lived in the Zone for more than a year, and has walked more than 10,000 km within the Zone.[2]

_A Stroll to the Zone_

Kamysh's 2015 debut novel, _A Stroll to the Zone_, about illegal Chernobyl tourists has been called the most sensational debut of Ukrainian literature.[3] Six months after its publication in Ukraine and after positive reviews, it was translated into French and published by Groupe Flammarion.

In France, the novel was released under the title _La Zone_. French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur has called it _“Stunning book”_.[4] Monaco Hebdo magazine has included it in the list of choices of the month.[5] The Italian publishing house Keller Editore has bought rights to this text and signed an agreement on translation and publication of _La Zone_ in Italy.[6]

The Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov said about this text: "The book 'A Stroll to the Zone' (La Zone)" by Markian Kamysh is definitely double discovery for any reader! The first discovery is the author himself with his vivid and very dynamic narrative, and the other one - the content of the book that will open for you completely unknown reality - life in Chernobyl zone behind the barbed wire, life described by those who made this zone their secret and illegal playground. Markian Kamysh is one of them and that's why the book is also an honest first hand experience!.''

Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi, director of the film _The Tribe_, called _A Stroll to the Zone_ "a new breath and new voice in Ukrainian literature".[7]
