CELGOSIVIR, in development by Migenix for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is an oral prodrug of the natural product castanospermine that inhibits alpha-glucosidase I, an enzyme that plays a critical role in viral maturation by initiating the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides of viral envelope glycoproteins. Celgosivir is well absorbed _in vitro_ and _in vivo_, and is rapidly converted to castanospermine. Celgosivir has a novel mechanism of action (preventing the glycosylation of viral proteins by the host), and demonstrates broad antiviral activity _in vitro_.[1]


Clinical trials

Celgosivir is not efficient as a monotherapy for the treatment of HCV, but has demonstrated a synergistic effect in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, both _in vitro_ and in phase II clinical trials that last up to 1 year in patients with chronic HCV infection. Celgosivir may prove to be a valuable component for combination therapy and may help to prevent the apparition of drug resistance. Long-term toxicity studies are necessary to confirm the safety of celgosivir in humans.[2]

Although generally safe and well tolerated, celgosivir does not seem to reduce viral load or fever burden in patients with dengue fever.[3]
