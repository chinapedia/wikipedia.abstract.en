The MONTEVERDE THEME PARK, previously known as FROG POND RANARIUM (), located in Santa Elena, north of Monteverde, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, is a frog pond turned animal theme park that houses a butterfly farm with approximately 30 live butterflies species[1] and other insects and over 25 species of frogs and other amphibians from around the country in a climate controlled habitat.[2]

The park includes flowering plants, cascading waterfalls and trees. There are also several species of free flying "butterfly friendly" birds. There is a learning center where visitors get a close up view of a variety of live caterpillars feeding and developing on their host plants. It also hosts a newly installed 8-cable zip-line through the park's tropical forest, the only zip-line in Costa Rica open at night.[3]
