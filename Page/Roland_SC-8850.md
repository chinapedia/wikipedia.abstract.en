The ROLAND ED SC-8850 (Sound Canvas) is a GS-compatible MIDI sound module released in 1999 by Roland under the name RolandED. The SC-8850 was the first sound module to incorporate the new General MIDI Level 2 standard. The SC-8850 uses a PCM sampling engine, supports 128-voice polyphony with 64-part multitimbrality. It came preloaded with the soundsets of all older Sound Canvas models, as well as the CM-32 and MT-32. The 8850 is infamous for playing MIDIs from other models incorrectly, by mapping certain instruments incorrectly. Aimed at personal computer users, the SC-8850 features 1,703 instrument patches, including the GS sounds and additional GM2 sounds. The selection of effects includes reverb, chorus, and Roland's own Insertion EFX, which adds effects like vibrato, distortion, tremolo, etc.


SC-8820

Alongside the SC-8850, Roland released the Roland ED SC-8820, an inexpensive cut-down version of the MIDI module, smaller than the 8850. Both sound canvases could be rackmounted alongside each other. The Roland SC-8820 model lacks the large LCD screen and extended controls of the SC-8850. Some sounds are different in comparison to the 8850, but has a map that is compatible with the 8850. Both models have external appearance similar to Roland's older models.

The Sound Canvas VA plugin emulates an SC-8820. However, it sounds a bit different.[1]


SC-D70

In 2001, Roland released the Roland ED SC-D70, which was a SC-8820 with a digital output, among other differences. It had a sampling rate of 44.1/48 kHz, instead of 32 kHz sounds the SC-8820 had. The sample rate could be selected between 44.1 and 48. The SC-D70 also lacks a map select button on the module, meaning you must send sysex messages to change the map. The SC-D70 is the only Sound Canvas module, bar the Studio Canvas models, like the SD-90, that had a digital output.


Sound Canvas and Keyboard

In 1994, Roland introduced their SK series (Sound Canvas and Keyboard), which combines a sound canvas and a portable MIDI controller.

The SK-500 was an SC-8820 with a 49-key keyboard.
