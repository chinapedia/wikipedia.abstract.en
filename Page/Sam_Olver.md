SAM OLVER (born 17 October 1994) is a professional rugby union player currently playing at Ealing Trailfinders following spells at Worcester Warriors and Northampton Saints.

He was coached at Oundle School by his father, John Olver,[1] ex-England player.

Olver made his debut for Saints in 2013 when he came off the bench against Gloucester Rugby in the Anglo-Welsh Cup on 9 November 2013 where Olver's side won 33-6. The fly-half also scored his first points for the club during that game as he converted Alex Day's try in the 75th minute.

The fly-half made his Aviva Premiership debut the following season, coming on as a replacement in Saints' trip to Welford Road to face Leicester Tigers on 16 May 2015.[2] Olver, however, is yet to score in the top-flight of English rugby, rather scoring all his 38 points in a Saints shirt so far in the Anglo-Welsh Cup.

Olver was also recognised with International age-group call-ups.[3] The youngster played in four tests for the England U20s during their 2014 Six Nations Under 20s Championship.[4] Olver scored 31 points during that competition including kicking the winning penalty as England faced Argentina on 10 June 2014.[5]

Olver helped Saints' second team the Northampton Wanderers reach the Aviva 'A' League Final in 2016/17 season, kicking 17 points in the final as Saints beat Gloucester United to lift the trophy.[6]

It was announced that Olver would leave current side Northampton Saints at the conclusion of the 2016/17 season and link up with fellow Aviva Premiership side Worcester Warriors after making 14 appearances in a Saints shirt.[7][8] On 6 April 2018, Olver leaves Worcester to join RFU Championship side Ealing Trailfinders ahead of the 2018-19 season.[9]
