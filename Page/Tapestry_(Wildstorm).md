TAPESTRY is a fictional comic book villainess who has appeared in books published by Wildstorm Productions and DC Comics. Created by artist Jim Lee and writer Brandon Choi, she first appeared in _WildC.A.T.s_Sourcebook #2 (November 1993) and in later publishings as an antagonist to Zealot and the WildC.A.T.s is Issue #11 (June 1994), during the period when Wildstorm and its properties were owned by Jim Lee.

Within story Tapestry was an ancient godlike sorceress with a mean streak for obsessive possession and domineering cruelty, the mortal enemy to former Coda Magestrix; Zannah of Khera, who pledged her services to the evil mystic at a terrible price millennia ago. Like a great many of the Wildstorm Character roster, Tapestry, too, was given away when the imprint and ownership of all Wildstorm characters was sold by Lee to DC Comics In 1999. But her entire character profile remained the same regardless.


Fictional character biography

The dark witch Domina who had come to be known as Tapestry was once a high ranking mage among a mystic council loyal to the King of Atlantis; Lord S'ylton, a Kherubim Lord and the father of Backlash. A god-powerful and dangerous craft user who has a secret tie to Zealot's past, she helped S'ylton and other allies of Atlantis battle the invasive D'rahn who threatened to overrun the world and its human population, but they were betrayed by one of their own and the lost kingdom fell beneath the waves.[1] Some three thousand years later Zannah ventured towards the new lair of the fate weaver in order to heal her ailing sister (her daughter in actuality) Kenesha who suffered from an unknown affliction. In return Domina enslaved Zealot for nigh on a century, seeking to dominate and corrupt her, body and soul towards the evil witch's way of thinking.

In that time of servitude Tapestry would teach she who had come to be known as Zealot in the ways for dark magics, her area of expertise, to better sway and bolster control over her derided slave; for the power she bestowed was corrupting as it was intoxicating, threatening to overcome the alien immortal if overused. The focus of all this was to craft Zealot in her image, to create a like minded individual with whom she would overtake both the Kherubim and Daemonite races whom she felt encroached into her domain on earth. Fortunately she failed for not only did Tapestry's servant defy her will and the influence of power granted to her, she eventually escaped her clutches fleeing with her sister fully healed after besting her former mistress once in a magical duel. But Domina warned that Zealot was eternally damned, vowing one day to take her back again in another lifetime.

WildC.A.T.S Confrontation

After another couple of centuries Tapestry would return with a new servant named Soma, employing the deadly Troika; a band of super-powered mercenaries who work for the highest bidder, as well as the Raksha a deadly caste of toxic alien beings with possession, conversion and life-force draining abilities. The initial assault began when she ordered her shock troops to attack Jacob Marlowe's close ally, Alabaster Wu. Failing that one of them managed to wound Zealot with their transformative venom and possess her new coda in training Priscilla, who in turn called in the other WildC.A.T.s ending in them all aptly subdued by the TRI-AD rogues in the weavers employ.[2] Sensing they are being watched, Tapestry smiles as she looks back at her would be observers. Deeply frightening Zealot who immediately recognized her from times long past, as she fled with her new compatriots Huntsmen and Marinda Tai; Tapestry went to work rewriting everyone's histories through her dark arts.

When Providence, a former acolyte of Helspont's Cabal; demanded her counterpart Void be handed over to her as per their agreement. The evil mystic betrayed her throwing the latter into her opposite number merging the two Orb wielders into one physical body with which Tapestry could draw near limitless quantities of power from. After Zannah broke her vow to never utilize the dark craft taught to her by said nemesis, Tapestry commented to her man servant that she's well aware the Troika may fail in their endeavor to capture her. But cackled expectingly as her prize gathered her ally's to face her one final time.[3] during their final battle Tapestry engaged Zealot in a duel of mystic might with one turning the other's age backwards or forwards before manifesting esoteric avatars of their respective alien acolyte or counterpart, before both began siphoning energy from the conjoined entity of Void/Providence and their amalgamated Orbs of Power. To Break the Stalemate, Marinda Tai whom had taken a crystal shard from Savant; who'ed also been watching the battle take place, handed the fragment of the Kheran Orb of Power to her sister's acquaintance; Huntsmen. As the crystal was a shard of the energy the opposite seers were accustomed to, after turning it into a Coda clef blade he slices the knots of soul bending magical forces the two are struggling and wresting from oneanother. Before an end can be reached however Soma grabs his downed mistress and teleport's himself and his mistress a long ways away using one of Savant's treasures.[4]
