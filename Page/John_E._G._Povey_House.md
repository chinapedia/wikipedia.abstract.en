The JOHN E. G. POVEY HOUSE in northeast Portland, Oregon, is a Queen Anne-style house that was built in 1891. The house is asymmetrical and is about wide by deep. It was home of glass-maker John E. G. Povey (1867â€“1917).[1]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[2] It was deemed significant for its association with John E. G. Povey and the Povey Brothers Art & Stained Glass Works company, and also for its architecture "containing high artistic merit both in the craftsmanship of the structure and the stained glass designs in many of the windows."[3]

The Povey Brothers Art Glass Works firm was founded by John E. and brother David L. Povey in Portland in 1888; it was the leading art-glass maker in the area from about 1890 to about 1920.[4]

John E. G. Povey died in the house in 1917, at age 49.[5]
