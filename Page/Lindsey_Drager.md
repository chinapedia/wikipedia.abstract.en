Lindsey_Drager.jpg LINDSEY DRAGER (born October 9, 1986) is an author and professor of creative writing at the College of Charleston.[1]


Education and career

Drager was born in Toledo, Ohio. She earned her BA in writing and English language and literature from Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, and an MFA in fiction from the University of Illinois. While at Illinois, she studied under the novelist Richard Powers and worked for Dalkey Archive Press.

After spending a year in Los Angeles working for a textbook publishing company, she entered the PhD program at the University of Denver where she worked as an editor of the _Denver Quarterly_ and a writing consultant at the St. Francis Center, a day shelter for those experiencing homelessness. She also taught writing at the Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design as well as Lighthouse Writer’s Workshop.

She is currently an assistant professor of creative writing at the College of Charleston where she teaches in the MFA program and serves as associate fiction editor of _Crazyhorse_.[2]


Writing and reception

Drager has said she is highly influenced by visual art, in particular the work of Escher.[3] In a _Tupelo Quarterly_ interview, she said, "Much of my interest has been to reveal how language behaves in certain environments, and what forces are—overtly or obliquely—governing those behaviors."[4]

Her first novel, _The Sorrow Proper_ (Dzanc, 2015), explores the hypothetical end of the public library system. Called "a remarkable and mature debut"[5] in a starred _Library Journal_ review, it was awarded the 2016 Binghamton University John Gardner Fiction Prize and received Silver in the 2015 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards in Literary Fiction. In 2017, it was made available in braille.[6]

In 2017, Dzanc released her second novel, _The Lost Daughter Collective_, a "gender-bending gothic cautionary tale".[7] The book was deemed "intelligent and densely layered" (_Kirkus Reviews_) and "formally rich" (_Publisher’s Weekly_). In her _The Rumpus_ review, Ilana Masad noted, "Drager continues to be a force and should be recognized widely for her work."[8]

Drager says her projects try to explore the questions: "What does it mean to have a body, to own a body, be a body, be bodied? How is that body constructed by others when it enters the public arena? How is that body governed by time, both the literal constructs of the temporal (bodies move always toward decay) and cultural periods, zeitgeist (bodies, depending on era, _mean differently_)? In other words: How are our bodies—like our books—authored and read?"[9]

Her influences include Rikki Ducornet, Carole Maso, Renee Gladman, Zora Neale Hurston, Kate Bernheimer, Kathryn Davis, Mary Shelley, Percival Everett, Thalia Field, Donald Barthelme, Michael Ondaatje and Herman Melville.[10]
