KANSAS SETTLEMENT is a populated place located in Sulfer Springs Valley in Cochise County, Arizona.[1] It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2]

After World War II, farming around Kansas Settlement expanded greatly, due to opening markets and better irrigation techniques.[3] However, by 1985 less than 25% of the area's irrigated farmland was still in production. The largest reason for this was the dropping levels of aquifers, which significantly increased the cost of pumping water for irrigation.[4] In one year alone, 1963, water levels in Kansas Settlement dropped by fifty feet.[5] One of the crops grown in and around Kansas Settlement are orchards of Western Schley pecans. Between May 2005 and December 2008, a large study was done in Kansas Settlement on the effects of nitrogen fertilization on the Western Schley pecan.[6]
