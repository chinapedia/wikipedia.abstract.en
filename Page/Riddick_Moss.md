MICHAEL RALLIS (born October 11, 1989) is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he competes in the developmental territory NXT under the ring name RIDDICK MOSS.[1]


Early life

Rallis attended the University of Minnesota, where he played for the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team between 2008 and 2012. After graduating college, he attended a tryout camp with the Miami Dolphins but was not signed to a contract. In October 2013, Rallis attended a WWE tryout after contacting Jim Ross.[2]


Professional wrestling career

Rallis signed a developmental contract with WWE in early 2014 and began training at the WWE Performance Center. He made his professional wrestling debut on December 18 at a NXT live event in Tampa, Florida under the ring name Digg Rawlis. He made his televised debut on the May 27, 2015, episode of _NXT_, working as an enhancement talent alongside Elias Samson in a defeat to Blake and Murphy. Rawlis made further occasional televised appearances as an enhancement talent during 2015, losing to The Hype Bros and Samoa Joe.[3] In August 2015 he adopted the new ring name Riddick Moss, a tribute to former NFL player Randy Moss.[4]

In October 2016, Moss began teaming with Tino Sabbatelli, (calling themselves the God Gifted Athletes) with the two competing in the 2016 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic where they were defeated in the first round by TM61 on the October 12 episode of _NXT_.[5] Moss made a further appearance on the January 4, 2017, episode of _NXT_, again teaming with Sabbatelli in a defeat to The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson).[6] Moss and Sabbatelli made another appearance on the May 10 episode of _NXT_, losing to #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa). The duo had their first televised victory on the October 25 episode of _NXT_, defeating the team of Oney Lorcan and Danny Burch. In early 2018, Moss and Sabbatelli entered the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic losing to Sanity in the first round. On April 25 during a match with Heavy Machinery, Sabbatelli ditched Moss, thus ending the team. In May 2018, he tore his Achilles tendon and would require several months to recuperate.[7] He would make his return from injury on a November 30, 2018 live event, losing to Matt Riddle after a surprise appearance.[8] In March 2019, he started being managed by Robert Strauss at NXT live events.[9] On the May 8, 2019 episode of NXT, Moss competed in his first televised match since his injury in a loss to Raul Mendoza.
