NEW MALDEN is a suburb of south-west London, England. It is located mainly within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, with a small part in the London Borough of Merton, and is from Charing Cross.

New Malden forms part of the historic county of Surrey. Neighbouring localities include Kingston upon Thames, Raynes Park, Surbiton, Tolworth, Wimbledon and Worcester Park.


History

New Malden was established entirely as a result of the arrival of the railway, when what is now called New Malden railway station was opened on 1 December 1846 on the main line from London Waterloo.

Building started slowly in the area just to the north of the station, gathering pace in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with two- and three-bedroom terraced houses. Further out towards Coombe Hill are larger detached and semi-detached houses from the 1930s. The name of the road which leads up the hill to Coombe, Traps Lane, is thought to derive from a farm owned by a Mrs Trap. Following the opening of the Kingston bypass in 1927, the farms to its south progressively gave way to suburban development.

Two miles (3 km) to the south is the former village of OLD MALDEN (from which New Malden gets its name) whose origins go back to Anglo-Saxon times, the name being Old English for _Mæl_ + _duna_ = "the cross on the hill".

Under the District Councils Act 1895, The Maldens & Coombe Urban District Council was created (the plural relating to Old Malden and New Malden). In 1936 Malden and Coombe was granted full Borough status, with its own Mayor, and had the rare distinction of a civic mace bearing the royal insignia of King Edward VIII. In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 came into force merging the boroughs of Malden & Coombe and Surbiton with Kingston upon Thames to form the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.

New Malden is home to the offices of several large organisations, including Nestle Purina (until 2012 when Nestle moved its UK headquarters to Gatwick [1]) and Northrop Grumman.

Demographics

Korean community

Kmart.jpg The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames has one of the largest expatriate communities of South Koreans in Europe, and is said to be one of the most densely populated areas of Koreans outside South Korea.[2] According to different sources, as of 2014 there were about 10,000 ethnic Koreans in New Malden proper,[3] and as of the same year the Korean population in the area around New Malden is around 20,000, including about 600 originating from North Korea,[4] giving it the largest group of North Koreans in Europe.[5] In the 2001 census, some small areas of New Malden had "Other Asian" (i.e., other than of Indian sub-continental origin, which also included Chinese) populations of "over 25%", though no whole ward reached over 20%. Many of the Koreans living in New Malden work for Korean companies, and they are either permanently settled and formerly expatriate, or they are still expatriates.[6]

The New Malden area has Korean language churches and nursery schools as well as restaurants and shops with Korean clientele.[7][8] New Malden functions as the shopping and cultural centre for a Korean population spread more widely across South-West London and the neighbouring counties. The area has Korean supermarkets, about 20 Korean restaurants and cafes,[9] including those serving bulgogi.[10] It also has a noraebang (Karaoke bar),[11] and many other shops. The Korean language is visible on several shop signs. The original Embassy of South Korea was in New Malden, before moving to 60 Buckingham Gate in Westminster.[12]

Some factors cited in _The Daily Telegraph_ as reasons why the Korean community formed in New Malden included a 1950s joint venture partnership between a chaebol and Racal Avionics (formerly Decca), Lord Chancellor's Walk in Coombe Lane West previously serving as the residence of the Ambassador of South Korea to the United Kingdom, and Samsung Electronics having its UK offices in New Malden until they moved to their current location in Chertsey, Surrey in 2005. Many Koreans settled in New Malden in the 1970s due to the ambassador's location.[13]

There is a Hindu Temple in the eastern part of Burlington Road.[14]

The area's last surviving cinema, the Odeon at Shannon Corner on the A3 was replaced by a large retail area including several large stores. The other cinema in the High Street (corner of Sussex Road) burnt down on Boxing Day 1936. There was also a silent cinema on Coombe Road by the station, which became the New Malden Gentlemen's Club in 1923; this closed in August 2010, and is now a Korean karaoke and pool bar.
