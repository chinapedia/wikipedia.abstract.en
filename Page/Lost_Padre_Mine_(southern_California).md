The LOST PADRE MINE is a legend about Spanish or Mexican mining activity along the "big bend" section of the San Andreas Fault during California's colonial period between 1769 and 1848.[1]


Disambiguation

There are a number of legends from former Spanish colonies around the world that refer to a _Lost Padre Mine_ or by names similar to this. The mine referred to in this short treatise is located in Kern County in southern California in the United States of America.


Other Names

The LOST PADRE MINE is the most common name found in documentation however the mine is also known by other names including the Los Padres Mine, Lost Los Padres Mine, Lost Padres Mine, and the San Emigdio silver mine.


The Legend

Stories of lost or hidden mines have been intriguing successive generations for one and a half centuries since being popularized in 19th century newspapers such as stories featured in _The Ventura Signal_ starting the same year the newspaper was founded in 1871.[2]

There are multiple stories describing lost mines in southern Kern County and northern Los Angeles County. Different stories may refer to different mines as there is more than one mine that falls under the umbrella of the Lost Padre Mine.[3]


Historical Context

Priests from the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church are thought to have established a number of secret mines along the San Andreas fault zone during the period of Spanish and later Mexican rule of California. By the time California was admitted as the thirty-first State of the Union in 1850, these early mines had effectively disappeared casting doubt that they had ever existed.[4]

Some believe priests from the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church were exploiting mineral wealth in pre-colonial California before 1768. However, there is little to support this claim in the historical record so this remote possibility is largely discounted or debunked by scholars.[5]

Very few stories about southern California's Lost Padre Mines can be substantiated and therefore appear to be apocryphal accounts arising from folklore. However, some references have a solid basis in fact.


Early Prospecting

Spanish knowledge of the interior of California was sketchy during the first decades of coastal settlement. Much of this knowledge was learned from expeditions in search of military deserters and runaway mission neophytes.[6]

On 24 August 1790, Commandante Felipe de Goycochea dispatched nine soldiers headed by Sergeant Jose Ignacio Olivera to search for a neophyte named Domingo who had run away from Mission San Buenaventura. The military dispatch was also ordered to search for mineral outcroppings (silver) reported to be in San Emigdio Canyon. While prospecting the troupe was attacked by Indians and two soldiers were killed.[7]

In 1792, a Spanish naturalist, José Longinos Martínez, visited the canyon. He believed the ore there contained silver but felt mining would be too dangerous.[8]


Physical Evidence

A pioneering, fur trapper and trader from Tennessee named Ewing Young (1799 — 1841) found physical evidence of early mining activity in southern California in the form of abandoned smelter ovens. His party made this discovery in October 1832 which was during the latter part of the Californian mission era (1769 — 1836). The location of the smelter works was near the Chumash village of Taxlipu/Tashlipun located in the mouth of San Emigdio Canyon (now part of the Wind Wolves Preserve west of Grapevine, CA).[9] [10]

Hidden in the mountains above the smelting ovens were "Spanish" mines that were in operation during the mission era. Records indicate these smelters were managed by Mission San Buenaventura[11] which was founded in 1782 and secularized in 1836. These smelters were built sometime after 1806 and before 1824.

Another "forge or furnace" used for processing antimony ore (stibnite) was documented by the renowned geologist and mineralogist William Phipps Blake. He made a thorough investigation of the site on 21 September 1853 at a place his Indian guide called "Campo de los Americanos". This discovery provided further evidence of early mining activity in the area although not mission related.[12]


Rediscovery

An elderly Native American named José el Venadero knew the location of the mines that supplied the old smelters. There are newspaper reports from 1860 describing how he led an interested party to the mines.[13] [14]

A mission Indian from the San Buenaventura Mission named Carlos Juan Capena also knew of the smelters and the location of the mines supplying them with ore. He described one as being an antimony mine and the other a silver mine. Like most Native Americans, Capena believed in the padres' curse that would cost him his life if he revealed the secret location of the mines.

Late in his life, Capena was persuaded to lead an expedition to the silver mine on behalf of the Hon. Angel G. Escandon (a Senator of Ventura County elected in 1874). Capena, now over eighty years of age, felt he was near the end of his life and had little to lose by revealing the location of the Franciscan mine. In August 1871, Capena led a party to the mine site where everything was found to be exactly as he had described it.[15] [16]

In December 1871, an interview was recorded with Carlos Juan Capena describing the mine. It took the form of a transcript of an oral interview given in the spoken Indian language of Mizkanaltan that was subsequently translated into Spanish. The interviewer, Juan Esteban Pico (1841 — 1901) was expert in translating indigenous languages into Spanish.[17]

In April/May 1884, Pico himself led an expedition to this silver mine on behalf of an Italian, Prospero Calli from Bakersfield. Pico wrote a detailed report describing the expedition and the mine.[18]

This was a highly-secret, mining operation and the details available mostly come from Native Americans who had worked at the mine or had visited the site.[19]

The year the mine was established and when it was subsequently concealed and abandoned remains unknown. However, there is clear evidence that the mine was operating in early 1824 during the widespread Chumash revolt of that year.[20]

All the evidence points to this being the quintessential "Lost Padre Mine" that arose from stories circulating in the mid-to-late 1800s.


Cyclic Rediscovery

In cyclic fashion, this historic mine keeps being rediscovered and then lost again through time. Documented visits to the mine site occurred in 1824, 1837, 1860, 1871, 1884, and possibly in 1915 when a map surfaced in Bakersfield.[21] [22] [23] The most recent rediscovery was made by Peter C. Gray and a companion on 23 September 2017 after a twelve year search. A request has been made for The United States Forest Service to conduct an archaeological study of the site which is currently under consideration.
