KRISTA KIM is a contemporary artist and founder of the Techism movement since 2014, promoting the confluence of art and technology, and technological innovation as a medium to further the development of digital humanism. She believes that artists must participate at the vanguard of technological innovation in order to contribute to the creation of future culture during this pivotal period of technological innovation, adaptation, and disruption. In her Digital Consciousness series, Krista gathers digital images of LED lights and manipulates them using multiple software to create her artwork, a technique that she has developed since 2012.

Krista is interested in the disruptive interpersonal and social effects of digital technology, as a force of distraction and segregation of people based on similar interests and likes though algorithms on social media. She seeks to communicate a transcendent, meditative experience for the viewer in digital visual language, which she describes as digital consciousness.

Krista was the chosen artist by Creative Director Olivier Lapidus of Lanvin for the fall-winter 2018 collection. Five of her artworks were selected as the inspiration of the color cards and digitally printed fabrics and leather goods for the collection. This groundbreaking collaboration introduced the digital gradient trend into the fashion world, which is now copied by other brands. The Krista Kim sneakers and handbags were sold out of Lanvin shops worldwide before the end of season.

Krista has lived in Seoul, Tokyo, and Singapore. She is exhibiting in New York, Paris, and worldwide art fairs. She earned her Masters of Arts Fine Arts from LASALLE College of the Arts / Goldsmiths, University of London in 2014. She completed her undergraduate studies in Political Science at the University of Toronto.


Techism

Kim created the art movement of Techism in 2014, involving technological innovation with the creation of art. In her manifesto, Krista Kim, explains that her movement is not in opposition to older art practices because it is "an artist’s expression drawn from the cross-pollination of contemporary tools: intelligent software and digital media."

The complete Techism Manifesto reads:

"Techism is a movement that reconciles technological innovation with the creation of art. Techism understands innovation, be it technological or philosophical, as a medium in and of itself. For this reason, Techism does not mean how it sounds. It does not put technology before art but rather, sees art and technology as companions meeting the next wave of human expression – digital humanism. We are the masters of technology, and creating art is the expression of digital humanism.

What does it mean to be human in the digital age, and where is the beauty in it?

Many traditional practices of artisanship have remained, and they will continue to do so. Techism is not a movement that stands in opposition to older practices. Nor does it assert brusque claims that the old will be swept away with the new. Artists can decide when and which practices to adopt and discard with each phase of creation.

In the age of digital disruption, technology will continue to transform and revolutionize industries in services, manufacturing, healthcare, media and education, and will continue to revolutionize creative platforms. We are in the midst of creating a new digital civilization, and artists must contribute to this new culture, in order to preserve our humanity. We cannot leave the role of leading future culture to technocrats, engineers and corporations. It is in our collective interest to include artists and people of diverse interests to contribute to our culture in order to create balance, harmony and humanism. Digital disruption is causing fear and unrest, and without a broader dialogue that is inclusive and expresses our true emotions and concerns, there will be wider conflict and misdirected blame. Art is a force of nature that brings us together, and it is necessary today, more than ever.

Art is no longer limited to a frame on a wall. Art is becoming ever more an interactive practice. Collaboration has always enabled art’s creation. Collaboration materializes consciousness. Art is consciousness. Techism is an appeal and return to that consciousness, the consciousness of art as shared, as thing, as idea and as experience.

Software allows the artist to become multifaceted and collaborative. It's about expressing yourself and finding what fits and collaborating with engineers and intelligent software, because you can.

Art is experiential, the phenomenal. We, the viewer participate, and discern for ourselves, what we behold.

Techism is the movement of our time, where we need to acknowledge digital disruption of our society, and accept the immense task of creating new culture that expresses our humanity in the digital age."
