MAHAVEER RAGHUNATHAN (born 17 November 1998) is an Indian racing driver. He currently competes in the FIA Formula 2 Championship, driving for MP Motorsport.


Career

Raghunathan started his racing career in karting in 2011, where he remained active until 2013. He also made his Formula racing debut in 2012, in four races of the JK Racing Asia Series for the Meco Racing team.

In 2013, Raghunathan competed in the MRF Challenge Formula 1600, finishing sixth. He also took part in the final race weekend of the Formula Masters China series at the Shanghai International Circuit for the Cebu Pacific Air by KCMG team, finishing the races in 14th, 15th and 12th respectively.

In 2014 Raghunathan moved to the new Italian F4 Championship, debuting on the second race weekend for the F & M team. With four sixth places at Monza and Imola as best results, he finished twelfth in the championship with 45 points.

At the beginning of 2015, Raghunathan took part in the final race weekend of the MRF Challenge Formula 2000 series at the Madras Motor Race Track. He then returned to Europe to take part in the European Formula 3 Championship for the Motopark team. With a 20th place at the Norisring as his best result, he finished 39th in the standings with zero points. Raghunathan took part in the official GP3 post season test with the Campos and Trident teams, in preparation for the 2016 GP3 Series. He also tested with the Coloni Motorsport team in Auto GP.

In 2016, Raghunathan raced in the Auto GP championship with Italian team PS Racing, securing nine podium finishes. In the same year, he also raced in the BOSS GP series in the Formula Class and secured two podiums.

In 2017, he continued racing in the BOSS GP-Formula Class Championship with Italian team Coloni Racing. He won 13 podiums out of 14 races, scoring three wins, and ending the season as champion. He is the first Indian to win the BOSS GP Championship.

In 2019, Raghunathan began racing in the FIA Formula 2 Championship for MP Motorsport, and currently sits 20th in the drivers' championship. Raghunathan's F2 career has so far been marred by a string of penalties and poor results, whilst being on average over 4.5 seconds off the pole-position time at the first five rounds and even occasionally running slower than Formula 3 drivers in inferior machinery.[1] He was subsequently suspended for the Austrian round based on the accumulation of penalty points, including picking up 9 points for infringements under all 3 Virtual Safety Car procedures in the Feature Race in France and taking him over the 12 required for a ban, having previously been reprimanded for passing the chequered flag twice at the opening round in Bahrain and colliding with Jack Aitken in Monaco.[2]
