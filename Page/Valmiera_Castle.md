VALMIERA CASTLE (, ) was a castle in Valmiera, Latvia. Today its ruins lie in the city centre.

The medieval castle was built on the site of an old Latgalian fortification during the 13th century by the Livonian Order as an _Ordensburg_. It protected the right bank of the river Gauja. The castle had a certain political importance since it hosted _Landtags_ (i.e. assemblies of representatives) of the Livonian Confederation. The fortress was burnt down by Russian troops during the Great Northern War and was subsequently used as a quarry for local residents to collect building materials.[1]

The former castle grounds today contain a museum and a shop and is used as an open-air venue for concerts and celebrations.[2]
