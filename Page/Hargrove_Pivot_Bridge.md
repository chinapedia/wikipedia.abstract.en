HARGROVE PIVOT BRIDGE, also known as '''Old Hargrove Bridge ''' is a historic swing bridge located at Poplar Bluff, Butler County, Missouri. It was built in 1917, and is 220 feet long with a turning span of 100 feet. This bridge has a modified Wichert truss as its center span and a modified Warren pony truss extending on each side of the center truss. The bridge has not been turned since 1942 due to the lack of river traffic in the area.[1]

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[2]
