LIBERTY PRINCIPLES PAC is a conservative, Illinois-based super PAC (political action committee). The PAC supports political candidates for state and local offices in Illinois who "are committed to the economic liberty policy agenda."[1] The PAC is an independent expenditure PAC, which means that it cannot coordinate with candidates that supports. Liberty Principles PAC focuses on supporting candidates who are supportive of policies and ideology around economic liberty in Illinois.[2]

The chairman and treasurer is Dan Proft.[3] The idea behind Liberty Principles PAC, according to Proft, was to "improve the quality of policy thinking" and "change the balance of power in the Illinois General Assembly."[4]

According to the _Chicago Sun-Times_, the PAC "has become a chief conduit for allies of Rauner to influence legislative races across the state."[6] Donors include shipping magnate Richard Uihlein and Governor Bruce Rauner. Uihlein is the PAC's largest contributor.[7]

Chairman Proft and Richard Uihlein are associated with the Illinois Policy Institute, an economic conservative think tank. The think tank released a documentary in 2016 that criticized the policies of Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.[8]
