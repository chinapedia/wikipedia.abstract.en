Northern_Cardinal_Male-27527-2.jpg is the state bird of Virginia.]]

This LIST OF BIRDS OF VIRGINIA includes species credibly documented in the U.S. state of Virginia by the Virginia Avian Records Committee of the Virginia Society of Ornithology (VARCOM). As of June 2018 the list contained 472 species and three species pairs.[1] Of them, 91 are considered accidental and 90 are considered rare. Seven species were introduced to North America, one is extinct, and one has been extirpated. Four additional species, now extinct, are believed to have occurred in Virginia, but there is insufficient evidence to include them in the main list. The published list includes identifiable subspecies which are not presented here.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the _Check-list of North American Birds_, 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS).[2][3] Common and scientific names are also those of the _Check-list_.

Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Virginia as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following codes are used to designate some species:

-   (A) - ACCIDENTAL - a species that has "less than six accepted physical or written records in the past 50 years" according to VARCOM
-   (R) - RARE - "A species that is so scarce that it cannot be expected with any certainty, or one that occurs in a very specific and extremely limited habitat" according to VARCOM
-   (I) - INTRODUCED - a species introduced to North America by humans
-   (H) - HISTORICAL - "Species believed to have occurred historically" according to VARCOM

The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

New World quail

ORDER: GalliformesFAMILY: Odontophoridae

The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. One species has been recorded in Virginia.

-   Northern bobwhite, _Colinus virginianus_


Pheasants, grouse, and allies

Ruffed_Grouse_(1).jpg ORDER: GalliformesFAMILY: Phasianidae

Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of 1.5–1.8 meters (almost 6 feet), the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. One species has been recorded in Virginia. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are game and are sometimes hunted for food. In all Virginia species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Three species have been recorded in Virginia.

-   Ring-necked pheasant, _Phasianus colchicus_ (I) (extirpated)
-   Wild turkey, _Meleagris gallopavo_

-   American flamingo, _Phoencopterus ruber_ (R)


Grebes

Podilymbus-podiceps-001.jpg ORDER: PodicipediformesFAMILY: Podicipedidae

Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. Six species have been recorded in Virginia.

Nightjars and allies

Common_Nighthawk.JPG ORDER: CaprimulgiformesFAMILY: Caprimulgidae

Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet which are of little use for walking and long, pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. Three species have been recorded in Virginia.

Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. One species has been recorded in Virginia.

-   Chimney swift, _Chaetura pelagica_


Hummingbirds

Rubythroathummer65.jpg ORDER: ApodiformesFAMILY: Trochilidae

Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards. Seven species have been recorded in Virginia.

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. Ten species have been recorded in Virginia.

-   Limpkin, _Aramus guarauna_ (A)


Cranes

ORDER: GruiformesFAMILY: Gruidae

Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or "dances". One species has been recorded in Virginia.

Commonloonudfs.jpg ORDER: GaviiformesFAMILY: Gaviidae

Loons are aquatic birds, the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body. Three species have been recorded in Virginia.

Frigatebirds

ORDER: SuliformesFAMILY: Fregatidae

Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface.

However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carcasses. Two species have been recorded in Virginia.

-   Black vulture, _Coragyps atratus_
-   Turkey vulture, _Cathartes aura_
