PS_mapo_2015.png The PASPORTA SERVO () is a hospitality service for Esperanto speakers. It is maintained by the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO), which publishes an annual online and print directory of people within the Esperanto culture who are willing to host other Esperanto speakers in their residences for free for up to 3 nights. The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging.

Free lodging via Pasporta Servo is one of the benefits of learning Esperanto.[1][2][3][4] Guests using the service are encouraged to speak only Esperanto with their hosts.


History

In 1966, psychologist Rubén Feldman González started the _Programo Pasporto_, a hospitality service for Esperanto speakers, in Argentina. In 1974, under the guidance of Jeanne-Marie Cash in France, the Pasporta Servo directory in its current form was first published, listing 40 hosts. Both founders are still hosts in the Pasporta Servo.

In August 2008, TEJO launched Pasporta Servo 2.0, an online version of the service.[5]
