Bridge was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 side which competed in the 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Italy where he made two appearances and scored a try.[6][7]

His debut season at provincial level saw him coached by Canterbury legend Scott Robertson and like his coach, Bridge found himself promoted to Super Rugby level in 2017, earning a contract with the Crusaders.[8] Bridge made a successful start to the 2017 season, notching his first Super Rugby try against the Waratahs in Sydney. The Crusaders withstood a late charge, to win the contest 41-22. Bridge has subsequently elevated his game, scoring a hat trick of tries during the Crusaders 57-21 demolition of the Stormers in Christchurch on 21 April 2017. Bridge followed this effort with another 3 tries a week later, during another comprehensive Crusaders win over the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on 29 April 2017.

With All Black midfielder Ryan Crotty out injured, Bridge was moved into the starting XV for the Crusaders, to play against the touring 2017 British and Irish Lions team, on 10 June 2017. Bridge played for 65 minutes of the historic fixture, before he was replaced by Tim Bateman. The Crusaders lost 3-12.

Bridge was voted as the Crusaders' Rookie of the Year by his team-mates at the end of the 2017 season, when they won the Super Rugby final against the Lions, beating the Lions by 25-17. Bridge came off the bench in the match, completing his 2017 season on a high note and then, was subsequently signed on to 2022 by the Crusaders. [9]

Bridge's form during the season saw Dagg displaced from the match-day 23 during the Super Rugby playoffs, with Bridge starting in the Super Rugby final.
