A CONCEPT ALBUM is an album in which its tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually. This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical. Sometimes the term is applied to albums considered to be of "uniform excellence" rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif. There is no consensus among music critics as to the specific criteria for what a "concept album" is.[2]

The format originates with folk singer Woody Guthrie's _Dust Bowl Ballads_ (1940) and was subsequently popularized by traditional pop singer Frank Sinatra's 1940s–50s string of albums, although the term is more often associated with rock music. In the 1960s, several well-regarded concept albums were released by various rock bands, which eventually led to the invention of progressive rock and rock opera. Since then, many concept albums have been released across numerous musical genres.


Definitions

There is no clear definition of what constitutes a "concept album".[3] Fiona Sturges of _The Independent_ stated that the concept album "was originally defined as a long-player where the songs were based on one dramatic idea – but the term is subjective."[4] A precursor to this type of album can be found in the 19th century song cycle[5] which ran into similar difficulties in classification. The extremely broad definitions of a "concept album" could potentially encompass all soundtracks, compilations, cast recordings, greatest hits albums, tribute albums, Christmas albums, and live albums.

The most common definitions refer to an expanded approach to a rock album (as a story, play, or opus), or a project that either revolves around a specific theme or a collection of related materials. AllMusic writes, "A concept album could be a collection of songs by an individual songwriter or a particular theme — these are the concept LPs that reigned in the '50s ... the phrase 'concept album' is inextricably tied to the late 1960s, when rock & rollers began stretching the limits of their art form."[6] Author Jim Cullen describes it as "a collection of discrete but thematically unified songs whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts ... sometimes [erroneously] assumed to be a product of the rock era." Author Roy Shuker defines concept albums and rock operas as albums that are "unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical. ... In this form, the album changed from a collection of heterogeneous songs into a narrative work with a single theme, in which individual songs segue into one another."

Speaking of concepts in albums during the 1970s, Robert Christgau wrote in _Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies_ (1981), because "overall impression" of an album matters, "concept intensifies the impact" of certain albums "in more or less the way _Sgt. Pepper_ intended", as well as "a species of concept that pushes a rhythmically unrelenting album like _The Wild Magnolias_ or a vocally irresistible one like Shirley Brown's _Woman to Woman_, to a deeper level of significance."[7]


History

1940s–50s: Origins

Rick Wakeman, keyboardist from the band Yes, considers the first concept album to be Woody Guthrie's 1940 album _Dust Bowl Ballads_.[8] _The Independent_ regards it as "perhaps" one of the first concept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s.[9] In the late 1940s, the LP record was introduced, with space age pop composers producing concept albums soon after. Themes included exploring wild life and dealing with emotions, with some albums meant to be played while dining or relaxing. This was accompanied in the mid 1950s with the invention of the gatefold, which allowed room for liner notes to explain the concept.

, 1950]]

Singer Frank Sinatra recorded several concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including _In the Wee Small Hours_ (1955) and _Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely_ (1958). Sinatra is occasionally credited as the inventor of the concept album, beginning with _The Voice of Frank Sinatra_ (1946), which led to similar work by Bing Crosby. According to biographer Will Friedwald, Sinatra "sequenced the songs so that the lyrics created a flow from track to track, affording an impression of a narrative, as in musical comedy or opera. ... [He was the] first pop singer to bring a consciously artistic attitude to recording."

1960s: Rock and country music

, 1967]]

In the early 1960s, concept albums began featuring highly in American country music, however the fact went largely unacknowledged by rock/pop fans and critics who would only begin noting "concept albums" as a phenomenon later in the decade, when albums became closely aligned with countercultural ideology, resulting in a recognised "album era" and the introduction of the rock concept album. The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that the Beach Boys' _Pet Sounds_ (1966), the Beatles' _Revolver_ (1966) and _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ (1967), and the Who's _Tommy_ (1969) are variously cited as "the first concept album", usually for their "uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif".

Other records have been claimed as "early" or "first" concept albums. _The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time_ (2015) states that the Ventures "pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born". Another is the Beach Boys' _Little Deuce Coupe_ (1963).[10] Writing in _101 Albums That Changed Popular Music_, Chris Smith commented: "Though albums such as Frank Sinatra's 1955 _In the Wee Small Hours_ and Marty Robbins' 1959 _Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs_ had already introduced concept albums, _Little Deuce Coupe_ was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers." Writing in his _Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture_, Marcel Danesi identifies the Beatles' _Rubber Soul_ (1965) and the Who's _The Who Sell Out_ (1967) as other examples of early concept albums. Brian Boyd of _The Irish Times_ names the Kinks' _Face to Face_ (1966) as the first concept album: "Written entirely by Ray Davies, the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It’s not one of the band’s finest works, but it did have an impact."[11]

"Popular consensus" for the first rock concept album, according to AllMusic, favours _Sgt. Pepper_.[12] According to music critic Tim Riley, "Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention's _Freak Out!_ [1966] has claims as the first 'concept album', but _Sgt. Pepper_ was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears." Musicologist Allan Moore says that "Even though previous albums had set a unified mood, it was on the basis of the influence of _Sgt. Pepper_ that the penchant for the concept album was born." Adding to _Sgt. Pepper_{{'}}s claim, the artwork reinforced its central theme by depicting the four Beatles in uniform as members of the Sgt. Pepper band, while the record omitted the gaps that usually separated album tracks.[13]

1960s–70s: Rock operas and progressive rock

Author Bill Martin relates the assumed concept albums of the 1960s to progressive rock:

_Popmatters_{{'}} Sarah Zupko notes that while the Who's _Tommy_ is "popularly thought of as the first rock opera, an extra-long concept album with characters, a consistent storyline, and a slight bit of pomposity", it is preceded by the shorter concept albums _Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake_ (Small Faces, 1968) and _S.F. Sorrow_ (The Pretty Things, 1968).[14] Author Jim Cullen states: "The concept album reached its apogee in the 1970s in ambitious records like Pink Floyd's _Dark Side of the Moon_ (1973) and the Eagles' _Hotel California_ (1976)." In 2015, _Rolling Stone_ ranked _Dark Side of the Moon_ at number one among the 50 greatest progressive rock albums of all-time, also noting the LP's stature as the second best-selling album of all time.[15] Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ (1979), a semi-autobiographical story modeled after the band's Roger Waters and Syd Barrett, is one of the most famous concept albums by any artist.[16] In addition to _The Wall_, Danesi highlights Genesis' _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_ (1974) and Zappa's _Joe's Garage_ (1979) as other culturally significant concept albums.

According to author Edward Macan, concept albums as a recurrent theme in progressive rock was directly inspired by the counterculture associated with "the proto-progressive bands of the 1960s", observing: "the consistent use of lengthy forms such as the programmatic song cycle of the concept album and the multimovement suite underscores the hippies' new, drug-induced conception of time."

1980s–present: Decline and return to popularity

With the emergence of MTV as a music video network which valued singles over albums, concept albums became less dominant in the 1980s.[17] Some artists, however, still released concept albums and experienced success in the 1990s and 2000s.[18] _NME_{{'}}s Emily Barker cites Green Day's _American Idiot_ (2004) as one of the "more notable" examples,[19] having brought the concept album back to high-charting positions.[20] Dorian Lynskey, writing for _GQ_, noted a resurgence of concept albums in the 2010s due to streaming: "This is happening not in spite of the rise of streaming and playlists, but because of it. Threatened with redundancy in the digital era, albums have fought back by becoming more album-like."[21] Cucchiara argues that "concept albums" should also describe "this new generation of concept albums, for one key reason. This is because the unison between the songs on a particular album has now been expanded into a broader field of visual and artistic design and marketing strategies that play into the themes and stories that form the album."[22]
