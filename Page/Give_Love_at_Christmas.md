_GIVE LOVE AT CHRISTMAS_ is a 1980 Christmas album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. Released on August 14, 1980. The group's second holiday release following 1970's _The Temptations Christmas Card_, it features each Temptation leading on various popular Christmas carols and original Christmas songs. The album includes versions of The Jackson 5's "Give Love on Christmas Day", "The Little Drummer Boy", "This Christmas", and "Silent Night", alongside originals written or co-written by Motown founder Berry Gordy, Jr. and Motown star and vice-president Smokey Robinson.

The Temptations' 1980 recording of "Silent Night" (punctuated by bass singer Melvin Franklin's sign-off of "Merry Christmas, from the Temptations!") became an enduring staple of rhythm and blues radio during the holiday season.[1]
