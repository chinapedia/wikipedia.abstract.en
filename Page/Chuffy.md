Plot

Bertie's insistence on playing the trombone drives Jeeves to give notice. Bertie hires a less satisfactory valet, Brinkley. Bertie's friend, Lord Chuffnell or "Chuffy", quickly snaps Jeeves up.

Bertie rents a country cottage from Chuffy in Chuffy's family-owned village of Chufnell Regis in Devon, and practices his trombone. Chuffy is intent on selling Chuffnell Hall to J. Washburn Stoker, so that he can afford to marry Stoker's daughter Pauline. He discovers, to his concern, that Pauline was once engaged to Bertie—and that Washburn wants Bertie to stay away from his daughter.

Jeeves produces a plan to get Pauline and Chuffy together that results in the burning down of Bertie's cottage. Sympathetic to Bertie, however, Jeeves resumes working for him at the end of the episode.

The seaside part of the Chufnell Regis village scenes (beach, jetty, steep hillside cottages) were filmed in Clovelly, Devon. The thatched cottage village scenes were filmed elsewhere. Chuffnell Hall scenes were filmed at Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire.
