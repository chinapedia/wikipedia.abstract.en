VIOLETA JAKOVA or VIOLETA YAKOVA (Bulgarian: ВИОЛЕТА ЯКОВА; June 2, 1923 in Dupnitsa – June 18, 1944 in Radomir) was a Jewish partisan, member of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Jakova, whose _nom de guerre_ was "Ivanka",[1] participated in the assassination of several Nazi and pro-German Bulgarian military officers operational, including the assassination of the chief of the Bulgarian Police, Atanas Pantev and Lieutenant general Hristo Lukov.[2] She was persecuted by the Bulgarian security forces, and in June 1944, injured during clashes with police in the city of Radomir, was captured and tortured to death.


Biography

Violeta Yosifova Yakova was born into a poor Sephardic-Jewish[3] family in Dupnitsa; her father, Yosef Yakov, a small trader, died before she was born. The difficult economic situation in Bulgaria after World War I led many Jewish families to emigrate from relatively small towns to larger population centers, and under these circumstances, her family emigrated to the capital Sofia. Violeta learned sewing and was employed as a tailor's apprentice. For many young Bulgarian Jews in the late 1930s and during World War II, idealism combined with the Bulgarian regime alignment with the Axis powers furthered a commitment to Zionist and left-wing organizations, engaging in underground activities against the government, informers and Nazi officers in Bulgaria.[4] In 1939, she joined the youth organization of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In 1942, after Bulgaria joined the Axis and signed the Tripartite Pact, Jakova joined the underground resistance.

Many young Bulgarian Jews participated in attacks in Sofia. Together, Yakova and Anjel Vagenstein burned in 1942 the Sofia Leather Jackets Factory, which produced uniforms for the Nazi forces. Also, together with Leon Kalaora and Dano Albahara,[5] formed a death squad who assassinated well-known antisemites, fascists and nazi informers. Out of these, Yakova was considered the most skilled fighter, who assassinated Lieutenant General Hristo Lukov[6][7] and the chief of the Bulgarian Police, Colonel Atanas Pantev. Her toughness was heard far and she became wanted by the Bulgarian security forces. At the beginning of March 1944, the Bulgarian police gathered intelligence information about the whereabouts of Yakova in her hometown of Radomir, and the police began a manhunt. Yakova was located in June and was captured after a shootout with the police, during which she was injured. She was raped,[8] beaten and tortured to death by the Bulgarian police.[9] Radomir-Violeta-Yakova-Ivanka.jpg


Memorial

Her boldness and the circumstances of her death made Yakova one of the symbols of the resistance against the pro-fascist regime in Bulgaria, and the Communist movement idealized her name. She was declared a national hero of Bulgaria. In 1970, Vulo Radev produced a movie called _Черните ангели_ (_Black Angels_), whose plot is about the assassination of pro-Nazi military officers by young resistance fighters, and in which Yakova has a central role. The city of Radomir has erected a monument in her memory.
