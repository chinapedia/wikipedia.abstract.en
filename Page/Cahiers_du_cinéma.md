_CAHIERS DU CINÉMA_ (, _Notebooks on Cinema_) is a French film magazine founded in 1951 by André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca.[1][2] It developed from the earlier magazine _Revue du Cinéma_ (_Review of the Cinema_ established in 1928) involving members of two Paris film clubs—_Objectif 49_ (_Objective 49_) (Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, and Alexandre Astruc, among others) and _Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin_ (_Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter_).

Initially edited by Doniol-Valcroze and, after 1957, by Éric Rohmer (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its writers Jacques Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and François Truffaut.[3] It is the oldest French-language film magazine in publication.[4]


History and profile

The first issue of _Cahiers_ appeared in April 1951.[5] Much of its head staff, including Bazin, Doniol-Valcroze, Lo Duca, and the various members of what would become the Young Turks, had met and shared their beliefs about film through their involvement in the publication of _Revue du Cinéma_ from 1946 until its final issue in 1948; _Cahiers_ was created as a successor to this earlier magazine.[6] Early issues of _Cahiers_ were small journals of thirty pages which bore minimalist covers, distinctive for their lack of headlines in favor of film stills on a trademark bright yellow background. Each issue contained four or five articles (with at least one piece by Bazin in most issues published while he was still alive),[7] most of which were reviews of specific films or appreciations of specific directors, supplemented on occasion by longer theoretical essays.[8] The first few years of the magazine's publication were dominated by Bazin, who was the _de facto_ head of the editorial board.[9][10] Bazin intended _Cahiers_ to be a continuation of the intellectual form of criticism that _Revue_ had printed, which prominently featured his articles advocating for realism as the most valuable quality of cinema. As more issues of _Cahiers_ were published, however, Bazin found that the Young Turks, a group of young proteges and critics serving as editors underneath him, were beginning to disagree with him in the pages of the magazine.[11] Godard would voice his disagreement with Bazin as early as 1952, when he challenged Bazin's views on editing in an article for the September issue of _Cahiers._[12][13] Gradually, the tastes of the Young Turks drifted away from those of Bazin, as members of the group began to write critical appreciations of more commercial American filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks rather than the canonized French and Italian filmmakers that interested Bazin.[14]

The Young Turks broke completely with Bazin by 1954, when an article in the January issue by Truffaut attacked what he called _La qualité française_ ("the French Quality," usually translated as "The Tradition of Quality"), denouncing many critically popular French films of the time as being unimaginative, oversimplified, and even immoral adaptations of literary works.[15][16] The article was the manifesto for the _politique des Auteurs_, the Young Turks' emphasis on the importance of the director in the creation of a film, which Andrew Sarris later termed the auteur theory, resulting in the re-evaluation of Hollywood films and directors such as Hitchcock, Hawks, Jerry Lewis, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray, and Fritz Lang.[17] After the publication of Truffaut's article, Doniol-Valcroze and most of the _Cahiers_ editors besides Bazin and Lo Duca rallied behind the Young Turks; Lo Duca left _Cahiers_ a year later,[18] while Bazin, in failing health, gave editorial control of the magazine to Rohmer and largely left Paris, though he continued to write for the magazine.[19] Now with control over the magazine's ideological approaches to film, the Young Turks (minus Godard, who had left Paris in 1952, not to return until 1956)[20] changed the format of _Cahiers_ somewhat, frequently conducting interviews with directors deemed "auteurs" and voting on films in a "Council" of ten core critics.[21] The Young Turks came to champion non-American directors as well, writing on the _mise en scène_ (the "dominant object of study" at the magazine)[22] of such filmmakers as Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, Kenji Mizoguchi, Max Ophüls, and Jean Cocteau, many of which Bazin had introduced them to.[23]

By the end of the 1950s, many of the remaining editors of _Cahiers_, however, were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the mere act of writing film criticism. Spurred on by the return of Godard to Paris in 1956 (who in the interim had made a short film himself), many of the Young Turks became interested in making films themselves. Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Doniol-Valcroze, and even Rohmer, who had officially succeeded Doniol-Valcroze as head editor in 1958, began to divide their time between making films and writing about them.[24] The films that these critics made were experimental explorations of various theoretical, artistic, and ideological aspects of the film form, and would, along with the films of young French filmmakers outside the _Cahiers_ circle, form the basis for the cinematic movement known as the French New Wave.[25][26] Meanwhile, _Cahiers_ underwent staff changes, as Rohmer hired new editors such as Jean Douchet to fill the roles of those editors who were now making films, while other existing editors, particularly Jacques Rivette, began to write even more for the magazine.[27] Many of the newer critical voices (except for Rivette) largely ignored the films of the New Wave for Hollywood when they were not outright criticizing them, creating friction between much of the directorial side of the Young Turks and the head editor Rohmer. A group of five _Cahiers_ editors, including Godard and Doniol-Valcroze and led by Rivette, urged Rohmer to refocus the magazine's content on newer films such as their own. When he refused, the "gang of five" forced Rohmer out and installed Rivette as his replacement. [28]

Jacques Rivette, through his replacement of Rohmer as editor in 1963, shifted political and social concerns farther to the left, and began a trend in the magazine of paying more attention to non-Hollywood films. The style of the journal moved through literary modernism in the early 1960s to radicalism and dialectical materialism by 1970. Moreover, during the mid-1970s the magazine was run by a Maoist editorial collective. In the mid-1970s, a review of the American film _Jaws_ marked the magazine's return to more commercial perspectives, and an editorial turnover: (Serge Daney, Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, and Charles Tesson). It led to the rehabilitation of some of the old _Cahiers_ favourites, as well as some new film makers like Manoel de Oliveira, Raoul Ruiz, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Youssef Chahine, and Maurice Pialat. Recent writers have included Daney, André Téchiné, Léos Carax, Olivier Assayas, Danièle Dubroux, and Serge Le Péron.

In 1998, the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing _Cahiers_) was acquired by the press group _Le Monde_.[29] Traditionally losing money, the magazine attempted a make-over in 1999 to gain new readers, leading to a first split among writers and resulting in a magazine addressing all visual arts in a post-modernist approach. This version of the magazine printed ill-received opinion pieces on reality TV or video games that confused the traditional readership of the magazine.[30][31]

_Le Monde_ took full editorial control of the magazine in 2003, appointing Jean-Michel Frodon as editor-in-chief. In February 2009, _Cahiers_ was acquired from _Le Monde_ by Richard Schlagman, also owner of Phaidon Press, a worldwide publishing group which specialises in books on the visual arts.[32] In July 2009, Stéphane Delorme and Jean-Philippe Tessé were promoted respectively to the positions of editor-in-chief and deputy chief editor.
