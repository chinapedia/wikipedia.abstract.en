CLERMONT CAIRN, also called BLACK MOUNTAIN CHAMBERED CAIRN (Irish: _Carnán Mhaighréid Náir_[1]), is a chambered cairn and National Monument located in the Cooley Mountains, County Louth, Republic of Ireland.[2][3]


Location

Clermont Cairn is located atop Black Mountain in the Cooley Mountains, which overlook the Cooley Peninsula. The mountain itself, and the radio transmission site are also sometimes called "Clermont Ca[i]rn."[4][5]


History

Clermont Cairn was constructed in the early Neolithic, c. 4000–3500 BC, and forms part of the Clyde-Carlingford group of court cairns. The mound has been disturbed by quarrying and blasting.[6][7]


Description

This circular hilltop cairn is in diameter and over high, with the remains of a trapezoidal cairn long in the southwest part. Three lintels are in position and the rear part is corbelled. Surrounding this was a court (5.5 × 7 m) and a gallery containing at least two burial chambers.[8]
