"UN BACIO A MEZZANOTTE"(lit. A Midnight Kiss[1] or A Kiss At Midnight[2]) is a 1952 Italian song composed by Gorni Kramer (music) and Garinei & Giovannini (lyrics). Originally part of the revue _Gran baraonda_, starring Wanda Osiris and Alberto Sordi, it was popularized by the vocal group Quartetto Cetra, as to become a classic of Italian music.[3][4]

The song was later covered by numerous artists, including Elena Beltrami & Natalino Otto, Nete Twins, Teddy Reno, Quartetto Italiano, Renzo Arbore, Marisa Laurito.[5] In 2016 the pop-rock group Dear Jack presented a new version of the song at the 66th edition of the Sanremo Music Festival.[6]
