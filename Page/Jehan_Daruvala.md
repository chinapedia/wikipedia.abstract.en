Career

Karting

Daruvala started karting at the age of thirteen in 2011, winning titles as champion and vice champion across Asia and Europe. He was coached by Rayomand Banajee who recognised his talent early on and was instrumental in laying the foundations for his future success. [4]

Formula Renault 2.0
