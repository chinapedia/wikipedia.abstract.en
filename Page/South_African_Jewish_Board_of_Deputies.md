The SOUTH AFRICAN JEWISH BOARD OF DEPUTIES is an organisation formed in 1912 from the merger of the Board for the Transvaal and the Board for the Cape.[1] It serves as the central representative institution of most of the country's Hebrew congregations, Jewish societies, and institutions.[2]

In his address to the 2015 Biennial National Conference of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, South African President Jacob Zuma credited the South African Jewish community's historical role in resisting apartheid.[3]
