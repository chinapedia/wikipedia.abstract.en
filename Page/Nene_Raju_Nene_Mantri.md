Production

In February 2016, filmmaker Teja signed Telugu actor Rajasekhar to play a negative role in his directorial _Aham_. Sneha was approached to play the female lead in the film.[8] It was shelved in April 2016 due to both creative and personal differences. P. Satyanarayana Reddy, the film's producer, wanted another actor to play the lead role.[9] Teja approached Rana Daggubati and gained his consent. Rana's father Daggubati Suresh Babu suggested Kajal Aggarwal for the female lead role, who was signed later.[10] Daggubati was completing his portions in _The Ghazi Attack_ (2017) and was about to join the sets of _Baahubali 2: The Conclusion_ when Teja approached him. They worked on the script for eight months, writing different versions.[11] Lyricist Lakshmi Bhoopal, who was supposed to work with Teja for three of his earlier films, was chosen to pen the dialogues.[12] Teja also approached R. Rathnavelu to handle the film's cinematography.[13]

The film was titled _Nene Raju Nene Mantri_; Venkat C. Dileep and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao were recruited as the cinematographer and editor respectively. Anoop Rubens composed the film's soundtrack and background score.[14] Babu, along with Kiran Reddy and Bharath Chowdary, jointly bankrolled the film under their banners Suresh Productions and Blue Planet Entertainments.[15] _Nene Raju Nene Mantri_ was Aggarwal's 50th film as an actor. Catherine Tresa, Navdeep and Ashutosh Rana were cast in supporting roles.[16]

Critical reception

Purnima Sriram Iyer of _The New Indian Express_ termed _Nene Raju Nene Mantri_ a "riveting political drama"; Iyer found the narration "gripping and enthralling" and the dialogues "hard-hitting". She added that Teja writing was effective enough to let even a politically-ignorant person "enlightened about the subject".[17] Hemanth Kumar, writing for _Firstpost_, called _Nene Raju Nene Mantri_ the "cinematic equivalent of Newton's Third Law of Physics" where "every action is met with an equal and opposite reaction". Kumar noted that the leads' performances and Teja's writing are the film's strengths, adding that Aggarwal's portrayal of Radha was the "biggest revelation".[18] Karthik Kumar of _Hindustan Times_ noted that the entire film is built on the bonding between the lead characters, with the political backdrop used only "to give the story a solid padding". Kumar was appreciative of Daggubati's performance: "[His] powerful screen presence takes everything up a notch and it's a treat to watch him turn from good to grey."[19] Suresh Kavirayani of _Deccan Chronicle_ praised the performances and the portrayal of emotions such as love, hatred, smartness and cruelty handled by Jogendra. He, however, felt that the second half suffered from an "overdose of sentiment".[20]

Writing for _The Hindu_, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo opined that the film's later segments lacked the sharpness of the initial moments. She termed Jogendra as one of the "most intriguing characters Rana [Daggubati] has played" and found its actions troubling the narrative.[21] Neeshita Nyayapati, reviewing for _The Times of India_, found _Nene Raju Nene Mantri_ a good love story of Radha and Jogendra than an effective political drama; she stated that the political angle "seems like a pesky annoyance in an otherwise beautiful movie". Nyayapati was also critical of Rani's characterisation, calling it a "messy" one with "no thought put into it at all".[22] Sify noted that the film turns "tedious and predictable" post intermission and criticised the script's lack of logic in the later portions. The reviewer added that Daggubati's portrayal of Jogendra was a "stunning act" and "very intense" in crucial scenes.[23]

Criticising the lack of cohesiveness, Nagarjuna Rao of _Gulf News_ added that the addition of few irrelevant characters and implausible situations in the later portions "drain the viewer much before the climax, which turns out to be a denouement". Rao also found Rubens' score "too loud, to the point of being irritating".[24] Manoj Kumar R, writing for _The Indian Express_, was critical of Teja's direction. He found the climax "cringe worthy" because of Teja's attempt to "underplay the gravity of crimes Jogendra committed". He also added that Teja's reservations failed to give Rana's character a logical conclusion.[25] K. Naresh Kumar of _The Hans India_ found the film a "patchy effort" and criticised its indifferent treatment: "Building up the hero as a crusader for the common man, despite his questionable and violent tactics in retaining his political status is the main contradiction that one feels, the film suffers from."[26] Sowmya Rajendran of _The News Minute_ opined that the narrative "simply does not hold together" and found the CGI "patchy". Rajendran too felt that the film doesn't allow Jogendra's devolution "to really punch [the viewers] in the gut, because it wants to simultaneously hail him as a hero."[27]
