BIG BRAIN (),[1] is a South-Korean R&B ballad group that consist of four-members under the label World Show Market. They have been active since 2010 and officially debuted on October 22, 2015 with the album _Billionaire Sound_ and their breakthrough song “Welcome”.


History

Pre-debut

They were group of students who majored in vocal performance and decided to form their own group. During pre-debut, they were known as _The Man_, but changed their name due to similarity with another senior group. Big Brain is a group that enjoys music, singing and hopes that their music will heal others. Before their official debut, many people already recognised their outstanding talent, calling them the next _Brown Eyed Soul_ and compared them to _Big Mama_[2] Before they held their official debut concert in South Korea, they were busking around New York City and performed in several places, Times Square, Central Park, Manhattan and more.[3]

2015 debut, _Billionaire Sound_

The group debuted on October 22, 2015 with the release of their first mini-album _Billionare Sound_ and their digital single featuring title track "Welcome". "Welcome" is an emotional ballad mixed with powerful R&B and a fresh tempo. The story of the song is about an honest man who wishes that his ex-lover would never have a beautiful relationship with another man. They showed an impressive work which boldly challenged the youth with different genres.[4]

2016

They became an opening act in _Olivia Newton-John_ concert on May,14[5]
