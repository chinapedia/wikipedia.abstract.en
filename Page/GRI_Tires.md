Types of tires

GRI's main products are material handling tires, which are used on material handling equipment such as forklifts. These tires are produced using natural rubber compounds, which have properties of high-heat dissipation, high run-time and low rolling resistance.

GRI also produces tires required for agricultural purposes which are used in farming vehicles especially those in tractors and harvesters. Agricultural tires are unique in aspects of tread pattern and high-load carrying capacity.

Other tires produced by GRI include industrial and construction tires. Both these types are often used for vehicles that perform heavy industrial work. Off the road tires produced by GRI are tires built for surfaces such as sand, gravel, mud, rock and other off-road terrain.
