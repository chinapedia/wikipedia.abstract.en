_DENDRONOTUS ROBILLIARDI_ is a species of sea slugs, a dendronotid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusc in the family Dendronotidae.[1]


Taxonomic history

This species was correctly recognised as separate from _Dendronotus albus_ by Robilliard in 1960.[2] However he identified it as _D. albus_ and described the true _D. albus_ as _Dendronotus diversicolor_.[3]


Distribution

This marine animal can be found in the NE Pacific Ocean from Alaska to California and in the NW Pacific from Russia and Korea.[4]


Description

This species grows to a maximum length of 40 mm. It is distinguished from _Dendronotus albus_ by having more than four pairs of cerata, (typically 5 to 7), whilst _D . albus_ is a bigger animal but has no more than four or five pairs.[5] The body and cerata are translucent white with opaque white and orange-yellow tips to the cerata, although in some cases the orange-yellow is absent.[6]


Diet

This species feeds preferentially on the hydroid _Thuiaria argentea_ in the family Sertulariidae.[7] _Dendronotus albus_ is said to prefer _Abietinaria greenei_, _Hydrallmania distans_ and _Abietinaria amphora_.[8]
