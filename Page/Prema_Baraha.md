Production

In December 2015, Arjun announced that he was set to produce and direct a bilingual Kannada and Tamil romantic film featuring his daughter Aishwarya Arjun in the lead role. He had initially narrated three stories to his daughter, who was most satisfied with a script on two journalists falling in love during the Kargil War of 1999. While he was working on the screenplay, Arjun spent a week in the studios of Asian News International and went through all the material they had on Kargil.[1][2] Kannada actor Chetan Kumar was signed on to feature as the lead actor in the project, thus making his debut in Tamil films.[3] In May 2016, Chetan Kumar backed out of the project, unhappy with his characterisation in the film, and was replaced by another Kannada actor Chandan Kumar.[4] For her particular role, Aishwarya Arjun carefully observed the style and characteristics of Barkha Dutt, who worked as a journalist during the 1999 conflict.[5]

The film was launched in May 2016, with promotional stills from a shoot released shortly after.[6][7] The film's first schedule was completed in July 2016, with Suhasini and K. Viswanath also joining the film's cast. The film was then shot in Dharamsala, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kerala, Mumbai, Switzerland, and Italy. In August 2017, the Tamil title was changed from _Kadhalin Ponveedhiyil_ to _Sollividava the uls_ .[8] The Kannada title of _Prema Baraha_ is derived from Arjun Sarja's song _Prema Baraha Koti Taraha_ from the film _Prathap_ (1990).[9]


Soundtrack

Jassie Gift has composed the score and songs for the film, with Divo releasing the soundtrack in Kannada and U1 Records in Tamil. The heroine introduction theme included in the album was composed by Aruldev.
