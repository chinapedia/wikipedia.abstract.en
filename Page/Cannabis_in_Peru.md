CANNABIS IN PERU is illegal for recreational use, but possession is decriminalized by Art. 299 of the Criminal Code, and cannabis oil was legalized for medical purposes in 2017.


Enforcement

Possession of under 8 grams is considered personal use and it is not punished.[1][2][3][4]

Cultivation, production or sale is punished with 8 to 15 years in prison.[5][6]


Medical cannabis

In 2017, the administration of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced a plan to legalize medical cannabis in Peru. The announcement followed a raid in Lima, in which police shut down an operation which produced cannabis medicines for 80 members whose children suffered from epilepsy and other ailments.[7][8] Later that year, by a vote of 68 to 5, Peru's congress legalized cannabis oil for medical use.[9]
