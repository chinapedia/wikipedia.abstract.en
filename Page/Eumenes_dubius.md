In males clypeus is long, with smooth and bright yellow free margin. Mandibles are orange yellow, basally spotted. In the females scape is ventrally yellow, while dorsally it is orange-yellow, with a thin black line on flagellomeres 3-9. These flagellomeres are black dorsally, while the others are orange-yellow.
