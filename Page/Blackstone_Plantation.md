Personnel

Frank Crumit and Julia Sanderson, a husband-and-wife team[3] who had been headliners in vaudeville,[4] were hosts for the show. Alfred Swenson played Captain Blackstone, Santos Ortega played Don Rodrigo, and Ted de Corsia played Don Philippe.[5] The program also featured guest stars such as Lanny Ross[6] and Parker Fennelly[7]

Ed Herlihy was the program's announcer,[8] and Jack Shilkret's orchestra provided music.[9]

Frank Vallan was the producer when the program was on CBS.[10]


Format

The book _Vaudeville old & new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America_ summarized the program as follows: "The two stars sang and exchanged banter. Music and gab with guests in their breezy and humorous style characterized their programs."[11] The show was sponsored by Blackstone cigars.[12]
