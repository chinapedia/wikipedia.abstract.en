Description

_Eucalyptus doratoxylon_ is a mallee, rarely a small tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, powdery white over reddish or greenish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are also usually arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, creamy white, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between August and March and the flowers are white to pale yellow. The fruit is a pendulous, woody, more or less spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.[4][5][6]


Taxonomy

_Eucalyptus doratoxylon_ was first formally described in 1860 by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in _Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae_ from samples collected by George Maxwell in the Kojoneerup district.[7][8] The specific epithet is (_doratoxylon_) is derived from the Ancient Greek _dorato-_ meaning "spear" and _xylon_ meaning "wood", possibly in reference to the use of the stems for spears.[9]


Distribution

Spearwood mallee grows in sandy loam or white-grey sandy soils in heath and open forest on hills and around granite outcrops along the south coast in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia.[10][11]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus doratoxylon_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife[12]
