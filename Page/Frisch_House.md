History

Lorentzen]] Nytorv_5_-_Juliuss_Tafdrup.png The house was built in 1799-1803 for _justitsråd_ Hartvig Marcus Frisch who was director of the Royal Greenland Trade Department. The building was designed by Nicolai Abildgaard. Frisch lived in the building until his death in 1816.[1]

The building was expanded with an extra storey by the architect August Klein in 1889-1890. The jurist Andreas Aagesen lived in the building from 1852. The politician Herman Trier lived on the third floor from 1892 to 1900. It was listed in 1918.[2]

The textile mefchant Julous Tafdrup's building was for a while based in the building in the 1900s. He also operated a clothing store in the ground floor. The company later moved to Studiestræde and in 1913 to the property at Vesterbrogade 9B.[3]

Provinsbanken, Denmark's fifth largest bank at the time. purchased the building in 1988. It was subsequently restored.[4] In 1990, Provinsbanken merged with Danske Bank and the property was later sold to Nordea. On 31 December 2014, Mordea sold Nytorv 5-5A together with neighbouring Nygade 1-3 and Knabrostræde 6-8 to Danica Pension for DFF 370 millions.[5]


Architecture

The building is six bays wide. The facade of Abildgaard's original building was tipped by a triangular pediment and vases.[6]

The most well-preserved interiors are located on the first floor. A restoration carried out in 1988 unveiled four paintings by Abildgaard that had been painted over with later decorations. They depict scenes from Voltaire's tragedy _Le Triumvirat_.


Today

Restaurant & Café Nytorv occupies the ground floor. Other tenants include the law firm Christian Harlang.
