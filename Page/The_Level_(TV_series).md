Plot

One night, Frank Le Saux (Philip Glenister), a corrupt businessman, arranges to meet DS Nancy Devlin (Karla Crome), a National Crime Division detective who has been protecting him from prosecution on several occasions. However, their meeting is cut short when they are interrupted by the arrival of an unknown gunman. Frank is shot dead, and Nancy receives a wound from a ricochet. The Brighton CID of East Sussex Police are assigned to investigate the case. Boss DCI Michelle Newman (Lindsey Coulson) arranges for DS Devlin to be assigned to the case, unaware of her being present at the scene of the murder. Devlin is initially paired with DS Sean 'Gunner' Martin (Noel Clarke), but friction occurs between the pair, forcing Newman to second Nancy's fellow NCD detective Kevin O'Dowd (Rob James-Collier) to the case.[3]

Nancy struggles to hide her involvement in Frank's activities. Her friendship with Frank's daughter, Hayley (Laura Haddock) makes her situation increasingly difficult. However, it soon transpires that the blight of the team's investigation appears to a mole within their ranks. Nancy suspects that Gunner may be the leak, but during a late-night visit to O'Dowd's hotel room, she discovers a series of surveillance photos that disappeared earlier in the day. Whilst trying to deal with the pressures of the investigation, Nancy is forced to help her mentally ill mother, Teresa (Suzanne Packer), but soon discovers that her mum has been shielding a life-changing secret for twenty years - that Nancy is secretly Frank's daughter.
