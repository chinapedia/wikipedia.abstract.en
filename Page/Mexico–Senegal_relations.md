MEXICO–SENEGAL RELATIONS refers to the diplomatic relations between Mexico and Senegal.


History

Mexico and Senegal established diplomatic relations in May 1962, two years after Senegal obtained its independence from France in April 1960. In May 1975, Senegalese President Léopold Sédar Senghor paid a visit to Mexico.[1] During his visit to Mexico, both nations signed agreements on cultural and scientific cooperation[2] and an agreement on technical cooperation.[3] In July 1975, Mexican President Luis Echeverría reciprocated the visit and paid a state visit to Senegal, becoming the first sitting Mexican President to visit Africa.[4]

In the late 1980s, Mexico closed its embassy in Senegal.[5] In March 2002, Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade paid a visit to the northern Mexican city of Monterrey to attend the International Conference on Financing for Development.[6][7] In 2017, both nations celebrated 55 years of diplomatic relations.
