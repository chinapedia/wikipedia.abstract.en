GENOVA is an extinct town in Livingston County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1]

The State Historical Society of Missouri speculates Genova derives its name from Geneva and/or Genoa.[2] A post office called Genova was established in 1891, and remained in operation until 1901.[3]
