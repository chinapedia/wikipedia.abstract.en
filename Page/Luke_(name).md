Luke}} LUKE is a male given name, and less commonly, a surname.

The name Luke is the English form of the Latin name . It is derived from the Latin name _Lucius_, and it either means "the great Lucius", or it is a shortened form of the Latin name. _Lucius_ means "the bright one" or "the one born at dawn".[1][2] The frequently stated explanation of as "man from Lucania" is not supported by reliable sources.

Although the name is attested in ancient inscriptions, the best known historical use of the name is in the New Testament. The Gospel of Luke was written around 70 to 90 AD (the exact years are unknown), and was from here that the name was first popularized. Luke, who is credited with the authorship of the Gospel of Luke, was a physician who lived around 30 to 130 AD. Luke is also credited with the Book of Acts in the Bible, and also is mentioned by the Apostle Paul in some of Paul's letters to first-century churches.

The name is sometimes used as a nickname for Luther.
