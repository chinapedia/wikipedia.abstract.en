Scheel and returned to Tranquebar in 1766 from where he continued to Bengal to enroll in the British army. He served under Major-General Robert Clive, was promoted to captain, and, probably in Spanish service, took part in the conquest of Manila.[1]

On his way back to Denmark, on board a ship to the Netherlands, he was captured by pirates and brought to Algiers where he was sold as a slave.[2] He finally made it back to Denmark in about 1772.

Legacy

Halling has a reputation for being a brutal ruler of his estate and for leading a somewhat bizarre lifestyle. The rough treatment of tenant farmers was, however, a common phenomenon at the time. He had an Indian servant and brought and had acquired an oriental taste for splendor during his years in India. His marriage was unhappy and the couple lived apart at times.

Halling constructed 21 residences for soldiers on the Dronninglund estate. He launched a programme which taught boys a craft and hired a physician on the estate in 1790. In 1796, he created a trust for indigent residents of the Dronninglund estate.

Halling died in 1796. His widow sold Dronninglund in 1806. She then settled at Keldkær where she died a very wealthy woman in 1817.
