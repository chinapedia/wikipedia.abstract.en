JOSHUA G. CLARKE (c.1780-1828) was one of the first justices on the Supreme Court of Mississippi.

Born c. 1780 in Maryland,[1] and raised in Pennsylvania,[2] Clarke was a member of the territorial legislature and of the constitutional convention as the representative of Claiborne county.[3]

Clarke served on the Supreme Court of Mississippi from its first session in June 1818 until 1821.[4] Among other rulings, Clarke judged that killing a slave was murder because slaves were "reasonable creatures", and voted that slaves became freedmen by having lived in the Northwest Territory under the Ordinance of 1787.[5][6]

His home, Claremont (Port Gibson, Mississippi), built by him in 1826, is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
