TK's second single, "Signal", was featured as an opening for the anime _91 Days_. "Signal" had two versions, one being a digipak release with artwork inspired by _91 Days_, the other a standard jewel case. Both versions contained a reworked version of "Shandy", a Ling tosite sigure track from the album _still a Sigure virgin?_; and the acoustic version of "Unravel".

_White Noise_, being released in November 2016, featured six new tracks: a reworking of "Like There is Tomorrow", the singles "Signal" and "Secret Sensation", and a proper studio recording of "Jewel of Sin". The limited version featured a live DVD from the _Secret Sensation_ Tour.[8]
