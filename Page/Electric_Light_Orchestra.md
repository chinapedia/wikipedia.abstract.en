The ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque rock, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography.[1] After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan, and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members.

ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, The Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including two LPs that reached the top of British charts: the disco-inspired _Discovery_ (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album _Time_ (1981). In 1986, Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became the Orchestra. With the exception of a short-lived reunion in 2000–01, when Jeff Lynne released a new album, _Zoom_, ELO remained largely inactive until the 2010s. In 2014, Lynne re-formed the band again with Tandy as JEFF LYNNE'S ELO, where he resumed concert touring and new recordings under the moniker.[2]

During ELO's original 14-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide,[3] and collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards.[4][5] For a period in the mid 1970s, the band saw more success in the United States, where they were billed as "the English guys with the big fiddles".[6] From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated twenty seven Top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US _Billboard_ Hot 100[7][8]. The band also holds the record for having the most _Billboard_ Hot 100 Top 40 hits (20) without a number one single of any band in US chart history.[9][10] In 2017, the ELO line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, and Tandy were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[11][12].


History

1970–1973: Formation and early albums

In 1968, Roy Wood—guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of The Move—had an idea to form a new band that would use violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound, taking rock music in the direction to "pick up where The Beatles left off".[13] The orchestral instruments would be the main focus, rather than the guitars. Jeff Lynne, frontman of fellow Birmingham group The Idle Race, was excited by the concept. When Trevor Burton left The Move in February 1969, he was asked by Wood to join, only for Lynne to say no, as he was still focused on finding success with his band. But in January 1970, when Carl Wayne left the Move, Lynne accepted Wood's second invitation to join the band on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project. On 12 July 1970, when Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and "10538 Overture" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. The original plan was to end The Move following the release of the _Looking On_ album at the end of 1970, crossing over to the new unit in the new year, but to help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album, _Message from the Country_, was also recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. The resulting debut album _The Electric Light Orchestra_ was released in December 1971. Only the trio of Wood, Lynne and Bevan played on all songs, with the outside help coming from Bill Hunt, who supplied the French Horn parts and Steve Woolam, who played violin. It was released in the United States in 1972 as _No Answer_. The name was chosen because a record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company and get the name of the album—since they were unable to contact them they left a note saying "No answer".[14] "10538 Overture" became a UK top-ten hit. Due to both band's albums being in the stores at the same time, The Move appeared on television during this period as did ELO.

ELO's debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey,[15] with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden,[16], who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively.[17]

The new line-up performed at the 1972 Reading Festival. Barcus Berry instrument pick-ups, now sported by the band's string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by all the sound of the electrified instruments. The band released their second album, _ELO 2_ in early 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic "Roll Over Beethoven" (which also incorporated the first movement of Beethoven's own Fifth Symphony).[18] ELO also made their first appearance on _American Bandstand_ show. During the recording of the third album Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, Mik Kaminski joined as violinist, and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much. Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, _On the Third Day_, was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single "Showdown". After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell then returned as the group's second cellist, also in late 1973.

1974–1982: Global success and concept albums

For the band's fourth album, _Eldorado_, a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped overdubbing strings and hired an orchestra and choir instead. Louis Clark was hired by the band as string arranger.[19] The first single off the album, "Can't Get It Out of My Head", became their first US top 10 hit, and _Eldorado, A Symphony_ became ELO's first gold album. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne. Following the release of _Eldorado_ Kelly Groucutt was recruited as bassist, and in early 1975 Melvyn Gale replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and regularly appeared on _The Midnight Special_ (1973, 1975, 1976 and 1977) more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances.

_Face the Music_ was released in 1975, producing the hit singles "Evil Woman", their third UK top 10, and "Strange Magic".[20] The opening instrumental "Fire on High", with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television program _CBS Sports Spectacular_ in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.

Their sixth album, the platinum selling _A New World Record_, became their first UK top ten album when it was released in 1976.[21] It contained the hit singles "Livin' Thing", "Telephone Line", "Rockaria!" and "Do Ya", the latter a re-recording of a Move song recorded for that group's final single. The band toured in support in the US only from September 1976 to April 1977 with a break in December, then an _American Music Awards_ show appearance on 31 January 1977,[22] plus a one-off gig in San Diego in August 1977. Casey Kasem said that the Electric Light Orchestra is the "World's first touring rock 'n' roll chamber group" before he played "Livin' Thing" at #28.[23]

_A New World Record_ was followed by a multi-platinum selling album, the double-LP _Out of the Blue_, in 1977. _Out of the Blue_ featured the singles "Turn to Stone", "Sweet Talkin' Woman", "Mr. Blue Sky", and "Wild West Hero", each becoming a hit in the United Kingdom. The band then set out on a nine-month, 92-date world tour, with an enormous set and a hugely expensive space ship stage with fog machines and a laser display. In the United States the concerts were billed as _The Big Night_ and were their largest to date, with 62,000 people seeing them at Cleveland Stadium.[24] _The Big Night_ went on to become the highest-grossing live concert tour in music history up to that point (1978).[25] The band played at London's Wembley Arena for eight straight sold-out nights during the tour, another record at that time.

In 1979, the multi-platinum album _Discovery_ was released, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart.[26] Although the biggest hit on the album (and ELO's biggest hit overall) was the rock song "Don't Bring Me Down", the album was noted for its heavy disco influence. _Discovery_ also produced the hits "Shine a Little Love", their first and only no. 1 hit from 1972 to the present with any of the 4 major or minor US singles charts on _Radio & Records (R&R)_,[27][28] "Last Train to London", "Confusion" and "The Diary of Horace Wimp". Another song, "Midnight Blue", was released as a single in Southeast Asia. The band recorded promotional videos for all the songs on the album.

Elo_27041978_04_800.jpg, Norway, in 1978]] By the end of 1979, ELO had reached the peak of their stardom, selling millions of albums and singles, and even inspiring a parody/tribute song on the Randy Newman album _Born Again_, titled "The Story of a Rock and Roll Band". During 1979 Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 Knebworth Festival concerts. That allowed Led Zeppelin the chance to headline instead. In 1980 Jeff Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film _Xanadu_, with the other half written by John Farrar and performed by the film's star Olivia Newton-John. The movie performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going double platinum. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John ("Magic", a #1 hit in the United States, and "Suddenly" with Cliff Richard) and ELO ("I'm Alive", which went gold, "All Over the World" and "Don't Walk Away"). The title track, performed by both Newton-John and ELO, is ELO's only song to top the singles chart in the United Kingdom.[29] More than a quarter of a century later, _Xanadu_, a Broadway musical, based on the film, opened on 10 July 2007 at the Helen Hayes Theatre to uniformly good reviews. It received 4 Tony Award nominations. The musical received its UK premiere in London in October 2015.[30] Casey Kasem called The Electric Light Orchestra a "7-man supergroup" and "amazing" for hitting The Top 40 a remarkable 6 times in a one-year period from August 1979 to August 1980 before playing "All Over the World" at #23[31]

In 1981, ELO's sound changed again with the science fiction concept album _Time_, a throwback to earlier, more progressive rock albums like _Eldorado_. With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. _Time_ topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until _Alone in the Universe_ in 2015. Singles from the album included "Hold On Tight", "Twilight", "The Way Life's Meant to Be", "Here Is the News" and "Ticket to the Moon". The band embarked on their last world tour to promote the LP. For the tour Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst synthesizer players Louis Clark and Dave Morgan also joined the band.

1983–1986: _Secret Messages_, _Balance of Power_, disbanding

Electric_Light_Orchestra_(1986).jpg

Jeff Lynne wanted to follow _Time_ with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive in the oil crisis and as a result, the new album was edited down from double album to a single disc and released as _Secret Messages_ in 1983 (many of the out-takes were later released on _Afterglow_ or as b-sides of singles). The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5; but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP, as drummer Bevan was now playing drums for Black Sabbath and bassist Groucutt had left the band during the recording of the album (leaving Lynne to once again record many of the bass parts). Rumours of the group disbanding were publicly denied by Bevan and although _Secret Messages_ debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it fell off the charts, failing to catch fire with a lack of hit singles in the UK (though "Rock 'n' Roll Is King" was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response.

By 1983 Bevan was expressing a desire to join Black Sabbath permanently and Lynne and Tandy were recording tracks for the _Electric Dreams_ soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record _Balance of Power_, released early in 1986. Though the single "Calling America" placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the States, subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesisers, played by Tandy.

The band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark, and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on _American Bandstand_,[32] _Solid Gold_, then at Disneyland that summer.[33] The Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986 was a charity concert organised by Bevan in ELO's hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986.[34] A hint of Lynne's future was seen when George Harrison appeared onstage during the encore at Heartbeat, joining in the all-star jam of "Johnny B. Goode". ELO's last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in Stuttgart, Germany playing as opening act to Rod Stewart. ELO effectively disbanded after that final show in Stuttgart in 1986, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison's Lynne-produced album _Cloud Nine_ and the pair's follow-up (with Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as Traveling Wilburys) _Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1_ were released.

ELO Part II

Electric_Light_Orchestra_3.jpg

Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as ELO Part II, initially with no other former ELO members. ELO Part II released their debut album _Electric Light Orchestra Part Two_ in 1990. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell joined the band for the first tour in 1991. McDowell left after that tour. Bevan, Groucutt, Kaminski and Clark recorded a second album, _Moment of Truth_, in 1994 and toured extensively until 1999. Bevan retired from the line-up in 1999 and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000. After Bevan left, the band continued after they changed its name to 'The Orchestra'.

2000–2001: Reformation

Lynne's comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, _Flashback_, containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO's only UK number one hit "Xanadu". In 2001 _Zoom,_ ELO's first album since 1986, was released.[35] Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Upon completion of the album, Lynne reformed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend Rosie Vela (who had released her own album, _Zazu_, in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Former ELO member Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: _VH1 Storytellers_ and a PBS concert shot at CBS Television City, later titled _Zoom Tour Live_, that was released on DVD. The planned tour was cancelled.[36]

2001–2013: Non-performing work, reissues and miniature reunions

Electric_Light_Orchestra_in_2013_on_Stage.jpg For the next six years, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was "Surrender" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was "Latitude 88 North".

On 9 August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released _Live – The Early Years_ in the UK as a DVD compilation that included _Fusion – Live in London_ (1976) along with never before released live performances at _Brunel University_ (1973) and on a German TV show _Rockpalast_ (1974).[37] The US had a slightly edited release on 24 August 2010.[38] _The Essential Electric Light Orchestra_ artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.[39]

_Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra_ was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of new recordings of ELO's greatest hits by Lynne; along with a new song "Point of No Return", released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release _Long Wave_.[40] These new 2012 albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album _Zoom_ and Lynne's debut solo album _Armchair Theatre_, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, _Electric Light Orchestra Live_, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.[41]

Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, "Livin' Thing" and "Mr. Blue Sky" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin.[42]

2014–present: Jeff Lynne's ELO

Jefflynne_hydepark.jpg, September 2014]]

The success of the Children in Need was followed by much support from BBC Radio 2's DJ Chris Evans, who asked his listeners if they wanted ELO to perform. The 50,000 tickets for the resulting BBC Radio 2's "Festival in a Day" in Hyde Park on 14 September 2014 sold out in 15 minutes. Billed as "Jeff Lynne's ELO", Lynne and Tandy were backed by the Take That/Gary Barlow band from the Children in Need concert, led by Mike Stevens [43] and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Lynne chose to use the name as a response to ELO offshoot, tribute and imitation bands, (ELO Part II, the Orchestra, OrKestra and the Music of ELO) who repeatedly used ELO for promoting their own tours.[44] Chereene Allen[45] was the lead violinist for the band. The development of modern digital processing added a smoother finish to the work, which led Lynne to reconsider his preference for studio work, hinting at a UK tour in 2015.[46]

On 8 February 2015, Jeff Lynne's ELO played at the Grammy Awards for the first time.[47] They performed a medley of "Evil Woman" and "Mr. Blue Sky" with Ed Sheeran, who introduced them as "A man and a band who I love".[48]

On 10 September 2015, it was announced that a new ELO album would be released. The album was to be under the moniker of Jeff Lynne's ELO, with the band signed to Columbia Records.[49] _Alone in the Universe_ was released on 13 November 2015. The album was ELO's first album of new material in nearly 15 years.[50] The first track, and single, "When I Was a Boy" was made available for streaming on the same day and a music video for the song was also released.[51] A small promotional tour followed the album's release which saw ELO perform a full concert for _BBC Radio 2_ along with ELO's first two shows in the United States in 30 years, both which sold out very quickly. ELO also made rare US television appearances on _The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon_, _Jimmy Kimmel Live_ and _CBS This Morning_.[52] A 19-date European tour was announced for 2016,[53] with the band playing the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2016.[54]

In 2017 they played their "Alone in the Universe" tour.[55][56] That same year, on 7 April, they played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they were inducted during the 32nd Annual Induction Ceremony.[57]

The band continued to tour in 2018 and performed at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony during the handover presentation of Birmingham 2022 joining rapper Lady Sanity.[58]

On 22 October 2018 Lynne announced that ELO would embark on a 2019 North American tour from June to August 2019.[59]

ELO keyboardist Richard Tandy last toured with the group in 2016, but has been absent from the stage since then due to a rumored illness or injury.


Legacy and influence

According to music journalist Simon Price, ELO was "arguably the most uncool, even defiantly anti-cool, of the lot and have been the slowest to be rehabilitated since ... They've been sampled by dozens upon dozens of acts, from Company Flow to the Pussycat Dolls!, if you go looking. Every now and then in my journalistic career, it's been possible to coax a contemporary band to admit to an ELO influence, the Flaming Lips and Super Furry Animals being two examples. But the band with arguably, the greatest amount of ELO DNA are outside the rock genre altogether: Daft Punk."[60]

In November 2016, Jeff Lynne's ELO won Band of the Year at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. [61] In October 2016, ELO were nominated for the 2017 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time. [62] It was the first time the Hall had announced in advance the members of bands who would be inducted; the members of ELO listed were Jeff Lynne, Roy Wood, Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy.[63] On 20 December 2016, it was announced ELO had been elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2017.[64]
