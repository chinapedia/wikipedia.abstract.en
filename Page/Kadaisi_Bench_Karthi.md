Production

Director Ravi Bhargavan decided to collaborate with actor Bharath for a film in July 2016, with the film being launched later that month.[1] Punjabi model, Ruhani Sharma, was brought in to portray one of the film's lead actresses in July 2016. The shot primarily in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and some portions in Amalapuram. Ruhani Sharma finished filming for her scenes in mid-August 2016, with the team holding a photoshoot with the lead actors to mark the end of her portion in the film.[2] Angana Roy joined the sets of the film in August 2016, and revealed that the film was a bilingual and all the artistes had committed double call sheets to work day and night.[3][4]


Soundtrack

The film's music was composed by Anbu Rajesh. The soundtrack was released by New Music by film-maker S. S. Rajamouli, who attended as the chief guest on 27 January 2017.[5][6]


Release

The film was initially set for release on 6 October 2017 but was delayed following a theatre strike against new taxes in Tamil Nadu.[7] The film subsequently had a low profile release across Tamil Nadu on 27 October 2017, alongside another film, _Kalathur Gramam_ (2017).

A critic from The New Indian Express gave the film a negative review, stating "there’s almost nothing positive about this film, which, to double the misery, is a bilingual" and that "it’s just about a truckload of issues that will make you laugh for the wrong reasons".[8] Another critic from Tamil Nadu Central added "_Kadaisi Bench Karthi_ is so stale that you wonder what made Bharath agree to do this film", adding "the film had no big promotions and there is hardly anyone in the theatre to hoot or cheer" and that the film "is bound to be at the ‘kadaisi bench’ itself".[9]
