PRINCESS GYEONGHYE (1435–1473), also known as PRINCESS PYEONGCHANG before her marriage, was a Joseon princess and the eldest child of Munjong of Joseon. She served as guardian for her brother, Danjong of Joseon, when he ascended the throne underage.[1]


Biography

The princess was born in 1435 to the Crown Prince of Joseon and Crown Princess Hyeondeok, who died later in 1441. She was enfeoffed as Princess Pyeongchang (; ).[2] At some point during her childhood, Princess Pyeongchang was sent to live with a government minister, Cho Yurye (조유례), for safety. Munjong later noted that she regarded Cho as a foster-father.[3]

In 1450, the princess was married to Jeong Jong and granted the title Princess Gyeonghye.[4] Jeong was raised to the position of Minister of Justice.[5] The next year, Munjong of Joseon granted her land at Yeongdeok pang (양덕방) to build a new mansion. Officials argued against this, as it required removing more than 30 families and Jeong already had a mansion, but the gift was bestowed anyway.[6] In 1452, Princess Gyeonghye's brother ascended the throne and she acted as his guardian. Although along with the general Kim Jong-seo, she attempted to strengthen royal authority, a coup led by her uncle ended with her brother's banishment.[7]


Reign of Sejo

In 1455, Jeong was banished to Gyeonggi Province and Princess Gyeonghye fell ill. Hearing of her illness, the new king Sejo of Joseon sent a servant to tend her, who Princess Gyeonghye used to send a message begging for Jeong to be restored, which was allowed.[8] She was pregnant at the time and Sejo threatened that if she had a boy the child would be killed. Queen Jeonghui, however, issued instructions that the child be spared regardless of its sex, telling the eunuch in charge that she would take responsibility for deceiving Sejo. After Princess Gyeonghye gave birth to her son in exile, the eunuch dressed the child in female clothes and took it to the court, where it was raised.

In 1461, Jeong was found guilty of rebelling against Sejo of Joseon and was executed by dismemberment. Princess Gyeonghye was judged guilty by association, her rank was reduced to _nobi_ serf (), and she was sent to the official royal convent.[9] Queen Jeonghui later intervened on the princess' behalf, persuading Sejo to restore her status, property, and servants.


Legacy

On 27 December 1473, Princess Gyeonghye wrote a will, urging her son to build a shrine to his grandfather and perform ancestral rites in accordance with Confucian tradition. The will is in the Jangseogak, housed by the Academy of Korean Studies.[10]
