VUKOV SABOR ( / _Vukov sabor_) or VUK'S CONVOCATION[1] is the oldest and most massive cultural event in Serbia. It was named after the reformer of the Serbian language Vuk Karadžić. The central program is traditionally held in September in Vuk's birthplace Tršić, near Loznica. Part of the program is realized in Loznica, Belgrade and the nearby Tronoša Monastery.

The first Vukov sabor was held in 1933[2] and, in following years, Vukov sabor wasn't held only in 1941 and 1944 due to World War II.[3]

Organizers of Vukov sabor are Vuk Karadžić Cultural Center, the city of Loznica, and Serbian Ministry of Culture and Information.
