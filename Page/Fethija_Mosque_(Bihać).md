FEHTIJA MOSQUE (Bosnian: _Fethija džamija_) is a mosque and former Catholic church located in the town of Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Built in 1266, it is the oldest gothic building in the country.[1] It was originally built as a Catholic church dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, and was subsequently transformed into a mosque following the 1592 conquest of Bihać from Habsburg Croatia by the Ottomans. The building was originally accompanied by a monastery, which was also mentioned in a 13th-century charter of the Croatian nobility.
