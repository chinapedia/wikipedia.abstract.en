Annotations

The book Reforms and Dogmas. The state and the economy in the age of reforms and revolutions (1860-1920) examines the history of the economy and economic policy of Russia and the USSR in the first third of the 20th century; it shows the integrity of this period, including the continuity of economic decisions by successive governments of Russia (Tsar, Interim, and Bolshevik governments). It analyzes how different governments searched for the measures to steer the country out of social and economic crisis and to expedite economic growth.

The book In search of conformity to the plan: economic discussion of 1930-1960s is dedicated to one of the most dramatic periods in the history of Soviet economic thought. It addresses the deep crisis that swept science in the context of administrative system formation and repression against prominent academic economists, and the first attempts to get out of this crisis related to the theoretical preparation of the economic reform of 1965 in the USSR. While analyzing the theory of the planned economy, the author reveals the inner logic of the development of science, the contradictions inherent in it, and quantum leaps, the relationship between political economy views and concepts of economic mechanism.

Economy and power: Political history of economic reform in Russia (1985-1994) considers the relationship and the impact of economic and political problems that arose during the period of perestroika and after the collapse of the Soviet system. It reveals the reasons for decisions made by the highest authorities of the USSR and Russia, as well as the root of the authorities’ illusions and delusions. The book was published in Delo Publishing House in 1994, and in 1996, it was released in the UK under the title The Political History of Economic Reform in Russia, 1985-1994 (L.: Centre for Research into Communist Economies).

Economic reform: through the lens of the constitution and politics represents one of the first forays into constitutional economics research with regard to modern Russia. The book explores constitutional (and even broader – legal) problems of Russian economic reforms, based on the experiences of developed and developing countries. Economic problems are considered through the lens of noneconomic factors, i.e. political, constitutional, and legal. The book was first published in the AdMarginem Publishing House in 1999.

The great revolutions. From Cromwell to Putin (Moscow: Vagrius, 2001. 2nd edition — 2004), also published by Oxford University Press under the title The Challenge of Revolution: Contemporary Russia in Historical Perspective (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001). The book considers the events of 1985-2000 in Russia in the context of the great revolutions of the past — the English civil war, the French Revolution, and the Russian and Mexican revolutions in the early 20th century. The authors show that the post-communist transformation in Russia can be better understood based on historical analysis. It is proved that Russia experienced a full-scale revolution in the late 20th century, which, in its main features, is remarkably similar to the great revolutions of the past. This concept not only explains the causes and consequences of many key events in the country since 1985, but makes it possible to understand the logic of further events in contemporary Russia.

Crises and lessons. Russia's economy in an age of turbulence (Moscow: Gaidar Institute Publishing House, 2016) is devoted to the study of crises in contemporary Russian history. The analysis was conducted in the context of last century’s large-scale crises. In the publication, special attention is paid to the problems of contemporary global crisis and its development in Russia. The book is intended for economists, historians, and all those interested in the realities of economic policy and economic history.
