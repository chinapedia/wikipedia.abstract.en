Members

Ryan Steele

Ryan Steele grew up in the city of Langley, British Columbia, where he graduated from H. D. Stafford High School. He became interested in comedy at an early age, and started making comedy videos in his early-teens, with early successes 'Ferry Death' and 'Big Mac Attack'. After being diagnosed with testicular cancer at 19, he gave up the dream of being a comedian for a while. In his late 20s, he went to a Tony Robbins' like workshop where he was told to start doing Sketch Comedy, so he started his own ensemble sketch show.[7]

Amy Goodmurphy

Amy Goodmurphy grew up in North Vancouver, British Columbia, and is a St. Thomas Aquinas Regional Secondary School alumna. She started comedy at the age of 23 after meeting Steele at the bar where he worked. He convinced her it would be worth her while to join his ensemble sketch show. It wasn't, so she started studying acting at Vancouver Acting School, graduating in 2012.[8]


Style

THE RYAN AND AMY SHOW is unique in that it doesn't just do sketch comedy but is interspersed with previously recorded video. The smart transitions from video to sketch back to video is unrivaled in the industry today. Their style spans a wide variety from Horror to Displacement sketches. They've been described as a modern day Three's Company meets Mr. Dressup, for their affinity for tickle trunk magic and the lingering question of whether Steele may actually be straight.


Kelowna Song

In May 2017 the duo had a viral hit about the town of Kelowna, racking up over 150,000 hits in under a month. Performing as Mom's over Miami, they sang 'My Sharona' by the Knack but with better lyrics.[9]
