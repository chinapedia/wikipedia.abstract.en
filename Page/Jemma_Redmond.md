JEMMA REDMOND (16 March 1978 – 16 August 2016) was an Irish biotechnology pioneer and innovator. She was a co-founder of 3D bio-printing firm Ourobotics, developers of the first-ever ten-material bio-printer.[1] Redmond designed a way of keeping living cells alive while printed using 3D printers,[2] making her a leading figure in Irish science and technology.[3]


Early life

Born in Tallaght, South Dublin, Redmond studied applied physics at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen in 2002. She later returned to university, completing a master's degree in nano-bioscience at University College Dublin in 2012, along with qualifications in project management and electronic engineering.[4] Her interest in nano-bioscience was sparked by an intersex condition that made her infertile.[5][6][7] She started bioprinting by building her own devices in her kitchen.[8]


Career

A serial entrepreneur, Redmond created a company manufacturing vending machines in 2008, before co-founding Ourobotics in January 2015, with Alanna Kelly from Galway, Ireland, and backing from SOSV.[9] Kelly resigned as director in July 2015. Tony Herbert, entrepreneur and owner of technical optics company Irish Precision Optics, from Cork became a director of Ourobotics in August 2015 and the company moved to the optics company premises in Cork City. Redmond designed and marketed two bio-printers including, in 2016, a printer capable of printing human tissue,[10] and at a much lower cost than previous bio-printers.[11] Redmond's first device printed an extended finger, described by Pádraig Belton as "a gentle reply to those who had called printing organs of such complexity impossible."[12]

In January 2016, the company won first prize in a prestigious international competition, _Silicon Valley Open Doors Europe_.[13][14][15] The company was also selected as part of a start-up adoption program by Google.[16]


Death

Redmond died unexpectedly in August 2016.[17][18][19] Her mother described it as a "tragic accident".[20] She was described as a polymath,[21] an inspiration and great friend.[22][23]
