It is bounded to the north by the Petrópolis Environmental Protection Area and the Três Picos State Park, to the east by the Paraíso Ecological Station, the Guapiaçú River and the municipality of Itaboraí and to the south by the Guapimirim Environmental Protection Area.

The APA has low population density. , or 14.77%, is designated for permanent protection. Of this, , or 71.36% of the permanently protected area, is not covered by natural vegetation. Most of the natural vegetation is várzea forest, but the APA contains significant remnants of submontane and montane Atlantic Forest. It connects the mangroves to the alpine meadows and high montane forests, forms a corridor between the five conservation units that are partly located in the municipality of Guapimirim, and helps to control occupation and land use of the area.

Potential threats are uncontrolled urban and industrial expansion due to low agricultural use, deforestation, trafficking in wildlife and hunting. On the positive side, the low agricultural use may provide the opportunity for reforestation.
