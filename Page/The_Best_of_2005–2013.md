_THE BEST OF 2005–2013_ is a greatest hits album by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released by the band's former label, Warner Music Group on December 2, 2016. The album covers songs from all of the band's albums released under Warner Bros., from _City of Evil_ to _Hail to the King_, including covers and one-off singles released in between.[1] The band members themselves have not endorsed or supported this album due to it being released without their consent, knowledge or involvement.


Background

In early 2016, Avenged Sevenfold left Warner Bros. for Capitol Records, resulting in a legal battle between the record label and the band.[2] In response to the alleged leaked release date of the band's seventh album, falsely leaked and titled _Voltaic Oceans_ with a December 9 release date by Chris Jericho over Instagram, Warner Bros. announced _The Best of 2005–2013_, to be released one week prior to the leaked release date, on December 2. However, the band officially surprise released the album as _The Stage_ on October 28, to which the label quickly changed the release date to capitalize on traffic, but reverted to its December 2 release.

Singer M. Shadows has openly expressed disdain about the release of the greatest hits album without the band's knowledge, stating "You’re gonna try to put this record out right before our new record just to undercut us and try to confuse the casual fan, like, 'Is this the new record? Or is that the new record?' Or parents buying stuff for Christmas. So it's just really childish."[3]
