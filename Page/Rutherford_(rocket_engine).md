RUTHERFORD is a liquid-propellant rocket engine designed by American-New Zealand aerospace company Rocket Lab[1] and manufactured in California.[2] It uses LOX and RP-1 as its propellants and is the first flight-ready engine to use the electric-pump feed cycle. It is used on the company's own rocket, Electron. The rocket uses a similar engine arrangement to the Falcon 9; a two-stage rocket using a cluster of nine identical engines on the first stage, and one vacuum-optimized version with a longer nozzle on the second stage.[3][4] The sea-level version produces of thrust and has a specific impulse of , while the vacuum optimized-version produces of thrust and has a specific impulse of .[5]

It was qualified for flight in March 2016[6] and had its first flight on 25 May 2017.[7] The engine has powered 7 Electron flights in total, making the count of flown engines 70.


Description

RUTHERFORD, named after renowned British-based, New Zealander scientist Ernest Rutherford, is a small liquid-propellant rocket engine designed to be simple and cheap to produce. It is used as both a first-stage and a second-stage engine, which simplifies logistics and improves economies of scale.[8][9] To reduce its cost, it uses the electric-pump feed cycle, being the first flight-ready engine of such type.[10] It is fabricated largely by 3D printing, using a method called electron-beam melting. Its combustion chamber, injectors, pumps, and main propellant valves are all 3D-printed.[11][12][13]

As with all pump-fed engines, the Rutherford uses a rotodynamic pump to increase the pressure from the tanks to that needed by the combustion chamber.[14] The use of a pump avoids the need for heavy tanks capable of holding high pressures and the high amounts of inert gas needed to keep the tanks pressurized during flight.[15]

The pumps (one for the fuel and one for the oxidizer) in electric-pump feed engines are driven by an electric motor.[16] The Rutherford engine uses dual brushless DC electric motors and a lithium polymer battery. It is claimed that this improves efficiency from the 50% of a typical gas-generator cycle to 95%.[17] However, the battery pack increases the weight of the complete engine and presents an energy conversion issue.[18]

Each engine has two small motors that generate while spinning at 40 000 rpm.[19] The first-stage battery, which has to power the pumps of nine engines simultaneously, can provide over 1 MW of electric power.[20]

The engine is regeneratively cooled, meaning that before injection some of the cold RP-1 is passed through cooling channels embedded in the combustion chamber and nozzle structure, transferring heat away from them, before finally being injected into the combustion chamber.
