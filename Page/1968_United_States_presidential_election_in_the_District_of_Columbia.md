The UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 1968 took place in order to select the District of Columbia's 3 electoral votes for President of the United States. Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the District by an overwhelming margin, receiving over 80% of the vote.[1] This was the second presidential election in which the District of Columbia had the right to vote in presidential elections, as well as the only place where George Wallace did not have his name on the ballot. This is the only election in which a republican had a higher score in DC than at least one state in that same election
