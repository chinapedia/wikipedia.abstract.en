CHOUTEAU SPRINGS is an unincorporated community in Pilot Grove Township, Cooper County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

In 1799 Jean Pierre Chouteau and his party of fur traders on an inland excursion from the Missouri River came upon bubbling mineral springs in a valley surrounded by sycamores and elms. The local Osage Indians informed Chouteau of the curative qualities of the mineral water and told him that their braves would often drink from them. Chouteau bartered with the Osage for 30,000 arpines (about 25,000 acres) of what is now called the Chouteau Springs area. The official transaction took place at the Fort of the Osages on March 19, 1799.[2] Chouteau would later sell the 30,000 arpines to William Henry Ashley.[3][4]Portrait_of_Jean_Pierre_Chouteau.jpg

In 1870, St. Martin's Catholic Church, an 18x24 log structure, was built in Chouteau Springs on 1.5 acres of land donated by Daniel Martin, called "Martinsville."[5][6]

In 1877, a 4-story frame hotel 190 x 45 ft. was built in Chouteau Springs for about $25,000 with C. B. Lakin of Kansas City as the architect. It had a passenger elevator, steam bath, speaking tubes, hardwood, stained glass.[7] In 1906, there was a hotel in Chouteau Springs called the "Hotel Brown". 1906_Ad_for_Hotel_Brown_Chouteau_Springs_Missouri.jpg In 1882, citizens of Boonville seriously considered piping Chouteau Springs mineral water from Chouteau Springs to Boonville, a distance of about ten miles. Chouteau Springs Resort had several turreted structures from which to obtain the mineral water, a large dancing pavilion, a pool, and ample picnic grounds.Chouteau_Springs_Resort_Pavilion_ca_1900.jpg Families from St. Louis and beyond would spend a week or more at Chouteau Springs Resort (1902). Fox hunts were also conducted at Chouteau Springs Resort.[8]

Chouteau Springs was platted in 1886 beside a mineral spring, and named after Jean Pierre Chouteau, the original owner of the town site.[9]

In 1887, an electric railroad from Boonville to Chouteau Springs was proposed. It was never built.

A post office called Chouteau was established in 1890, and remained in operation until 1896.[10]

In 1900, Eugene A Windsor purchased Chouteau Springs Park Resort from James E. Young of Kansas City, Kansas.[11]

By 1907, KATY Railroad was making multiple stops in Chouteau Springs.

Chouteau Springs Resort ceased operations about 1960. It is in ruins as of 2019.


Geological Research

In 1874, Professor Adolphe Smith of the Missouri Geological Survey was "delighted with Chouteau Springs water, pronouncing it the best he ever tasted and better than the famous Blue Lick waters in Kentucky."[12] In 1886, an analysis of Chouteau Springs water by G. C. Swallow, Missouri state geologist, showed the following minerals: carbonate of protoxide of iron, carbonate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, chloride of calcium, chloride of potassium, chloride of sodium, carbonic acid and silica. Total weight of the minerals was approximately one-tenth of one per cent of the weight of the water.[13]

In 1981, Larry Stout, a scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, published an article in the _Journal of Paleontology_ regarding his discovery of the unusual occurrence (only the third known in North America) of the brackish-water ostracode _Cyprideis salebrosa_ in Chouteau Springs, Missouri.[14]

In 1944, William H. Easton of the Illinois State Geological Survey Division published an article (Report of Investigations No. 97) which noted, among many other things, that the coral fauna of the Chouteau Springs limestone is larger in number of genera and species than that known from any other Carboniferous formation in this hemisphere (p. 7).[15]
