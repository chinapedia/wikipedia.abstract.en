Early life

Jade Wu was born January 5, 1953, in Tokyo, Japan and was born into a family of Chinese heritage. She was the daughter of a soldier and spent much of her childhood traveling while her father was serving in the United States Army. Her family later settled in the United States where her father began work at Capitol Hill. Wu spent much of her childhood living in Washington, D.C. and considers it to be where she was raised, despite the many places she had lived before hand. Many years later she moved to California.


Education

After moving to the west coast, Wu attended the University of California, San Diego. Working towards success in medical school, Wu began research after her first year enrolled as a student, realizing that she wanted to pursue an MFA in theater. There, over time she developed the accents of standard English, British/Polish/ Slovakian and some fluency in Cantonese and Mandarin. Wu Graduated the University of California with a BS in Biochemistry, a BA in Humanities, a BA in Drama, and an MFA in Acting and Directing. Also, later received education:

-   Certification in Video/Film Editing from The Edit Center
-   AA in Science and Humanities from Mira Costa College


Before entertainment

After graduating, Jade Wu moved to New York City to put her degree to use and pursue her dream as an actress and or director. Upon her arrival, however, she could not find a job. There were no roles or positions for Asian Americans on television at the time, and if there were they were too small to benefit from financially. Because of the lack of opportunities, Wu got involved in commercialism and later found herself in the corporate realm of public relations and advertising. Through this period of her youth, she became skilled in image and visibility in both public and private sector campaigns. She became well-versed in international diplomacy and formalizing relationships as well as gaining interest in social, cultural, human, and environmental causes. During this time Wu also, further developed her specialties of public speaking, writing narratives/scripts/essays/journals, food styling and photography.


Acting career

Network Television, Independent Film and Professional Theater. Wu did not get involved with showbiz until 20 years after her big move from the west coast. It was not until one of her old head-shots happened to end up in a _Homicide: Life on the Street_ episodic casting office that she finally surfaced within Hollywood. At the time, the show was shooting in Baltimore, Maryland. The executives called her in for an audition as they were looking for a Korean immigrant. Even during the late 1990s roles for Asian American actors were so sparse that it was rare to find trained Asians who were adequately eligible for the position posted. Wu was awarded a recurring role on the show, officially introducing her to the professional arena of television.
