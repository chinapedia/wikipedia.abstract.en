Hillingdon_Civic_Centre,_exterior_3_-_Anthony_Ossa-Richardson.jpg HILLINGDON CIVIC CENTRE is the headquarters of the London Borough of Hillingdon, located in Uxbridge. It was designed by Andrew Derbyshire and is one of the most famous buildings in the British neo-vernacular style.[1][2][3][4] It was planned from 1970, built from 1973 onwards and opened in stages after 1976 with a formal opening in April 1979.[5]

Derbyshire's design made extensive use of brick and tile, to pay homage to traditional homely brick architecture of nearby buildings and suburban developments that were "indigenous to the borough".[6][7] It was designated a Grade II Listed Building in April 2018.[8]
