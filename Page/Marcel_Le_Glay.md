MARCEL LE GLAY (7 May 1920, Arleux near Douai (Nord) – 14 August 1992[1]) was a 20th-century French historian and archaeologist, specializing in ancient Rome. His work focused in particular on Roman religion and North Africa during Antiquity, especially from Latin literature epigraphic: his monumental thesis, dedicated to the cult of Saturn in Africa, is meeting his three favorite areas.


Career

A member of the École française de Rome from 1947 to 1949, he chose to devote himself to archeology, with a thesis on the Roman porticos and religious history, with an article on Syrian gods of the Janiculum where he already addressed the issue of integration of provincial cults in the Roman religious universe.

The work of Marcel Le Glay is important: a dozen books, and nearly two hundred articles and pamphlets, of which approximately half relates to ancient Africa. His culture, intellectual curiosity, competence were very broad and covered all of Roman history.

He also devoted many studies to Gaul, and the Byzantine Empire often caught his attention. Throughout his career he managed to combine his research and scientific responsibilities with his university professor functions.
