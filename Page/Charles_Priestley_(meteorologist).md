Education

He was born in London and educated at Cambridge University, where he graduated with first class honors in Applied Mathematics in 1937 and in Economics a year later.


Career

He joined the British Meteorological Office in 1939 and was asked to study turbulent diffusion in the atmospheric boundary layer (the first few hundred meters of the atmosphere above the earth's surface). In 1943 he was transferred to the upper-air unit and helped prepare the D-Day weather forecast.

After the war, he was recommended for a new position as head of a research group at CSIRO in Australia to carry out atmospheric research. He moved with his wife to Melbourne in 1946 as Officer-in-Charge of the Meteorological Physics Section. There, over some 30 years, the team studies included atmospheric turbulence, geophysical fluid dynamics, and atmospheric chemistry.

He retired from the position in 1972 to become Chairman of CSIRO's Environmental Physics Research Laboratories from 1973 to 1977 and then part-time Professor of Mathematics at Monash University. He retired completely in the late 1980s and died in 1998.
