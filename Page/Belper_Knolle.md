Belper_Knolle_avec_ruban_rouge,_WikiCheese_Lausanne.jpg Belper_Knolle_Gold_with_packaging,_WikiCheese_Lausanne.jpg The BELPER KNOLLE ("Belp Ball") is a Swiss cheese made in the city of Belp, Switzerland.[1]

Made from unpasteurized cow's milk, it can be found in two variants, _red_ or _gold_ depending on its degree of maturation, fresh or dry. A fresh Belper Knolle can be heated to 60 °C and softened in a sort of square-shaped stone before consumption.
