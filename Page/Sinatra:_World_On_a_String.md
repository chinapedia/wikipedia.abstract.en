_SINATRA: WORLD ON A STRING_ is a 2016 box set album of live performances by the American singer Frank Sinatra, recorded in Italy in 1953, Monaco in 1958, Sydney in 1961, Cairo in 1979, and the Dominican Republic in 1982. The performances are chronicled on four compact discs with a further DVD of a 1962 concert in Tokyo with short films and Italian chocolate adverts featuring Sinatra during his world tour of 1962.[1]

The album continues a series of live box sets of unreleased Sinatra concerts following _Sinatra: Vegas_ (2006), _Sinatra: New York_ (2009), and _Sinatra: London_ (2014).


Reception

Wade Tatangelo, reviewing the set for the _Sarasota Herald-Tribune_, described the set as "every bit as rewarding" as _Sinatra: Vegas_ and _Sinatra: New York_ and wrote of the Monaco concert that "...Sinatra never sounded better in the studio or on stage than he did in the late 1950s and this concert is a perfectly-paced treasure". Tatangelo noted the decline in Sinatra's voice by the time of the 1979 concert in Egypt, but felt that by the 1982 concert in the Dominican Republic, Sinatra sounded "...just as good, maybe even better, than he did during the 1979 set" and highlighted his performance of "Send in the Clowns" with "sparse, sublime accompaniment" from the guitarist Tony Mottola.[2]

In their review of the set, _Broadway World_ commented that "Listening to the nearly 30-year span of performances, it's remarkable to realize how the passage of time never diminished Sinatra's way with a song; if anything, it deepened his understanding of his material. Comparing renditions of "Bewitched" from 1958 and 1979 reveals a more pronounced resonance in Sinatra's delivery".[3]
