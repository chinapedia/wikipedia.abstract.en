_EUCALYPTUS CERNUA_, commonly known as the RED-FLOWERED MOORT[1] or the YELLOW-FLOWERED MOORT,[2] is a eucalypt that is native to Western Australia.[3]


Description

The mallee typically grows to a height of [4] but can reach as high as .[5] It has smooth mottled grey to brown coloured bark[6] that can become black over greenish yellow new bark. It has no lignotuber and a single stem. The concolorous glossy green adult leaves are arranged alternately. The leaf blade has a lanceolate shape that is in length and wide with a base tapering to petiole.[7] It blooms between October and December and produces crimson-red flowers.[8] Each axillary unbranched inflorescence is often down-turned and in length and occurs groups of seven per umbel.[9]


Taxonomy

The species was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 2002 and _Taxonomy of species deriving from the publication of Eucalyptus subseries Cornutae Benth. (Myrtaceae)_ as published in the journal _Nuytsia_.[10] The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word _cernuus_ meaning _nodding, towards earth_ in reference referring to the downward facing inflorescences.[11] The species was previously thought to have been _Eucalyptus nutans_.[12][13]


Distribution

It has a limited range along the south coast of Western Australia in the Goldfields-Esperance region near Ravensthorpe particularly in the Fitzgerald River National Park.[14]


Cultivation

It is used for ornamental plantings, shade and honey production. When cultivated it can tolerate arid area, is slow growing and requires little maintenance.
