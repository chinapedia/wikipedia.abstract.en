History

1908_PHARUS_sielanka.jpg

In the early 20th century, Bydgoszcz was called "Bromberg". A large distinct area developed east of the town centre. This area was delineated by Ossoliński Alley, Adam Mickiewicz Alley and Markwarta, Paderewskiego and Staszica streets. The area lay north of a Christian cemetery which became Ludowy Park, on Jagiellońska street.

In 1906, the Emperor Wilhelm Royal Institute of Agriculture, (_Kaiser Wilhelm's Institut für Landwirtschaft zu Bromberg_) was constructed to the east of the area. At the same time, between 1905 and 1907, the Royal School of Bromberg (_Stadt Real Schule_) was constructed to the west of the area. This became the Copernicanum building. Between 1903 and 1907, most of the tenements on Adam Mickiewicz Alley were completed. This formed the north boundary of the area. Between 1910 and 1912, the People's School for Boys (_Bürgerschule_) was formed on the western boundary. It became High School N° VI.[4]

The resulting triangular area was then further developed as the _Sielanka_ (). In December 1912, Josef Stübben (1845 1936) made a sketch for the area. The project was led by Heinrich Metzger, and urban engineer. The surveyor was Bernhard Hirsch.

In the draft, the area was divided into seven irregularly shaped parts. Five of the parts were devoted to the construction of small houses. These parts were near what became Asnyka Street and the southern part of Paderewskiego Street.

The Copernicanum building was built on Staszica Street but the south western tip of the area near Markwarta street remained available for development. At the time, this land was the property of the Province of Posen. It later became a square named after Leszek the White (1124 1227), a Polish prince.

In the 1920s, fifty plots for building were defined. Their land areas varied from 600 to 1400 m². The first house to be built in Sielanka became 5 Kopernika Street.[5] During World War I, construction ceased.

In 1925, the town allowed the resumption of construction and encouraged the project with generous loans and appropriate regulations.[6] Local workers were employed. Between 1914 and 1945, the town issued forty-eight building permits. Thirty-six of these were issued between 1927 and 1933.[7]

The villa was commissioned by Antoni Weynerowski, the owner of a successful shoe factory, _LEO_. The shoe factory became _KOBRA_. The house was a wedding gift to his son, Witold and Witold's wife Julia. Julia was of Dutch descent and so the roof was designed in the style of de l'Orme.[22] The villa was surrounded by beautiful gardens. After World War II, the villa became the property of the city and became a kindergarten for the children of members of the police force.[23]
