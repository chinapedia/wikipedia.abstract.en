GLAIS STADIUM was a sports stadium and greyhound racing in Glais, near Swansea, Wales.

Before the greyhound stadium was constructed there was a recreation area and racecourse used for horse racing and pedestrianism.[1] The stadium was built in 1928 and was situated on the northern edge of Glais near Glais Bridge.[2] Greyhound racing was originally introduced in 1927 by the Welsh Racing and Athletic Association but was wound up in October 1928.[3] It re-opened in late 1928 following the decision by the Swansea Corporation not to allow racing in the town centre at the St Helens ground. The stadium remained independent (unaffiliated with a governing body) and had a grandstand by 1935 but closed before World War II.[4]

It reverted to being a recreation ground with a bowling green, tennis courts and sports fields. Today it is the Tawe Vale Golf and bowling club.
