TITYUSTOXIN PEPTIDE 2 (TsPep2) is a peptide isolated from the venom of the _Tityus serrulatus_ (Brazilian yellow scorpion). It belongs to a class of short peptides, together with Tityustoxin peptide 1 and Tityustoxin peptide 3.[1]


Sources

_Tityus serrulatus_, also known as the Brazilian yellow scorpion, is from the genus _Tityus_ belonging to the family _Buthidae_.

TsPep2 is identified from the venom of _Tityus serrulatus_ by using a cDNA primer sequence based on the C-terminal amino acid sequence of KTx2 from _Androctonus australis_.[2][3]


Chemistry

The original encoded sequence of TsPep2 consists of 68 amino acids processed in a mature peptide of 29 amino acids with a final molecular weight of 2993.59 Da.[4][5] TsPep2 differs in the mature sequence from TsPep3 only in one amino acid and TsPep1 shows 58,6% of sequence homology with Tspep2 and TsPep3.[6]

  : TSPEP2 SEQUENCE [7]

Eight cysteines establish four disulfide bridges and a C-terminal tyrosine amide is present in the 55th position. Furthermore, TsPep2 sequence alignment shows that a part of the amino acid consensus sequence (CXXXKCCXC) involved in the pore blocking mechanism is present as in other known short scorpion toxins.[8][9][10]

Target

It seems likely that TsPep2 has inhibitory actions on potassium channels, based on its sequence similarities in the C-terminal beta sheet with the potassium channel inhibitory alpha family (α-KTX) and on its similarities in the patterns of disulfide bridges with other short scorpion venom toxins.[11][12][13]


Toxicity

The biological function of TsPep2 is not clear yet, except from a small displacement on the ¹²⁵I-KTX binding site on rat brain synaptosomes.[14] However, it has been shown that this peptide is not toxic to mice.[15][16] The LD₅₀ of TsPep2 is currently unknown.
