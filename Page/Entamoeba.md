_ENTAMOEBA_ is a genus of Amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals.

In 1875, Fedor Lösch described the first proven case of amoebic dysentery in St. Petersburg, Russia. He referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as _Amoeba coli_; however, it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name.[1] The genus _Entamoeba_ was defined by Casagrandi and Barbagallo for the species _Entamoeba coli_, which is known to be a commensal organism.[2] Lösch's organism was renamed _Entamoeba histolytica_ by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. For a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus _Entamoeba_ was transferred to _Endamoeba_, a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and _Entamoeba_ has stayed 'stable' ever since.


Species

Several species are found in humans and animals. _Entamoeba histolytica_ is the pathogen responsible for invasive 'amoebiasis' (which includes amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses). Others such as _Entamoeba coli_ (not to be confused with _Escherichia coli_) and _Entamoeba dispar_[3] are harmless. With the exception of _Entamoeba gingivalis_, which lives in the mouth, and _E. moshkovskii_, which is frequently isolated from river and lake sediments, all _Entamoeba_ species are found in the intestines of the animals they infect. _Entamoeba invadens_ is a species that can cause a disease similar to _E. histolytica_ but in reptiles. In contrast to other species, _E. invadens_ forms cysts in vitro in the absence of bacteria and is used as a model system to study this aspect of the life cycle. Many other species of _Entamoeba_ have been described, and it is likely that many others remain to be found.


Structure

_Entamoeba_ cells are small, with a single nucleus and typically a single lobose pseudopod taking the form of a clear anterior bulge. They have a simple life cycle. The trophozoite (feeding-dividing form) is approximately 10-20 μm in diameter and feeds primarily on bacteria. It divides by simple binary fission to form two smaller daughter cells. Almost all species form cysts, the stage involved in transmission (the exception is _Entamoeba gingivalis_). Depending on the species, these can have one, four or eight nuclei and are variable in size; these characteristics help in species identification.


Classification

_Entamoeba_ belongs to the Archamoebae, which like many other anaerobic eukaryotes lack mitochondria. This group also includes _Endolimax_ and _Iodamoeba_, which also live in animal intestines and are similar in appearance to _Entamoeba_, although this may partly be due to convergence. Also in this group are the free-living amoebo-flagellates of the genus _Mastigamoeba_ and related genera.[4] Certain other genera of symbiotic amoebae, such as _Endamoeba_, might prove to be synonyms of _Entamoeba_ but this is still unclear.


Culture

Fission

Studying _Entamoeba invadens_, David Biron of the Weizmann Institute of Science and coworkers found that about one third of the cells are unable to separate unaided and recruit a neighboring amoeba (dubbed the "midwife") to complete the fission.[5] He writes:

    _When an amoeba divides, the two daughter cells stay attached by a tubular tether which remains intact unless mechanically severed. If called upon, the neighbouring amoeba midwife travels up to 200 μm towards the dividing amoeba, usually advancing in a straight trajectory with an average velocity of about 0.5 μm/s. The midwife then proceeds to rupture the connection, after which all three amoebae move on._

They also reported a similar behavior in _Dictyostelium_.[6]

Since _E. histolytica_ does not form cysts in the absence of bacteria, _E. invadens_ has become used as a model for encystation studies as it will form cysts under axenic growth conditions, which simplifies analysis. After inducing encystation in _E. invadens_, DNA replication increases initially and then slows down. On completion of encystation, predominantly tetra-nucleate cysts are formed along with some uni-, bi- and tri-nucleate cysts.[7]


Differentiation and cell biology

Uninucleated trophozoites convert into cysts in a process called encystation. The number of nuclei in the cyst varies from 1 to 8 among species and is one of the characteristics used to tell species apart. Of the species already mentioned, _Entamoeba coli_ forms cysts with 8 nuclei while the others form tetra-nucleated cysts. Since _E. histolytica_ does not form cysts _in vitro_ in the absence of bacteria, it is not possible to study the differentiation process in detail in that species. Instead the differentiation process is studied using _E. invadens_, a reptilian parasite that causes a very similar disease to _E. histolytica_ and which can be induced to encyst _in vitro_. Until recently there was no genetic transfection vector available for this organism and detailed study at the cellular level was not possible. However, recently a transfection vector was developed and the transfection conditions for _E. invadens_ were optimised which should enhance the research possibilities at the molecular level of the differentiation process.[8][9]


Meiosis

In sexually reproducing eukaryotes, homologous recombination (HR) ordinarily occurs during meiosis. The meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1, is required for efficient meiotic HR, and Dmc1 is expressed in _E. histolytica_.[10] The purified Dmc1 from _E. histolytica_ forms presynaptic filaments and catalyzes ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs.[11] The DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) Hop2-Mnd1.[12] These processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that _E. histolytica_ undergoes meiosis.[13]

Studies of _E. invadens_ found that, during the conversion from the tetraploid uninucleate trophozoite to the tetranucleate cyst, homologous recombination is enhanced.[14] Expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increased during encystations.[15] These findings in _E. invadens_, combined with evidence from studies of _E. histolytica_ indicate the presence of meiosis in the _Entamoeba_.
