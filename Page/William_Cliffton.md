WILLIAM CLIFFTON (1771 â€“ December 1799) was a Philadelphian poet and pamphleteer. He is the only identified member of the Anchor Club.[1] He is considered part of the "transitive state" of American poetry.[2]

Born the son of a wealthy Quaker, Cliffton suffered form a blood clot at the age of nineteen, and from then until his death, aged twenty-seven, pursued an almost exclusively literary life, though he took an interest in field sports.

Cliffton was a supporter of William Cobbett. He died in December 1799[3] from consumption.[4]
