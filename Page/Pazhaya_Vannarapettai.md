Reception

Within a month after the film's release, the film was premiered in Kalaignar TV on the eve of Pongal.

Anupama Subramaniam from Deccan Chronicle wrote " Prajin has given a neat performance and the new girl Ashmitha who resembles Reshmi Menon looks pretty and promising. Nishanth and Richard bring out their parts in a nice and refreshing manner. Karunas proves his versatility even though he appears in a cameo scene. Though director Mohan initially takes a while to establish the characters, he still manages to maintain a racy pace post interval. You could hardly catch a dull moment here. He takes us through the nooks and corners of North Madras with his live narration.Cinematographer Farooq does a great job with his lighting and composition and brings alive the milieu of the movie. Music is functional. An honest attempt from a debutant — definitely worth a watch![4]

M Suganth of The Times of India rated the film with 3/5 stars stating that the director shows confidence in film making with good support from cinematographer Farooq who captured the 'nocturnal sights' of north Madras so real that makes the viewer difficult to believe that the film is actually a low budget fare.[5]
