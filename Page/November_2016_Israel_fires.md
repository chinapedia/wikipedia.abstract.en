In November, a wave of fires (both wildfires and urban fires) began in Israel from south of the Beersheva area to Nahariya.[1][2][3] Some of the fires occurred naturally; others were arson attacks.[4] On 28 November, after 8 days, the firefighting services announced that the emergency condition was over.

Israel's Nature and Parks Authority reported that more than of forests, brushland and open space were burnt, the largest amount since the Mount Carmel forest fire (2010).[9]

Two Arab citizens of Israel confessed they delibrately set up fires. At least 35 people were arrested on suspection of setting fires or inciting to do so. More than 15 were citizens of the Palestinian Authority and at least 10 were Arab citizens of Israel.

The Arson had been Arabs and the victims had been Jews."[13]

Insurance and restoration

Private insurance company does not pay insurance money when the cause for the damage is consider to be an act of aggression (מעשה איבה)(war/terrorism etc), as such people who had lost property and funds had not been able to receive funds to rebuild and fix their properties.

On 30 November 2016, the Israeli Insurance companies and Israeli finance office had come to an agreement where the government will fund 90% of the insured victims.[71]

The Israeli tax authority had published a list of settlements that will receive funds for rebuilding the lost property where they are considering the fires being an act of aggression.[72]
