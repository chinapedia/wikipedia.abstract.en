The PACIFIC ISLANDS OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (PacIOOS) is a nonprofit association and one of eleven such associations in the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System, funded in part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[1][2]

The PacIOOS area covers eight time zones,[3] and 2300 individual islands associated with the U.S.[4] Observation priorities are public safety, direct economic value, and environmental preservation.[5] Among ocean characteristics reported are:[6]

-   Currents forecast
-   Shoreline impacts such as high sea level
-   Buoy water characteristics including salinity, turbidity, and temperature

The PacIOOS website is hosted by the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and provides interactive graphs and map viewers.[7]
