OGLE-2007-BLG-349(AB)B[1][2] is a circumbinary extrasolar planet about 8,000 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.[3] It is the first circumbinary exoplanet to be discovered using the microlensing method of detecting exoplanets.[4]


Characteristics

Mass and orbit

OGLE-2007-BLG-349L(AB)b is a super-Neptune, an exoplanet that has a mass and radius larger than that of Neptune. It has a mass of around 80 .[5] This is somewhat close to the mass of Saturn, 95 , so OGLE-2007-BLG-349L(AB)b can also be considered a gas giant. It orbits at a distance of around 2.9 AU in a circumbinary orbit, meaning it orbits around two stars.

Host star

The planet orbits in a circumbinary (M-type) binary star system named OGLE-2007-BLG-349L. They orbit around each other roughly every 9 days.[6] The stars have masses of 0.41 and 0.30 , respectively. The age of the system, radii and temperatures of the stars are not known. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old[7][8] and has a surface temperature of 5778 K.[9] The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14.3. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

[1] The initial paper intentionally refers to the planet as planet "c", as their solution to "an apparent inconsistency" in exoplanet naming convention. Other sources, such as the SIMBAD Astronomical Database and Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, refer to it as planet "b", however NASA Exoplanet Archive does not.
