The BANTU LANGUAGES (English: , Proto-Bantu: *bantʊ̀) technically the NARROW BANTU LANGUAGES, as opposed to "Wide Bantu", a loosely defined categorisation which includes other "Bantoid" languages, are a large family of languages spoken by the Bantu peoples throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.

As part of the Southern Bantoid group, they are part of the Benue-Congo language family, which in turn is part of the large Niger–Congo phylum.

The total number of Bantu languages ranges in the hundreds, depending on the definition of "language" versus "dialect", and is estimated at between 440 and 680 distinct languages.[1] The total number of Bantu speakers is in the hundreds of millions, estimated around 350 million in the mid-2010s (roughly 30% of the total population of Africa, or roughly 5% of world population).[2] Bantu languages are largely spoken east and south of Cameroon, throughout Central Africa, Southeast Africa and Southern Africa. About one sixth of the Bantu speakers, and about one third of Bantu languages, are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone (c. 60 million speakers as of 2015). See list of Bantu peoples.

The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is Swahili; however, the majority of its speakers use it as a second language (L1: c. 16 million, L2: 80 million, as of 2015).[3]

Other major Bantu languages include Zulu, with 27 million speakers (15.7 million L2), and Shona, with about 11 million speakers (if Manyika and Ndau are included).[4][5] Ethnologue separates the largely mutually intelligible Kinyarwanda and Kirundi, which, if grouped together, have 12.4 million speakers.[6]


Name

The similarity between dispersed Bantu languages had been observed as early as in the 17th century.[7] The term "Bantu" as a name or the group was coined (as _Bâ-ntu_) by Wilhelm Bleek in 1857 or 1858, and popularised in his _Comparative Grammar_ of 1862.[8] The name was coined to represent the word for "people" in loosely reconstructed Proto-Bantu, from the plural noun class prefix _*ba-_ categorizing "people", and the root _*ntʊ̀ -_ "some (entity), any" (e.g. Zulu _umuntu_ "person", _abantu_ "people"). There is no native term for the group, as Bantu populations refer to themselves by their tribal endonyms but did not have a concept for the larger ethno-linguistic phylum. Bleek's coinage was inspired by the anthropological observation of groups self-identifying as "people" or "the true people" (as is indeed the case, for example, with the _Khoikhoi_ of South Africa).[9]

The term "narrow Bantu", excluding those languages classified as Bantoid by Guthrie (1948), was introduced in the 1960s.[10]

The prefix _ba-_ in Bantu specifically refers to people, not language. In Bantu itself, the term for languages is formed with the _ki-_ noun class (Nguni _ísi-_), as in ''Kiswahili '' "coast-language" and _isiZulu_ "Zulu language". Apparently inspired by this pattern, there was a suggestion in South Africa to refer to Bantu languages as "Kintu" in the 1980s. The suggestion was immediately abandoned. Not only does the word _kintu_ exist, meaning "thing" with no relation to the concept of "language",[11] it was also reported by delegates at the African Languages Association of Southern Africa conference in 1984 that in some Bantu languages, the term 'Kintu' has a derogatory significance,[12] that is, _kintu_ refers to "things" and is used as a dehumanizing term of people who have lost their dignity.[13] In addition, _Kintu_ is a figure in some Bantu mythologies.[14] The term "Kintu" apparently still saw occasional use in the 1990s in South Africa.[15]


Origin and history

The Bantu languages descend from a common Proto-Bantu language, which is believed to have been spoken in what is now Cameroon in Central Africa.[16] An estimated 2,500–3,000 years ago (1000 BC to 500 BC), although other sources put the start of the Bantu Expansion closer to 3000 BC,[17] speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This Bantu expansion came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where Bantu peoples now constitute nearly the entire population.[18][19]

The technical term Bantu, meaning "human beings" or simply "people", was first used by Wilhelm Bleek (1827–1875), as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as _muntu_ or _mutu_ for "human being" or in simplistic terms "person", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with _mu-_ (class 1) in most languages is _ba-_ (class 2), thus giving _bantu_ for "people". Bleek, and later Carl Meinhof, pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.


Classification

Bantu_zones.png, including the addition of a zone J around the Great Lakes. The Jarawan languages are spoken in Nigeria.]]

The most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by Malcolm Guthrie in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. It is mainly geographic. The term 'narrow Bantu' was coined by the _Benue–Congo Working Group_ to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the Bantoid languages not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.

In recent times, the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other Southern Bantoid languages has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson & Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used. A coherent classification of Narrow Bantu will likely need to exclude many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages.

There is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid.

At a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns: Many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as _Northwest Bantu_ or _Forest Bantu_, and the remainder as _Central Bantu_ or _Savanna Bantu_. The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa.

Northwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less conservative due to contact with non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is clearly not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.

Another attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 "Tervuren" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann.[20] However, it relies on lexicostatistics, which, because of its reliance on similarity rather than shared innovations, may predict spurious groups of conservative languages that are not closely related. Meanwhile, _Ethnologue_ has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the Mbam languages (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse & Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family. _Glottolog_ has incorporated many of these into their classification.[21]

The languages that share Dahl's law may also form a valid group, Northeast Bantu. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger–Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.

Computational phylogenetic analyses of Bantu include Currie, et al. (2013)[22] and Grollemund, et al. (2015).[23]


Language structure

Guthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.

The most prominent grammatical characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of affixes (see Sotho grammar and Ganda noun classes for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a class, and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like grammatical gender in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.

The verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words.[24] In Swahili, for example, _Kitoto kidogo amekisoma_ (for comparison, _Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga_ in Shona language) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. _Kitoto_ 'child' governs the adjective prefix _ki-_('ki' being a prefix representing the diminutive form of the word) and the verb subject prefix _a-_. Then comes perfect tense _-me-_ and an object marker _-ki-_ agreeing with implicit _kitabu_ 'book' (from Arabic _kitab_). Pluralizing to 'children' gives _Watoto wadogo wamekisoma_ (_Vana vadoko varikuverenga_ in Shona), and pluralizing to 'books' (_vitabu_) gives _Watoto wadogo wamevisoma_.

Bantu words are typically made up of open syllables of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The Bushong language recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants,[25] while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the Tonga of Malawi.[26] The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood.

This tendency to avoid consonant clusters in some positions is important when words are imported from English or other non-Bantu languages. An example from Chewa: the word "school", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is _sukulu_. That is, _sk-_ has been broken up by inserting an epenthetic _-u-_; _-u_ has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is _buledi_ for "bread". Similar effects are seen in loanwords for other non-African CV languages like Japanese. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona,[27] and the Makua languages.[28]

With few exceptions, notably Swahili, Bantu languages are tonal and have two to four register tones.

Reduplication

Reduplication is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.[29]

-   Example: in Swahili _piga_ means "strike", _pigapiga_ means "strike repeatedly".

Well-known words and names that have reduplication include

-   Bafana Bafana, a football team
-   Chipolopolo, a football team
-   Eric Djemba-Djemba, a footballer
-   Lomana LuaLua, a footballer
-   Ngorongoro, a conservation area

Repetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, "Mwenda pole hajikwai," while, "Pole pole ndio mwendo," has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, "He who goes slowly doesn't trip," and that of the latter is, "A slow but steady pace wins the race." Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in "Njoo! Haraka haraka" [come here! Hurry, hurry].

In contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.

-   Example 1: In Xitsonga and Shona, _famba_ means "walk" while _famba-famba_ means "walk around".
-   Example 2: in isiZulu and SiSwati _hamba_ means "go", _hambahamba_ means "go a little bit, but not much".
-   Example 3: in both of the above languages _shaya_ means "strike", _shayashaya_ means "strike a few more times lightly, but not heavy strikes and not too many times".
-   Example 4: In Shona _kwenya_ means "scratch", _Kwenyakwenya_ means "scratch excessively or a lot".

By country

Following is an incomplete list of the principal Bantu languages of each country.[31] Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country. An attempt at a full list of Bantu languages (with various conflations and a puzzlingly diverse nomenclature) can be found in _The Bantu Languages of Africa_, 1959.[32]

Most languages are best known in English without the class prefix (_Swahili_, _Tswana_, _Ndebele_), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (_Kiswahili_, _Setswana_, _Sindebele_). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as Tshiluba and Kiluba (both _Luba_), Umbundu and Kimbundu (both _Mbundu_). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of Botswana the people are the _Batswana_, one person is a _Motswana_, and the language is _Setswana_; and in Uganda, centred on the kingdom of _Buganda_, the dominant ethnicity are the _Baganda_ (sg. _Muganda_), whose language is _Luganda_.

Bantu words popularised in western cultures

A case has been made out for borrowings of many place-names and even misremembered rhymes – chiefly from one of the Luba varieties – in the USA.[44]

Some words from various Bantu languages have been borrowed into western languages. These include:

-   Boma
-   Bomba
-   Bongos
-   Bwana
-   Candombe
-   Chimpanzee
-   Gumbo
-   Hakuna matata
-   Impala
-   Indaba
-   Jenga
-   Jumbo
-   Kalimba
-   Kwanzaa
-   Mamba
-   Mambo
-   Mbira
-   Marimba
-   Rumba
-   Safari
-   Samba
-   Simba
-   Ubuntu


Writing systems

Along with the Latin script and Arabic script orthographies, there are also some modern indigenous writing systems used for Bantu languages:

-   The Mwangwego alphabet is an abugida that is used to write the Chewa language and other languages of Malawi.
-   The Mandombe script is an abugida that is used to write the Bantu languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mainly by the Kimbanguist movement.
-   The Isibheqe Sohlamvu or Ditema tsa Dinoko script is a featural syllabary used to write the siNtu or Southern Bantu languages.

Derek Nurse, 2006, "Bantu Languages", in the _Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics_, p. 2. Ethnologue report for Southern Bantoid lists a total of 535 languages. The count includes 13 Mbam languages which are not always included under "Narrow Bantu".

[2] Total population cannot be established with any accuracy due to the unavailability of precise census data from Sub-Saharan Africa. A number just above 200 million was cited in the early 2000s (see Niger-Congo languages: subgroups and numbers of speakers for a 2007 compilation of data from SIL Ethnologue, citing 210 million).
