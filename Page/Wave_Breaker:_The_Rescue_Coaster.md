WAVE BREAKER: THE RESCUE COASTER is a double launch roller coaster currently operating at SeaWorld San Antonio. The roller coaster is designed to emphasize SeaWorld's animal rescue efforts. It is the first jet ski roller coaster in North America and would incorporate cars designed as jet skis used by SeaWorld's rescue team. Most of the track was built over the park's lake.[1]


Construction

The park's lake was partially drained and inflatable rubber dams were put in the lake to allow the construction site to be drained, but not the rest of the lake. The park closes annually from January to late February and during this time SeaWorld re-themed the area near the coaster's entrance queue. SeaWorld San Antonio regularly posted construction update videos on their YouTube channel. The roller coaster was officially opened on June 16, 2017.[2]


Ride experience

Once riders are seated and restrained, the train exits the loading station and enters a video orientation tunnel. Once the orientation is over, the train is launched up a camelback hump. The train then glides across the surface of the park's lake simulating a jet ski ride. Halfway through the ride, the train is launched one more time up the tallest point of the coaster (61 feet) and crosses the only section of the track that is on land (a small artificial island in the lake). After a few more seconds, the train returns to the station.[3][4]
