The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to physics:

PHYSICS – natural science that involves the study of matter[1] and its motion through spacetime, along with related concepts such as energy and force.[2] More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.[3][4][5]


What _type_ of subject is physics?

Physics can be described as all of the following:

-   An academic discipline – one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.
-   A scientific field (a branch of science) – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer-reviewed research is published.
    -   A natural science – one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific method.
        -   A physical science – one that studies non-living systems.
        -   A biological science – one that studies the role of physical processes in living organisms. _See Outline of biophysics._

General concepts of physics

Basic principles of physics

Physics – branch of science that studies matter[8] and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. [9] Physics is one of the "fundamental sciences" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:

-   Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.
    -   Newton's laws of motion
    -   Mass, force and weight (Mass versus weight)
    -   Momentum and conservation of energy
    -   Gravity, theories of gravity
    -   Energy, work, and their relationship
    -   Motion, position, and energy
    -   Different forms of Energy, their inter-conversion and the inevitable loss of energy in the form of heat (Thermodynamics)
    -   Energy conservation, conversion, and transfer.
    -   Energy source the transfer of energy from one source to work in another.
-   Kinetic molecular theory
    -   Phases of matter and phase transitions
    -   Temperature and thermometers
    -   Energy and heat
    -   Heat flow: conduction, convection, and radiation

[1] Richard Feynman begins his _Lectures_ with the atomic hypothesis, as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that _all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ..._"

[4]

[5] Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.

[7]

[8] At the start of _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_, Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence [...] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is [...] that _all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another_ ..."

[9] "Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of events."
