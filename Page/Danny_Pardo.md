Biography

Danny_Pardo_with_Michael_Chiklis_on_the_set_of_The_Shield.jpg on the set of _The Shield_ (2008).]] Danny_Pardo_with_director_Juan_Campanella_on_the_set_of_Colony.jpg Pardo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, South America, and he can trace his family roots back to Italy, Spain, and Yugoslavia.[5] He received degrees in marketing and business in Argentina before moving to Miami, Florida, United States, in January 2001 to run an import business. In September 2003, he switched to acting, and booked his first commercial, for the Florida lottery, one month later.

After building a strong base in Miami in commercials and as a host on E! Entertainment Latin America's _Vidas Bonitas_ and a reporter for _Univision_, Pardo moved to Los Angeles in 2005, where his career took off. He landed recurring roles on the hit TV shows _Prison Break_, _24_, and _The Shield_, as well as the movies _Pretty Obsession_ (2012) and _Counterpunch_ (2014). He speaks Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Italian fluently, and has performed in all of these languages.[6]

Pardo's breakthrough role came in February 2015, when he was cast by Juan Jose Campanella, director of the Oscar winner _The Secret in Their Eyes_ (2010), to play Padre Martin in the hit Argentinian telenovela _Entre Canibales_. The popularity of the series has made him a star in his native Argentina and throughout South America.[7][8][9]

Pardo and Campanella got the chance to work together again when Pardo guest-starred in an episode of the TV show _Colony_ (2017).[10]

Pardo has also done voiceover work for movies, TV, and video games, including _The Cleveland Show_,[11] _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_, and _Grand Theft Auto V_. In 2014, he voiced the character Blackout in Disney's _Planes: Fire & Rescue_.
