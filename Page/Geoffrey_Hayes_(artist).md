GEOFFREY L. HAYES (1947–2017) was an American children's book illustrator and cartoonist. He was the author of over 50 books, including a series of titles with the children's comics publisher Toon Books. He was the brother of underground cartoonist Rory Hayes (1949–1983).


Biography

Growing up in San Francisco, Hayes moved homes frequently with his family; by the time he was twelve years old the family had moved ten times.[1] Hayes and his younger brother were into pop culture and comic books, including _Little Lulu_, _Uncle Scrooge_, _Sugar and Spike_, and _Dick Tracy_. Together, they published homemade comics, which were encouraged by their mother. All through their teens the boys continued to make comics, home-made movies, and later, fanzines.[2]

After high school, Hayes moved to New York City to pursue a career as an illustrator and cartoonist. He contributed to a few underground comix during this period (including _Bogeyman_ and _Arcade_), mostly in collaboration with Rory, who was developing a reputation as a groundbreaking cartoonist in that genre.

Hayes died on June 2, 2017, of natural causes in Asheville, North Carolina at age 69.[3]
