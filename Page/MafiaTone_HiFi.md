MAFIA TONE is a music brand active early in the UK reggae movement. The Jah MafiaTone HiFi sound system launched in Birmingham, UK 1975 and was active until 1980._[1]_

During this short time Jah Mafiatone HiFi made a considerable impactin developing the city as a hub for reggae in the UK. Proprietor Stafford Douglas and his team operated the sound system in various venues across the UK.

Entering the existing roots reggae scene as a "David" against "Goliaths" (see David and Goliath) of the time such as Sir Coxsone International, Jah Shaka and Fatman Sound, Jah Mafia Tone HiFi quickly climbed the ranks as a household name within the UK's reggae and Afro-Caribbean communities.

Mafia Tone had a clear influence in the introduction of the Rastafarian ideology into Birmingham's dancehalls. This was owed to Stafford's frequent trips to Jamaica where he would source reggae music, conduct and cut dub versions to tracks to be played exclusively by Jah MafiaTone HiFi back in the UK.

He launched the Mafia Tone record label and released _Dungeon_ voiced by [[Glenn_Miller_-_Wailing_Souls]_in_1972._After_recording_only_two_tracks_on_this_label,_he_moved_on_to_launch_the_Art_&_Craft_label_putting_out__Motherless_Children__by_Symbol,_as_well_as_works_by_artists_such_as_[[Johnny_Clarke|Glenn Miller - Wailing Souls] in 1972. After recording only two tracks on this label, he moved on to launch the Art & Craft label putting out _Motherless Children_ by Symbol, as well as works by artists such as Johnny Clarke. Recording between the UK and Jamaica he scouted and produced many recordings for numerous reggae artists.

Now Generation label was launched in 1985 and produced the first hit for Bonito Star, Money Can't Buy Me Love in 1986.
