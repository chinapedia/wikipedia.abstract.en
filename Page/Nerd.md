A NERD is a person seen as overly intellectual, obsessive, introverted or lacking social skills. Such a person may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, little known, or non-mainstream activities, which are generally either highly technical, abstract, or relating to topics of science fiction or fantasy, to the exclusion of more mainstream activities.[1][2][3] Additionally, many so-called nerds are described as being shy, quirky, pedantic, and unattractive.[4]

Originally derogatory, the term "nerd" was a stereotype, but as with other pejoratives, it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity.


Etymology

The first documented appearance of the word _nerd_ is as the name of a creature in Dr. Seuss's book _If I Ran the Zoo_ (1950), in which the narrator Gerald McGrew claims that he would collect "a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too" for his imaginary zoo.[5][6][7] The slang meaning of the term dates to 1951.[8] That year, _Newsweek_ magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for _drip_ or _square_ in Detroit, Michigan.[9] By the early 1960s, usage of the term had spread throughout the United States, and even as far as Scotland.[10][11] At some point, the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude.[12]

An alternate spelling,[13] as _nurd_ or _gnurd_, also began to appear in the mid-1960s or early 1970s.[14] Author Philip K. Dick claimed to have coined the "nurd" spelling in 1973, but its first recorded use appeared in a 1965 student publication at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).[15][16] Oral tradition there holds that the word is derived from _knurd_ (_drunk_ spelled backward), which was used to describe people who studied rather than partied. The term ''gnurd '' (spelled with the "g") was in use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by 1965.[17] The term "nurd" was also in use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as early as 1971.[18]

According to _Online Etymology Dictionary_, the word is an alteration of the 1940s term "_nert_" (meaning "stupid or crazy person"), which is itself an alteration of "nut" (nutcase).

The term was popularized in the 1970s by its heavy use in the sitcom _Happy Days_.[19]


Nerd culture

Nerd stereotype

Because of the nerd stereotype, many smart people are often thought of as nerdy. This belief can be harmful, as it can cause high-school students to "switch off their lights" out of fear of being branded as a nerd,[20] and cause otherwise appealing people to be considered nerdy simply for their intellect. It was once thought that intellectuals were nerdy because they were envied. However, Paul Graham stated in his essay, "Why Nerds are Unpopular", that intellect is neutral, meaning that you are neither loved nor despised for it. He also states that it is only the correlation that makes smart teens automatically seem nerdy, and that a nerd is someone that is not socially adept enough. Additionally, he says that the reason why many smart kids are unpopular is that they "don't have time for the activities required for popularity."[21]

Nerd_11.jpg Stereotypical nerd appearance, often lampooned in caricatures, can include very large glasses, braces, buck teeth, severe acne and pants worn high at the waist. Following suit of popular use in emoticons, Unicode released in 2015 its "Nerd Face" character, featuring some of those stereotypes: ðŸ¤“ (code point U+1F913). In the media, many nerds are males, portrayed as being physically unfit, either overweight or skinny due to lack of physical exercise.[22][23] It has been suggested by some, such as linguist Mary Bucholtz, that being a nerd may be a state of being "hyperwhite" and rejecting African-American culture and slang that "cool" white children use.[24] However, after the _Revenge of the Nerds_ movie franchise (with multicultural nerds), and the introduction of the Steve Urkel character on the television series _Family Matters_, nerds have been seen in all races and colors as well as more recently being a frequent young East Asian or Indian male stereotype in North America. Portrayal of "nerd girls", in films such as _She's Out of Control_, _Welcome to the Dollhouse_ and _She's All That_ depicts that smart but nerdy women might suffer later in life if they do not focus on improving their physical attractiveness.[25]

In the United States, a 2010 study published in the _Journal of International and Intercultural Communication_ indicated that Asian Americans are perceived as most likely to be nerds, followed by White Americans, while non-White Hispanics and Black Americans were perceived as least likely to be nerds. These stereotypes stem from concepts of Orientalism and Primitivism, as discussed in Ron Eglash's essay _Race, Sex, and Nerds_: _From Black Geeks to Asian American Hipsters_.[26]

Some of the stereotypical behaviors associated with the "nerd" stereotype have correlations with the symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome or other autism-spectrum disorders.[27]

Nerd pride

The rise of Silicon Valley and the American computer industry at large has allowed many so-called "nerdy people" to accumulate large fortunes and influence media culture. Many stereotypically nerdy interests, such as superhero, fantasy and science fiction works, are now international popular culture hits.[28] Some measures of nerdiness are now allegedly considered desirable, as, to some, it suggests a person who is intelligent, respectful, interesting, and able to earn a large salary. Stereotypical nerd qualities are evolving, going from awkwardness and social ostracism to an allegedly more widespread acceptance and sometimes even celebration of their differences.[29]

Johannes Grenzfurthner, researcher, self-proclaimed nerd and director of nerd documentary _Traceroute_, reflects on the emergence of nerds and nerd culture:

In the 1984 film _Revenge of the Nerds_ Robert Carradine worked to embody the nerd stereotype; in doing so, he helped create a definitive image of nerds.[30] Additionally, the storyline presaged, and may have helped inspire, the "nerd pride" that emerged in the 1990s. _American Splendor_ regular Toby Radloff claims this was the movie that inspired him to become "The Genuine Nerd from Cleveland, Ohio."[31] In the _American Splendor_ film, Toby's friend, _American Splendor_ author Harvey Pekar, was less receptive to the movie, believing it to be hopelessly idealistic, explaining that Toby, an adult low income file clerk, had nothing in common with the middle class kids in the film who would eventually attain college degrees, success, and cease being perceived as nerds. Many, however, seem to share Radloff's view, as "nerd pride" has become more widespread in the years since. MIT professor Gerald Sussman, for example, seeks to instill pride in nerds:

The popular computer-related news website Slashdot uses the tagline "News for nerds. Stuff that matters." The Charles J. Sykes quote "Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one" has been popularized on the Internet and incorrectly attributed to Bill Gates.[32] In Spain, Nerd Pride Day has been observed on May 25 since 2006,[33] the same day as Towel Day, another somewhat nerdy holiday.[34] The date was picked as it is the anniversary of the release of _Star Wars: A New Hope_.[35]

An episode from the animated series _Freakazoid_, titled "Nerdator", includes the use of nerds to power the mind of a Predator-like enemy. Towards the middle of the show, he gave this speech. : The Danish reality TV show _FC Zulu_, known in the internationally franchised format as _FC Nerds_, established a format wherein a team of nerds, after two or three months of training, competes with a professional soccer team.[36]

Some commentators consider that the word is devalued when applied to people who adopt a sub-cultural pattern of behaviour, rather than being reserved for people with a marked ability.[37]

Although originally being predominately an American stereotype, Nerd culture has grown across the globe and is now more acceptable and common than ever. Australian events such as Oz Comic-Con (a large comic book and Cosplay convention, similar to San Diego Comic-Con International) and Supernova, are incredibly popular events among the culture of people who identify themselves as nerds. In 2016, Oz Comic-Con in Perth saw almost 20,000 cos-players and comic book fans meet to celebrate the event, hence being named a "professionally organised Woodstock for geeks".[38]

Bullying

Individuals who are labeled as "nerds" are often the target of bullying due to a range of reasons that may include physical appearance or social background.[39] Paul Graham has suggested that the reason nerds are frequently singled out for bullying is their indifference to popularity or social context, in the face of a youth culture that views popularity as paramount.[40] However, research findings suggest that bullies are often as socially inept as their academically better-performing victims,[41] and that popularity fails to confer protection from bullying.[42] Other commentators have pointed out that pervasive harassment of intellectually-oriented youth began only in the mid-twentieth century[43][44] and some have suggested that its cause involves jealousy over future employment opportunities and earning potential.[45]


In popular culture

-   Old media[46] have seen several memorable nerdy characters including, but not limited to: Anthony Michael Hall's character of Brian Johnson in _The Breakfast Club_, Steve Urkel in _Family Matters_, Dr Spencer Reid from _Criminal Minds_, Fogell from _Superbad_, Peter Parker from the _Spider-Man_ franchise, Hermione Granger from the _Harry Potter_ franchise, Twilight Sparkle from the _My Little Pony_ franchise, Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe from _Revenge of the Nerds_, Steve Carell's character of Andy Stitzer in _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_, Dilton Doiley from the _Archie_ comics franchise, and various characters in _The Big Bang Theory_ and _Silicon Valley_.
-   The parody song and music video "White & Nerdy" by "Weird Al" Yankovic also prominently features and celebrates aspects of nerd culture.[47]
