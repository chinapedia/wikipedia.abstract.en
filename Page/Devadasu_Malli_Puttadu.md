_DEVADASU MALLI PUTTADU_ (English: DEVADASU HAS BEEN REBORN) is a 1978 Telugu drama film, produced by Srinivasulu and Pandurangappa under the Devi Art Productions banner[1] and directed by Dasari Narayana Rao.[2] It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Vanisri in the lead roles[3] and music composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The film is the _sequel_ to Evergreen Classic movie _Devadasu_ (1953).[4]


Plot

The film is based on the concept of Reincarnation, an idea chiseled in the mind of director _Dasari Narayana Rao_ to give completeness to Devadasu's story. The film begins Devadasu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) leaving his last breath in front of Parvathi's (Savitri) house and she rushes to see him, but the door is closed by her family and she collapses. Chandramukhi a courtesan who adores Devadasu, whom he promises to marry in the next life also dies at his Samadhi. Now the story begins; Devadasu takes rebirth as Sridhar Raja (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), Chandramukhi as Aruna (Vanisri) and Parvathi is still waiting for Devadasu with a strong faith as she has a desire to serve him. The rest of the story is whether Devadasu comes back and how he reunites with Chandramukhi.
