AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH is an American author and tech entrepreneur. She is the co-founder and editor of MuslimGirl.com, a blog for Muslim women. At 23 years old, she was named to Forbes 30 Under 30 in media for her work with Muslim Girl.[1][2]


Early years

Al-Khatahtbeh grew up in New Jersey.[3] When she was 13 years old, her family decided to move to Jordan due to concerns of increased violence against the Muslim community in the United States.[4] After her mother fell ill, her family moved back to New Jersey to be closer to their relatives who still lived there. Back in New Jersey, she continued to feel closer to her Muslim identity and decided to wear the hijab as an act of resistance against Islamophobia.[5] Her experience as a Muslim American post 9/11 evoked her to speak up and fulfill a moral obligation, despite the fact that she was one of a small percentage of Arab American kids in her high school and wasn't accepted by her classmates.[6] Because she didn't have a community of young Muslim women, she decided to make her own and founded MuslimGirl.com in 2009 when she was 17 years old and a senior in high school.[7] With friends from her mosque, al-Khatahtbeh published blogs on the site. Following high school, she attended Rutgers University,[8] graduating in 2014. She then worked for a non-profit based in Washington, D.C. before moving to New York and briefly working for a major media organization.[9][10]

Al-Khatahtbeh is of Jordanian descent.[11]


MuslimGirl

In the beginning of 2015, MuslimGirl developed a volunteer staff and saw a large increase its readership.[12] The site logged 1.7 million hits in 2018.[13]

Following the shooting of Laquan McDonald, al-Khatahtbeh did live coverage of some of the protests in Chicago.[14] She gave a sermon at the Women's Mosque of America in Los Angeles. Her sermon focused on the metaphor of "the pit" from the film _The Dark Knight Rises_. She compared the pit to the experience of Muslim Americans after 9/11.[15]

In 2016, she partnered with _Teen Vogue_ for a web series that explored issues of concern to young Muslim women.[16][17]


Literary career

Al-Khatahtbeh was on the program for 3 events at the 2017 Brisbane Writers Festival in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.[18][19] Her book, _MuslimGirl: A Coming of Age_, was released in October 2016.[20]
