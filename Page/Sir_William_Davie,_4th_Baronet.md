-   -   Mary Davie (1688-1762), who married Nicholas III Hooper (son of Sir Nicholas II Hooper (1654-1731) of Fullabrook,[5] Braunton[6] and Raleigh, Pilton in Devon, a lawyer who served as Tory Member of Parliament for Barnstaple 1695-1715), who rebuilt Raleigh House on an adjacent site slightly higher up the hill, which building survives today.[7] Without progeny.

She died the 16th of May in the year of our Lord 1762 (in the year) of her age 74. In testimony of his great esteem and to perpetuate the memory of so valuable a friend & so worthy a relation, John Hippisley Coxe of Ston-Easton in the county of Somerset Esq^(r.) caused this monument to be erected in the year of our Lord 1764"
