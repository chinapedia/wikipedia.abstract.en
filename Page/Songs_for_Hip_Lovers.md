_SONGS FOR HIP LOVERS_ is a 1957 vocal album by the jazz bandleader Woody Herman, arranged by Marty Paich.


Recording and music

The album was recorded in two sessions, in January and March 1957.[1] The material is standards and the arrangements are by Marty Paich.[2]


Release and reception

_Songs for Hip Lovers_ was reissued by Verve Records on CD.[3] Ken Dryden reviewed the album for AllMusic and wrote that "Herman is a swinging, friendly singer heard doing such time-tested standards as the humorous "Makin' Whoopee," a more upbeat than typical "Willow Weep For Me," and "I Won't Dance." The musicians from each of the two sessions provide strong accompaniment: "Sweets" Edison, Charlie Shavers, and Ben Webster are outstanding and Marty Paich's arrangements fit Herman's style rather well".[4] _The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ described it as "a delightful set. Herman's singing was enduring and unpretentious, and he made a lyric line swing without manhandling it."[5] Scott Yanow, in his book _Bebop_, writes that the album has its "charming moments" but the "horns are missing in its concise performances".
