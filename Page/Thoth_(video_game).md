THOTH (stylised as THOTH) is an abstract shoot 'em up video game created by Jeppe Carlsen, former lead gameplay designer of Playdead games _Limbo_ and _Inside_.[1][2] It is published by Double Fine Productions.[3]


Development

As a solo developer, Carlsen had previously worked on independent platformer _140_.[4] Carlsen had thought about designing a game inspired by _Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved_ and _Robotron: 2084_ before he started working on _Limbo_.[5]

Music for the game was composed by experimental composers SÃ˜S Gunver Ryberg and Cristian Vogel.[6]


Gameplay

Progress through the levels of the game is made by eliminating all enemies. Doing so transforms them into ghostly voids that relentlessly chase the player. The game can be played solo or with two players cooperatively; when playing with a second player, the first player to die will become a ghost void that haunts the player. The main sequence of levels are divided into sets of four, each introducing new enemy types and game mechanics. If the main 64 levels are completed, the player gains access to randomly generated levels.[7]
