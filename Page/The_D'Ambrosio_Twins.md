Music career

The twins started playing piano at the age of four. They expressed an interest in a music career and an early age, and have been playing the guitar and drums since the age of six.

The first song they recorded was an anti bullying song "Let Your Light Shine".[15][16] This song was produced by John Ryan and written by Nick Pellegrino. The song and video were released on September 18, 2012. The "Let Your Light Shine" music video went on to win several film festivals. The girls were honored to receive a Gracie Award[17][18] in 2013 for Outstanding Video. They also won Best Music Video at New Media Film Festival and Honolulu Film Awards, and were nominated at the Garden State Film Festival. They performed their song live on Fox and Friends in New York City.

They went on to work with Andrew Lane who produced the rest of their first album, titled "Bianca and Chiara D'Ambrosio", released September 23, 2014. On April 5, 2016, they released their new song "That's What Girls Do",[19] which was produced by Jared Lee Gosselin and written by Chris La Vrar from _America's Got Talent_. They recently released the music video for the song on October 11, 2015, which was directed by Paul Boyd and featured Miss California 2016 Nadia Mejia and actor Mace Coronel from Nickelodeons _Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn_.

The girls are currently in the studio working on original material.

On February 13, the D'Ambrosio Twins released their album entitled, "Got You Covered" on iTunes and all streaming sources. "Got You Covered" is an album of songs the girls recorded and made YouTube videos based on songs they grew up hearing around the house on their dads iPod as well as songs they knew from movies, like "Kids in America" by Kim Wilde, that was in the film Clueless.[20] The album is not your average pick of songs that a typical 11 year olds would play. They picked songs that were more instrument (Guitar and Drums) based and rocked. Songs ranged from Ramones to The Clash to Twenty One Pilots. The videos they posted of these songs got the attention of artists they covered, such as Bethany Costentino, who shared and tweeted "It's Official, I'm quitting the band and letting these two have over @dambrosiotwins" (Twitter 10/31/16) and Linda Ramone, wife of Johnny Ramones reposting on Instagram and actually contacting the girls with great words of encouragement.[21]

The girls learned the songs with their coach Marko DeSantis from the band Sugarcult and recorded them with Luke Tierney who performed in Virgin Records band Silverjet.[22] The videos they made were done with video, commercial and film director Paul Boyd to look great.

The D'Ambrosio Twins released a video and single for “Young And Free" on June 1 and was directed by Paul Boyd. The song was co-written by Marko DeSantis of the band Sugarcult and features musical.ly sensation, Hayden Summerall. The video was premiered on Celebmix.
