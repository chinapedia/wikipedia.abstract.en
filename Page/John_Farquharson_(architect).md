Life

Gladsmuir_Parish_Church_-_geograph.org.uk_-_171751.jpg He was born in Haddington, East Lothian in 1847 the son of Francis Farquharson, a local architect, and Jessie Richardson. He trained as an architect with his father from around 1862 and officially joined the practice as a partner, creating F & J Farquharson, around 1868. His younger brother Robert Farquharson (1849-1891) also trained as an architect and joined him (from 1875) on several projects, the firm then renaming as J & R FARQUHARSON, but Robert committed suicide by shooting himself on 5 September 1891, aged only 42.[1]

He lived at Hilton Lodge an imposing villa in Haddington. He had offices further along the street at 31 Court Street.[2]

He died on 18 July 1933 and is buried with his parents in the churchyard of St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington, against the northern wall.
