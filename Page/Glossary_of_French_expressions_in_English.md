Around 45 percent[1] of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as _art_, _competition_, _force_, _machine_, _money_, _police_, _publicity_, _role_, _routine_ and _table_, are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.

This article, on the other hand, covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably "French" to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French diacritics and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French; an entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a solecism.

Some of them were never "good French", in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage. Some others were once normal French but have become very old-fashioned, or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language, to the extent that they would not be understood (either at all, or in the intended sense) by a native French speaker.

Not used as such in French

Through the evolution of the language, many words and phrases are no longer used in modern French. Also there are expressions that, even though grammatically correct, do not have the same meaning in French as the English words derived from them. Some older word usages still appear in Quebec French.

à la mode:fashionable; in the US it also describes a dessert with ice cream (as in "apple pie à la mode") or, in some US regions, with cheese. In French, it mainly means "fashionable", "trendy", but is occasionally a culinary term usually meaning something cooked with carrots and onions (as in _bœuf à la mode_). It can also mean "in the style or manner [of]"[56] (as in _tripes à la mode de Caen_), and in this acceptation is similar to the shorter expression "à la". The British English meaning and usage is the same as in French.
accoutrement: personal military or fighting armaments worn about one's self; has come to mean the accompanying items available to pursue a mission, or just accessories in general. In French, means a funny or ridiculous clothing; often a weird disguise or a getup, though it can be said also for people with bad taste in clothing.
appliqué: an inlaid or attached decorative feature. Lit. "applied", though this meaning does not exist as such in French. However "appliqué inversé" exists and has the same meaning than a reverse appliqué. Also an "applique murale" is a decorative light fixture attached on a wall.
après-ski: lit. "after skiing", socializing after a ski session; in French, this word refers to boots used to walk in snow (e.g. MoonBoots). Commonly used for the same thing as in English in Quebec.
arrêt à bon temps: A counterattack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack in fencing. Though grammatically correct, this expression is not used in French. The term _arrêt_ exists in fencing, with the meaning of a "simple counteroffensive action"; the general meaning is "a stop". A related French expression: _s'arrêter à temps_ (to stop in time).
artiste: a skilled performer, a person with artistic pretensions. In French: an artist. Can be used ironically for a person demonstrating little professional skill or passion in both languages.
au naturel: nude; in French, literally, in a natural manner or way (_au_ is the contraction of _à le_, masculine form of _à la_). It means "in an unaltered way" and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (_un entretien au naturel_ = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like _thon au naturel_: canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning "in natural colours", especially flesh colour, which is not one of the "standard" colours of heraldry.
auteur: A film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation. The English connotation derives from French film theory. It was popularized in the journal _Cahiers du cinéma_: auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work. In French, the word means "author", but some expressions like _cinéma d'auteur_ are also in use.
bête noire: a scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypal scary monster in a story; literally "black beast." In French, _être la bête noire de quelqu'un_ ("to be somebody's black beast") means that you're particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you're scary or not. The dictionary of the Académie française admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admits it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person, who is thus considered their archenemy (for instance, "Nadal is the bête noire of Roger Federer").
boutique: a clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise. The expression _hôtel-boutique_ can be used to refer to upmarket hotels, but the word is recent and not as widespread as the equivalent expression boutique hotel.
boutonnière: In English, a boutonnière is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonnière is the buttonhole itself. Yet the French expression "Une fleur à la boutonnière" has an equivalent meaning.
c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre: "it is magnificent, but it is not war" — quotation from Marshal Pierre Bosquet commenting on the charge of the Light Brigade. Unknown quotation in French.
cause célèbre: An issue arousing widespread controversy or heated public debate, lit. 'famous cause'. It is correct grammatically, but the expression is not used in French.
chacun à son goût: the correct expressions in French are _chacun ses goûts / à chacun ses goûts / à chacun son goût_: "to each his/her own taste(s)".
chanson: a classical "art song", equiv. to the German _Lied_ or the Italian _aria_; or, in Russian, a cabaret-style sung narrative, usually rendered by a guttural male voice with guitar accompaniment. In French, it can be used to refer to any song, but it also refers to the same music genre as in English (someone practicing this genre being generally called a _chansonnier_ in Quebec, especially if they sing at a restaurant or cabaret).
château: a manor house or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions. The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort ("strong castle") is used to describe a castle.
chef: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French, a professional cook is a _cuisinier_ (lit. "cook"), _chef-cuisinier_ referring to a head cook. Also, SOUS-CHEF, the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, _chef_ used to means the head, for example a "couvre-chef" is a headgear, but by extension it's often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: "chef d'État" (lit. "Head of State" and "Chief of State"), "chef d'entreprise" ("Business executive"), "chef d'orchestre" (Conductor of an Orchestra), "sergeant-chef" (Staff Sergeant), "chef de gare" (stationmaster), "chef de famille" (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a _chef_ is a boss.
cinq à sept: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm. In French, though it can also mean this, it primarily means any relaxing time with friends between the end of work and the beginning of the marital obligations. In Quebec French, it is also used as a synonym for "Happy Hour" by bars and restaurants that serve discounted drinks after working hours.
claque: a group of admirers; in French, la claque is a group of people paid to applaud or disturb a piece at the theatre, though the common meaning of "claque" is "a slap"; _clique_ is used in this sense (but in a pejorative way).
connoisseur: an expert in wines, fine arts, or other matters of culture; a person of refined taste. It is spelled _connAisseur_ in modern French (lit. "someone who knows").
corsage: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.
coup de main (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, _[donner] un coup de main_ means "[to give] a hand" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in _faire le coup de main_), it is old-fashioned.
coup d'état (pl. coups d'État):a sudden change in government by force; literally "hit (blow) of state." French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word (État: a State, as in a country; État: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as _coup-_ as is often the case in English- because this literally means a "hit" in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.
début:first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means "beginning." The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: _[faire] ses débuts [sur scène]_ (to make one's débuts on the stage). The English meaning and usage also extends to sports to denote a player who is making their first appearance for a team or at an event.
décolletage: a low-cut neckline, cleavage. In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment's neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe.
démarche: a decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step (often used in the plural form), a specific set of steps to get a specific result (can be used in the singular form, sometimes the expression "marche à suivre" (lit. "step to follow") will be preferred), or a distinctive way of walking.
dépanneur: a neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to _dép_ or _dep_). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman. In France, a convenience store would be a _supérette_ or _épicerie [de quartier]_.
émigré: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word _exilé_ (exiled) or _réfugié_ (refugee) or even "exilé politique" or "réfugié politique".
encore: A request to repeat a performance, as in _Encore!_, lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a gig. Francophones would say « Une autre ! » ('Another one!') or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».
en masse: in a mass or group, all together. In French, _masse_ refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: "they all together said 'get out'" would be translated as _ils ont dit 'dehors' en chœur_ ([like a chorus]). Also, _en masse_ refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Québécois French, it means "a bunch" (as in _il y avait du monde en masse_, "there was a bunch of people").
en suite:as a set (not to be confused with _ensuite_, meaning "then"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, _suite_, when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other. _J'ai loué une suite au Ritz_ would be translated as "I rented a suite at the Ritz." _En suite_ is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used. Also used in British English to denote a bathroom that is accessible directly from the master bedroom of a house (usually with a connecting door), rather than by a separate entrance.
entrée: lit. "entrance"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or "plat de résistance" comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to "main dish". In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.
épée: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.
escritoire: a writing table. It is spelt _écritoire_ in modern French.
exposé: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of "to expose"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.
femme: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, _femme_ (pronounced 'fam') means "woman."
fin de siècle: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) turn-of-the-century but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means "end of the century", but it isn't a recognized expression as such. The French expression "ambiance [de] fin de règne" (lit. "end-of-reign atmosphere") also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.
forte: a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French _fort(e)_ (strong) and/or Italian _forte_ (strong, esp. "loud" in music) and/or Latin _forte_ (neuter form of _fortis_, strong). French uses _fort(e)_ for both people and objects.
    According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, "In _forte_ we have a word derived from French that in its "strong point" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \'for-"tA\ and \'for-tE\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived _forte_. Their recommended pronunciation \'fort\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word _le fort_ and would rhyme it with English _for_ [French doesn't pronounce the final "t"]. All are standard, however. In British English \'fo-"tA\ and \'fot\ predominate; \'for-"tA\ and \for-'tA\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English."
    The New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, _le fort d'une épée_ is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.

hors d'oeuvre: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally "outside of the work". The French use _apéritif_ to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet "hors d'œuvre" is a synonym of "entrée" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. In Québécois French, _apéritif_ refers to the drink only, and _hors-d'œuvre_ (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an _entrée_ is a small dish (an _entrée_ can be made as _hors-d'œuvres_, but not all of them are).
la sauce est tout: "The sauce is everything!" or "The secret's in the sauce!" Tagline used in a 1950s American television commercial campaign for an American line of canned food products. Grammatically correct but not used in French, where one might say _Tout est dans la sauce_ or _C'est la sauce qui fait (passer) le poisson_.
Lavatoire or Lavatory: A once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word Toilet was a rather vulgar, impure, corruption of the French word "Toilettes" and that Lavatory was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, "Lavatoire", which was supposed to mean "to wash, or to clean, yourself". Actually, though the word Lavatoire does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The Lavatoire was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.
marquee:the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From _marquise_, which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (_l'affiche_). In English, means a temporary structure (often made of canvas or similar material) which is erected to host an event outdoors, especially in the UK, where such events can often be affected by weather conditions (pronounced _mar-key_).
: "yearning for the mud"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.[57] Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.
objet trouvé: an ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an _objet d'art_ because it is aesthetically pleasing.[58] In French, _les objets trouvés_, short for _le bureau des objets trouvés_, means the lost-and-found, the lost property.
outré: out of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor's style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to "literary" style.
passé: out of fashion. The correct expression in French is _passé de mode._ Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.
peignoir: a woman's dressing gown. It means bathrobe. In French, both _peignoir_ and _robe de chambre_ are used interchangeably, though the latter is generally considered formal and the former is generally seen as colloquial.
pièce d'occasion: "occasional piece"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means "second-hand hardware." Can be shortened as _pièce d'occas{{'}}_ or even _occas{{'}}_ (pronounced /okaz/).
portemanteau (pl. portemanteaux):in English a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, Lewis Carroll, in his novel _Through the Looking Glass_ playfully coined a further figurative sense for portmanteau meaning a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English/ Lewis-Carroll _portemanteau_ is _un mot-valise_ (lit. a suitcase word). "Brexit" and "emoticon" are modern examples of portmanteau words.
potpourri: medley, mixture; French write it _pot-pourri_, literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.
précis: a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, _précis_ means precise, accurate.
première: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. "La première" can be used in same way in French, but it more generally means "the first".
raisonneur: a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a _raisonneur_ is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. _raisonneuse_) who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.
recherché: lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.
rendezvous: lit. "present yourself" or "proceed to"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: _rendez-vous_. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.
reprise:repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. and also applied to an actor who resumes a role that they have played previously. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a cover version, or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term _rediffusion_ is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term coda.
résumé: in North American English, a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead _curriculum vitæ_, or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).
risqué (ALSO RISQUE): sexually suggestive;[59] in French, the meaning of _risqué_ is "risky", with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead _osé_ (lit. "daring") or sometimes _dévergondé_ (very formal language). _Osé_, unlike _dévergondé_, cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.
_rouge_ (lit. "red") : 1) a rouge is red makeup, also called blusher. _Rouge à lèvres_ is French for "lipstick", even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is "fard à joues"; 2) in Canadian football, a rouge is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone.
séance : a gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.
table d'hôte (pl. tables d'hôte): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be "a bed & breakfast" or "B&B." The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'hôte (literally "table of the house" or "table of the host"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled "table d'hôte" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a "bed & breakfast -style" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, _table d'hôte_ generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression _couette et café_ (lit. "duvet and coffee") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.
tableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as _tableau_): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture. _Tableau_ means painting, _tableau vivant_, living painting. In French, it is an expression used in body painting.
touché: acknowledgment of an effective counterpoint. In French, used for "emotionally touched".
vignette: a brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture or a thumbnail. By extension a vignette is the name of a compulsory road tax in the form of a small sticker affixed to a vehicle windscreen, which is now also used in several European countries.

aide-de-camp: "camp assistant"; in the army, a military assistant to a senior military officer (heads of State are considered military officers because of their status as head of the army). In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written _aide de camp_ (without any hyphens).
cinquefoil: five-petal, five-leaf flower of the genus Potentilla, family Rosaceae; also a circular 5-lobed ornamental design. Spelled _quintefeuille_ in French.
cri de cœur: "cry from the heart": an impassioned outcry, as of entreaty or protest. In French, the exact expression is _cri DU cœur_.
demi-monde: a class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use _une demi-mondaine_ to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.
double entendre: a figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. "Entendre" is an infinitive verb ("to hear"), not a noun; a correct rendering would be "à double entente", an adjectival phrase meaning "of a double understanding or double interpretation" (literally, "with a double hearing"). The modern French phrase is "à double sens".
in lieu (of): "in place (of)": a hybrid phrase, partially translated from the existing French phrase _au lieu_.
léger de main (legerdemain): "light of hand": sleight of hand, usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French, and has no equivalent.
maître d':translates literally as _master o_'. The French term for head waiter (the manager of the service side of a restaurant) is _maître d'hôtel_ (literally "master of the house" or "master of the establishment"); French never uses "d stand-alone. Most often used in American English and its usage in the UK is rare.
negligée:A robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women, or a nightdress. As with lingerie, the usage of the word suggests the garment is alluring or fancy. French uses _négligé_ (masculine form) or _nuisette_. In French, the word _négligée_ qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.
succès de scandale: "Success through scandal"; Francophones might use _succès par médisance_.
voir dire: a trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection (Law French). Literally "to speak the truth."[60] (Anglo-Norman _voir_ [_truth_] is etymologically unrelated to the modern French _voir_ [_to see_].)[61] In modern American court procedure, the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve, including inherent biases, views and predelictions; during this examination, each prospective juror must "speak the truth" so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused. In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a "trial within a trial", during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not. For example, a judge might hold a "voir dire" to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.


French phrases in international air-sea rescue

International authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during air-sea rescues. Note that the "phonetic" versions of spelling are presented as shown and not the IPA.

SECURITAY: (_sécurité_, "safety") the following is a safety message or warning, the lowest level of danger.
PAN PAN: (_panne_, "breakdown") the following is a message concerning a danger to a person or ship, the next level of danger.
MAYDAY: (_[venez] m'aider_, come to help me"; _aidez-moi_ means "help me") the following is a message of extreme urgency, the highest level of danger. _(MAYDAY is used on voice channels for the same uses as SOS on Morse channels.)_
SEELONCE: (_silence_, "silence") keep this channel clear for air-sea rescue communications.
SEELONCE FEE NEE: (_silence fini_, "silence is over") this channel is now available again.
PRU DONCE: (_prudence_, "prudence") silence partially lifted, channel may be used again for urgent non-distress communication.
MAY DEE CAL: (_médical_, "medical") medical assistance needed.

It is a serious breach in most countries, and in international zones, to use any of these phrases without justification.

_See Mayday (distress signal) for a more detailed explanation._
