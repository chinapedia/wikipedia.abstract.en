Notable comments

After the passing of Nelson Mandela in December 2013 Langa compared his country's late iconic figure to Mao Zedong, saying Mandela and Mao "were both very strong leaders who fought for the liberation of their people, and who also contributed to laying the foundation for further development in society."[9]

When he served as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of South Africa to China, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the proposed new Public Protector, worked in the embassy. He has refuted claims that she served as a spy for the State Security Agency: "I can confirm without any fear of contradiction that advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane was employed as counsellor for the department of home affairs at the South African embassy and was never in the employ, nor performed any assignment for, the State Security Agency throughout her period of service in China."[10]
