Cannabis_ruderalis.jpg CANNABIS IN ROMANIA is illegal for recreational use and allowed in only limited form for medical use.

Some of the earliest evidence of the psychoactive use of cannabis have been found in Romania, including the archaeological sites of Frumușica and Gurbănești.[1]


Prohibition

In 1928 Romania established laws for countering narcotics, including hashish and its preparations.[2]


Medical cannabis

A limited medical cannabis law was passed in 2013 allowing for the use of low-THC (below 0.2%) derivatives of the plant only.[3][4][5][6]
