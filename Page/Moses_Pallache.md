MOSES PALLACHE (died 1650), was a Jewish-Moroccan-born merchant and diplomat of the Pallache family, who emerged as leader of his second generation.[1][2][3]


Background

Pallache was born to father Joseph Pallache; his uncle was Samuel Pallache.[4][5]

He studied languages at the University of Leiden without registering there.[6]


Career

Thanks to his many languages known, as a young man he was able to help his father and uncle prepare important negotiations, for which they rewarded him.

The States General of the Netherlands considered him a _jeune homme de bonne expectation et fort qualifié et entendu en affaires et plusieurs langages_ ("young man of good prospects, very qualified, and knowledgeable in business affairs and several languages").[7]

He partook in a mission to Istanbul (1614-1616).[8]

After the death of his uncle Samuel, he went to live in Morocco and served at the court of Fez, where 1622–1642 he served as European secretary and interpreter.[9] He became a chief interpreter and translator from Spanish, Dutch, and French into Arabic for the rules of Morocco. During those years, he served under four sultans of Morocco (1618 to 1650): Muley Zaydan (1603–1627), Muley Abd al-Malik (1623–1627), Muley al-Walid (1631–1636), and Muley Muhammad al-Shakh al-Saghir (1636–1655). "He became a very important and influential figure at the Moroccan court, responsible for international and diplomatic dealings."[10][11]

His name appears in English records from 1636 to his death. It also appears in the Spanish translation of a 1638 treaty between the English and Moroccans.[12]

His prominence in Morocco led many relatives to return there from the Netherlands, including his brothers Joshua and Abraham. Joshua became a tax official. Abraham set up in the port of Safi, where he provisioned ships and served as unofficial consult for the Dutch.[13]


Death

Pallache probably died in Morocco around 1650.
