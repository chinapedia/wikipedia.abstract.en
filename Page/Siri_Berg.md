In 1984, Berg's exhibit "The Geometric Angle in Sculpture" was presented at Martin/Molinary Art and Design. The exhibit featured her transition into working with found objects. The exhibition also featured painting Berg created in the 70s including her "Black Series" and "Four Elements" which would later be included in the Guggenheim Museum's permanent collection. The exhibition debuted Berg's "White Holes" and "Black Holes" which use painted and unpainted suction cups in various ways mounted on Masonite and displayed in clear Plexiglas boxes Berg called "Environmental Boxes".

Technique

Berg's work consists of assemblages (art created from found objects), paintings and collages. Her works tend to be minimalist through the use of geometric abstraction or color. Her main influence is the Bauhaus due to their "revolutionary and unconventional approach".[32] Her art has been described as "cerebral and calculated" and "a paradox - exuberance born of control".[33]


Personal life

She has been married twice. She has two sons, Jeffrey and Arthur.[34][35][36]
