RØNSHOVED HIGH SCHOOL[1] () is a folk high school () in southern Denmark close to the border to Germany. It was founded in 1921 by its first headmaster, Aage Møller, who was inspired by the Danish philosopher and pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig. The school is general in the sense that it is not specialized but it offers a wide variety of intellectual subjects (history, religion, philosophy, literature, psychology, etc.), creative subjects (music, arts, writing, etc.), languages (Danish, English, German, French, Latin, and Hebrew), and sports (volleyball, badminton, kayaking, mountain biking, etc.). The classes are open to foreigners as well as to Danish students.

The short courses (1–2 weeks) are only held in Danish, whereas the long courses are held in Danish and/or English.

The Danish minister of culture and ecclesiastical affairs since 2015, Bertel Haarder, was born and grew up at Rønshoved High School.
