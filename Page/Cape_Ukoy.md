CAPE UKOY (Russian: _Mys Ukoy_) is a steep, narrow cape in the western Sea of Okhotsk. It consists of high and prominent rocks. UKOY BAY lies just west of the cape.[1]


History

American and Russian whaleships cruised for bowhead whales off the cape in the 1850s and 1860s.[2][3] They also anchored off the cape to obtain wood and water.[4][5]
