SMARTBEAR SOFTWARE is a privately-held information technology company that delivers tools for application performance monitoring (APM), software development, software testing and API management. The company is based in Assembly Square in Somerville in the Greater Boston Area. The current SmartBear company was founded in 2009.


History and founding

The original Smart Bear company was founded by Jason Cohen in 2003.[1] The current SmartBear Software is the result of Insight Venture Partners acquiring three companies, Smart Bear, AutomatedQA and Pragmatic Software, between 2007 and early 2009. These companies operated as AQA Holdings until being rebranded as SmartBear Software in 2010.[2]

After the rebranding, the company acquired Eviware in 2011, leading to API promoter and SoapUI's founder, Ole Lensmar, joining the company. He later served as chief technology officer (CTO) of SmartBear.[3] That same year, the company acquired APM vendor AlertSite.[4]

In 2013 SmartBear acquired Spanish APM vendor Lucierna.[5] SmartBear then acquired the Open Source Community Swagger in 2015 and its founder, Tony Tam, joined the company as head of products for Swagger and the commercial version of Swagger, SwaggerHub.[6] In 2016, SmartBear acquired CrossBrowserTesting.com (CBT) and Ken Hamric, founder of CBT, joined the company as general manager of CrossBrowserTesting.com.[7]

In 2017, Francisco Partners acquired a majority stake in SmartBear Software.[8][9][10][11]
