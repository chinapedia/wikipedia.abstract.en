Fernand_Stiévenart.JPG Fermette-Stiévenart.jpg FERNAND JOSEPH JULES STIÉVENART (21 May 1862 in Douai – 22 January 1922 in Uccle) was a French landscape painter; associated with the artists' colony at Wissant.


Biography

After completing his primary education in Douai, he began his artistic studies with a local painter, François-Constant Petit (1819-?). From 1878 to 1880, he studied at the École des Beaux-arts with Gustave Boulanger and others; winning several awards.[1]

In 1888, he exhibited several landscapes at the "Salon des Artistes Français", but it was not until 1893 that he joined the Société des Artistes Français. Shortly after, a terrible shipwreck occurred near Wissant, so he joined with his fellow painters, Adrien Demont, Pierre Carrier-Belleuse and to create a company called "Flotsam"; devoted to replacing the fishing equipment that had been lost.[2]

He and his wife, the artist Juliette De Reul (1872-1925), daughter of the Belgian novelist , lived in Douai until the late 1890s, when they settled in Wissant and opened a studio. Later, their workshop would be occupied by the graphic artist, Paule Crampel (1864-1964), widow of the explorer Paul Crampel.[3]

He was awarded a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). Toward the end of his life, he and Juliette moved to Uccle, where they had built a large mansion.[4]
