MOUNT BANCROFT is a peak in Grand and Clear Creek counties.[1] It is located west of the town of Empire,[2] within a group of mountain peaks called the James Group that also includes Mount Flora, Mount Eva, Parry Peak, James Peak, and Colorado Mines Peak.[3][4]

Mount Bancroft is named for Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft,[5] who is noted for his work in public health and the state's history. The summit was named for the doctor at the request of his son, George Jarvis Bancroft (1873-1945). The decision by the United States Geological Survey to name the summit Mount Bancroft was made on March 7, 1906.[6] Below the summit is Lake Caroline, named for his granddaughter, Caroline Bancroft.[7]
