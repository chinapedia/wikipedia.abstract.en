The STEPHENSON BLAKE GROTESQUE fonts are a series of sans-serif fonts created by printing company Stephenson Blake of Sheffield mostly around the end of the nineteenth century.[1]

Stephenson Blake's grotesque faces are in the traditional "grotesque" style of sans-serif, with folded-up letterforms and a solid structure not intended for extended body text.[2] Forming a sprawling series, they include several unusual details, such as an 'r' with a droop, a bruised-looking 'G' and 'C' with inward curls on the right, very short descenders and considerable variation in stroke width, creating a somewhat eccentric, irregular impression.[3][4][5]

Much less artistically and systematically designed than later families like Univers and Helvetica, they were very commonly used in British commercial printing in the metal type era, with a revival of interest as part of a resurgence of use of such "industrial" sans-serifs around the 1950s.[6][7][8] Writing in _The Typography of Press Advertisement_ (1956), printer Kenneth Day commented that the family "has a personality sometimes lacking in the condensed forms of the contemporary sans cuttings of the last thirty years."[9] Jeremy Tankard has described them as the "most idiosyncratic of designs".[10] Not all versions have been digitised.


Family

Grotesque_No._8_Type_Specimen_(8241109617).jpg Grotesque_№_9_Type_Specimen_(7982813165).jpg The family of typefaces was sold by number rather than using weight names. Commonly used numbers included:

-   GROTESQUE NO. 5 - condensed
-   GROTESQUE NO. 6 - wide[11]
-   GROTESQUE NO. 7 - (shown on specimen, above) light condensed
-   GROTESQUE NO. 8 - wide, bold.[12]
-   GROTESQUE NO. 9 - (shown on specimen, above) condensed, bold. Dated to 1906 by Hutchings,[13] it was particularly popular and an oblique was later added in 1949.[14][15] It has been digitised.[16][17][18]
-   GROTESQUE NO. 10 - regular weight and width.[19]
-   GROTESQUE NO. 66 - wide[20]

Stephenson Blake also used the terms "Condensed" and "Elongated Sans Serif" in some cases.

A particularly popular member of the family is Grotesque No. 9, a bold condensed weight, and its companion oblique.[21] Users of "Grot No. 9" include Wyndham Lewis's 1914 avant-garde magazine _Blast_ and more recently Newsweek (which commissioned a custom digitisation) and _Q_ magazine.[22][23][24][25][26] Grotesque No. 9 reached Letraset dry transfer lettering and, unlike many of the other Stephenson Blake Grotesques, has been digitised in several releases.[27]

The Stephenson Blake Grotesques of the late nineteenth century should not be confused with the first sans-serif font ever made, the capitals-only Caslon Egyptian of c. 1816 which Stephenson Blake sold, which was a quite separate design.

-   Headline Bold or Series 595, Monotype's clone of No. 9 with oblique, upright weight digitised.[29][30]

Digital period:

-   "Bureau Grotesque" family from Font Bureau, a loose digital adaptation.[31][32]
-   Balboa is Jim Parkinson's digitisation, expanded from his digitisation for _Newsweek_.[33][34] It includes a shaded weight.[35]
-   Kilburn by Adrian Talbot, a digital family inspired by the condensed styles.[36][37]
-   Sporting Grotesque, a wide open-source family by Lucas Le Bihan loosely inspired by Grotesque No. 6.[38][39]
-   Work Sans by Wei Huang, loosely based on Grotesque No. 10 and other wider sans-serifs from the period adapted for onscreen display.[40]

The modern corporate font of Sheffield, Wayfarer designed by Jeremy Tankard, is designed with some influences of the Stephenson Blake Grotesque series but predominantly based on their unrelated sans-serif Granby.[41][42][43]
