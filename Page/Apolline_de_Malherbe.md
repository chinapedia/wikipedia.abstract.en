Biography

Education

After studying the humanities, de Malherbe completed a MAS in social politics at Sciences Po,[2] along with a master's degree in public service. She put her MAS degree to use by analysing politicians who appeared in the television programmes of Marc-Olivier Fogiel and Thierry Ardisson.[3] A politically left-wing woman, she supported the presidential candidacy of Jean-Pierre Chevènement in 2002.[4][5] During this campaign, Apolline de Malherbe was a member of the _pôle républicain_ group, which worked to criticise republican policy, and included people of various political parties and viewpoints who all supported the candidacy of Jean-Pierre Chevènement. The group was chaired by writer Max Gallo, and had the following notable members: Natacha Polony, Karim Zéribi, Paul-Marie Couteaux, Élisabeth Lévy, Rémy Auchedé and Bertrand Renouvin, who founded the French political movement _Nouvelle Action Royaliste_.[6]

Apolline de Malherbe took part in several work placement schemes, which solidified her love of journalism. The first one had her working for the editorial board of the Le Mans edition of newspaper Ouest-France.[7] She also spent two consecutive summers as an editor of the newspaper Le Figaro, especially of the political section.[8] In 2001, she worked with Le Figaro's foreign department, helping with the report on the September 11 attacks. Another work placement with the television channel LCI allowed her to work with journalist Christophe Barbier.[9]

Career

Meeting with Christophe Barbier allowed De Malherbe to join the team responsible for preparing his morning political interviews. In 2007, she published her first essay, entitled _Politiques cherchent Audimat, désespérément_ (politics yearns for popularity, desperately), published by Albin Michel,[10] which won the Edgar Faure political work prize.[11] She then joined the NextRadioTV group, subsequently becoming a producer for BFM radio. In the same year, she joined BFM TV as chief editor, alongside Ruth Elkrief, Olivier Mazerolle and Hedwige Chevrillon.[12]

From 2008 to 2011, she was an on-the-scene reporter for BFM TV in Washington.[13] In 2011 she became known to the general public by covering the criminal case relating to allegations of attempted rape made against French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn, for BFM TV and for various English channels, such as CNN, NBC and ABC.[14][15]

In 2012, on returning to France, she started working for TV channel Canal+.[16]

She returned in to BFM TV in 2013 as political editor and interviewer for the show _à la maison_.[17] At present, she presents _BFM Politique_, and has appeared on the French political and economic TV show Bourdin Direct, presented by Jean-Jacques Bourdin.
