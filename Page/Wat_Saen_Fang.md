WAT SAEN FANG () is a Buddhist temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The temple was founded in the 1500s, but all extant structures date to the 1800s or later.[1] The viharn of Wat Saen Fang previously served as the royal residence (_ho kham_) of Kawirolot in the 1860s, and was converted into a viharn by his successor, Inthawichayanon in 1878.[2] The temple is also noted for its Burmese-style chedi, which is gilded with glass mosaic.[3] The ubosot, which is topped with kinnara, is a fusion of Burmese and Lan Na styles.[4]
