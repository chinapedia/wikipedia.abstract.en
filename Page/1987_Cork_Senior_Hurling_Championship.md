The 1987 CORK SENIOR HURLING CHAMPIONSHIP was the 99th staging of the Cork Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Cork County Board in 1887. The championship began on 23 May 1987 and ended on 25 October 1987.

Midleton entered the championship as the defending champions.

On 25 October 1987, Midleton won the championship following a 2-12 to 0-15 defeat of N Piarsaigh in the final. This was their fifth championship title overall and their second in succession.[1]

Na Piarsaigh's Mickey Mullins was the championship's top scorer with 0-33.


Seeding

Seeding was introduced in the draw for the championship after being advocated by County Secretary Frank Murphy for the previous two years. The system of seeding was introduced to safeguard the financial potential of the championship and to avoid "lop-sided" finals. After some debate, Blackrock, Glen Rovers, Midleton and St. Finbarr's were deemed to be the four strongest clubs and were separated.
