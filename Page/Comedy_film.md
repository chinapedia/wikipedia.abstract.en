COMEDY is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humour. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.[1] Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.

Comedy, compared with other film genres, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former stand-up comics transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as _The King of Comedy_ and _Wag the Dog_).


History

Silent Film Era

The era of Silent Film began with the release of the motion picture itself. Many films were released in the late 1870s and 1880s that are widely considered to be the first instance of movies like The Horse in Motion (1875) by Eadweard Muybridge, Roundhay Garden Scene (1888), and Arrival of a Train (1895) by the Lumière Brothers.[2] However, the first comedy film can be classified as the Watering the Gardener (1895) also created by the Lumière Brothers. These films were silent, and began the Silent Film era that was then defined by comedy actors like William Haines, Charlie Chaplin, Lon Chaney, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton.


Subgenres

Comedy of Manners

A COMEDY OF MANNERS satirizes the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. Also, satirical comedy-drama & the plot is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as _Much Ado about Nothing_ created by William Shakespeare.

Slapstick

SLAPSTICK FILMS involve exaggerated, boisterous action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era. Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges, also found success incorporating slapstick comedy into sound films.

Fish Out of Water

In a FISH OUT OF WATER COMEDY, the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be neo noir crime comedy, satirical comedy-drama & black comedy as sometimes as fantasy comedy behinds swapping gender roles, as in _Tootsie_ (1982); an age changing role, as in _Big_ (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in _Police Academy_ (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in _Crocodile Dundee_, and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the "fish-out-of-water" bill include _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) and _A Serious Man_ (2009).

Parody

A PARODY OR SPOOF FILM is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films mockumentary, employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include _Mud and Sand_ (1922), _Blazing Saddles_ (1974), _Airplane!_ (1980), _Young Frankenstein_ (1974), and ''Scary Movie (2000).

Anarchic Comedy

The ANARCHIC COMEDY FILM, as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.[3] The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by Monty Python.[4] Others include _Duck Soup_ (1933) and _National Lampoon's Animal House_ (1978).

Black Comedy

The BLACK COMEDY film deals with normally taboo subjects, including death, murder, crime, suicide, and war, in a satirical manner. Examples include _Arsenic and Old Lace_ (1944), _Monsieur Verdoux_ (1947), _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ (1949), _The Ladykillers_ (1955), _Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ (1964), _The Loved One_ (1965), _MASH_ (1970), _The King of Comedy_ (1983), _Monty Python's The Meaning of Life_ (1983), _Brazil_ (1985), _After Hours_ (1985), _The War of the Roses_ (1989), _Heathers_ (1989), _Your Friends & Neighbors_ (1998), _Keeping Mum_ (2005), _Burn After Reading_ (2008), _The Wolf of Wall Street_ (2013), _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri_ (2017) and _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ (2019).

Gross Out

GROSS OUT FILMS are a relatively recent development and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or "toilet" humour. Examples include _Porky's_ (1982), _Dumb and Dumber_ (1994), _There's Something About Mary_ (1998), and _American Pie_ (1999).

Screwball Comedy

It was not uncommon for the early romantic comedy film to also be a SCREWBALL COMEDY FILM. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty repartee, some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: _It Happened One Night_ (1934), _Bringing Up Baby_ (1938), _Philadelphia Story_ (1940), _His Girl Friday_ (1940), and more recently, _What's Up, Doc?_ (1972).


Hybrid subgenres

Action comedy

Films in this sub-genre blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine with and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as Eddie Murphy started taking more action oriented roles such as in _48 Hrs._ and _Beverly Hills Cop_. These types of films are often buddy films, with mismatched partners such as in _Midnight Run_, _Rush Hour_, _21 Jump Street_, _Bad Boys_, _Starsky and Hutch_, and _Hot Fuzz_. Slapstick martial arts films became a mainstay of Hong Kong action cinema through the work of Jackie Chan among others. It may also focus on superheroes such as _The Incredibles_, _Hancock_, _Kick-Ass_, and _Mystery Men_. It may focus on kung fu such as _Kung Fu Panda_.

Comedy horror

Comedy horror is a type of film in which the usual dark themes and "scare tactics" attributed to horror films are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror cliches, such as in _Scream_, _Young Frankenstein_, _Little Shop of Horrors_, _Haunted Mansion_, and _Scary Movie_ where campy styles are favoured. Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as _An American Werewolf In London_. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in _The Evil Dead_ (1981), _Re-Animator_ (1985), _Braindead_ (1992), and _Club Dread_ (2004) - such films are sometimes known as _splatstick_, a portmanteau of the words _splatter_ and _slapstick_. It would be reasonable to put _Ghostbusters_ in this category.

Comedy thriller

Comedy thriller is a genre that combines elements of comedy and thrillers, a combination of humor and suspense. Films such as _Silver Streak_, _Charade_, _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_, _In Bruges_, _Mr. and Mrs. Smith_, _Grosse Point Blank_, _The Thin Man_, _The Big Fix_, and _The Lady Vanishes_.

Fantasy comedy

Fantasy comedy films are types of films that uses magic, supernatural and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include _The Chipmunk Adventure_, _Big_, _Being John Malkovich_, _Ernest Saves Christmas_, _Ernest Scared Stupid_, _Night at the Museum_, _Groundhog Day_, _Click_, and _Shrek_.

Science fiction comedy

Science fiction comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy, use the elements of science fiction films to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Examples of these types of films include _Back to the Future_, _Spaceballs_, _Ghostbusters_, _Evolution_, _Innerspace_, _Galaxy Quest_, _Mars Attacks!_, _Men in Black_, and _The World's End_.

Military comedy

Military comedy films involve comic situations in a military setting. When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and still feeling out of place, it may be referred to as a "service comedy". Because war is such a grim subject, many military comedies are set in peacetime or during wartime but away from battle zones. Military and service comedies include Good Morning, Vietnam, M*A*S*H, Forrest Gump, and more.[5]

Romantic comedy

The ROMANTIC COMEDY FILM subgenre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include _It_ (1927), _City Lights_ (1931), _It's a Wonderful World_ (1939), _The Shop Around the Corner_ (1940), _Sabrina_ (1954), _Annie Hall_ (1977), _When Harry Met Sally..._ (1989), _Pretty Woman_ (1990), _Four Weddings and a Funeral_ (1994), and _There's Something About Mary_ (1998).
