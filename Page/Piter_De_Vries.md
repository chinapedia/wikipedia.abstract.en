PITER DE VRIES is a fictional character from the _Dune_ universe created by Frank Herbert. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel _Dune_, but also appears in the _Prelude to Dune_ prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.

De Vries is portrayed by Brad Dourif in David Lynch's 1984 film _Dune_, and by Jan Unger in the 2000 _Dune_ miniseries. The character will be played by David Dastmalchian in the upcoming Denis Villeneuve film _Dune_.


Character

In the service of the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, De Vries is a Mentat — a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, which are forbidden universe-wide. In addition, De Vries has been "twisted" into an amoral sadist by his Tleilaxu creators.[1]

De Vries is so loyal to Harkonnen that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm his suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him.[2] As he says in _Dune_:

De Vries is described in the novel _Dune_ (though not portrayed on screen) as being addicted to the drug melange, which has colored both the sclera and irises of his eyes a characteristic deep blue.[3]


Appearances

_Dune_

Mentat_Piter_DeVries.gif'']] In _Dune_, it is established that De Vries had pioneered a type of toxin called "residual poison" which remains in the body for years and requires an antidote to be administered regularly. One such fatal poison is secretly administered by the Harkonnens to Thufir Hawat, the Mentat of House Atreides, in order to keep Hawat's allegiance as the only provider of the antidote[4] (in the 1984 movie version, it is shown that Hawat has to milk a gruesome captive cat for the antidote every day).

De Vries is generally regarded as architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, long-time enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet Arrakis. Through torture and psychological manipulation, De Vries breaks the Suk conditioning of Wellington Yueh, personal physician to House Atreides, which renders him incapable of inflicting harm on his patients. Yueh eventually betrays House Atreides. De Vries originally plans to claim Lady Jessica, the concubine of Duke Leto Atreides, as his slave, but he decides to become governor of Arrakis instead. However, Yueh has given the captured Leto a false tooth filled with poison gas. When Leto crushes the tooth, the intended victim Baron Harkonnen escapes, but Leto and De Vries die.[5]

_Prelude to Dune_

In _Dune: House Corrino_ (published in 2001 and the third novel in the _Prelude to Dune_ prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), Piter De Vries discovers the Harkonnen heritage of Lady Jessica and her newborn son Paul, and attempts to kidnap and ransom the infant. The plot is thwarted and the secret preserved—the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam kills the Mentat and arranges for his corpse to be shipped home to Giedi Prime. An enraged Baron is left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax: the Mentat De Vries featured in Herbert's original novel _Dune_.[6]
