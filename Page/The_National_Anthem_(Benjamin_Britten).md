_THE NATIONAL ANTHEM_ is a 1962 choral and orchestral arrangement of _God Save the Queen_ by Benjamin Britten. The arrangement was written for the Leeds Festival. It has been described as an "extraordinary progression from pianissimo prayer to pealing, overlapping choral fortissimo".[1]


Instrumentation

Britten arranged the anthem for an SATB chorus and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B-flat, two bassoons; four horns in F, two trumpets in C, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, cymbals, side drum, bass drum; and strings.


Notable performances

The piece was performed by Britten and the English Chamber Orchestra, along with the overture _The Building of the House_, at the openings of two English concert halls in 1967.[2][3]

The Queen Elizabeth Hall

The Queen Elizabeth Hall (QEH) is a purpose-built music venue on the South Bank in London which opened in March 1967. Britten prepared a reduced orchestration of his arrangement for the ECO to play at the opening concert.[4][5]

Snape Maltings

Snape Maltings is a converted industrial building in Suffolk. The Queen presided over its opening as a concert hall in June 1967 and its reopening after fire in 1970.[6][7]
