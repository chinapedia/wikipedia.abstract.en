The 2016 EUROPEAN KORFBALL CHAMPIONSHIP was held in the Netherlands from October 22 to October 30, with 10 national teams in competition. As the European Korfball Championship was split into an A-Championship and a B-Championship as of 2018, this tournament was used to decide which teams would participate at which level, with the top 8 teams qualifying for the A-Championship, while the teams in positions 9 and 10 relegated to the B-Championship. Netherlands won the tournament for a sixth consecutive time, maintaining its 100% win record.

Group stage

The number of participating teams was brought down from 16 during the past two championships to only 10 in 2016, thus requiring a new format. Two groups (A and B) of five teams were drawn on 6 June 2016, with each team playing the other teams in their group once. The top two teams in these groups will move to the semi-finals. The other teams will also be paired with a team from the other group in a playoff match with the winners moving into group C playing for positions 5 through 7, while the playoff losers will go into group D playing for positions 8 through 10.
