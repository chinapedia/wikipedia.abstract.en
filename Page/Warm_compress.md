A WARM COMPRESS is a method of applying heat to the body.[1] Heating sources can include warm water, microwaveable pads, and electrical or chemical pads. Some more unorthodox methods include warmed potatoes, uncooked rice, and hard-boiled eggs. The most common method is a warm, wet washcloth. [2]


Uses

Warm compresses are a common non-pharmacological therapy used in the treatment of such things as sports injuries, post-operative wound healing, and ophthalmic conditions. They are believed to improve blood flow, increase oxygenation in tissues, and help manage inflammation. [3]

Usage for Ocular Problems

Warm compresses are commonly used for the treatment of such ocular conditions as: [4]

-   dry eyes
-   pinkeye (conjunctivitis)
-   stye or chalazion
-   swollen eyelids (blephartis)
-   muscle spasms or pain

Usage for Muscle/Joint Injury

For both muscle and joint injuries, it is common to alternate both cold and warm compresses to manage inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids may also be used in conjunction. [5]
