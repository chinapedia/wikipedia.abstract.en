MAXIMILIAN SALZMANN (9 December 1862, in Vienna – 17 April 1954, in Graz) was an Austrian ophthalmologist.

In 1887 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, where he later worked as an assistant to Ernst Fuchs at the eye hospital. In 1906 he became an associate professor, then in 1911 was appointed professor of ophthalmology at the University of Graz. In 1918/19 he served as dean to the faculty of medicine.[1][2]

He is credited for introducing the goniolens into ophthalmology (1914), and is remembered for his pioneer research of the iridocorneal angle, an angle of the anterior chamber of the eye.[3][4][5] His name is associated with a corneal disorder known as Salzmann's nodular dystrophy.[6][7]


Published works

He was the author of a popular work on the anatomy and histology of the eye, _Anatomie und Histologie des menschlichen Augapfels im Normalzustande_, that was translated into English and published as _The anatomy and histology of the human eyeball in the normal state, its development and senescence_.[8] He published the 13th to the 15th editions of Fuchs' _Lehrbuch der Augenheilkunde_ (1921–26), and his revision of Eduard Jäger von Jaxtthal's atlas of ophthalmoscopy was translated into English as _Ophthalmoscopical Atlas_ (1890). Other noted works by Salzmann are:

-   _Die Zonula ciliaris und ihr Verhältnis zur Umgebung_, 1900 – The ciliary zonule and its relationship to its surroundings.
