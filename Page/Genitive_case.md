In grammar, the GENITIVE CASE (abbreviated ),[1] also called the SECOND CASE, is the grammatical case that marks a word, usually a noun, as modifying another word, also usually a noun—thus, indicating an attributive relationship of one noun to the other noun.[2] A genitive can also serve purposes indicating other relationships. For example, some verbs may feature arguments in the genitive case; and the genitive case may also have adverbial uses (see adverbial genitive).

Genitive construction includes the genitive case, but is a broader category. Placing a modifying noun in the genitive case is one way of indicating that it is related to a head noun, in a genitive construction. However, there are other ways to indicate a genitive construction. For example, many Afroasiatic languages place the head noun (rather than the modifying noun) in the construct state.

Possessive grammatical constructions, including the POSSESSIVE CASE, may be regarded as a subset of genitive construction. For example, the genitive construction "pack of dogs" is similar, but not identical in meaning to the possessive case "dogs' pack" (and neither of these is entirely interchangeable with "dog pack", which is neither genitive nor possessive). Modern English is an example of a language that has a possessive case rather than a _conventional_ genitive case. That is, Modern English indicates a genitive construction with either the possessive clitic suffix "-{{'s}}", or a prepositional genitive construction such as "x of y". However, some irregular English pronouns do have possessive forms which may more commonly be described as genitive (see English possessive).

Many languages have a genitive case, including Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, Georgian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Sanskrit, Scottish Gaelic, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish and all Slavic languages except Bulgarian and Macedonian.


Functions

Depending on the language, specific varieties of genitive-noun–main-noun relationships may include:

-   possession (_see_ possessive case, possessed case):
    -   inalienable possession ("_Janet's_ height", "_Janet's_ existence", "_Janet's_ long fingers")
    -   alienable possession ("_Janet's_ jacket", "_Janet's_ drink")
    -   relationship indicated by the noun being modified ("_Janet's_ husband")
-   composition (_see_ Partitive):
    -   substance ("a wheel _of cheese_")
    -   elements ("a group _of men_")
    -   source ("a portion _of the food_")
-   participation in an action:
    -   as an agent ("She benefited from _her father's_ love") – this is called the _subjective genitive_ (Compare "Her father loved her", where _Her father_ is the _subject_.)
    -   as a patient ("the love _of music_")  – this is called the _objective genitive_ (Compare "She loves music", where _music_ is the _object_.)
-   origin ("men _of Rome_")
-   reference ("the capital _of the Republic_" OR "_the Republic's_ capital")
-   description ("man _of honour_", "day _of reckoning_")
-   compounds ("_dooms_day" ("doom's day"), Scottish Gaelic "_ball coise_" = "football", where "_coise_" = gen. of "_cas_", "foot")
-   apposition (Japanese ふじの山 (_Fuji no Yama_), "Mount Fuji"

Depending on the language, some of the relationships mentioned above have their own distinct cases different from the genitive.

Possessive pronouns are distinct pronouns, found in Indo-European languages such as English, that function like pronouns inflected in the genitive. They are considered separate pronouns if contrasting to languages where pronouns are regularly inflected in the genitive. For example, English _my_ is either a separate possessive adjective or an irregular genitive of _I_, while in Finnish, for example, _minun_ is regularly agglutinated from _minu-_ "I" and _-n_ (genitive).

In some languages, nouns in the genitive case also agree in case with the nouns they modify (that is, it is marked for two cases). This phenomenon is called suffixaufnahme.

In some languages, nouns in the genitive case may be found in inclusio – that is, between the main noun's article and the noun itself.


Chinese

Cantonese

The particle 嘅 (_ge_) or the possessed noun's classifier is used to denote possession for singular nouns, while the particle 啲 (_dī_) is used for plural nouns.

Examples (In Yale transcription):

-   爸爸嘅屋企 _bā bā ge ūk kéi_ (father's house/home)
-   我間屋 _ngóh gāan ūk_ (my house)
-   係佢啲書. _haih kéuih di shyu_ (It's his books.)

Hokkien

The Hokkien possessive is constructed by using the suffix _ê_ (的 or 个 or 兮) to make the genitive case. For example:

    Nominative: _thâu-ke_ 頭家 ("boss"); _chhia_ 車 ("car")
    Genitive: _thâu-ke ê chhia_ ("boss's car")

It also uses the suffix _chi_ (之) for classical or official cases. For example:

    _Kun put kiàn Hông-hô chi súi thian-siōng lâi?_ 君不見黃河之水天上來 ("Don't you see the water of Yellow River falls down from the sky?")

Some of the Hokkien singular pronouns play the roles of possessive determiners with their nasalized forms. For example: (see Hokkien pronouns)

    Pronoun: _góa_ (I), _lí_ (you), _i_ (he, she or it)
    Genitive: _goán tau_ ("my home"), _lín tau_ ("your house"), _in tau_ ("his home" or "her home")

Still, suffix _ê_ is available for pronouns to express the genitive. For example:

    Pronoun: _góa_ (I), _lí_ (you), _i_ (he, she or it)
    Genitive: _góa-ê_ (my), _lí-ê_ (your), _i-ê_ (his, her or its)

Mandarin

In Mandarin Chinese, the genitive case is made by use of the particle 的 (de).

For instance: 我的猫 _wǒ de māo_ (my cat).

However, about persons in relation to one's self, 的 is often dropped when the context allows for it to be easily understood.

For instance: 我妈妈 _wǒ māmā_ and 我的妈妈 _wǒ de māmā_ both mean "my mother".


English

Old English had a genitive case, which has left its mark in modern English in the form of the possessive ending _'s_ (now sometimes referred to as the "Saxon genitive"), as well as possessive pronoun forms such as _his_, _theirs_, etc., and in certain words derived from adverbial genitives such as _once_ and _afterwards_. (Other Old English case markers have generally disappeared completely.) The modern English possessive forms are not normally considered to represent a grammatical case, although they are sometimes referred to as genitives or as belonging to a possessive case. One of the reasons that the status of _’s_ as a case ending is often rejected is that it does not behave as such, but rather as a clitic marking that indicates that a dependency relationship exists between phrases. One can say _the Queen’s dress_, but also _the Queen of England’s dress_, where the genitive marker is completely separated from the actual possessor. If it were a genitive case as many other languages have (including Old English), one would expect something like _*the Queen’s of England dress_ or, to emulate languages with a single consistent genitive case, _*the England’s queen’s dress_. There are limits to this kind of construction; for example, _*the horse in second place's chances_ is not acceptable.


Finnic genitives and accusatives

Finnic languages (Finnish, Estonian) have genitive cases.

In Finnish, prototypically the genitive is marked with _-n_, e.g. _maa – maan_ "country – of the country". The stem may change, however, with consonant gradation and other reasons. For example, in certain words ending in consonants, _-e-_ is added, e.g. _mies – miehen_ "man – of the man", and in some, but not all words ending in _-i_, the _-i_ is changed to an _-e-_, to give _-en_, e.g. _lumi – lumen_ "snow – of the snow". The genitive is used extensively, with animate and inanimate possessors. In addition to the genitive, there is also a partitive case (marked _-ta/-tä_ or _-a/-ä_) used for expressing that something is a part of a larger mass, e.g. _joukko miehiä_ "a group of men".

In Estonian, the genitive marker _-n_ has elided with respect to Finnish. Thus, the genitive always ends with a vowel, and the singular genitive is sometimes (in a subset of words ending with a vocal in nominative) identical in form to nominative.

In Finnish, in addition to the uses mentioned above, there is a construct where the genitive is used to mark a surname. For example, _Juhani Virtanen_ can be also expressed _Virtasen Juhani_ ("Juhani of the Virtanens").

A complication in Finnic languages is that the accusative case _-(e)n_ is homophonic to the genitive case. This case does not indicate possession, but is a syntactic marker for the object, additionally indicating that the action is telic (completed). In Estonian, it is often said that only a "genitive" exists. However, the cases have completely different functions, and the form of the accusative has developed from *_-(e)m_. (The same sound change has developed into a synchronic mutation of a final _m_ into _n_ in Finnish, e.g. genitive _sydämen_ vs. nominative _sydän_.) This homophony has exceptions in Finnish, where a separate accusative _-(e)t_ is found in pronouns, e.g. _kenet_ "who (telic object)", vs. _kenen_ "whose".

A difference is also observed in some of the related Sámi languages, where the pronouns and the plural of nouns in the genitive and accusative are easily distinguishable from each other, e.g., _kuä'cǩǩmi_ "eagles' (genitive plural)" and _kuä'cǩǩmid_ "eagles (accusative plural)" in Skolt Sami.


German

Formation

Articles

The genitive singular definite article for masculine and neuter nouns is _des_, while the feminine and plural definite article is _der_. The indefinite articles are _eines_ for masculine and neuter nouns, and _einer_ for feminine and plural nouns (although the bare form cannot be used in the plural, it manifests in _keiner_, _meiner_, etc.)

Nouns

Singular masculine and neuter nouns of the strong declension in the genitive case are marked with _-(e)s_. Generally, one-syllable nouns favour the _-es_ ending, and it is obligatory with nouns ending with a sibilant such as _s_ or _z_. Otherwise, a simple _-s_ ending is usual. Feminine and plural nouns remain uninflected:

-   des BeitragS (of the contribution) – masculine
-   der Blume (of the flower) – feminine
-   des LandES (of the country) – neuter
-   der Bäume (of the trees) – plural

Singular masculine nouns (and one neuter noun) of the weak declension are marked with an _-(e)n_ (or rarely _-(e)ns_) ending in the genitive case:

-   des RabeN (of the raven) – masculine
-   des HerzENS (of the heart) – neuter

Adjectives

The declension of adjectives in the genitive case is as follows:

                            Masculine   Feminine   Neuter   Plural
  ------------------------- ----------- ---------- -------- --------
  With definite article     -en         -en        -en      -en
  With indefinite article   -en         -en        -en      -en
  With no article           -en         -er        -en      -er

Personal pronouns

The genitive personal pronouns are quite rare and either very formal, literary or outdated. They are as follows (with comparison to the nominative pronouns):

  Nominative           Genitive
  -------------------- ----------
  ich (I)              meiner
  du (you sg.)         deiner
  er (he)              seiner
  wir (we)             unser
  ihr (you pl.)        euer
  Sie (you for. pl.)   Ihrer
  sie (she/they)       ihrer

Some examples:

-   Würden Sie statt _meiner_ gehen? (Would you go instead _of me_?)
-   Wir sind _ihrer_ nicht würdig (We are not worthy _of her/them_)
-   Ich werde _euer_ gedenken (I will commemorate _you_)

Relative pronouns

Unlike the personal ones, the genitive relative pronouns are in regular use and are as follows (with comparison to the nominative relative pronouns):

              Nominative   Genitive
  ----------- ------------ ----------
  Masculine   der          dessen
  Feminine    die          deren
  Neuter      das          dessen
  Plural      die          deren

Some examples:

-   Kennst du den Schüler, _dessen_ Mutter eine Hexe ist? (Do you know the student _whose_ mother is a witch?) – masculine
-   Sie ist die Frau, _deren_ Mann Rennfahrer ist (She is the woman _whose_ husband is a racer) – feminine

Usage

Nouns

The genitive case is often used to show possession or the relation between nouns:

-   die Farbe _des_ _Himmels_ (the colour _of the_ _sky_)
-   Deutschland liegt im Herzen _Europas_ (Germany lies in the heart _of Europe_)
-   der Tod _seiner Frau_ (the death _of his wife_)
-   die Entwicklung _dieser Länder_ (the development _of these countries_)

A simple _s_ is added to the end of a name:

-   _Claudias_ Buch (_Claudia's_ book)

Prepositions

The genitive case is also commonly found after certain prepositions:

-   innerhalb _eines Tages_ (within _a day_)
-   statt _des_ _Hemdes_ (instead _of the shirt_)
-   während _unserer_ _Abwesenheit_ (during _our absence_)
-   jenseits _der Berge_ (beyond _the mountains_)

Adjectives

The genitive case can sometimes be found in connection with certain adjectives:

-   Wir sind uns _dessen_ bewusst (We are aware _of that_)
-   Er ist _des Diebstahls_ schuldig (He is guilty _of the theft_)
-   Das Kind ist _der Ruhe_ bedürftig (The child is in need _of the calmness_)
-   Ich werde _dieses Lebens_ überdrüssig (I am growing weary _of this life_)

Verbs

The genitive case is occasionally found in connection with certain verbs (some of which require an accusative before the genitive); they are mostly either formal or legal:

-   Die Stadt erfreut sich _eines günstigen Klimas_ (The city enjoys _a favourable climate_)
-   Gedenken Sie _der Toten_ des Krieges (Remember _those who died_ in the war)
-   Wer klagte ihn _des Mordes_ an? (Who accused him _of the murder_?)
-   Man verdächtigt euch _des Betrugs_ (Someone suspects you _of (committing) fraud_)


Greek

The ablative case of Indo-European was absorbed into the genitive in Classical Greek.[3] This added to the usages of the "genitive proper", the usages of the "ablatival genitive". The genitive occurs with verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions.


Hungarian

The Hungarian genitive is constructed using the suffix _-é_ or _-e_ depending on vowel harmony. It is a noun case formed from standalone external possession as a contraction of owner and ownee in one. It serves the role of mine, yours, hers, etc. For example:

-   _madár_ ('bird'); _madáré_ ('bird's')
-   _csőr_ ('beak'); _csőre_ ('its beak')
-   _madár csőre_ ('bird's beak')

In addition, the suffix _-i_ ('of') is also used. For example:

-   _madár_ ('bird'); _madári_ ('avian', 'of bird(s)')


Japanese

The Japanese possessive is constructed by using the suffix _-no_ 〜の to make the genitive case. For example:

    Nominative: 猫 _neko_ ('cat'); 手 _te_ ('hand, paw')
    Genitive: 猫の手 _neko-no te_ ('cat's paw')

It also uses the suffix _-na_ 〜な for adjectival noun; in some analyses adjectival nouns are simply nouns that take _-na_ in the genitive, forming a complementary distribution (_-no_ and _-na_ being allomorphs).

The archaic genitive case particle _-ga_ ～が is still retained in certain expressions, place names, and dialects.

Typically, languages have nominative case nouns converting into genitive case. It has been found, however, that Japanese will in rare cases allow accusative case to convert to genitive, if specific conditions are met in the clause in which the conversion appears. This is referred to as "Accusative-Genitive conversion."[4]


Korean

The genitive in Korean can be formed using the particle _-ui_ '의', although this particle is normally elided in Modern Korean, which leaves the genitive unmarked. (If not, it is usually pronounced _-e_ '에') Only some personal pronouns retain a distinctive genitive which comes from the amalgamation of the pronoun plus _-ui_ '의'

    This is a car. _igeoseun jadongchayeyo._ 이것은 자동차예요.
    This is the man's car. _igeoseun geu namja-ui jadongchayeyo._ 이것은 그 남자의 자동차예요.

But, Modern Korean: _igeoseun geu namja jadongchayeyo._ 이것은 그 남자 자동차예요.

  Korean Personal Pronouns   Nominative   Literary Genitive   Modern Genitive
  -------------------------- ------------ ------------------- -----------------
  I (formal)                 저 jeo       저의 jeo-ui         제 je
  I (informal)               나 na        나의 na-ui          내 nae
  You (informal)             너 neo       너의 neo-ui         네 ne

의 is used to mark possession, relation, origination, containment, description/limitation, partition, being an object of a metaphor, or modification.[5]


Latin

The genitive is one of the cases of nouns and pronouns in Latin. Latin genitives still have certain modern scientific uses:

-   Scientific names of living things sometimes contain genitives, as in the plant name _Buddleja davidii_, meaning "David's buddleia". Here _Davidii_ is the genitive of _Davidius_, a Latinized version of the English name. It is not capitalized because it is the second part of a binomial name.
-   Names of astronomical constellations are Latin, and the genitives of their names are used in naming objects in those constellations, as in the Bayer designation of stars. For example, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo is called _Alpha Virginis_, which is to say "Alpha of Virgo", as _virginis_ is the genitive of _virgō_. Note that plural forms and adjectives also decline accordingly: plural _Alpha Piscium_ (Pisces) and _Alpha Canum Venaticorum_ (Canes Venatici) versus singular _Alpha Piscis Austrini_ (Piscis Austrinus) and _Alpha Canis Majoris_ (Canis Major). Astronomy manuals often list the genitive forms, as some are easy to get wrong even with a basic knowledge of Latin, e.g. Vela, which is a neuter plural not a feminine singular: _Delta Velorum_ not *_Delta Velae_.
-   _Modus operandi_, which can be translated to English as "mode of operation", in which _operandi_ is a singular genitive gerund (i.e. "of operation"), not a plural of _operandus_ as is sometimes mistakenly assumed.


Irish

The Irish language also uses a genitive case (_tuiseal ginideach_). For example, in the phrase _bean an tí_ (woman of the house), _tí_ is the genitive case of _teach_, meaning "house". Another example is _barr an chnoic_, "top of the hill", where _cnoc_ means "hill", but is changed to _chnoic_, which also incorporates lenition.


Persian

Old Persian had a true genitive case inherited from Proto-Indo-European. By the time of Middle Persian, the genitive case had been lost and replaced by an analytical construction which is now called Ezāfe. This construction was inherited by New Persian, and was also later borrowed into numerous other Iranic, Turkic and Indo-Aryan languages of Western and South Asia.


Semitic languages

Genitive case marking existed in Proto-Semitic, Akkadian, and Ugaritic. It indicated possession, and it is preserved today only in Arabic.

Akkadian

    Nominative: _šarrum_ (king)
    Genitive: _aššat šarrim_ (wife of king = king's wife)

Arabic

Called المجرور _al-majrūr_ (meaning "dragged") in Arabic, the genitive case functions both as an indication of ownership (ex. the door OF THE HOUSE) and for nouns following a preposition.

    Nominative: ٌبيت _baytun_ (a house)
    Genitive: ٍبابُ بيت _bābu baytin_ (the door of a house) ِبابُ البيت _bābu l-bayti_ (the door of the house)

The Arabic genitive marking also appears after prepositions.

    e.g. ٍبابٌ لبيت _bābun li-baytin_ (a door FOR a house)

The Semitic genitive should not be confused with the pronominal possessive suffixes that exist in all the Semitic languages

    e.g. Arabic بيتي _bayt-ī_ (my house) َكتابُك _kitābu-ka_ (your [masc.] book).


Slavic languages

With the exception of Bulgarian and Macedonian, all Slavic languages decline the nouns and adjectives in accordance with the genitive case using a variety of endings depending on the word's lexical category, its gender, and number (singular or plural).

Possessives

To indicate possession the ending of the noun indicating the possessor changes depending on the word's ending in the nominative case. For example, to _a, u, i or y_ in Polish, _а, я, ы or и_ in Russian, and similar cases in other Slavic languages.

    Nominative: (pol.) "Oto Anton" / (rus.) "Вот Антон" ("Here is Anton").
    Genitive: (pol.) "Oto obiad AntonА" / (rus.) "Вот ужин АнтонА" ("Here is Anton's dinner").

Possessives can also be formed by the construction (pol.) "u [subject] jest [object]" / (rus.) "У [subject] есть [object]".

    Nominative: (pol.) "Oto Sergiusz" / (rus.) "Вот Сергей" ("Here is Sergei").
    Genitive: (pol.) "u SergiuszА jest obiad / (rus.) "У СергеЯ есть обед" ("Sergei has a dinner", literally: "(There) is a dinner at Sergei's").

In sentences where the possessor includes an associated pronoun, the pronoun also changes:

    Nominative: (pol.) Oto mój brat / (rus.) "Вот мой брат" ("Here is my brother").
    Genitive: (pol.) "u mojEGO bratА jest obiad / (rus.) "У моЕГО братА есть обед" ("My brother has a dinner", literally: "(There) is a dinner at my_brother's).

And in sentences denoting negative possession, the ending of the object noun also changes:

    Nominative: (pol.) "Oto Irena" / (rus.) "Вот Ирина" ("Here is Irene").
    Genitive: (pol.) "Irena nie ma obiadU ("Irene does not have a dinner") or (pol.) "u IrenY nie ma obiadU ("There is no dinner at Irene's")

Note that the Polish phrase "nie ma [object]" can work both as a negation of having [object] or a negation of an existence of [object], but the meaning of the two sentences and its structure is different. (In the first case [subject] is Irene, and in the second case [subject] is virtual, it is "the space" at Irene's place, not Irene herself)

    Genitive: (rus.) "У ИринЫ нет обедА" ("Irine does not have a dinner", literally: "(There) is no dinner at Irene's").

Note that the Russian word "нет" is a contraction of "не" + "есть". In Russian there is no distinction between [subject] not having an [object] and [object] not being present at [subject]'s.

To express negation

The genitive case is also used in sentences expressing negation, even when no possessive relationship is involved. The ending of the subject noun changes just as it does in possessive sentences. The genitive, in this sense, can only be used to negate nominative, accusative and genitive sentences, and not other cases.

    Nominative: (pol.) "(Czy) Maria jest w domu?" / (rus.) "Мария дома?" ("Is Maria at home?").
    Genitive: (pol.) "MariI nie ma w domu" ("Maria is not at home", literally: "[virtual subject] has no Maria at home")
    Genitive: (rus.) "МариИ нет дома" ("Maria is not at home", literally: "Of Maria there is none at home.").

    Accusative: (pol.) "Mogę rozczytać Twoje pismo" / (rus.) Могу (про)читать ваш почерк ("I can read your hand writing")
    Genitive: (pol.) "Nie mogę rozczytać TwojEGO pismA" / (rus.) "Не могу (про)читать вашЕГО почеркА" ("I can't read your handwriting")

Use of genitive for negation is obligatory in Slovene, Polish and Old Church Slavonic. The East Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, and Belorussian) employ either the accusative or genitive for negation, although the genitive is more commonly used. In Czech, Slovak and Serbo-Croatian, negating with the genitive case is perceived as rather archaic and the accusative is preferred, but genitive negation in these languages is still not uncommon, especially in music and literature.[6]

Partial direct object

The genitive case is used with some verbs and mass nouns to indicate that the action covers only a part of the direct object (having a function of non-existing partitive case), whereas similar constructions using the Accusative case denote full coverage. Compare the sentences:

    Genitive: (pol.) "Napiłem się wodY" / (rus.) "Я выпил водЫ" ("I drank water," i.e. "I drank some water, part of the water available")
    Accusative: (pol.) "Wypiłem wodĘ" / (rus.) "Я выпил водУ ("I drank THE water," i.e. "I drank all the water, all the water in question")

In Russian, special partitive case or sub-case is observed for some uncountable nouns which in some contexts have preferred alternative form on -у/ю instead of standard genitive on -а/я: выпил чаЮ ('drank some tea'), but сорта чаЯ ('sorts of tea').

Prepositional constructions

The genitive case is also used in many prepositional constructions. (Usually when some movement or change of state is involved, and when describing the source / destination of the movement. Sometimes also when describing the manner of acting.)

-   Czech prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do (into), bez (without), kromě (excepting), místo (instead of), podle (after, according to), podél (along), okolo (around), u (near, by), vedle (beside), během (during), pomocí (using, by the help of), stran (as regards) etc.
-   Polish prepositions using genitive case: od (from), z, ze (from), do, w (into), na (onto), bez (without), zamiast (instead of), wedle (after, according to), wzdłuż (along), około (around), u (near, by), koło (beside), podczas (during), etc.
-   Russian prepositions using genitive case: от (from), с, со (from), до (before, up to), без (without), кроме (excepting), вместо (instead of), после (after), вдоль (along), около (around), у (near, by), во время (during), насчёт (regarding), etc.


Turkish

The Turkish possessive is constructed using two suffixes: a genitive case for the possessor and a possessive suffix for the possessed object. For example:

    Nominative: _Kadın_ ('woman'); _ayakkabı_ ('shoe')
    Genitive: _Kadının ayakkabısı_ ('the woman's shoe')


Albanian

The genitive in Albanian is formed with the help of clitics. For example:

    Nominative: _libër_ ('book'); _vajzë_ ('girl');
    Genitive: _libri i vajzës_ (the girl's book)

If the possessed object is masculine, the clitic is _i_. If the possessed object is feminine, the clitic is _e_. If the possessed object is plural, the clitic is _e_ regardless of the gender.

The genitive is used with some prepositions: _me anë_ ('by means of'), _nga ana_ ('on behalf of', 'from the side of'), _për arsye_ ('due to'), _për shkak_ ('because of'), _me përjashtim_ ('with the exception of'), _në vend_ ('instead of').


Kannada

In Kannada, the genitive case-endings are:

for masculine or feminine nouns ending in "ಅ" (a): ನ (na)

-   Examples: _sūrya-na_ ('of the sun')

for neuter nouns ending in "ಅ" (a): ದ (da)

-   Examples: _mara-da_ ('of the tree')

for all nouns ending in "ಇ" (i), "ಈ" (ī), "ಎ" (e), or "ಏ" (ē): ಅ (a)

-   Examples: _mane-y-a_ ('of the house'; note that a linking "y" is added between the stem and the suffix)

for all nouns ending in "ಉ" (u), "ಊ" (ū), "ಋ" (r̥), or "ೠ" (r̥̄): ಇನ (ina)

-   Examples; _guru-v-ina_ ('of the teacher'; note that a linking "v" is added between the stem and the suffix)

Most postpositions in Kannada take the genitive case.


Tamil

In Tamil, the genitive case ending is the word உடைய, which signifies possession. Depending on the last letter of the noun, the genitive case endings may vary.

If the last letter is a consonant (மெய் எழுத்து), like க், ங், ச், ஞ், ட், ண், த், ந், ப், ம், ய், ர், ல், வ், ழ், then the suffix உடைய gets added. *Examples: His: அவன் + உடைய = அவனுடைய, Doctor's: மருத்துவர் + உடைய = மருத்துவருடைய, Kumar's: குமார் + உடைய = குமாருடைய
