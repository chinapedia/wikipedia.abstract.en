Chiesa_del_suffragio_Matelica.jpg The CHIESA DEL SUFFRAGIO, also known as the CHIESE DELLE ANIME PURGANTI (Church of the Suffering or Church of the Souls in Purgatory), is a Baroque-style, Roman Catholic church and monastery located in Piazza Mattei in the city center of Matelica, province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.


History

The church was commissioned by the Confraternity _Del Suffragio_, which was founded in 1684. Work on the church was completed in 1715.

The brick facade has monumental pilasters upholding a triangular tympanum, flanking a white stone portal with a rounded pediment. In the presbytery are two chapels dedicated to Saints Sebastian and Lucy. An elliptical dome covers the nave, with a cupula frescoed with _Jesus in Glory with Angels_. The main altarpiece depicts _Christ and the Souls in Purgatory_ by the studio of Biagio Puccini, which also painted the works in the lateral chapels.[1]
