ABDUL NAWAZ BUGTI is a Baloch human rights activist and representative of Baloch Republican Party at the United Nations Human Rights Council.[1] He has been representing Balochistan during the regular sessions of the UNHRC, held every March, June and September every year.

During the March 2016 session, the permanent mission of Pakistan at UN Geneva objected on the statement made by Abdul Nawaz Bugti on point of order, but the request by the Pakistani mission was denied by UNHRC and he was allowed to complete his statement.[2]

Pakistani delegation at the UNHRC tried to silence Bugti once more during the 34th session on March 23, 2017. Pakistani move was backed by China but major western powers such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands and Norway opposed the undiplomatic objection on Bugti's statement which focused on the human rights violations in Balochistan as a result of China Pakistan Economic Corridor.
