MILOŠ TRIVUNAC (28 July 1876 – 27 November 1944) was a prominent Serbian professor and writer, who, influenced by German literature, published many works in Serbian and German.[1]He was also critical of it in his works.[2]

Trivunac was born in Aleksinac in 1876, and educated in Niš, Belgrade, Munich, and Leipzig. During the end of the Great War, Trivunac was the president of the Serbian National Defense League of America, founded by Michael Pupin and headquartered at 441 West 22nd Street in New York City.[3]Upon his return to Serbia, he founded the Department of German Language and Literature at the University of Belgrade and was its first professor there.[4]Also, he was one of the founders of the Serbian PEN center in 1926.

In 1941 when Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany, Milan Nedić appointed him Minister of Education in the Government of National Salvation in Serbia. He retained this position until 1942.[5]

In 1944 he was arrested and executed by Yugoslav Partisans in Belgrade together with Momčilo Janković Milan Horvatski, Srbislav Dokić, Milan Milovanović, Ranisav Avramović and Jovan Mijušković and 105 other alleged Serbian collaborators.
