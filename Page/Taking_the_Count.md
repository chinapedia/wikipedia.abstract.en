_TAKING THE COUNT_ is an 1898 painting by American artist Thomas Eakins. It is part of the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery.[1]

This depiction of a prizefight marks Eakins' return to anatomical studies of the male figure, this time in a more urban setting. _Taking the Count_ was his second largest canvas, but not his most successful composition.[2] The same may be said of his _Wrestlers_ (1899). More successful was _Between Rounds_ (1899), for which boxer Billy Smith posed seated in his corner at Philadelphia's Arena; in fact, all of principal figures in this composition were posed by models re-enacting what had been an actual boxing match.[3]
