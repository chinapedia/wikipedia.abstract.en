SARAI ISAURA GONZALEZ[1] (born 2005) is an American Latina child actress and author. She made her professional acting debut at the age of 11 on the Spanish-language "_Soy Yo_" ("That's Me") music video by Bomba Estéreo. Cast as a "nerdy" tween with a "sassy" and "confident" attitude, her performance turned her into a "Latina icon" for "female empowerment, identity and self-worth".[2][3] She subsequently appeared in two get out the vote videos for Latinos in advance of the 2016 United States elections. In 2018 she co-authored several volumes in a semiautobiographical chapter book series for children aged 7 to 10.


Early life and family

Sarai Gonzalez is the eldest of three daughters of Juan Carlos Gonzalez, a native of Naranjo de Alajuela, Costa Rica,[4] and his wife Diana, originally from Peru.[5] Her parents immigrated to the United States when they were children and later met in church. The family resides in Green Brook, New Jersey. Juan Carlos formerly worked as a construction engineer before leaving his job to care for the children; Diana is a computer analyst in a hospital in Newark.[6].


Career

2015–2016

From an early age, Sarai enjoyed singing, dancing, and performing. In 2015 her parents signed her up for a talent and modeling program run by Actors, Models and Talent for Christ, and she was signed by a New York agent.[7] In 2016 she auditioned for the lead role in the Spanish-language "_Soy Yo_" music video and was selected from a pool of more than 100 applicants.[8] Cast as a "nerdy" tween with a "sassy" and "confident" attitude, she traverses the "mean streets" of Brooklyn, facing up to taunts and bullies.[9][10] The music video, released on September 7, 2016,[11] garnered over one million views upon its September 2016 release and logged over 6.5 million views as of early November.[12] Gonzalez was viewed as a "Latina icon" for "female empowerment, identity and self-worth".[13][14] _The New York Times_ opined:

  {{'}}_Soy Yo_{{'}} seemed to appear at precisely the right moment—a defiant, and adorable, rebuke to the anti-Latino rhetoric of the Trump campaign, and haters in general. "Don't worry if they don't accept you," goes the song's chorus, in Spanish. "If they criticize you, just say, 'That's me.'"[15]

Gonzalez' character inspired fans to post artwork, memes, and childhood photos of themselves on social media under the hashtag #SoyYo.[16][17] In October, Fusion released a video of Gonzalez giving advice on how to develop self-confidence.[18]

Gonzalez appeared in her first speaking role in a 30-second Latino get out the vote video produced by Civic Innovation Works in advance of the 2016 US elections.[19][20] She also appeared in the two-minute "Be You y Vota" video produced by People for the American Way, in which she encourages her father and neighbors to cast their ballots and dances as she leads them to the polling station.[21][22][23]

Gonzalez was a guest at the Hispanic Heritage reception at the White House on October 12, 2016, where she shared a hug with President Barack Obama.[24][25]

2017

Gonzalez was cast in the lead role in _Watermelon_ (2017), a New York University thesis short film written and directed by Toryn Seabrooks. Gonzalez played a "12 year old frumpy wallflower" who wants to join a cheerleaders squad.[26][27]

2018

The first volume of a multi-part chapter book series, co-authored by Gonzalez and Monica Brown and published by Scholastic, was released in September 2018. Titled _Sarai and the Meaning of Awesome_, the series is based on events in Gonzalez' life and is aimed at readers aged 7 to 10.[28][29] Scholastic has since released volume 2, _Sarai in the Spotlight_,[30] and volume 3, _Sarai Saves the Music_. Each volume is available in English and Spanish editions.[31]
