Some early witnesses for the text of this chapter in Hebrew language:

-   Masoretic Text (10th century)
-   Dead Sea Scrolls: (2nd century BC)[3]

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; 𝔊^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: 𝔊^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; 𝔊^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; 𝔊^(Q); 6th century). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter (a revision of the Septuagint) were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., Naḥal Ḥever (8ḤevXII^(gr); 1st century CE) with extant verses 6-7[8]


Further Indictments against the Jerusalem Community (3:1–8)

After the oracles against the neighboring nations, the judgment of God is announced for Jerusalem for all her sins, but concludes with an announcement of his judgment against the nations.

Verse 8

    _"Therefore wait for Me," says the Lord,_
    _"Until the day I rise up for plunder;_
    _My determination is to gather the nations_
    _To My assembly of kingdoms,_
    _To pour on them My indignation,_
    _All My fierce anger;_
    _All the earth shall be devoured_
    _With the fire of My jealousy."_[9]

-   "For plunder": or "for witness" in Greek Septuagint and Syriac version; Targum reads "for the day of My revelation for judgment"; Vulgate has "for the day of My resurrection that is to come"[10]


Salvation for Judah and the Nations (3:9–13)

Following the threat of judgment against the nations in Zephaniah 3:8, the salvation of Israel will come and have universal consequences.

Verse 9

    _"For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language,_
    _That they all may call on the name of the Lord,_
    _To serve Him with one accord."_[11]

-   "Language": literally, "lip",[12] from Hebrew: , [13]


Yahweh's Reign as King in Jerusalem (3:14–20)

The joy of Yahweh's victorious kingship in the midst of the people is the theme of the closing section of this book.

Verse 16

    _In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:_

        _"Do not fear;_
        _Zion, let not your hands be weak._[14]

-   "Let not your hands be weak" - "Let not thine hands be slack" (KJV) — cited (paraphrased) in .

Verse 17

    _The Lord your God in your midst,_

        _The Mighty One, will save;_

    _He will rejoice over you with gladness,_

        _He will quiet you with His love,_

    _He will rejoice over you with singing."_[15]

-   "The Mighty One, will save" is translated from Hebrew: גבור יושיע _gib-bōr yō-shî-a_'. The word "_gibbor_" (= "mighty"), here as an attribute of God, is used in Isaiah 9:6 as one of the attributes of Messiah, who "has all power in heaven and earth"; whereas the word "_yoshia_" has the same root verb "_yasha_" (="to save") as "_yeshua_" or "Jesus" (="he saves" or "savior"), for Jesus Christ, who will be in the midst of His people, and at the head of them, to save them from the enemies (evil ones); the main theme of this passage.[16]
