AIN LUTSEPP (born 6 May 1954) is an Estonian actor and politician.


Early life and education

Born in Tallinn, Ain Lutsepp began his career as a child actor at age thirteen as the character Tõnisson in the 1969 Arvo Kruusement directed Estonian language film _Kevade_ (English: _Spring_); a film adaptation of author Oskar Luts' popular 1913 novel of the same name.[1][2]

In 1972, he graduated for the Tallinn 10th Secondary School (now, the Tallinn Nõmme Gymnasium) and in 1980 he graduated from the Tallinn State Conservatory's Performing Arts Department (present-day Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre).[3] Graduating classmates included actors Roman Baskin, Guido Kangur, Arvo Kukumägi, Paul Poom, Anne Veesaar, and Ülle Kaljuste.[4]


Acting career

Shortly after graduating from the Tallinn State Conservatory in 1980, Lutsepp was engaged at the Estonian Drama Theatre in Tallinn. There, he appeared in numerous stage productions until his departure in 2015. Among his more memorable international roles in theater were in works by: William Shakespeare, Lev Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Jean Genet, Tom Stoppard, Samuel Beckett, Anton Chekhov, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Miller, and Eugene O'Neill, among others; in addition to works by Estonian playwrights and authors A. H. Tammsaare, Madis Kõiv, Jaan Kross, Bernard Kangro, Paul-Eerik Rummo, Juhan Smuul, Hugo Raudsepp and others. Since 2008, he has been the Estonian Theatre Union chairman.[5]

In addition to his stage career, Lutsepp has appeared in a number of film and television roles. Following his role as Tõnisson in the 1969 film adaptation of Oscar Luts' _Kevade_, he revisited the role twice more; in the 1976 film _Suvi_ (English: _Summer_) and in the 1990 film _Sügis_ (English: _Fall_); both directed by Arvo Kruusement and both based on novels penned by Oscar Luts of the same names.[6]

Other film roles include that of Madis in the 1983 biopic _Lurich_, about the Estonian strongman Georg Lurich; Jaan Lõoke, in the 1983 film _Nipernaadi_, an adaptation of August Gailit's 1928 novel _Toomas Nipernaadi_; Nymann, in the 2004 Hardi Volmer directed historical thriller _Tulivesi_ (English: _The Firewater_); Julius Saarepuu, in the 2008 historical drama _Detsembrikuumus_ (English: _December Heat_); and as Ants, in the 2012 Ain Mäeots directed drama _Deemonid_ (English: _Demons_). Additionally, he voiced the character of Eduard in the 2006 Estonian animated film _Lotte from Gadgetville_, as well as having performed in several radio plays.[7]


Political career

In 2015, Lutsepp ran as a member of the Estonian Free Party for parliamentary elections in Constituency No. 3 (Nõmme and Mustamäe). He was the frontrunner of the race, garnering 4,109 votes and was elected to the Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament).[8]
