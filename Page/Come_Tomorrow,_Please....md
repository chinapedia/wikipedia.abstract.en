Plot

Young woman Frosya Burlakova comes to Moscow from a remote Siberian village to enter the Gnessin State Musical College and become a singer. She stays at the place of sculptor Nikolai Vasilievich, who studied at a school in Zaporozhye, where their common acquaintance worked a school manager, who then moved to Siberia. Absolutely unfamiliar with the big city life, Frosya amuses Nikolai Vasilyevich, his girlfriend Natasha and the housekeeper with her provinciality and spontaneity. However, the absolute sincerity and spiritual purity of Frosya lead the sculptor to the idea that he himself has long been bogged down in lies, fuss and commercial work, exchanged his artistic talent for trifles and lost his creative path.

Frosya tries to enter the institute, but finds out that she was late the exams are already over. After spending several days at the institute, Frosya constantly encounters the famous and respected professor Sokolov, who finally agrees to listen to her sing. During the audition the professor discovers that the little-educated Siberian girl has a bright and outstanding singing talent, a fantastically strong voice, is also endowed with an innate intelligence and a sense of beauty. He is trying to persuade the administration that Frosya, should be admitted to the institute as an exception.

All this time, Nikolai Vasilyevich in vain tries to find himself in art. The further he goes, the more he is convinced that all his previous work is just a forgery for art, and that the ideas are dead and empty. Kostya communication with Frosya, as well as criticism of friends and colleagues only confirm these thoughts. On one of the sleepless nights, realizing that a creative crisis has come, the sculptor, in despair, destroys all creations in his workshop, leaving only one a work from college made during the third year, which he said was really made for people.

The next morning Frosya leaves the apartment of Nikolai Vasilyevich. By the efforts of Professor Sokolov, she still manages to be admitted to college and gets a place in the hostel. On the way there she meets a student, Kostya, who soon becomes her boyfriend. However, the relationship between young people does not mesh, because Kostya completely does not share nor understand Frosya's passion for music. And the girl herself when conversing with him does not try to understand his interests, but instead only continues to think about her studies.

Six months months. During one of the lessons Burlakova's voice breaks and she has to interrupt the training for some time. In a tram she accidentally meets Nikolai Vasilyevich. Both are very pleased with each other and in conversation Frosya finds out that the sculptor has changed a lot during this time, has rethought a lot about his life and seems to have found his own creative path.

After recovering, Burlakova returns to the institute and on the same day Kostya leaves Moscow for good. He informed Frosya about this using a note and the girl did not even have a chance to say goodbye to him and to get from him any explanation. Left alone, the future singer devotes herself entirely to study, because for her the time of easy success has passed and ahead long and painstaking work is planned.
