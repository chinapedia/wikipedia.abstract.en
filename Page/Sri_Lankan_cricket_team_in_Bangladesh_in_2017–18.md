The Sri Lanka cricket team toured Bangladesh in January and February 2018 to play two Tests and two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.[1][2] Prior to the tour, both teams played in a tri-series, along with Zimbabwe.[3][4]

In December 2017, Shakib Al Hasan was named as the new captain of Bangladesh's Test squad, replacing Mushfiqur Rahim.[5] However, ahead of the Test series, Shakib suffered a hand injury during the final of the 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, with Mahmudullah named as captain of Bangladesh for the first Test.[6] It was Mahmudullah's first Test as captain and he became the tenth player to lead Bangladesh in Tests.[7][8] Mahmudullah also captained Bangladesh for the second Test, as Shakib was still recovering from his injury.[9] Sri Lanka won the Test series 1–0, after the first match was drawn.[10]

Shakib Al Hasan was also ruled out of the T20I series, with Mahmudullah once again named as captain in his place.[11][12] Sri Lanka won the T20I series 2–0.[13]
