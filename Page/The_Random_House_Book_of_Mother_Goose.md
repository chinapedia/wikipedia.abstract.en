_THE RANDOM HOUSE BOOK OF MOTHER GOOSE: A TREASURY OF MORE THAN 300 CLASSIC NURSERY RHYMES_ is a 1986 collection of over 300 nursery rhymes by Arnold Lobel. It was republished in 1997 as _The Arnold Lobel Book of Mother Goose_.


Reception

Alison Lurie, writing for The New York Times called it "an almost continuous round of noise and fun and feasting." writing "One admirable feature of this new edition of _Mother Goose_ is its generous inclusiveness." and although "Readers of a generation raised on earlier visualizations of _Mother Goose_ may regret some aspects of Mr. Lobel's version.", concluded "on balance this is a wonderful new edition of these classic rhymes,".[1]

_Horn Book_ wrote "All in all, this is an ample and robust volume, vibrant with the many human conditions that gave rise to the rhymes in the first place: quirks, incongruities, injustices, nightmares, absurdities, laughter, hopes, dreams."[2]

Parents' Choice awarded it a gold medal and wrote "The day Mother Goose met Mr. Lobel was a fortunate day."[3]
