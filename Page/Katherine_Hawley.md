KATHERINE HAWLEY is a British philosopher specialising in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of physics. Hawley is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews.[1] [2] She is the author of _How Things Persist_ (OUP 2002),[3] and _Trust: a Very Short Introduction_ (OUP 2012),[4] as well as numerous publications on testimony and knowledge-how.[5][6] She is the Fellow of Royal Society of Edinburgh[7] and the recipient of Philip Leverhulme Prize.[8].[9]


Life and career

Hawley was born in Stoke-on-Trent, England.[10] She did her undergraduate degree in physics and philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford and lived in France for a short while afterwards. She then went on to receive her M.Phil. and Ph.D. in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Peter Lipton.[11] Prior to becoming a senior lecturer at the University of St Andrews in 1999, Hawley had been Henry Sidgwick Research Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge,[12] where she had taught a variety of subjects, _inter alia_, political philosophy, critical thinking, epistemology, formal logic, and metaphysics[13]. She currently lives in Anstruther in Fife. She served as an editorial chair of The Philosophical Quarterly (2005–2010), in addition to being a deputy (1999–2001) and an associate editor (2011–2012) of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science.[14]


Work

In _How Things Persist_ (2002), Hawley defends a stage-theory of persistence that combines the four-dimensionalism of perdurantists with the endurantist account of predication. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews praised the book for offering a new formulation of endurance theory as “the claim that ordinary objects are such that (i) they exist at more than one time and (ii) statements about what parts they have must be made relative to some time or other” (Hawley, p. 30, cited in Dyke, 2013).[15] According to Dyke (2013),[16] this characterisation captures the fundamental notion that ordinary objects exist at more than one time without being temporally extended in addition to simplifying cross-comparisons with the perdurance theory, which accepts (i) but rejects (ii).

Recently, Hawley's research interests shifted from persistence, parthood and identity to (un)trustworthiness and competence in ethics and epistemology. She cites the metametaphysical turn in analytic philosophy coupled with her deflationary intuitions about the possibility of methodology of metaphysics as a reason for moving away from metaphysics to ethics and epistemology.[17]
