Career

Karting

Born in Rome, Pulcini began karting professionally in 2012 and came second in the CIK-FIA KF Junior championship a year later.

Lower Formulae

In 2014, Pulcini graduated to single-seaters, competing with DAV Racing in the inaugural season of the Italian F4 Championship, where he finished fourth. He also partook in two rounds of that year's Euroformula Open Championship with the same team.

In 2015, Pulcini switched to Euroformula Open full-time with DAV Racing, scoring his maiden victory at the first race at the Red Bull Ring and finished ninth in the standings. He also partook in the first round of the 2015 Auto GP Series.

The following year he switched to Campos Racing.[2] With them, he took seven victories, three pole positions and eight fastest laps to secure the Euroformula Open title.

In November 2016, it was announced that Pulcini would reunite with Campos for GP3 Series post-season testing at Yas Marina.[3] In January 2017, Pulcini signed to race with Arden International.[4]
