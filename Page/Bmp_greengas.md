BMP GREENGAS is a biomethane trading company based in Munich. The company produces over 1.5 terawatt hours per year and is a leader in the German biomethane market.[1] In 2016 the company took over the biomethane distribution of VNG â€“ Verbundnetz Gas.[2]

Bmp greengas works with "Greenbook", a system that detects the origin of biogas.[3] The _Deutsche Energie-Agentur_ (German Energy Agency) is also working with this system. This register was developed in 2009 and documents all biomethane quantities in the different development stages. The reason for the introduction of this system was the amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2009.


History

Bmp greengas GmbH was founded in 2003. The business idea was to prepare biogas and feed it into the natural gas network. After several analyzes in the years 2004 and 2005, a biomethane plant was developed. This plant was built in Pliening in 2006 and was the first one to feed biogas directly into the natural gas network.[4] In 2007, the project was outsourced to _RES Projects_.

The founder and managing director was Andreas Seebach. He was supported by his brother in 2013.[5] Volker Seebach has been the sole managing director of bmp greengas since 2014.[6]

Innovation price

In 2009, the company received the first innovation prize awarded by the _Deutsche Energie-Agentur_.[7][8]
