Environment

Reserva_da_Juréia.jpg ]] The region has over 10,000 species of flora and fauna. It has over of well-preserved forests, about 21% of the total remaining Atlantic Forest in Brazil. It also has of _restinga_ and of mangroves. In 1999 the Southeast Atlantic Forest Reserve, which covered 17 municipalities in the Vale do Ribeira, was one of six regions in Brazil that were considered by UNESCO to be natural World Heritage Sites. There are 24 conservation units in the region, containing rare species such as cedar, palmito, cinnamon, araucaria and caxeta, and many types of bromeliad and orchid. Preserved areas are found outside the conservation units in indigenous territories, quilombos and rural districts whose inhabitants practice small-scale subsistence agriculture.

Endangered species include the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_), jaguar (_Panthera onca_), ocelot (_Leopardus pardalis_), Pampas deer (_Ozotoceros bezoarticus_), black-fronted piping guan (_Pipile jacutinga_), broad-snouted caiman (_Caiman latirostris_) and red-tailed amazon (_Amazona brasiliensis_). Endemic species include saw-billed hermit (_Ramphodon naevius_), Guiana dolphin (_Sotalia guianensis_), yellow-legged tinamou (_Crypturellus noctivagus_) and the Superagui lion tamarin (_Leontopithecus caissara_).

Conservation units include:

-   Bananal Ecological Station
-   Carlos Botelho State Park
-   Chauás Ecological Station
-   Ilha do Cardoso State Park
-   Ilhabela State Park

Economy

Caverna_do_Diabo5.jpg, a major tourist attraction]] Gold was mined in the region from the 17th century, and more recently other minerals. Farms produced rice, coffee, tea and bananas. The Vale do Ribeira became a supplier of low-cost natural resources, exploited without regard for the environment or cultural heritage. It is one of the poorest parts of the states of São Paulo and Paraná, with low levels of education and employment. The economically active and young population continues to migrate to other regions. The region is close to the major industrial centers of São Paulo and Curitiba, and there are proposals to divert water to these centers. In recent years infrastructure improvements have included making BR-116 a divided highway and construction of hydroelectric plants.

The Vale do Ribeira today has large numbers of small properties, up to , producing bananas, beef, tomatoes and tangerines. Other products include maté tea, rice, corn and flowers, and fish in the coastal portion. There are about 80 caiçaras communities along the Iguape-Cananéia-Paranaguá estuary lagoon complex, mainly engaged in sustainable subsistance artisanal fishing or collection of crustaceans. There are ten Guarani villages, with families from the Mbyá and Ñandeva subgroups. They practice subsistence agriculture and sustainable hunting and fishing. They have been forced to move more than once when state or national parks were established on their traditional lands.

Agroforestry, producing and selling seedlings of native Atlantic Forest species, is a source of income for many communities. Commercialization of Juçara juice has potential. Mariculture, including oysters, shellfish and fish, is also showing promise. The state and federal governments are investing in development of ecotourism and adventure tourism. Some of the main attractions are the impressive calcareous caves such as those of Diabo, Santana, Morro Preto, Água Suja and Casa da Pedra.
