The KINDLER LITERATURE ENCYCLOPEDIA (in German: Das Kindler Literatur Lexikon) is an encyclopedia released in Germany covering information about world literature. Its first edition was released from 1965 to 1972 (7 volumes).[1] Its second and third edition were distributed from 1988â€“1992 (20 volumes) and in 2009 (18 volumes).[2] In 1999 a CD-ROM version was released.

For the first release the publisher Helmut Kindler started to translate articles from the Italian encyclopedia "Dizionario Letterario Bompiani". Additionally Kindler hired a crew to wrote articles on their own. As the first edition started as a translation, its primary focus was romanesque literature. With the second edition the former translations were to be rewritten. After a lot of nation building in between the 2. and 3. edition, some countries literature were merged (e.g. Russia and Ukraine).

In 2009 the German newspaper _Die Welt_ called the Kindler superior to Wikipedia articles.[3] From all the articles in the 2009 edition, the half was newly rewritten. An Online version went live at the same time.[4][5]
