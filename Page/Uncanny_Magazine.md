_UNCANNY MAGAZINE_ is an American science fiction and fantasy online magazine, edited and published by Lynne M. Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas. Issues appear bimonthly, starting November 2014[1] after receiving funding through Kickstarter.[2] _Uncanny Magazine_ has maintained a regular bimonthly schedule since, publishing original works by authors such as Neil Gaiman, Elizabeth Bear, Paul Cornell, Catherynne M. Valente, Charlie Jane Anders, Seanan McGuire, Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Alex Bledsoe, Kameron Hurley and Ken Liu.[3]

In 2017, _Uncanny_ won the 2016 Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine, and one of its published stories, "Folding Beijing" by Hao Jingfang translated by Ken Liu, won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette.[4]
