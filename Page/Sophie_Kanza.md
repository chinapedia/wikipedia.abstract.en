SOPHIE LIHAU-KANZA or _' Zala Lusibu N'Kanza_' (8 February 1940 – 2 April 1999) was a Congolese politician and sociologist. She was the first woman of her country to receive a secondary education, the first to graduate from a university, and the first to hold a government office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In her later life she held positions within the United Nations.


Early life and education

Sophie Madeline Kanza was born on 8 February 1940 in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo, the sixth of seven children[1][2] to Élisabeth Mansangaza and Daniel Kanza.[3] At the time of Congolese independence in 1960, Kanza was the only woman in the country who had been enrolled in secondary education, eventually graduating from _Lycée du Sacré Cœur_ (Sacred Heart High School) in June 1961.[4] In 1964, she became the first Congolese woman to graduate from a university[5] when she received her diploma from the University of Geneva with a degree in sociology, working in the same department for the university until 1966.[6] Kanza studied at Harvard University from 1973 to 1976, earning a master's degree and a PhD in sociology.[7]


Political career

On 31 October 1966 Kanza was appointed Minister of Social Affairs, becoming the first woman in the country to hold government office.[8] She was made a member of the political bureau of the Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution on 13 October 1967. She also served as Minister for Community Development and Minister for Work, Social Welfare and Habitat.[9] She later served as a representative to the United Nations.[10]

From 1973 until 1977, Kanza was a member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). She was Deputy Assistant Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) from 1981 to 1985 and Head of Mission to the Director-General of UNESCO from 1985 to 1988.[11][12]


Personal life

Kanza married Marcel Lihau, future the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, on 26 December 1964, and they had six daughters.[13] However, he fled political persecution in the Congo and they spent most of their later lives separated.[14]

In 1998, Kanza was in a car accident in Paris, and she became a paraplegic. After this, she left her job at UNESCO and traveled abroad to advocate for the disabled.[15]


Death and legacy

Kanza suffered cardiac arrest[16] and died on 2 April 1999. She was buried in the Luozi Territory.[17]

In 2004, Kanza was inducted into the Congo's Pantheon of National History, one of the first women to be accorded the honour. Her bust is displayed the Gallery of Memory.[18] The "Cercle Sophie Kanza", an association of female professors in the Congo, was named in her honour.[19] Three of Kanza's daughters organized a mass of thanksgiving in honor of herself and her husband in Gombe on 28 March 2015. Several important politicians attended the ceremony, including Léon Kengo and José Endundo Bononge.[20]
