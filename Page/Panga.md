PANGA is the common South African name for _PTEROGYMNUS LANIARIUS_, a small, ocean-dwelling fish, native to the southeast Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean. Alternatively called "torpedo scads", they are cold-blooded with white flesh. Their scales are generally pink in color with whitish underbelly and blue-green stripes running laterally along their sides.

Over the course of its life, a panga will undergo periodic sex-changes with as much as 30% of the population being hermaphroditic at a time. Despite the presence of both sex organs, it is thought unlikely that both are simultaneously active. Panga are slow to reach sexual maturity, with a minimum population doubling time of 4.5â€“14 years.

In other countries, the name _panga_ may refer to a different species. In Indonesia, it refers to _Megalaspis cordyla_, in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Poland it refers to _Pangasius hypophthalmus_, and in Kenya it refers to _Trichiurus lepturus_.
