_ANGELARCTOCYON_ is an extinct genus of Amphicyonidae (bear dog), which belongs to the order Carnivora.

It was originally interpreted as a miacid and named _Miacis australis_, however recent research has suggested it is an early amphicyonid.[1] Analysis of skeletal morphology suggests it is most closely related to another taxon previously attributed to Miacidae, _Miacis cognitus_, and the well known New World amphicyonid, _Daphoenus_.
