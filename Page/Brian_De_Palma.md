BRIAN RUSSELL DE PALMA (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. With a career spanning over 50 years, he is best known for his work in the suspense, psychological thriller, and crime drama genres. His prominent films include mainstream box office hits such as _Carrie_ (1976), _Dressed to Kill_ (1980), _Scarface_ (1983), _The Untouchables_ (1987), and _Mission: Impossible_ (1996), as well as cult favorites such as _Sisters_ (1973), _Blow Out_ (1981), _Body Double_ (1984), _Carlito's Way_ (1993), and _Femme Fatale_ (2002).[1]

De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the New Hollywood generation of film directors.[2] His directing style often makes use of quotations from other films or cinematic styles, and bears the influence of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and Jean-Luc Godard.[3] His films have frequently garnered controversy for their violence and sexual content,[4] but have also been championed by prominent critics such as Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael.[5][6]


Early life

De Palma, who is of Italian ancestry, is the youngest of three boys and was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Vivienne (née Muti) and Anthony Federico DePalma, an orthopedic surgeon.[7] He was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and attended various Protestant and Quaker schools, eventually graduating from Friends' Central School. He had a poor relationship with his father, and would secretly follow him to record his adulterous behavior; this would eventually inspire the teenage character played by Keith Gordon in De Palma's 1980 film _Dressed to Kill_.[8] When he was in high school, he built computers.[9] He won a regional science-fair prize for a project titled "An Analog Computer to Solve Differential Equations".


1960s and early career

Enrolled at Columbia as a physics student, De Palma became enraptured with the filmmaking process after viewing _Citizen Kane_ and _Vertigo_. De Palma subsequently enrolled at the newly coed Sarah Lawrence College as a graduate student in their theater department in the early 1960s, becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher Wilford Leach, the Maysles brothers, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Godard, Andy Warhol, and Alfred Hitchcock impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades.

An early association with a young Robert De Niro resulted in _The Wedding Party_. The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the Greenwich Village filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as "Robert ." The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the jump-cut for effect. De Palma followed this style with various small films for the NAACP and the Treasury Department.

During the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably _The Responsive Eye_, a 1966 movie about _The Responsive Eye_ op-art exhibit curated by William Seitz for MOMA in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as "very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves."[10]

_Dionysus in 69_ (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records The Performance Group's performance of Euripides' The Bacchae, starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the split-screen. De Palma recalls that he was "floored" by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he "began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other."[11]

De Palma's most significant features from this decade are _Greetings_ (1968) and _Hi, Mom!_ (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a Leftist revolutionary viewpoint common to their era. _Greetings_ was entered into the 19th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won a Silver Bear award.[12] His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy _Murder a la Mod_. Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and intertextuality, reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the "American Godard" while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work.[13]

_Greetings_ is about three New Yorkers dealing with the draft. The film is often considered the first to deal explicitly with the draft. The film is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting was used to distance the audience from the narrative, and it was difficult to discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. "Greetings" ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker.

After the success of his 1968 breakthrough, De Palma and his producing partner, Charles Hirsch, were given the opportunity by Sigma 3 to make an unofficial sequel of sorts, initially entitled _Son of Greetings_, and subsequently released as _Hi, Mom!_. While "Greetings" accentuated its varied cast, _Hi, Mom!_ focuses on De Niro's character, Jon Rubin, an essential carry-over from the previous film. The film is ultimately significant insofar as it displays the first enunciation of De Palma's style in all its major traits – voyeurism, guilt, and a hyper-consciousness of the medium are all on full display, not just as hallmarks, but built into this formal, material apparatus itself.

These traits come to the fore in _Hi, Mom!_'s "Be Black, Baby" sequence. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In _Hi, Mom!_ for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same time that you are emotionally involved with it."

"Be Black, Baby" was filmed in black and white stock on 16 mm, in low-light conditions that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of "realism." In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes "[Be Black, Baby] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." Furthermore, "I wanted to show in _Hi, Mom!_ how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – "Be Black, Baby" – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The "Be Black, Baby" section of _Hi, Mom!_ is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done."


Transition to Hollywood

In the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he worked on bigger budget films. In 1970, De Palma left New York for Hollywood at age thirty to make _Get to Know Your Rabbit_, starring Orson Welles and Tommy Smothers. Making the film was a crushing experience for De Palma, as Smothers did not like many of De Palma's ideas.[14]

After several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs _Sisters_, _Phantom of the Paradise_, and _Obsession_, a film based on the 1974 novel _Carrie_ was released, directed by Brian De Palma. The psychic thriller _Carrie_ is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by United Artists, and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as the source novel By Stephen King had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though Sissy Spacek and John Travolta had gained attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic sitcoms. _Carrie_ became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and Piper Laurie Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for George Lucas's _Star Wars_, and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa.[15] The "shock ending" finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of split-screen, split-diopter and slow motion shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.

The financial and critical success of _Carrie_ allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. _The Demolished Man_ was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and avant-garde storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's _Minority Report_ bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of _The Demolished Man_). The result of his experience with adapting _The Demolished Man_ was _The Fury_, a science fiction psychic thriller that starred Kirk Douglas, Carrie Snodgress, John Cassavetes and Amy Irving. The film was admired by Jean-Luc Godard, who featured a clip in his mammoth Histoire(s) du cinéma, and Pauline Kael who championed both _The Fury_ and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than _Carrie_, though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film, it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as _Mission: Impossible_, the thematic complex thriller for which he is now better known.

For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, most notably _Scarface_ and _Carlito's Way_, pushed the envelope of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary from one another in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of _Scarface_ contrast with the more emotional tragedy of _Carlito's Way_. Both films feature Al Pacino in what has become a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of the Bruce Springsteen's single "Dancing in the Dark". The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films _Dressed to Kill_, _Blow Out_, _Body Double_, and _The Untouchables_.

Later into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies (_Mission: Impossible_, _Carlito's Way_) worked and some others (_Raising Cain_, _Mission to Mars_, _The Bonfire of the Vanities_) failed at the box office, as did _Femme Fatale_, though this has since developed a cult status amongst cinephiles.

A more political controversy erupted in a later movie from De Palma, _Redacted_ (2007), which had the subject of American involvement in Iraq, including the committing of war atrocities there. It received limited release in the United States and grossed less than $1 million.

In 2012, his film _Passion_ was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival.[16] In 2015, he was the subject of a documentary film, _De Palma_.[17]

In 2017, De Palma began shooting the thriller _Domino_ in Málaga,[18] and then they moved to shoot in Almería at the airport, the bullring and the port.[19] The film will star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and walk-on actors were selected at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterráneos.[20] After the first take, which was shot in the bullring,[21] filming had to be cut short due to a lack of extras. Additionally, the leading female character was changed from Christina Hendricks to Carice van Houten.[22] When the shoot finished, De Palma moved to Denmark.[23]

When he went to shoot _Domino_ in Almería, he received a star at the Almeria Walk of Fame,[24] as did Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.[25]


Trademarks and style

Themes

De Palma's films can fall into two categories, his psychological thrillers (_Sisters_, _Body Double_, _Obsession_, _Dressed to Kill_, _Blow Out_, _Raising Cain_) and his mainly commercial films (_Scarface_, _The Untouchables_, _Carlito's Way_, and _Mission: Impossible_). He has often produced "De Palma" films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and graphic violence of some of De Palma's films, such as _Dressed to Kill_, _Scarface_ and _Body Double_, they are often at the center of controversy with the Motion Picture Association of America, film critics and the viewing public.[26]

De Palma is known for quoting and referencing other directors' work throughout his career. Michelangelo Antonioni's _Blowup_ and Francis Ford Coppola's _The Conversation_ plots were used for the basis of _Blow Out_. _The Untouchables_{{'}} finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's _The Battleship Potemkin_. The main plot from _Rear Window_ was used for _Body Double_, while it also used elements of _Vertigo_. _Vertigo_ was also the basis for _Obsession_. _Dressed to Kill_ was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's _Psycho_, including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.[27]

Camera shots

Film critics have often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and compositions throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a canted angle shot. Split-screen techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously.[28] To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a 360-degree camera pan. Slow sweeping, panning and tracking shots are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed long takes lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as "di-opt", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.[29]

Legacy

BrianDePalma09TIFF.jpg]] De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the New Hollywood generation of film directors, a distinct pedigree who either emerged from film schools or are overtly cine-literate.[31] His contemporaries include Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, John Milius, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Ridley Scott. His artistry in directing and use of cinematography and suspense in several of his films has often been compared to the work of Alfred Hitchcock.[32][33][34] Psychologists have been intrigued by De Palma's fascination with pathology, by the aberrant behavior aroused in characters who find themselves manipulated by others.[35]

De Palma has encouraged and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as Mark Romanek and Keith Gordon. Filmmakers influenced by De Palma include Quentin Tarantino,[36] Ronny Yu,[37] Don Mancini,[38] Nacho Vigalondo,[39] and Jack Thomas Smith.[40] During an interview with De Palma, Quentin Tarantino said that _Blow Out_ is one of his all-time favorite films, and that after watching _Scarface_ he knew how to make his own film.

Critics who frequently admire De Palma's work include Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, among others. Kael wrote in her review of _Blow Out_, "At forty, Brian De Palma has more than twenty years of moviemaking behind him, and he has been growing better and better. Each time a new film of his opens, everything he has done before seems to have been preparation for it."[41] In his review of _Femme Fatale_, Roger Ebert wrote about the director: "De Palma deserves more honor as a director. Consider also these titles: _Sisters_, _Blow Out_, _The Fury_, _Dressed to Kill_, _Carrie_, _Scarface_, _Wise Guys_, _Casualties of War_, _Carlito's Way_, _Mission: Impossible_. Yes, there are a few failures along the way (_Snake Eyes_, _Mission to Mars_, _The Bonfire of the Vanities_), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not just that he sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to."[42]


Criticism

Julie Salamon has written that De Palma has been accused of being "a perverse misogynist" by critics.[43] De Palma has responded to accusations of misogyny by saying: "I'm always attacked for having an erotic, sexist approach - chopping up women, putting women in peril. I'm making suspense movies! What else is going to happen to them?"[44]

David Thomson wrote in his entry for De Palma, "There is a self-conscious cunning in De Palma's work, ready to control everything except his own cruelty and indifference."[45]
