WYGGESTON GRAMMAR SCHOOL FOR BOYS was a grammar school in Leicester, England, in existence from 1876 to 1976.

It was succeeded by the present-day Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.


History

After William Wyggeston's death in 1536, his brother Thomas Wyggeston, as a trustee, used part of the money to establish a school for boys known as the ELIZABETHAN GRAMMAR SCHOOL. This eventually became defunct in the 19th century, but was re-founded on the site of the old Wyggeston Hospital as the WYGGESTON HOSPITAL SCHOOL, which took its first pupils on 30 April 1877.[1] This school passed its name to the later Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. In 1927, new buildings were built, designed by James Miller.

In 1970/1971, the school won the national Top of the Form contest, beating Harris Academy, Dundee, in the final on 2 January 1971.

After the reorganisation of local government, the system of education in the City of Leicester became comprehensive, and the school closed in 1976 to be replaced by other schools, including the Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.

WYGGESTON GRAMMAR SCHOOL FOR GIRLS, also known as Wyggeston Girls' Grammar School, was founded not long after the boys' school and also closed in 1976. Its site was re-used for the Wyggeston Collegiate Sixth Form College, known as Regent College, Leicester, between 1996 and 2018, when it was absorbed into Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.
