The ROMANI (also spelled ROMANY , ), colloquially known as GYPSIES or ROMA, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group, traditionally itinerant, living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent,[1][2] from the Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab regions of modern-day India.[3][4]

Genetic findings appear to confirm that the Romani "came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago".[5] Genetic research published in the _European Journal of Human Genetics_ "revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma".[6] They are a dispersed people, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Romani originated in northern India and arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1,000 years ago.[7] They have been associated with another Indo-Aryan group, the Dom people: the two groups have been said to have separated from each other or, at least, to share a similar history.[8] Specifically, the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 6th and 11th century.[9]

The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym _GYPSIES_ (or _GIPSIES_), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity.[10] Beginning in 1888 the Gypsy Lore Society[11] started to publish a journal that was meant to dispel rumors about their lifestyle.[12]

Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States;[13] and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from people deported by the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition.[14] In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada.

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India.[15] The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora.[16]

The Romani language is divided into several dialects which together have an estimated number of speakers of more than two million. The total number of Romani people is at least twice as high (several times as high according to high estimates). Many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence or of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani.[17]

Endonyms

ROM means man or husband in the Romani language. It has the variants dom and lom, related with the Sanskrit words _dam-pati_ (lord of the house, husband), _dama_ (to subdue), _lom_ (hair), _lomaka_ (hairy), _loman_, _roman_ (hairy), _romaça_ (man with beard and long hair).[26] Another possible origin is from Sanskrit डोम _doma_ (member of a low caste of travelling musicians and dancers).

Romani usage

In the Romani language, _Rom_ is a masculine noun, meaning 'man of the Roma ethnic group' or 'man, husband', with the plural _Roma_. The feminine of _Rom_ in the Romani language is _Romni_. However, in most cases, in other languages _Rom_ is now used for people of both genders.[27]

_Romani_ is the feminine adjective, while _Romano_ is the masculine adjective. Some Romanies use _Rom_ or _Roma_ as an ethnic name, while others (such as the Sinti, or the Romanichal) do not use this term as a self-ascription for the entire ethnic group.

Sometimes, _rom_ and _romani_ are spelled with a double _r_, i.e., _rrom_ and _rromani_. In this case _rr_ is used to represent the phoneme [[Uvular_trill|[28]

Most historians agree that Charles III pragmática failed for three main reasons, ultimately derived from its implementation outside major cities and in marginal areas: The difficulty the Gitano community faced in changing its nomadic lifestyle, the marginal lifestyle in which the community had been driven by society and the serious difficulties of applying the pragmática in the fields of education and work. One author ascribes its failure to the overall rejection by the wider population of the integration of the Gitanos.[29][30]

Other examples of forced assimilation include Norway, where a law was passed in 1896 permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions.[31] This resulted in some 1,500 Romani children being taken from their parents in the 20th century.[32]

Holocaust

The persecution of the Romanies reached a peak during World War II in the _Porajmos_, the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 1935, the Nuremberg laws stripped the Romani people living in Nazi Germany of their citizenship, after which they were subjected to violence, imprisonment in concentration camps and later genocide in extermination camps. The policy was extended in areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably the Independent State of Croatia, Romania and Hungary.

Because no accurate pre-war census figures exist for the Romanis, it is impossible to accurately assess the actual number of victims. Most estimates for numbers of Romani victims of the Holocaust fall between 200,000 and 500,000, although figures ranging between 90,000 and 1.5 million have been proposed. Lower estimates do not include those killed in all Axis-controlled countries. A detailed study by Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum gave a figure of at least a minimum of 220,000, possibly closer to 500,000.[33] Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, argues in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000.[34]

In Central Europe, the extermination in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was so thorough that the Bohemian Romani language became extinct.


Contemporary issues

"average estimates", totalling 9.8 million)[35]]]

, 2011]]

In Europe, Romani people are associated with poverty, and are accused of high rates of crime and behaviours that are perceived by the rest of the population as being antisocial or inappropriate.[36] Partly for this reason, discrimination against the Romani people has continued to the present day,[37][38] although efforts are being made to address them.[39] Amnesty International reports continued instances of Antizigan discrimination during the 20th Century, particularly in Romania, Serbia,[40] Slovakia,[41] Hungary,[42] Slovenia,[43] and Kosovo.[44] The European Union has recognized that discrimination against Romani must be addressed, and with the national Roma integration strategy they encourage member states to work towards greater Romani inclusion and upholding the rights of the Romani in the European union.[45]

The Romanis of Kosovo have been severely persecuted by ethnic Albanians since the end of the Kosovo War, and the region's Romani community is, for the most part, annihilated.[46]

Czechoslovakia carried out a policy of sterilization of Romani women, starting in 1973.[47] The dissidents of the Charter 77 denounced it in 1977–78 as a genocide, but the practice continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989.[48] A 2005 report by the Czech Republic's independent ombudsman, Otakar Motejl, identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators.[49]

In 2008, following the brutal rape and subsequent murder of an Italian woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment,[50] the Italian government declared that Italy's Romani population represented a national security risk and that swift action was required to address the _emergenza nomadi_ (_nomad emergency_).[51] Specifically, officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas.

The 2008 deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic, two Roma children who drowned while Italian beach-goers remained unperturbed, brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and the Roma people. Reviewing the situation in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:

The 2016 Pew Research poll found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma. In Greece 67%, in Hungary 64%, in France 61%, in Spain 49%, in Poland 47%, in the UK 45%, in Sweden 42%, in Germany 40%, and in the Netherlands[52] 37% have an unfavourable view of Roma.[53]

Forced repatriation

In the summer of 2010 French authorities demolished at least 51 illegal Roma camps and began the process of repatriating their residents to their countries of origin.[54] This followed tensions between the French state and Roma communities, which had been heightened after French police opened fire and killed a traveller who drove through a police checkpoint, hitting an officer, and attempted to hit two more officers at another checkpoint. In retaliation a group of Roma, armed with hatchets and iron bars, attacked the police station of Saint-Aignan, toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars.[55][56] The French government has been accused of perpetrating these actions to pursue its political agenda.[57] EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated that the European Commission should take legal action against France over the issue, calling the deportations "a disgrace". A leaked file dated 5 August, sent from the Interior Ministry to regional police chiefs included the instruction: "Three hundred camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months, Roma camps are a priority."[58]

Artistic representations

, , Elizabeth, at right, is shown as a gypsy fortune-teller]] Many depictions of Romani people in literature and art present romanticized narratives of mystical powers of fortune telling or irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. Romani were a popular subject in Venetian painting from the time of Giorgione at the start of the 16th century; the inclusion of such a figure adds an exotic oriental flavour to scenes. A Venetian Renaissance painting by Paris Bordone (ca. 1530, Strasbourg) of the Holy Family in Egypt makes Elizabeth, a gypsy fortune-teller; the scene is otherwise located in a distinctly European landscape.[60]

Particularly notable are classics like the story _Carmen_ by Prosper Mérimée and the opera based on it by Georges Bizet, Victor Hugo's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, Herge's _The Castafiore Emerald_ and Miguel de Cervantes' _La Gitanilla_. The Romani were also depicted in _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, _As You Like It_, _Othello_ and _The Tempest_, all by William Shakespeare.

The Romani were also heavily romanticized in the Soviet Union, a classic example being the 1975 _Tabor ukhodit v Nebo_. A more realistic depiction of contemporary Romani in the Balkans, featuring Romani lay actors speaking in their native dialects, although still playing with established clichés of a Romani penchant for both magic and crime, was presented by Emir Kusturica in his _Time of the Gypsies_ (1988) and _Black Cat, White Cat_ (1998). The films of Tony Gatlif, a French director of Romani ethnicity, like _Les Princes_ (1983), _Latcho Drom_ (1993) and _Gadjo Dilo_ (1997) also portray gypsy life.
