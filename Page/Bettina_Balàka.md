Biography

Born on 27 March 1966 in Salzburg, Balàka studied English and Italian at the Institut für Übersetzer- und Dolmetscherausbildung (Institute for Translation and Interpreting Studies) in Vienna, earning a master's degree in 1991. Her studies included extended trips to Britain and the United States. She has since worked as a freelance writer and translator in Vienna. In addition to her novels, poetry, drama and radio plays, Balàka has frequently contributed to literary journals and anthologies.[3] She lives with her daughter in Vienna.[4]

Her novel _Eisflüstern_, the story of a soldier returning from war, is one of the few Austrian thrillers set during the turning point of the First World War with the collapse of the Austrian Habsburgs and the establishment of a new republic.[5] _Unter Menschen_ is a humorous yet sad tale tracing a dog's experiences of a series of different owners.[6] _Die Prinzessin von Arborio_ tells how a restaurant owner who has committed three murders is interrogated by a psychologist who falls in love with her. The Austrian newspaper _Kurier_ quotes the author's explanation: "I'm a very curious person. That's why I always look for new themes. In _Die Prinzessin von Arborio_ I've chosen criminal psychology, hybristophilia, and falling in love as the most beautiful form of psychosis."[7]


Awards

Balàka's many awards include the Salzburger Lyrikpreis (Salzburg Poetry Prize, 2006) und the Friedrich-Schiedel- Literaturpreis (Friedrich Schiedel Literature Prize, 2008).[8]
