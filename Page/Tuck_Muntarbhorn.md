TUCK MUNTARBHORN (Thai: ทัก มันตาภรณ์; born January 1994 in Bangkok, Thailand) is a Thai artist, curator, contemporary art collector[1] and entrepreneur based in London and Bangkok.[2] Muntarbhorn is Thailand’s first contemporary art collector to produce and curate an art exhibition in the UK.[3]

He co-founded the international fashion brand Busardi in 2009 with the intention of bridging the exclusivity of haute couture with the accessibility of prêt-à-porter (as 'semi-couture').[4] In 2015, it became the first Thai label to exhibit collections at the Paris Fashion Week.[5] Within the field of haute couture, Muntarbhorn's creations have been characterized among those that reflect designers' own personalities.[6]

Muntarbhorn views creativity as a spiritual practice:[7] an awareness of thought, feeling, sensation, perception and intention; creating photography and sculpture to unite Eastern and Western symbols of spirituality to promote humanitarianism.
