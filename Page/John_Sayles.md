JOHN THOMAS SAYLES (born September 28, 1950) is an American independent film director, screenwriter, editor, actor and novelist. He has twice been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, for _Passion Fish_ (1992) and _Lone Star_ (1996). His film _Men with Guns_ (1997) was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. His directorial debut, _Return of the Secaucus 7_ (1980), has been added to the National Film Registry.


Early life

Sayles was born in Schenectady, New York, the son of Mary (_née_ Rausch), a teacher, and Donald John Sayles, a school administrator.[1] Both of Sayles's parents were of half-Irish descent and Catholic.[2] He attended Williams College with frequent collaborators Gordon Clapp and David Strathairn.


Career

Like Martin Scorsese and James Cameron, Sayles began his career working with Roger Corman. In 1979, Sayles used $30,000 he earned writing scripts for Corman to fund his first film, _Return of the Secaucus 7_.[3] To make the film on a limited budget, he set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set the story over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so he could cast his friends in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim at the time and has held its reputation. In November 1997, the National Film Preservation Board announced that _Return of the Secaucus 7_ would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.

In 1983, after the films _Baby It's You_ (starring Rosanna Arquette) and _Lianna_ (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a MacArthur Fellowship. He put the money into the fantasy _The Brother from Another Planet_,[4] a film about a black, three-toed slave who escapes from another planet and after crash-landing on Earth, finds himself at home among the people of Harlem, being pursued by white male agents from his home planet dressed as men in black.

In 1989, Sayles created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show _Shannon's Deal_ about a down-and-out Philadelphia lawyer played by Jamey Sheridan. Sayles received a 1990 Edgar Award for his teleplay for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being cancelled in 1991.

Sayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts, such as _Piranha_, _Alligator_, _The Howling_ and _The Challenge_[5]Having collaborated with Joe Dante on _Piranha_ and _The Howling_, Sayles acted in Dante's movie, _Matinee_. Sayles gets the rest of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for _Apollo 13_[6] and _Mimic_.

A genre script, called _Night Skies_, inspired what would eventually become the film _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_.[7]That film's director, Steven Spielberg, later commissioned Sayles to write a script (unused) for the fourth _Jurassic Park_ film.

He has written and directed his own films, including _Lone Star_, _Passion Fish_, _Eight Men Out_, _The Secret of Roan Inish,_ and _Matewan_. He serves on the advisory board for the Austin Film Society.

Maggie Renzi has been John Sayles' long-time companion (and collaborator), but they have not married. Renzi has produced most of his films since _Lianna_. They met as students at Williams College.

Sayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, and Gordon Clapp, each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films.

In early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name "Statement of Conscience" (along with Noam Chomsky, Steve Earle, Brian Eno, Jesse Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Bonnie Raitt, Oliver Stone, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and others) which opposed the invasion of Iraq[8]

In February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an HBO series based on the early life of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The drama, tentatively titled _Scar Tissue_, centers on Kiedis's early years living in West Hollywood with his father. At that time, Kiedis's father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included The Who and Led Zeppelin) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.[9]

In February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama _Amigo_, in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the Philippine–American War, with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and Garret Dillahunt.[10]

His novel _A Moment in the Sun_, set during the same period as _Amigo_, in the Philippines, Cuba, and the US, was released in 2011 by McSweeney's. It includes an account of the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in North Carolina, the only coup d'état in United States history in which a duly elected government was overthrown.[11]
