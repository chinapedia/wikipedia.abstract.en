Plot

Georgina Hayes, her brother Toby, and their parents live happily in an apartment in Darby North Carolina until her father leaves their family. Their limited income results in Georgina and her family being evicted from the apartment, and since then, they have lived in their car and in poverty. She tells her friend about this, but soon finds a way to get money and a new place to live after seeing a reward for a missing dog: Steal one, "return it", and get the money. Their mother manages to get an abandoned house as a temporary home, almost making Georgina abandon her plan, but it is so dilapidated it reinstates her confidence. The house is later boarded up. She and Toby manage to locate a dog named Willie, and lure it away from his owner, Carmella. Georgina assumes that Carmella is rich due to the exterior of her house, and her surname is on the street the siblings are on.

The plan works with few inconsistencies, but Georgina begins to feel guilty about the deed, and a traveler named Mookie begins to grow suspicious of the dog. To make matters worse, as Georgina befriends Carmella, she realizes that she isn't rich at all: the street belonged to Carmella's late grandfather, and all that is left of him is Willie. Carmella attempts to borrow money from her sister and uncle, making the guilt worse. Georgina finally realizes what she did was right and also wrong, and decides to return Willie without the reward money. However, Carmella forgives Georgina.

A three days pass and Georgina and Toby's mother announces they will now live in a house. Georgina is thrilled to no longer have to live in a car, and they move in. She resolves her life will slowly become normal again as she will get new friends and good grades. Towards the end, she resolves to not steal a dog again due to the consequences.
