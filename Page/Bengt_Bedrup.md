He attended _Viggbyholmsskolan_ in Viggbyholm in 1945 and became at the age of 17 an employee at the newspaper _Värmlands-Posten_ in Kristinehamn in 1945.

In 1980, he was interviewed by Lasse Holmqvist in the TV program _Här är ditt liv_ (_This Is Your Life_), when he was caught off guard when he had thought he would just be a guest when Bosse Parnevik was portrayed, a classic episode in Swedish television history. In this program, his severe alcohol problems were revealed,[6] which later founded his extensive work in these matters, including his TV series about alcoholism, _Torra fakta_ (Dry facts) and _Beska droppar_ (Bitter drops). Bedrup made himself also known as an alcohol informant where he wanted parents to teach their children how to drink properly.[7] He was also a member of the Lions Clubs International[8] and hosted the radio show _Sommar_ in 1992.
