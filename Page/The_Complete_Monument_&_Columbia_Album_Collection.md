_THE COMPLETE MONUMENT & COLUMBIA ALBUM COLLECTION_ is a box set by country singer/songwriter Kris Kristofferson, released in 2016 on Columbia Records and Legacy Recordings.[1]

The set consists of 16 CDs, the majority of which are reissues of albums released by Kristofferson during his 1970-1984 tenure with Monument Records. Included are all of his 10 studio albums from the period, plus a duet album by Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge. Each CD is packaged in a replica of the original LP cover, with any albums originally issued as two-LP set condensed onto one disc. Additional content consists of three live records (two of them previously unreleased), demos and a bonus disc called 'Extras', compiling non-album tracks and duets taken from other albums. For example, every Kristofferson song from _The Winning Hand_ and _Music from Songwriter_ list included there.

The CD set also includes a booklet featuring newly written essays and liner notes by Fred Foster, Don Was and Mikal Gilmore.

Alongside the CD version, digital download versions of the content were published (all songs/albums individually as well as the complete set containing all 16 albums).
