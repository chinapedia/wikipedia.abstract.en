NICOLE MAXINE MICHEL-MILLAR,[1] (born 27 April 1993) who performs as NICOLE MILLAR, is a Canadian-Australian electronic, indie pop singer-songwriter.[2][3] She is the featured vocalist on "High" (February 2014) by Australian duo, Peking Duk, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Millar co-wrote the track with Sam Littlemore and the duo's Adam Hyde and Reuben Styles.[4] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2014 she won a trophy for Best Dance Release alongside the group. In the following January, "High", was listed at No.2 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2014.

Her highest charting solo work is her debut extended play, _Tremble_ (5 February 2016), which reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 60. In November 2017 it was certified gold for shipment of 35000 copies.[5] Her debut album, _Excuse Me_, appeared on 1 June 2018, which peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums Chart.[6] It was recorded over two years with Sable, Dan Faber, Hoodboi, xSDTRK, and Kyle Shearer producing.[7]

Craig Mathieson of _The Sydney Morning Herald_ observed that the singer had completed, "a journey of creative self-discovery that began with her pulling her car over to quickly record ideas on her phone and ended with songwriting sessions in Sweden and studio time in Los Angeles."[8] She undertook a national headlining tour in June 2018.[9] _The Partae_{{'}}s reviewer found the album, "charts everything from admitting your faults and owning your shit to wild nights with best friends and the bittersweet parts of love, lust and relationships."[10]
