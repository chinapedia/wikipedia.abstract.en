METI is a term used, in the country of Nepal, referring to a feminine displaying and masculine bodied individual.[1] Known in western culture and society as transgender. The word _meti_ or _metis_ is predominantly used to refer to a transgender woman.[2] Metis are a part of a larger group of queer individuals in Nepal referred to as _anya_.[3]

Metis are an officially recognized _third gender_ in the country of Nepal as of a Supreme Court ruling in 2007. As of this Supreme Court ruling, metis are able to be officially recognized by the Nepalese government – able to have a government-issued ID card listing “both” as an option under “gender”.[4][5] This also set a precedent of using self-determination as a source of proof in determining a person eligibility in establishing a gender on government documents.


Discrimination

Discrimination is a common issue among self-identified meti individuals. In the country of Nepal ‘unnatural sex’ is still illegal despite the more progressive inclusion of a third-gender on registration forms in Nepal.[6] In 2004, 39 meti individuals were arrested and detained for ‘spreading perversion’ and furthermore were unable to receive due process, as a result of the lack of LGBT support among Nepalese laws. Although a potential amelioration to the situation could be acquired by pushing for education and informing of the citizens of Nepal.[7]

Meti are commonly associated with the Blue Diamond Society of Nepal.[8] The society is a LGBT rights association devoted to crusading for the rights of marginalized LGBTQ+ individuals.


HIV

The HIV epidemic prevalent in Nepal is especially concentrated among the meti community.[9] This can be attributed to the unique struggle that Meti face finding employment and acceptance in society. Many meti are pushed into the[10] sex-industry working as prostitutes and are unwelcome in any other roles in society.[11] As with issues of discrimination, the key to starting to solve the HIV epidemic among meti is making knowledge readily available and educating about safe-sex methods.[12]
