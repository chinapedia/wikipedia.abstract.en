The bark is grey to grey-white in colour and rough to the ends of branches, tightly held box-type becoming tessellated on the trunk.[2] The dull blue-green adult leaves are arranged alternately and have a blade with an orbicular to deltoid shape that is in length and wide.[3] It blooms between April and June and each terminal compound inflorescence has seven buds per umbel. The mature buds have a pyriform shape and are in length and wide with a beaked operculum and creamy white flowers. After flowering pedicellate fruit are formed that usually have a cupular but can have a slightly urceolate shape. The fruits are in length and wide with four valves at rim level.
