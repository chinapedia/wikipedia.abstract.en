_ORBEA VARIEGATA_ is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family Apocynaceae, known as the STAR FLOWER. It is native to the coastal belt of the Western Cape, South Africa, growing actively during the winter rainfall season.[1] Growing to tall by broad, it is a leafless succulent perennial with cactus-like toothed stems, and highly variable, star-shaped, off-white or yellow flowers strongly speckled with maroon, up to in diameter. The flowers may show regular (banded) markings, or irregular ones. They have five pointed or blunt lobes surrounding a central, pentagonal annulus (corona).[2] Each plant may produce up to five blooms. The flowers may have a faint carrion smell to attract potential insect pollinators.[3]

This plant is popular in cultivation, and is often sold under its former name _Stapelia variegata_. It has many common names, including starfish plant, starfish cactus, carrion cactus, carrion flower, toad cactus, toad plant.[4] It is not closely related to the true cactus family. When grown as an ornamental plant in temperate zones it requires protection, as it does not tolerate freezing temperatures. It is best grown under glass, in similar conditions to cacti.

In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Societyâ€™s Award of Garden Merit.[5][6]

It is an invasive species in southern Australia.[7]
