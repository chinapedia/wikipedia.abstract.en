ZIPPER CLUB is an American musical group from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed by members Mason James of Cerebral Ballzy and solo artist Lissy Trullie.[1]


History

Zipper Club was initially formed from the writing of Mason James of Cerebral Ballzy.[2] After touring internationally for many years, James left the group to start a new project.[3] He wanted to explore new instrumentations and musical styles so he began writing songs that were inspired by the diverse musical taste of his childhood.[4] He spent the next couple years honing his sound in his bedroom.[5]

James met up with Trullie to write and record the rest of the record, coming up with the name Zipper Club in the process.[6] Prior to Zipper Club, Trullie was a solo artist fronting the group Lissy Trullie in addition to studying art and film theory at Parsons and The New School.[7]

James and Trullie met with James Iha in Los Angeles to produce some of the songs for the band.[8] The duo has referred to Iha as a "subtle mad scientist" and is the only producer they wanted to work with.[9] James and Trullie continued to work with Iha as they recorded what would be the group's debut LP.[10] Zipper Club is currently managed by David Bason.[11]
