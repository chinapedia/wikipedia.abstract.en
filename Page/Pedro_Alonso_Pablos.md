PEDRO ALONSO PABLOS (Madrid, January 11, 1979) is an internet content producer, known by the creation of a series of video interviews to Spanish and international film and television personalities.


Interviews

Mentioned interviews were recorded in Madrid in 2004/2005 and produced, directed and presented by Pedro. Many Spanish and international celebrities were interviewed, including Santiago Segura, Álex de la Iglesia, Guillermo del Toro, Oliver Stone (with a small appearance), José Luis Moreno and Keanu Reeves, among others. These videos represent an early example of web television, and the first one was recorded on July 2004, approximately 7 months before the appearance of Youtube. These videos were distributed through his own website, _FreakSpain_, now unavailable.[1][2][3]


Animation

Afterwards, Pedro has released through the Spanish VOD portal Filmin his first animated mini series, _Cuentos del mundo_, made entirely by him with the help of voice actress Mª Luz Crespo Chaves.

In 2016, Pedro released through Filmin his first animated feature film, _La ruta de los elefantes_, which is one of the first feature films made almost entirely by just one person. This film technique was named _solo filmmaking_.[4]

In January 2019, he released his second feature film, _Triskipolis_, through Amazon Prime Video for the United States, using the same technique as the previous one, with a fast and great impact and downloads worldwide.[5]
