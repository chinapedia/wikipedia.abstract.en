Biography

Born in Edinburgh, Hunter graduated from Glasgow School of Art in 1987 and thereafter studied classical sculpture at the British School at Athens.[3]

Hunter makes monumental civic sculpture, he also makes gallery based work and has exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (including a bust of Jimmy Reid), the Centre for Contemporary Arts, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Tramway Glasgow, Galerie Scheffel in Germany and at Conner Contemporary Art, Washington, among others in the UK and Internationally.

According to his profile at _GENERATION_, _"Kenny Hunter makes elegant sculptures in many materials including wood, plastic, iron and bronze. He remains fascinated by the processes involved in making sculpture in the studio and the power that they have to transform materials in order to express his complex and vivid ideas on historical time."_[4] Blackbird_and_Lions_decoration_(32050935750).jpg


Public Art Works

Perhaps Hunter's most well-recognised piece of public art in Scotland is _CITIZEN FIREFIGHTER_ in Gordon Street, Glasgow. It was commissioned in 2001 for Strathclyde Fire & Rescue and due to its location on a busy corner near to Glasgow Central station it is passed by hundreds of office workers every day.
