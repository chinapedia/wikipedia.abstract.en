ISAIAH 8 is the eighth chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies spoken by the prophet Isaiah and is one of the Books of the Prophets.


Text

The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 22 verses in many translations, but in Hebrew texts and some English versions Isaiah 9:1 appears as verse 8:23.

Textual witnesses

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew language:

-   Masoretic Text (10th century)

Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; 𝔊^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: 𝔊^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; 𝔊^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; 𝔊^(Q); 6th century).


Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[1] Isaiah 8 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {P} 8:1-3a {S} 8:3b-4 ויאמר ה' אלי {S} 8:5-8 {S} 8:9-10 {S} 8:11-15 {P} 8:16-18 {S} 8:19-23 [9:1-6 {P}]


The sign of Maher-shalal-hash-baz (8:1–4)

Since the sign of Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14-17) gives an undisclosed time in the future, another sign is given to deal with the contemporary scene, in the form of a child with an ordinary birth and a name which would be a _standing witness_ (cf. ) to the prophecy both about 'the enemy at the gate' (verse 4; cf. ) and about the next victim of the Assyrians, which is Judah itself ().

Verse 1

    _Moreover the Lord said to me, "Take a large scroll, and write on it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz"_.[2]

-   "Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz": Literally, "Speed the Spoil, Hasten the Booty"[3]

Verse 3

    _Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, "Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz";_[4]

The striking similarities with Isaiah 7:14-15 raises an argument that this is a variant version of the same story, but 'the heavily symbolic name given to the unsuspecting child has markedly different overtone'.


God's gentle flow and Assyria's torrent (8:5–8)

Using evil to fight evil would bring Judah to the path of the torrent/flood which would jeopardize herself as the land of _Immanuel_, but for Immanuel's sake, there is a limit set (verse 8: _up to the neck_; cf. ).


God our refuge or our ruin (8:9–15)

This part contains Isaiah's defiant response to the meaning of "Immanuel" (verse 10c: _God with us_) and to God's insistence (verse 11: _his strong hand upon me_) that people should reshape their thinking and emotional attitudes (verse 12) round God himself (cf. call to a transformed outlook in Romans 12:2).

Verse 12

    ''"Do not say, 'A conspiracy,' ''
    _Concerning all that this people call a conspiracy,_
    _Nor be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled."_[5]

-   "Their threats" (NKJV; ESV: "What they fear"): or "terror".[6]

Verses 12b–13a are cited in 1 Peter 3:14–15 which identifies Christ with the "Lord of hosts" (_Lord Almighty_) as Jesus himself alluded Isaiah 8:14–15 in Luke 20:18a (cf. Romans 9:33, 1 Peter 2:7–8).

Verse 13

    _Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread._[7]

-   The first part is cited in 1 Peter 3:15[8]

As the oracle of judgement in this part gives clear warning to all conspiring against the community that the presence of Immanuel ('God is with us') will overthrow their plans: There is no political solutions to the community's problems, but the people are to trust in YHWH (_Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread_).

Verse 14

    ''He is the sanctuary and the stumbling stone
    ''and the rock that brings down the two houses of Israel;
    ''a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem."[9]

-   Cross reference: Isaiah 28:16
-   Cited in Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:7–8.
-   Alluded in Luke 20:18a.

Verse 15

    _"And many among them shall stumble;_
    ''They shall fall and be broken,
    _Be snared and taken."_[10]

-   Alluded in Luke 20:18a; 1 Peter 2:8.
-   "Taken": or "captured".[11]


The light withdrawn (8:16–22)

This part indicates that Israel is losing God's teaching and blessing (verses 16–17), because Isreal is refusing the light (verses 19–22), so is only left with _signs_ (verse 18) and can only expect _darkness_ (verse 22).

Verse 16

    _Bind up the testimony_
    _Seal the law among my disciples._[12]

This verse relates to the completion of the scroll initiated in verse 1. The expression _my disciples_ is God's new definition for his people in their relation to him.


Verse 23

    _For is there no gloom to her that was steadfast?_[13]

The Jerusalem Bible suggests that this line "seems to be a gloss".[14]

    _In the former time he debased the land of Zebulon, and the land of Naphthali;_
    _But in the latter time he hath made it glorious:_
    _Even the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations._[15]

This text, which appears as Isaiah 9:1 in most modern translations,[16] forms verse 8:23 in Hebrew texts and some English versions.
