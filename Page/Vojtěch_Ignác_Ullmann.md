VOJTĚCH IGNÁC ULLMANN (April 23, 1822 in Prague – September 17, 1897 in Příbram)[1] was a Czech architect working in Revivalism architecture, particularly Renaissance Revival architecture.


Life

Ullmann studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna with professors August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll.[2][3] After finishing his studies, he traveled to Italy. From 1854 he worked as an architect in Prague.

He often collaborated with the architect Antonín Viktor Barvitius, whose sister he married in 1856.[4] By 1874 he had designed a number of buildings in Prague.


Design style

In Ullmann's early work we see echoes of medieval stylistic elements (see the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague 8 - Karlín). In the next phase of his work, he was significantly influenced by the Viennese renaissance school.
