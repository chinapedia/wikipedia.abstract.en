Damara_Gaob.jpg'' (king) of the Damara people, in 2016]] TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP OF NAMIBIA is a governing structure in Namibia based on the ethnicity of the indigenous people of the territory. Acceptance of a traditional authority is vested in the Government of Namibia. There are 51 recognised traditional authorities and a further 40 pending applications.[1]

Traditional authorities cover the entire Namibian territory. Their leaders are entrusted with the allocation of communal land and the formulation of the traditional group's customary laws. They also take over minor judicial work. Leaders and their administrative staff are not paid by the state. Instead the traditional group's members are expected to sustain their leadership. Government did, however, give one car each to the recognised authorities, and awards allowances for fuel and administrative work. The parallel existence of traditional authorities and the Namibian government in Namibia is controversial.[2]
