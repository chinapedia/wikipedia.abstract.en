_KUCHIKAMIZAKE_ (口噛み酒, " "mouth-chewed sake") is a kind of rice-based alcohol produced by a process involving human saliva as a fermentation starter. Kuchikamizake was one of the earlist types of sake. Kuchi means "mouth", kami means "chew" and zake is the rendaku form of "sake". "Kuchikami no sake" is a synonym.


Description

Kuchikamizake has an opaque, whitish colour and tastes quite sour. It is made when someone, ideally a virginal girl,[1][2] chews cooked rice and then spits the resulting liquid into a container. The resulting mixture is then left to ferment, with the enzymes from the chewer's saliva breaking down the carbohydrates in the rice to produce the alcohol. It can achieve roughly 7% ABV after 2 weeks of fermentation process.[3]

Prior to the eighth century, perhaps the most widely made rice wine was _hitoyozake_ (一夜酒) or so-called overnight sake. This was made by allowing cooked rice or rice gruel to ferment naturally.[4]

Some islands in Okinawa Prefecture still held religious rituals involving chewed sake until the 1930s.[5][6]

Kuchikamizake is not considered the origin of nihonshu because of the differences of their times introduced to Japan, brewing methods and cultures.[7][8]
