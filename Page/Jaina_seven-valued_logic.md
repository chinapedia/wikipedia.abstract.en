JAINA SEVEN-VALUED LOGIC is system of argumentation developed by Jaina philosophers and thinkers to support and substantiate their theory of pluralism. This argumentation system has seven distinct semantic predicates which may be thought of as seven different truth values. Traditionally, in the Jaina and other Indian literature dealing with topics in Jain philosophy, this system of argumentation is referred to as _Saptabhangivada_ or _Syadvada_. The earliest reference to _Syadvada_ occurs is the writings of Bhadrabahu (c. 433–357 BCE). There is mention of _Syadvada_ in the _Nyayavatara_ of Siddhasens Divakara (about 480–550 CE). Samantabhadra (about 600 CE) gave a full exposition of the seven parts of _Syadvada_ or _Saptabhanginyaya_ in his _Aptamimamsa_. The _Syadvadamanjari_ of Mallisena (1292 CE) is a separate treatise on the same theory. There are, of course, still later works and a large number of modern commentaries.[1] The interpretation of Saptabhangivada as a seven-valued logic was attempted by Harvard University philosophy professor George Bosworth Burch (1902–1973) in a paper published in International Philosophical Quarterly in the year 1964.[2] P. C. Mahalanobis, an Indian applied statistician, has given a probabilistic interpretation of the _Saptabhangivada_.[3][4]


The seven predicates

The _Saptabhangivada_, the seven predicate theory may be summarized as follows:[5]

The seven predicate theory consists in the use of seven claims about sentences, each preceded by "arguably" or "conditionally" (syat), concerning a single object and its particular properties, composed of assertions and denials, either simultaneously or successively, and without contradiction. These seven claims are the following.

1.  Arguably, it (that is, some object) exists (_syad asty eva_).
2.  Arguably, it does not exist (_syan nasty eva_).
3.  Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist (_syad asty eva syan nasty eva_).
4.  Arguably, it is non-assertible (_syad avaktavyam eva_).
5.  Arguably, it exists; arguably, it is non-assertible (_syad asty eva syad avaktavyam eva_).
6.  Arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably, it is non-assertible (_syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva_).
7.  Arguably, it exists; arguably, it doesn't exist; arguably it is non-assertible (_syad asty eva syan nasty eva syad avaktavyam eva_).

There are three basic truth values, namely, true (t), false (f) and unassertible (u). These are combined to produce four more truth values, namely, tf, tu, fu, and tfu(Three-valued logic). Though, superficially, it appears that there are only three distinct truth values a deeper analysis of the Jaina system reveals that the seven truth values are indeed distinct. This is a consequence of the conditionalising operator "arguably" denoted in Sanskrit by the word _syat_. This Sanskrit word has the literal meaning of "perhaps it is", and it is used to mean "from a certain standpoint" or "within a particular philosophical perspective".

In this discussion the term "standpoint" has been used in a technical sense. Consider a situation in which a globally inconsistent set of propositions, the totality of philosophical discourse, is divided into sub-sets, each of which is internally consistent. Any proposition might be supported by others from within the same sub-set. At the same time, the negation of that proposition might occur in a distinct, though possibly overlapping subset, and be supported by other propositions within it. Each such consistent sub-set of a globally inconsistent discourse, is what the Jainas call a "standpoint" (naya). A standpoint corresponds to a particular philosophical perspective.[6]

In this terminology, it can be seen that the seven predicates get translated to the following seven possibilities. Each proposition _p_ has the following seven states:[7]

1.  _p_ is a member of every standpoint in _S_.
2.  Not-_p_ is a member of every standpoint in _S_.
3.  _p_ is a member of some standpoints, and Not-_p_ is a member of the rest.
4.  _p_ is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral.
5.  Not-_p_ is a member of some standpoints, the rest being neutral.
6.  _p_ is neutral with respect to every standpoint.
7.  _p_ is a member of some standpoints and Not-_p_ is a member of some other standpoints, and the rest are neutral.
