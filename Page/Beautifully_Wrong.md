"BEAUTIFULLY WRONG - THE LOST SONGS" is the third studio album by Australian band Bachelor Girl. The album was recorded between 2002 and 2003 but remained unreleased until 2011.

Doko explained "_Beautifully Wrong_ was the third album that was supposed to come out in 2003, but never got released." The album was nearly finished when their record company at the time, BMG, merged globally with Sony Music. In the corporate shakeout many artists' recording contracts were dissolved including Bachelor Girl's. [1] The band amicably split in 2004 and reformed in 2011.[2]

The album was only available for purchase during their _Loved and Lost_ reunion tour across Australia in May and June 2011. Sony Music Australia released the album digitally only in August 2011. [3]
