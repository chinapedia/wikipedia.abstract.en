Red Hat has become associated to a large extent with its enterprise operating system Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With the acquisition of open-source enterprise middleware vendor JBoss, Red Hat also offers Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), an enterprise virtualization product. Red Hat provides storage, operating system platforms, middleware, applications, management products, and support, training, and consulting services.

Red Hat creates, maintains, and contributes to many free software projects. It has acquired several proprietary software product codebases through corporate mergers and acquisitions and has released such software under open-source licenses. , Red Hat is the second largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel version 4.14 after Intel.[3]

On October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion.[4][5][6] The acquisition closed on July 9, 2019.[7]


History

In 1993, Bob Young incorporated the ACC Corporation, a catalog business that sold Linux and Unix software accessories. In 1994, Marc Ewing created his own Linux distribution, which he named Red Hat Linux[8] (Ewing had worn a red Cornell University lacrosse hat, given to him by his grandfather, while attending Carnegie Mellon University[9][10][11]). Ewing released the software in October, and it became known as the Halloween release. Young bought Ewing's business in 1995, and the two merged to become Red Hat Software, with Young serving as chief executive officer (CEO).

Red Hat went public on August 11, 1999, achieving the eighth-biggest first-day gain in the history of Wall Street.[12] Matthew Szulik succeeded Bob Young as CEO in December of that year.[13] Bob Young went on to found the online print on demand and self-publishing company, Lulu in 2002.

On November 15, 1999, Red Hat acquired Cygnus Solutions. Cygnus provided commercial support for free software and housed maintainers of GNU software products such as the GNU Debugger and GNU Binutils. One of the founders of Cygnus, Michael Tiemann, became the chief technical officer of Red Hat and the vice president of open-source affairs. Later Red Hat acquired WireSpeed, C2Net and Hell's Kitchen Systems.[14]

In February 2000, _InfoWorld_ awarded Red Hat its fourth consecutive "Operating System Product of the Year" award for Red Hat Linux 6.1.[15] Red Hat acquired Planning Technologies, Inc in 2001 and AOL's iPlanet directory and certificate-server software in 2004.

Red Hat moved its headquarters from Durham to North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh, North Carolina in February 2002. In the following month Red Hat introduced Red Hat Linux Advanced Server,[16][17] later renamed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Dell,[18] IBM,[19] HP[20] and Oracle Corporation[21] announced their support of the platform.[22]

In December 2005, _CIO Insight_ magazine conducted its annual "Vendor Value Survey", in which Red Hat ranked #1 in value for the second year in a row.[23] Red Hat stock became part of the NASDAQ-100 on December 19, 2005.

Red Hat acquired open-source middleware provider JBoss on June 5, 2006, and JBoss became a division of Red Hat. On September 18, 2006, Red Hat released the Red Hat Application Stack, which integrated the JBoss technology and which was certified by other well-known software vendors.[24][25] On December 12, 2006, Red Hat stock moved from trading on NASDAQ (RHAT) to the New York Stock Exchange (RHT). In 2007 Red Hat acquired MetaMatrix and made an agreement with Exadel to distribute its software.

On March 15, 2007, Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and in June acquired Mobicents. On March 13, 2008, Red Hat acquired Amentra, a provider of systems integration services for service-oriented architecture, business process management, systems development and enterprise data services.

On July 27, 2009, Red Hat replaced CIT Group in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index, a diversified index of 500 leading companies of the U.S. economy.[26][27] This was reported as a major milestone for Linux.[28][29]

On December 15, 2009, it was reported that Red Hat will pay to settle a class action lawsuit related to the restatement of financial results from July 2004. The suit had been pending in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Red Hat reached the proposed settlement agreement and recorded a one-time charge of for the quarter that ended Nov. 30.[30]

On January 10, 2011, Red Hat announced that it would expand its headquarters in two phases, adding 540 employees to the Raleigh operation, and investing over . The state of North Carolina is offering up to in incentives. The second phase involves "expansion into new technologies such as software visualization and technology cloud offerings".[31]

On August 25, 2011, Red Hat announced it would move about 600 employees from the N.C. State Centennial Campus to Two Progress Plaza downtown.[32] A ribbon cutting ceremony was held June 24, 2013, in the re-branded Red Hat Headquarters.[33]

In 2012, Red Hat became the first one-billion dollar open-source company, reaching in annual revenue during its fiscal year.[34] Red Hat passed the $2 billion benchmark in 2015. the company's annual revenue was nearly $3 billion.[35]

On October 16, 2015, Red Hat announced its acquisition of IT automation startup Ansible, rumored for an estimated $100 million USD.[36]

In May 2018, Red Hat acquired CoreOS.[37]

Acquisition by IBM

On October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire Red Hat for US$34 billion, in one of its largest-ever acquisitions. The company will operate out of IBM's Hybrid Cloud division.[38][39]

Six months later, on May 3, 2019, the US Department of Justice concluded its review of IBM's proposed Red Hat acquisition,[40] and according to Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols "essentially approved the IBM/Red Hat deal".[41] The acquisition was closed on July 9, 2019.[42]


Fedora Project

Fedora_logo_and_wordmark.svg

Red Hat sponsors the Fedora Project, a community-supported free software project that aims to promote the rapid progress of free and open-source software and content. Fedora aims for rapid innovation using open processes and public forums.[43]

The Fedora Project Board, which comprises community leaders and representatives of Red Hat, leads the project and steers the direction of the project and of Fedora, the Linux distribution it develops. Red Hat employees work with the code alongside community members, and many innovations within the Fedora Project make their way into new releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.


Business model

Red Hat operates on a professional open-source business model based on open-source software, development within a community, professional quality assurance, and subscription-based customer support. They produce open-source code so that more programmers can make adaptations and improvements.

Red Hat sells subscriptions for the support, training, and integration services that help customers in using their open-source software products. Customers pay one set price for unlimited access to services such as Red Hat Network and up to 24/7 support.[44]

In September 2014, however, CEO Jim Whitehurst announced that Red Hat was "in the midst of a major shift from client-server to cloud-mobile".[45]

Rich Bynum, a member of Red Hat's legal team, attributes Linux's success and rapid development partially to open-source business models, including Red Hat's.[46]


Programs and projects

One Laptop per Child

Red Hat engineers worked with the One Laptop per Child initiative (a non-profit organization established by members of the MIT Media Lab) to design and produce an inexpensive laptop and try to provide every child in the world with access to open communication, open knowledge, and open learning. The XO-4 laptop, the machine of this project, runs a slimmed-down version of Fedora 17 as its operating system.

GNOME

Red Hat is the largest contributor to the GNOME desktop environment. It has several employees working full-time on Evolution, the official personal information manager for GNOME.

Dogtail

Dogtail, an open-source automated graphical user interface (GUI) test framework initially developed by Red Hat, consists of free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is written in Python. It allows developers to build and test their applications. Red Hat announced the release of Dogtail at the 2006 Red Hat Summit.[47][48]

MRG

Red Hat MRG is a clustering product intended for integrated high-performance computing (HPC). The acronym MRG stands for "Messaging Realtime Grid".

Red Hat Enterprise MRG replaces the Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL, a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, kernel in order to provide extra support for real-time computing, together with middleware support for message brokerage and scheduling workload to local or remote virtual machines, grid computing, and cloud computing.[49]

, Red Hat works with the Condor High-Throughput Computing System community and also provides support for the software.[50]

The Tuna performance-monitoring tool runs in the MRG environment.[51]

Opensource.com

Red Hat produces the online publication Opensource.com. The site highlights ways open-source principles apply in domains other than software development. The site tracks the application of open-source philosophy to business, education, government, law, health, and life.

The company originally produced a newsletter called Under the Brim. Wide Open magazine first appeared in March 2004, as a means for Red Hat to share technical content with subscribers on a regular basis. The Under the Brim newsletter and Wide Open magazine merged in November 2004, to become _Red Hat Magazine_. In January 2010, _Red Hat Magazine_ became Opensource.com.[52]

Red Hat Exchange

In 2007, Red Hat announced that it had reached an agreement with some free software and open-source (FOSS) companies that allowed it to make a distribution portal called Red Hat Exchange, reselling FOSS software with the original branding intact.[53][54] However, by 2010, Red Hat had abandoned the Exchange program to focus their efforts more on their Open Source Channel Alliance which began in April 2009.[55]

Red Hat Subscription Management

Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)[56] combines content delivery with subscription management.[57]

OpenShift

Red Hat operates OpenShift, a cloud computing platform as a service, supporting applications written in Node.js, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaEE and more.[58]

On July 31, 2018, Red Hat announced the release of Istio 1.0, a microservices management program used in tandem with the Kubernetes platform. The software purports to provide "traffic management, service identity and security, policy enforcement and telemetry" services in order to streamline Kubernetes use under the various Fedora-based operating systems. Red Hat's Brian Redbeard Harring described Istio as "aiming to be a control plane, similar to the Kubernetes control plane, for configuring a series of proxy servers that get injected between application components".[59]

OpenStack

Red Hat markets a version of OpenStack which helps manage a data center in the manner of cloud computing.[60]

CloudForms

Red Hat CloudForms provides management of virtual machines, instances and containers based on VMware vSphere, Red Hat Virtualization, Microsoft Hyper-V, OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift. CloudForms is based on the ManageIQ project that Red Hat open sourced. Code in ManageIQ is from the over acquisition of ManageIQ in 2012.[61][62]

LibreOffice

Red Hat contributes, with several software developers, to work on LibreOffice, a free and open-source office suite.[63]

Other FOSS projects

Red Hat has some employees working full-time on other free and open-source software projects that are not Red Hat products, such as two full-time employees working on the free software _radeon_ (David Airlie and Jerome Glisse[64]) and one full-time employee working on the free software _nouveau_ graphic drivers.[65] Another such project is AeroGear, an open-source project that brings security and development expertise to cross-platform enterprise mobile development.

Red Hat also organises "Open Source Day" events[66] where multiple partners show their open-source technologies.[67]

Utilities and tools

Subscribers have access to:

-   Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)[68] – performance analysis and development tools

-   Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) [69]

Over and above Red Hat's major products and acquisitions, Red Hat programmers have produced software programming-tools and utilities to supplement standard Unix and Linux software. Some of these Red Hat "products" have found their way from specifically Red Hat operating environments via open-source channels to a wider community. Such utilities include:

-   Disk Druid – for disk partitioning[70]
-   rpm – for package management
-   sos (son of <code>sysreport</code>) – tools for collecting information on system hardware and configuration.

-   -   sosreport – reports system hardware and configuration details[71]

-   NetworkManager

The Red Hat website lists the organization's major involvements in free and open-source software projects.[74]

Community projects under the aegis of Red Hat include:

-   the Pulp application for software repository management.


Subsidiaries

Red Hat India

In 2000, Red Hat created the subsidiary RED HAT INDIA to deliver Red Hat software, support, and services to Indian customers.[75] Colin Tenwick, vice president and general manager of Red Hat EMEA said Red Hat India was opened "in response to the rapid adoption of Red Hat Linux in the subcontinent. Demand for open-source solutions from the Indian markets is rising and Red Hat wants to play a major role in this region."[76] Red Hat India has worked with local companies to enable adoption of open-source technology in both government[77] and education.[78]

In 2006, Red Hat India had a distribution network of more than 70 channel partners spanning 27 cities across India.[79] Red Hat India's channel partners included MarkCraft Solutions, Ashtech Infotech Pvt Ltd, Efensys Technologies, Embee Software, Allied Digital Services, and Softcell Technologies. Distributors include Integra Micro Systems[80] and Ingram Micro.
