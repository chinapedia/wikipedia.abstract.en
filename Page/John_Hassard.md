JOHN HASSARD (born 1953 Manchester, UK) is a British social scientist specialising in organization theory. He is known for conducting a ‘multiple paradigm’ (multiple theory and method) case study investigation in organizational research.[1]


Education and honorary degree

Hassard received PhD in Organizational Behaviour from Aston University (1985). His thesis was '' Multiple paradigms and organisational research: an analysis of work behaviour in the fire service'' (1985).[2] His postgraduate studies were sponsored by the Social Science Research Council.[3] For research in organization theory, he was awarded an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Science) by Oulu University, Finland.[4] In 2017 he was awarded a higher doctorate (Doctor of Letters) by the University of Manchester for research and publication in business and management.


Career

Hassard was Visiting Fellow in Management Learning at Cambridge University and taught at the London Business School. He was head of the School of Management at Keele University and taught at the Cardiff University Business School.[5] He is currently Professor of Organizational Analysis at the Manchester Business School, University of Manchester.[6][7] Hassard conducted the seminar, "Managing the Past: The Role of Organisational Archives", at the Aston Business School in 2015.[8]

Hassard was an equities trader on the Northern Stock Exchange before pursuing a career in organizational analysis.[9]


Research

Hassard's main research is in organisation theory and change. For the former, he researches critical and philosophical approaches to organisational analysis, notably contributing to debates on paradigms, labour processes, time, actor networks and post-modernism. For the latter, his work concerns management and organizational development in the manufacturing firm. This work often takes an international dimension, as with studies of enterprise restructuring in the Chinese state-owned steel industry and management reform in Japan, U.K. and U.S.A.[10]

To fund these and other research investigations Hassard has received significant funding from the British Council, Economic and Social Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry, and the United Nations.[11]

Hassard received the 2012 "Article of the Year" award from the journal Human Relations for a study of the Hawthorne Investigations (1924-1932).[12] He co-founded the Manchester Ethnography Network.[13]

John Hassard has published 20 books and more than 100 articles in refereed journals like the _Academy of Management Review_, _British Journal of Industrial Relations_, _Human Relations_, _Industrial Relations_, _Journal of Management Studies_ and _Organization Studies_.[14][15]
