Reaction

Korey Coleman of Double Toasted.com gave the movie a "Fuck You (the site's lowest rating)", for its incomprehensible plot, cheap set design, horrible sex scenes, DVD bargain bin-like quality, and the fact that is it a sad rip-off of 50 Shades of Grey, a series that he also hates. Coleman then proceeded to call this movie so bad that it is "an insult to Tyler Perry, and 50 Shades of Grey." Lastly he criticise the ending of the movie as a cheap way of building up a sequel.[6]

Movie Nation gave Kinky a 1 star out of five, comparing it to 50 Shade of Grey, but for Black people. They said the movie has "Bad acting by pretty people, chilly sex scenes acted out in mail order S&M wear, laughable dialogue and money money everywhere. What is this, “Fifty Shades of Ebony?”"[7]
