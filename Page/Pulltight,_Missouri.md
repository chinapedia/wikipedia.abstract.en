PULLTIGHT is an unincorporated community in Mississippi County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

Pulltight originally developed around the site of a mill.[2] According to tradition, the community was so named because the roads were often impassible, requiring locals to "pull tight" their wagons.[3]
