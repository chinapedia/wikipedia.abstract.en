DICK ROGERS (1912â€”1970) was a singer, comedian, songwriter and pianist, who wrote the lyrics for "Harlem Nocturne".[1][2][3] He was a member of the Ray Noble orchestra and the Will Osborne band.[4]

Rogers was associated with Will Osborne, a "star crooner" who was on the radio in the 1930s.[5] Osborne's band was on the decline in 1940.[6] Osborne created a "bus and truck vaudeville show", with comedy acts, which did not do well.[7] Dick was hired on as "Stinky" Rogers, doing a singing comedy act.[8] When Osborne moved to Hollywood in 1940, Rogers took over the band.[9] He did well, according to _Billboard Magazine_, who said he "acquitted himself credibly, as did his orchestra."[10] The magazine called him capable, saying he could sing, compose, play and lead.[11]
