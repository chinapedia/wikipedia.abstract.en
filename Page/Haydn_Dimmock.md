FREDERICK HAYDN DIMMOCK MBE (15 December 1895 to 26 April 1955[1]) was a British Scouting and science fiction magazine editor, children's author and supporter of the Boy Scouts Association.[2]


Early life

Haydn Dimmock was born in Luton in Bedfordshire and began his education at Enfield, which was then in Middlesex.[3] Dimmock's first encounter with Scouting came in 1909, when a schoolmaster gave him a copy of an early edition of _The Scout_, which he was told was better than "the trash which I so very often have to confiscate".[4] Dimmock was immediately enthralled, and finding that there was no local Scout troop, started his own patrol. Shortly afterwards, his parents moved to Musselburgh where there was a Scout troop, but later they returned to Enfield.[5] There, Dimmock joined the 5th Enfield Scouts in 1911;[6] he edited the troop's magazine which was so successful that it led to an introduction to Percy Everett, later the Deputy Chief Scout and the editor-in-chief at C. Arthur Pearson, Ltd., the publisher of _The Scout_. Dimmock was taken on at Pearson's in the post of "office boy".[7]


_The Scout_

Dimmock served with the British Army during the First World War and was wounded.[8] On his return from military service he became the editor of the magazine _The Scout_, a position he would hold for 35 years.[9] During his time with the magazine, Dimmock initiated a number of ventures to promote both the magazine and Scouting in general like running a daily Scout newspaper at the 3rd World Scout Jamboree,[10] persuading Ralph Reader to produce his Gang Shows in a West End theatre, organising Scout "Train Cruises" around the United Kingdom, introducing the soap box derby from America, and devising "Bob-a-Job Week", an annual fundraising campaign in which Scouts did small jobs in the community in return for a donation of a shilling or "bob" (equal to 5 new pence).[11] In 1940, publication of _The Scout_ was taken over by the Boy Scouts Association and Dimmock became a member of the Imperial Headquarters staff. In the following year, he was appointed to the additional role of Acting Publicity Secretary.[12]


Science fiction

The first British science fiction magazine was launched in 1934, when Pearson's launched _Scoops_, a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market. Soon Dimmock, _Scoops_' editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to kill the magazine. The failure of _Scoops_ gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication.[13]


Other work

Dimmock penned a total of sixteen popular junior Scout novels,[14] including 'Hazard Hike' and 'Scout Family Robinson',[15] three adventure novels about the Mounties,[16] together with a number of Scout instructional handbooks and an autobiography. He wrote and directed a documentary film about the Scout Movement, _Knights of Freedom_, which was released in 1947.[17]

Dimmock was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire "for services to the Boy Scouts Association" in the 1951 New Year Honours.[18] He died on 26 April 1955, only a year after his retirement.[19] His obituary in the May 1955 edition of _The Scouter_ was written by Lord Rowallan, the Chief Scout, who paid tribute to Dimmock's skill as an orator, artist and innovator, and concluded: "...thank God for that life, short by modern standards but so rich in achievement. Goodbye, Dim, and thank you".[20]
