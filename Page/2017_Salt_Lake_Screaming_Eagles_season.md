The 2017 SALT LAKE SCREAMING EAGLES SEASON was the team's first season as a professional indoor football franchise; they are an expansion team of the Indoor Football League. The Screaming Eagles were one of ten teams that competed in the IFL for the 2017 season, the Screaming Eagles are members of the Intense Conference. The Screaming Eagles played their home games at the Maverik Center in West Valley City, Utah.


Season events

The team was announced in April 2016 by a group called Project FANchise with the intent on creating an entirely fan operated indoor football team.[1] The project announced that fans would vote on every aspect of the team including the name of the team, signing players, and calling plays. On June 6, the name of the team was announced as the Screaming Eagles after the 101st Airborne Division.[2] The name was picked over the more controversial choices of "Teamy McTeamface," "Sandtroopers,"[3] and "Stormin' Mormons."[4] William McCarthy was voted in as the first head coach in franchise history.

The team lost their opening game before going on to win first game the next week by defeating the Colorado Crush 42–41 on February 26. On March 1, the team then fired head coach William McCarthy due to philosophical differences after only two games.[5] Director of operations Ray Austin was named the interim head coach for the bye week.[6] On March 6, the Screaming Eagles announced former Utah State Aggies quarterback Matthew Sauk as the new head coach without a fan vote.
