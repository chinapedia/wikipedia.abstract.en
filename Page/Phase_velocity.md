in groups of gravity waves on the surface of deep water. The red square moves with the phase velocity, and the       green circles propagate with the group velocity. In this deep-water case, _the phase velocity is twice the group velocity_. The red square overtakes two green circles when moving from the left to the right of the figure. New waves seem to emerge at the back of a wave group, grow in amplitude until they are at the center of the group, and vanish at the wave group front. For surface gravity waves, the water particle velocities are much smaller than the phase velocity, in most cases.]]

The PHASE VELOCITY of a wave is the rate at which the phase of the wave propagates in space. This is the velocity at which the phase of any one frequency component of the wave travels. For such a component, any given phase of the wave (for example, the crest) will appear to travel at the phase velocity. The phase velocity is given in terms of the wavelength (lambda) and time period as

$$v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\lambda}{T}.$$

Equivalently, in terms of the wave's angular frequency , which specifies angular change per unit of time, and wavenumber (or angular wave number) , which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency and the linear speed (speed of propagation) ν,

$$v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k}.$$

To understand where this equation comes from, consider a basic sine wave, . After time , the source has produced ft_}} oscillations. After the same time, the initial wave front has propagated away from the source through space to the distance to fit the same number of oscillations,  _ωt''}}.

Thus the propagation velocity _v_ is  _x_/_t_ {{=}} _ω_/_k_}}. The wave propagates faster when higher frequency oscillations are distributed less densely in space.[1] Formally,  _kx_−_ωt_}} is the phase. Since  −d_Φ_/d_t_}} and  +d_Φ_/d_x_}}, the wave velocity is  d_x_/d_t_ {{=}} _ω_/_k_}}.


Relation to group velocity, refractive index and transmission speed

Since a pure sine wave cannot convey any information, some change in amplitude or frequency, known as modulation, is required. By combining two sines with slightly different frequencies and wavelengths,

cos [(_k_ − _Δ__k_)_x_ − (_ω_ − _Δ__ω_)_t_] + cos [(_k_ + _Δ__k_)_x_ − (_ω_ + _Δ__ω_)_t_] = 2 cos (_Δ__k__x_ − _Δ__ω__t_) cos (_k__x_ − _ω__t_),
the amplitude becomes a sinusoid with _phase_ speed . It is this modulation that represents the signal content. Since each amplitude _envelope_ contains a group of internal waves, this speed is usually called the group velocity, _v__(g).[2]

In a given medium, the frequency is some function of the wave number, so in general, the phase velocity  _ω_/_k_}} and the group velocity  d_ω_/d_k_}} depend on the frequency and on the medium. The ratio between the speed of light c and the phase velocity _v__(p) is known as the refractive index,  _c_/_v_(p)_ {{=}} _ck_/_ω_}}.

Taking the derivative of  _ck_/_n_}} with respect to , yields the group velocity,

$$\frac{\text{d}\omega}{\text{d}k} = \frac{c}{n} - \frac{ck}{n^2}\cdot\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}k}~.$$
Noting that  _v_(p)_}}, indicates that the group speed is equal to the phase speed only when the refractive index is a constant 0}}, and in this case the phase speed and group speed are independent of frequency, d_ω_/d_k_{{=}}_c_/_n_}}.[3]

Otherwise, both the phase velocity and the group velocity vary with frequency, and the medium is called dispersive; the relation _ω_(_k_)}} is known as the dispersion relation of the medium.

The phase velocity of electromagnetic radiation may – under certain circumstances (for example anomalous dispersion) – exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, but this does not indicate any superluminal information or energy transfer. It was theoretically described by physicists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Léon Brillouin. See dispersion for a full discussion of wave velocities.
