History

It is believed that the ancestors of Vafiimai originally came from Mao by hunting a phenomenal 7 branching horn stag. When they reached the present location of Laii, it was dusk and the hunters had to halt there for the night. With no food at hand, they ate the buds of a leafy plant Himalayan knotweed locally called VAVU. Omens were good and 16 delegates from each clan of the 16 Mao villages were sent and a new settlement was set up.


Etymology

The term VAFIIMAI has its origin from the plant Himalayan knotweed which grows in abundant in the region. Literally, VA (Vavu) [Scientifically called Koenigia polystachya] is the name of _the plant_, FII meaning _place_, and MAI means _people_. Hence, _people from the land of Vavu_. The name GAZIPHEMA has the same interpretation as the above in Nagaland. The name LAII which means _God_ in Manipuri was given by a Meitei Ningthou after a failed attempt to raid the village.


Culture and religion

Like any other Naga village, the people of Gaziphema depends mainly on cultivation and livestock-rearing. Because of this labor-intensive cultivation, land is the most important form of property among them to date. However, with the changing times, many has adopted small businesses and other skilled professions. Several educated individuals and families migrated to various metropolitan cities due to government postings, education and corporate jobs leading to a huge diaspora populace.

During the period of headhunting, the menfolks spent the majority of their time in warfare with hostile villages and taking heads. Since 1879, when the British succeeded in annexing the Naga territory, the inter-village feuds have come to an end. With the introduction of Christianity in the region in the early twentieth century, many of them changed their faith to Christianity. Today, 99% of the population follows Christianity. These Christians are of two major denominations: Baptist and Roman Catholic.
