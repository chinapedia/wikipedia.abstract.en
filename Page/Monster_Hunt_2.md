The visual effects were rendered by half a dozen companies and required a multinational effort, Industrial Light & Magic and Whiskytree from the U.S., and China’s BaseFX in Beijing, Original Force in Nanjing, Trouper Visual Effects in Shanghai and CGCG in Taiwan.[10]

Reception

Box office

Buoyed by the groundbreaking success of the first film and its impact on China's cinema, its sequel was highly anticipated by audiences and was already envisioned to be a huge commercial success following the footsteps of its predecessor. Moreover, the film was released during the lucrative Chinese New Year period which aided the sequel in its continued success despite heavy competitions.[16] In its hometown market, the film pre-sold around US$7.8 million tickets for its opening day (which later grew to RMB70.6 million or US$11.3 million fourteen days shy of release[17]), seventeen days ahead of its premiere. By comparison, _Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back_ and _The Mermaid_ hit that mark three and four days prior to their release respectively.[18] At around 7:30 pm (GMT) of its opening day, ticket sales surpassed those of _The Fate of the Furious_ to record the biggest opening day in the Middle Kingdom. On its full opening day, the film earned an estimated RMB545 million (US$85.9 million), setting a new single day box office record and occupying 44% of the market share. It is also the fourth biggest single-day in any territory behind the North American openings of _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ (US$119 million), its sequel, _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_ (US$105 million) and _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2_ (US$91 million).[19][20] Including ticketing fees, the opening was worth RMB603 million (US$95.7 million),[21] while others reported US$97 million.[22] _The Hollywood Reporter_ noted that had there been less to no competition, the film would've broken the all-time opening day record.[23] The film topped the daily box office for two days but was eventually overtaken by _Detective Chinatown 2_ on its third day.[24]

Earning a total of RMB1.14 billion (US$178.7 million) or US$190 million including online ticket surcharges, it broke a new all-time opening weekend in the country, topping _Wolf Warrior 2_{{'}}s previous record,[25] and securing 81% of the weekend total box office.[26] An estimated US$7 million alone came from IMAX showings. The film along with the combined grosses of _Detective Chinatown 2_ (US$154 million), _The Monkey King 3: Kingdom of Women_ (US$79.9 million), _Operation Red Sea_ (US$70.3 million) and _Boonie Bears: The Big Shrink_ (US$40.9 million) amounted to a record breaking RMB3.21 billion (US$506 million) or US$543 million weekend with online ticket sales, which is more than double the feat achieved in 2017 (US$205 million) and 2016 (US$224 million) during the same time period.[27][28] The previous weekend record was set in North America during the weekend of December 18–20, 2017, when the combined grosses of several films resulted in US$306 million led by _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_{{'}}s US$248 million debut.[29][30] Moreover, the combined IMAX earnings of the three films also set a new record with US$15.1 million, led by _Monster Hunt 2_ and _Detective Chinatown 2_ (US$6.7 million).[31]

In the United States and Canada, the film made US$120,000 on its opening day from 70 screens,[32] and US$335,000 over its opening weekend.[33]

The film received an average rating of 8.5 out of 10 by moviegoers on Maoyan.[34] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 9 reviews, and an average rating of 5.2/10.[35]
