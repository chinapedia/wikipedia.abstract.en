The FRENCH DIVISION D'HONNEUR, referred to as simply DIVISION D'HONNEUR, is the common generic name for the highest level football league competitions run by each of the 22 Regional Leagues in France. Together, these league competitions serve as the sixth division of the French football league system, promoting one club per season each into the Championnat de France Amateur 2, subject to certain criteria being met.

The name is also given to the highest level football league competitions in the French overseas territories of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and RÃ©union.

Prior to the formation of a Championnat de France Amateur in 1927, the Division d'Honneur leagues were the highest level of league competition in France, and from 1932 (when Championnat de France Amateur was converted to become the top professional league) until the formation of the National League in 1970 they remained the highest level of amateur football.

Each region administers its own league to its own rules and is free to give their own name to their Division d'Honneur.

Most clubs that participate in the league are amateur, but a small number are semi-professional. The competition is open to qualifying reserve or academy teams of all clubs whose first team participates at a higher level in the league system.
