_DEAD OF NIGHT_ is a 1977 American made-for-television anthology horror film starring Ed Begley Jr., Anjanette Comer, Patrick Macnee, Horst Buchholz and Joan Hackett. Directed by Dan Curtis, the film consists of three stories written by Richard Matheson[1] (although the first segment, "Second Chance", was adapted from a story by Jack Finney[2]) much like the earlier _Trilogy of Terror_. The film originally premiered on NBC on March 29, 1977.
