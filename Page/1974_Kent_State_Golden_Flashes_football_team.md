The 1974 KENT STATE GOLDEN FLASHES FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Kent State University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1974 NCAA Division I football season. In their fourth and final season under head coach Don James, the Golden Flashes compiled a 7–4 record (2–3 against MAC opponents), finished in fourth place in the MAC, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 254 to 161.[1][2]

The team's statistical leaders included Larry Poole with 1,070 rushing yards, Greg Kokal with 1,265 passing yards, and Ken Dooner with 451 receiving yards.[3][4] Six Kent State players were selected as first-team All-MAC players: defensive back Cedric Brown, tight end Ken Dooner, defensive end Marvin Elliott, defensive lineman Larry Faulk, running back Larry Poole, and Henry Waszczuk.[5]

On December 23, 1974, Don James resigned as Kent State's head coach to become the head football coach at the University of Washington. James was credited with turning a "mediocre" Kent State program into a MAC power in four years.[6]
