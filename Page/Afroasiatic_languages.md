AFROASIATIC (AFRO-ASIATIC), also known as _AFRASIAN_ and in older
sources as _HAMITO-SEMITIC'' (_CHAMITO-SEMITIC'')[1] or
_SEMITO-HAMITIC_,[2] is a large language family of about 300 languages
that are spoken predominantly in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of
Africa and parts of the Sahel.[3] Though estimations vary widely, it is
believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around
12,000 to 18,000 years ago, making it the oldest established language
family in the world.

Afroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers, the fourth
largest number of any language family (after Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan
and Niger–Congo).[4] The phylum has six branches: Berber, Chadic,
Cushitic, Egyptian, Omotic and Semitic. By far the most widely spoken
Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is Arabic. A de facto group of
distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch, the languages
that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native speakers,
concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa.[5]

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several
important ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian, which forms a
distinct branch of the family, and Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew and Old
Aramaic, all of which are from the Semitic branch. The original homeland
of the Afroasiatic family, and when the parent language (i.e.
Proto-Afroasiatic) was spoken, are yet to be agreed upon by historical
linguists. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa,
the Eastern Sahara and the Levant.


Etymology

During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the Berber, Cushitic and
Egyptian languages within a "Hamitic" phylum, in acknowledgement of
these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the
Semitic phylum.[6] The terms "Hamitic" and "Semitic" were etymologically
derived from the Book of Genesis, which describes various Biblical
tribes descended from Ham and Shem, two sons of Noah.[7] By the 1860s,
the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had
been worked out.[8]

Friedrich Müller introduced the name "Hamito-Semitic" for the entire
family in his _Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft_ (1876).[9] Maurice
Delafosse (1914) later coined the term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled
"Afro-Asiatic"). However, it did not come into general use until Joseph
Greenberg (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg
sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of
both Africa and Asia.[10]

Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker
1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the
Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term "Afrasian",
meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic
distribution of the family's constituent languages.[11]

The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of
some European countries.


Distribution and branches

Interrelations_between_branches_of_Afro-Asiatic.svg afroasiatic.svg
Scholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including
the following branches:

-   Berber
-   Chadic
-   Cushitic
-   Egyptian
-   Omotic
-   Semitic

Although there is general agreement on these six families, linguists who
study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:

-   The Omotic language branch is the most controversial member of
    Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives to which most
    linguists have given the greatest weight in classifying languages in
    the family "are either absent or distinctly wobbly" (Hayward 1995).
    Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic,
    whereas others have raised doubts about its being part of
    Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).[12]
-   The Afroasiatic identity of Ongota is also broadly questioned, as is
    its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to
    the "mixed" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and
    data. Harold Fleming (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a
    separate branch of Afroasiatic.[13] Bonny Sands (2009) finds the
    proposal by Savà and Tosco (2003) the most convincing: namely that
    Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan substratum.
    In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a
    Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic
    language but retained some characteristics of their earlier
    Nilo-Saharan language.[14]
-   Beja, sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic, is more
    often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of
    internal diversity.
-   Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language
    family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in
    Afroasiatic itself.
-   There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five
    non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see § Subgrouping below). This
    situation is not unusual, even among long-established language
    families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal
    classification of the Indo-European languages, for instance.
-   Meroitic has been proposed (Bruce Trigger, 1964,[15] 1977[16]) as an
    unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the
    phonotactics characteristic of the family, but there is not enough
    evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974,[17]
    1979[18]).


Demographics

Arabic is the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language with over 300
million native speakers. Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages
include:

-   Hausa (Chadic), the dominant language of northern Nigeria and
    southern Niger, spoken as a first language by over 40 million people
    and used as a _lingua franca_ by another 20 million across West
    Africa and the Sahel.[19]
-   Oromo (Cushitic), spoken in Ethiopia and Kenya by around 34 million
    people
-   Amharic (Semitic), spoken in Ethiopia, with over 25 million native
    speakers in addition to millions of other Ethiopians speaking it as
    a second language.[20]
-   Somali (Cushitic), spoken by 16 million people in Somalia, Djibouti,
    eastern Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya.[21]
-   Afar (Cushitic), spoken by around 7.5 million people in Ethiopia,
    Djibouti, and Eritrea.[22]
-   Shilha (Berber), spoken by around 7 million people in Morocco.[23]
-   Tigrinya (Semitic), spoken by around 6.9 million people in Eritrea
    and Ethiopia[24]
-   Kabyle (Berber), spoken by around 5.6 million people in Algeria.[25]
-   Hebrew (Semitic), spoken by around 9 million people (5 million
    native first-language speakers and 4 million second-language
    speakers) in Israel and the Jewish diaspora; also the liturgical
    language of the Jewish people[26] and the Samaritan people.
-   Central Atlas Tamazight (Berber), spoken by around 4.6 million
    people in Morocco.[27]
-   Riffian (Berber), spoken by around 4.2 million people in
    Morocco.[28]
-   Gurage languages (Semitic), a group of languages spoken by more than
    2 million people in Ethiopia.[29]
-   Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (Semitic), a variety of modern Aramaic that is
    spoken by more than 500,000 people in the Assyrian diaspora.[30]


Classification history

In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in
Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he
perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic
through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.[31]

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such
relationships. In 1844, Theodor Benfey suggested a language family
consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter
"Ethiopic"). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship
between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute
and uncertainty.

Friedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in
his _Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft_ ("Outline of Linguistics"), and
defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group
containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.
It was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius (1810–1884) who restricted
Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized
by a grammatical gender system. This "Hamitic language group" was
proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including
the Ancient Egyptian language, the Berber languages, the Cushitic
languages, the Beja language, and the Chadic languages. Unlike Müller,
Lepsius considered that Hausa and Nama were part of the Hamitic group.
These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological
and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of
subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of
their arguments that particular languages should be grouped
together.[32] Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg In 1912, Carl Meinhof
published _Die Sprachen der Hamiten_ ("The Languages of the Hamites"),
in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the Fula, Maasai, Bari,
Nandi, Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model
was widely supported into the 1940s.[33] Meinhof's system of
classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that
"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding
peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from
and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'."[34] However, in the case of
the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages (a concept he introduced), it was
based on the typological feature of gender and a "fallacious theory of
language mixture." Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars
such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which
he would later dub "Nilo-Hamitic" were in fact Nilotic languages, with
numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.[35]

Leo Reinisch (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic,
while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic.
However, his suggestion found little acceptance. Marcel Cohen (1924)
rejected the idea of a distinct "Hamitic" subgroup, and included Hausa
(a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.
Finally, Joseph Greenberg's 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of
"Hamitic" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted
Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social
evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate "Nilo-Hamitic" language
category in particular, Greenberg was "returning to a view widely held a
half century earlier." He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called
Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.[36] He
also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the
new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted
this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book _The Languages of
Africa_ (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to
Hamitic to other language families, notably Nilo-Saharan. Following
Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the Khoekhoe
language as a member of the Khoisan languages, a grouping that has since
proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click
sounds[37]. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe,
though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these
languages consider them to be linguistic isolates.[38][39] Despite this,
Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work of
many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its
extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.[40]

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber,
Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive
(monophyletic) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other
Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense.
Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent
subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.[41]

In 1969, Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as
Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for
it the new name Omotic. This proposal and name have met with widespread
acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have
since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

_Glottolog_ does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic
has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It
therefore splits off the following groups as small families: South
Omotic, Mao, Dizoid, Gonga–Gimojan (North Omotic apart from the
preceding), Ongota, Kujarge.

: Proposed Afroasiatic sub-divisions

Little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches
of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic.
However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph
Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest
first.

Otherwise:

-   Paul Newman (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with
    Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic.
    Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not
    otherwise address the structure of the family.[42]
-   Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or
    "Erythraean", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and
    Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to
    Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed Ongota as a new
    third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two
    major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of
    three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja,
    and Ongota.
-   Like Harold Fleming, Christopher Ehret (1995: 490) divides
    Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides
    Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides
    Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South
    Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and "Boreafrasian."
    According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian,
    Berber, and Semitic.
-   Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and
    Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more
    independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a
    Sprachbund rather than a language family.
-   Igor M. Diakonoff (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping
    Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA),
    and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes
    Omotic from Afroasiatic.
-   Lionel Bender (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together
    as "Macro-Cushitic". He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of
    Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
-   Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of lexicostatistics, groups
    Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against
    Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.


Position among the world's languages

Afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in Africa
identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book _The Languages of Africa_
(1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with
languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle
East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any
other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic
with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known
of these are the following:

-   Hermann Möller (1906) argued for a relation between Semitic and the
    Indo-European languages. This proposal was accepted by a few
    linguists (e.g. Holger Pedersen and Louis Hjelmslev). (For a fuller
    account, see Indo-Semitic languages.) However, the theory has little
    currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of
    grammatical similarities between both families (such as grammatical
    gender, noun-adjective agreement, three-way number distinction, and
    vowel alternation as a means of derivation).
-   Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the
    University of Copenhagen), Holger Pedersen included Hamito-Semitic
    (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed Nostratic
    macro-family (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the
    Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Yukaghir languages, and Dravidian
    languages. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists,
    starting with Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky.
-   Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of
    Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more
    distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping
    instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he
    called Eurasiatic, and to which he added Chukotian, Gilyak, Korean,
    Japanese-Ryukyuan, Eskimo–Aleut, and Ainu.
-   Most recently, Sergei Starostin's school has accepted Eurasiatic as
    a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian
    in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger Borean
    super-family contains Nostratic as well as Dené-Caucasian and
    Austric.


Date of Afroasiatic

Assyriansample.ogg language, a descendant of Old Aramaic]] The earliest
written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian
inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).[43] Symbols on
Gerzean (Naqada II) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to
c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a
minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is
highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and
considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the
date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years
ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to Igor
M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC.
Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was
spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000
BC. These dates are older than those associated with other
proto-languages.


Afroasiatic Urheimat

Expansion_of_Afroasiatic.svg The term Afroasiatic Urheimat (_Urheimat_
meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the hypothetical place
where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic
community, or complex of communities, before this original language
dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages.
Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia, North
Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Their distribution
seems to have been influenced by the Sahara pump operating over the last
10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this
language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the
Levant,[44][45] the Eastern Sahara,[46][47][48][49][50] North Africa and
the Horn of Africa.

H. Ekkehard Wolff proposes that Proto-Afroasiatic arose in the Fertile
Crescent between 15,000 and 9,000 years BC during the Neolithic
revolution, then migrated to Africa around 8,000 BC to develop into the
Egyptian, Chadic, Omotic, Cushitic and Berber branches.[51]

Majority of male lineages of Chadian-speakers came from Europe less than
8700 years ago.[52]

  : Verbal paradigms in several Afroasiatic languages:

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages
include:

-   A set of emphatic consonants, variously realized as glottalized,
    pharyngealized, or implosive.
-   VSO typology with SVO tendencies.
-   A two-gender system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the
    sound /t/.
-   All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a causative affix _s_.
-   Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support
    possessive suffixes.
-   Nisba derivation in _-j_ (earlier Egyptian) or _-ī_ (Semitic)[53]
-   Morphology in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel
    changes or gemination) as well as with prefixes and suffixes.

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic
languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start
of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with
/ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine
/y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and
Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic
languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not
use tones phonemically.

(Semitic branch)]] The following are some examples of Afroasiatic
cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs.

    _Source:_ Christopher Ehret, _Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic_
    (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).

    _Note:_ Ehret does not make use of Berber in his etymologies,
    stating (1995: 12): "the kind of extensive reconstruction of
    proto-Berber lexicon that might help in sorting through alternative
    possible etymologies is not yet available." The Berber cognates here
    are taken from previous version of table in this article and need to
    be completed and referenced.

    _Abbreviations:_ NOm = 'North Omotic', SOm = 'South Omotic'. MSA =
    'Modern South Arabian', PSC = 'Proto-Southern Cushitic', PSom-II =
    'Proto-Somali, stage 2'. masc. = 'masculine', fem. = 'feminine',
    sing. = 'singular', pl. = 'plural'. 1s. = 'first person singular',
    2s. = 'second person singular'.

    _Symbols:_ Following Ehret (1995: 70), a caron ˇ over a vowel
    indicates rising tone, and a circumflex ^ over a vowel indicates
    falling tone. V indicates a vowel of unknown quality. Ɂ indicates a
    glottal stop. * indicates reconstructed forms based on comparison of
    related languages.
