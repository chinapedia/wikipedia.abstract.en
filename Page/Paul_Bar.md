Le_professeur_Bar_en_habit_d'académicien_-_1932.jpg PAUL BAR (5 November 1853, in Paris – 26 November 1945, in Paris) was a French obstetrician.

From 1876 he worked as a hospital interne in Paris, and served as an assistant to Étienne Stéphane Tarnier at the Maternité. In 1887 he obtained his agrégation for obstetrics at the faculty of medicine, and successively worked at the hospitals Tenon, Saint-Louis and Saint-Antoine. In 1907 he succeeded Pierre-Constant Budin as professor of obstetrics to the medical faculty.[1]

He was a co-founder of the _Société d'obstétrique de Paris_. In 1926 he was named president of the Académie de Médecine.[2]

He was involved in all facets of obstetrics, being especially known for his work involving eclampsia, twin pregnancies and craniotomy.[3] An obstetrical implement known as a _pince de Bar_ (an umbilical cord clamp) is named after him.[4][5]

His book _Les méthodes antiseptiques en obstétrique_ was later translated into English and published with the title _The principles of antiseptic methods applied to obstetric practice_ (1887). Other noted works by Bar are:
