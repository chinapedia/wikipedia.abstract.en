The Pakistan cricket team toured New Zealand in January 2018 to play five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.[1][2][3] New Zealand won the ODI series 5-0, their second ever 5-0 bilateral series win, the first being against the West Indies in 2000.[4][5] Pakistan won the T20I series 2–1. It was Pakistan's first T20I series win in New Zealand and as a result, Pakistan moved to the top of the ICC T20I Championship rankings.[6][7]
