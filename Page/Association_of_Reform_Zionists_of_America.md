The ASSOCIATION OF REFORM ZIONISTS OF AMERICA is the Zionist organization of the Reform movement in the United States. It was founded in 1978.[1]


History

ARZA was founded in 1978 after a resolution at the 1977 UAHC 54th General Assembly biennial convention.

ARZA is a member of the American Zionist Movement and, by extension, is part of the World Zionist Organization. In 2015, ARZA sent 56 delegates to the 37th World Zionist Congress after winning 40% of the US vote held by AZM. This was the single largest faction of the US delegation.[2] Between the previous AZM WZC election in 2006 and the 2015 election, ARZA sent 56 delegates to the 2006 35th WZC and to the 2010 36th WZC.
