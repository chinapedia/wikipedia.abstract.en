The participation of LATVIA IN THE TURKVISION SONG CONTEST was expected to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the Turkvision Song Contest 2016. The national broadcaster responsible for the selection process of Latvia's participants has yet to be known. Latvia had selected Oksana Bilera with her song "Yakışıyor bize bu sevgi", as their debut entry. However, the 2016 contest was subsequently cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings.


Origins of the contest

Turkvision is an annual song contest which was created by TÜRKSOY in cooperation with the Turkish music channel TMB TV. Based on the similar format of the Eurovision Song Contest, Turkvision focuses primarily on participating Turkic countries and regions. The participating countries and regions have to take part in the Semi Final. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. An amount of 12 to 15 nations qualify for the Grand Final where the jury determines the winner. TÜRKSOY has stated that televoting is going to be introduced in the future.[1] Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the Turkish Capital of Culture.[2]

Following the cancellation of the Turkvision Song Contest 2016, it was confirmed by the Ministry of Culture and Sports in Kazakhstan, that the 2017 edition would take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, and would coincide with other events taking place in the city as part of Expo 2017.[4] The contest was originally going to be held at the Barys Arena,[5] with the two semi-finals taking place on 8 and 9 September, and the final on 10 September 2017.[6] However, on 27 March 2017, it was announced that the dates and venue had subsequently been changed, with the Saryarka Velodrome as the new venue, and the contest itself taking place on 29 and 31 August 2017.[7]
