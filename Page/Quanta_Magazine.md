The articles in the magazine are freely available to read online.[2] Several publications like _Scientific American_,[3] _Wired_,[4], _The Atlantic_, and _The Washington Post_, as well as international science publications like _Spektrum der Wissenschaft_,[5] have reprinted articles from _Quanta Magazine_. _Undark Magazine_ described _Quanta Magazine_ as "highly regarded for its masterful coverage of complex topics in science and math."[6] The science news aggregator _RealClearScience_ ranked _Quanta Magazine_ No. 1 on its list of "The Top 10 Websites for Science in 2018."[7] Initially launched as _Simons Science News_[8] in October 2012, it was renamed to its current title in July 2013.[9][10] _Quanta_ was founded by the former New York Times journalist Thomas Lin, who is the magazine's first editor-in-chief.[11][12][13] _Quanta's_ two deputy editors are John Rennie (editor) and Michael Moyer, formerly of _Scientific American_. Notable writers include K.C. Cole, Robbert Dijkgraaf, Dan Falk, Kevin Hartnett, Erica Klarreich, George Musser, Jennifer Ouellette, Frank Wilczek, Natalie Wolchover and Carl Zimmer. On 2 May 2017 _Quanta_ launched its redesigned and rebranded magazine website.[14] In November 2018, MIT Press published two collections of _Quanta_ articles, _Alice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire_ and _The Prime Number Conspiracy_.[15][16]
