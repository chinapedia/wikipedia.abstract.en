İSKENDER KEBAP is one of the most well-known dishes of northwestern Turkey. It takes its name from its inventor, İskender Efendi (Master Alexander), who lived in Bursa in the late 19th century Ottoman Empire.

The dish consists of döner kebab prepared from thinly cut grilled lamb topped with hot tomato sauce over pieces of pita bread and generously slathered with melted sheep butter and yogurt. Tomato sauce and melted butter are generally poured over the dish, at the table.

"Kebapçı İskender" is trademarked by the İskenderoğlu family, who still run the restaurant in Bursa.[1][2] This dish is available in many restaurants throughout the country mostly under the name "İskender kebap", "Bursa kebabı", or at times with an alternative one made up by the serving restaurant such as "Uludağ kebabı".
