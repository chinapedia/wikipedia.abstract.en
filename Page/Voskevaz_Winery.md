VOSKEVAZ WINERY ( (_Voskevazi Ginu Gortsaran_)), is one of the oldest enterprises of Armenia for the production of wine. The winery was opened in 1932 in Voskevaz during the Soviet period, to process the grapes of the fertile vineyards in Aragatsotn, at the foothills of Mount Aragats.


History

Voskevaz_wineray.jpg The village of "Voskevaz" (which means the _golden vine_ in Armenian), is located on the edge of the picturesque gorge of Kasagh River. The region has an ancient history of wine-making. Many _karases_ (clay potteries) were found in the nearby church of Surp Hovhannes, dating back to the 7th century.[1]

Voskevaz Winery is located in the Armenian village of Voskevaz. The winery was first established in 1932, but the winery's renaissance began in 2004 when DAVID HOVHANISSYAN, who had run successful businesses in Russia for many years, moved back to Armenia and founded “Voskevaz Wine Cellar, LLC.” [2] At the winery many innovations were put in place, but one very important element would remain the same – the use of 19th century unique karases for the fermentation of wine. The traditional methods for wine fermentation were used on the territory of Armenia from ancient times, the earliest evidence of which are the remains of one of the oldest wineries in the world (about 6,100 years old), found in the caves of Areni, as well as the partially preserved karas wine cellar in the ruins of the Urartian fortress, Teishebaini. Today, all of the Voskevaz wines reflect the true nature of Armenia. The wines are produced only from local grape varieties while high-quality Armenian oak barrels are used for wine aging. Voskevaz Winery has also pioneered the use of the grape withering technology in the production of sweet wines in Armenia.[3]


The Architecture

What makes Voskevaz Winery especially unique is that the experience goes beyond award-winning wines [4] - Voskevaz Winery became a tourist destination even before it was open to the public because word spread quickly that it was a sight to see. In 2012 the founder's brother, GAGO OGANESYAN (a.k.a. Gagik Oganesyan), flew to Yerevan from his home in Los Angeles to build a tourist center incorporating the winery.[5] The idea came about when David and Gago were discussing wine tours for locals and tourists alike. Realizing they wanted this experience to appeal to all of the senses, David had suggested incorporating Gago's paintings into the winery while Gago went a step further suggesting to create a full tourist center, an environment visually based on what he's been painting for years.[6] Gago created a unique world rooted in Armenian visual tradition but also in complete fantasy. He brought to life the imaginary world from his paintings, “The Medieval Series.” [7] Architecturally, this complex that Gago designed is a one man's vision, incorporating his skills as an architect, designer, sculptor and painter into this live fairytale.[8][9] All of the sculptural reliefs in the architectural complex of Voskevaz are done by Gago.

   The youngest brother of the three, Armen Oganesyan, would join next. A renowned jeweler who has been head of production for one of Russia's greatest watchmaking companies and has also participated in numerous exhibitions all over the world with his original works, would now also bring his artistry to Voskevaz.[10] One of the elements quickly noticed by visitors is how no part, such as the uniquely branded lamps or carvings, have been left without a touch of special detailing, much of which is his jewelry designing touch. In the same way that he delicately designs his jewelry, Armen lends that same fine-tuning to the details on many of the special decorative pieces in the winery.[11]

Awards

Voskevaz wines have been awarded multiple medals at various prestigious local and international wine contests such as Mundus Vini Grand International Wine Awards, Decanter World Wine Awards, Sommelier Wine Awards, and so on.[13][14] Voskevaz Winery's new dry red “Voskevaz Karasi Collection, Areni Noir” wine was recently awarded a Gold medal at the Mundus Vini 18th Grand International Wine Awards held in Germany.[15] 5000 different wines from 149 countries were tasted and judged by 160 wine specialists from all over the world. This is the first time in Armenian winemaking history, that a wine, made from autochthonous Armenian grape variety, would win such a prestigious award.[16]
