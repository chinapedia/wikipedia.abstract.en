Personal life

Marriages and family

Gracen married Jon Birmingham in 1982, but they divorced in 1984.

In 1989, while filming _Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat_, she met actor Brendan Hughes, and they married soon after. They divorced in 1994.

Gracen married Adam Murphy, and they have a daughter.

Affair with Bill Clinton

According to Gracen, some time in 1983, she had a one-night stand with future President Bill Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas.[9][10] She was married at the time[11] as was he.

In 1992, rumors swirled that Gracen had conducted an affair with Bill Clinton.[12] At first, Gracen dismissed this claim (as request by Clinton's campaign manager Mickey Kantor);[13] however, in spring 1998 Gracen recanted her six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982.[14] After claiming this, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit, issued a subpoena to have her testify her claim in court.[15] However, Gracen eluded the subpoena[16] and was at one point able to avoid it because _Highlander: The Raven_ was being filmed out of the country.[17] Paula Jones' legal team was also unable to track down Gracen because she had made unscheduled trips to Las Vegas and the Caribbean.[18]
