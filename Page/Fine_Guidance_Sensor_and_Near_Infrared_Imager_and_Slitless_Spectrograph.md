The FGS helps the telescope aim and stay pointed at whatever it is commanded to look at.[10] FGS helps provide data to the JWST Attitude Control System (ACS) and do this it is a big sky coverage and sensitivity, to give a high probability it can find a guide star.[11]

NIRISS is designed for performing:[12]

-   Near-infrared imaging
-   Wide-field slitless spectroscopy
-   Single object slitless spectroscopy
-   Aperture masking interferometry

The aperture masking interfermotry mode uses a seven-hole aperture masking disc, and should allow the detection of exoplanets within certain ranges of light and types of stars.[13]

The Engineering Test Unit of the FGS was delivered to NASA in 2010.[14] The flight units were planned to be delivered later after the ETU, which enabled testing with other JWST hardware.[15] The flight units of FGS/NIRISS were delivered to NASA in August 2012.[16]


FGS

The FGS functionality supports JWST pointing at the desired targets.[17] The FGS is designed to find pre-selected guide stars, which allows the telescope to precisely pointed at the desired target.[18] The actual pointing of the telescope is handled by other segments, especially the systems in the Spacecraft Bus and the fine guidance mirror in the Optical Telescope Element


Tuneable Filter (Canceled)

Previously, the Canadians were working on a tuneable image filter.[19] This device was intended to allow a narrow filter band to be selected (as opposed to a fixed filter band).[20] The TFI was cancelled in 2011 and the work rolled-over into the NIRISS.[21] The TFI would have a selectable filter band between 1.5 – 5 µm.[22]

A developmental version of the TFI was tested in Ontario, Canada in 2010.[23] The chief problem was the time needed to resolve issues with cryogenic operation in time for the JWST launch.[24] The TFI was re-configured to form the basis for the NIRISS instrument that is planned for flight on the space telescope.[25]
