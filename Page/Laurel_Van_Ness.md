She then took out a ring, asked Grado if he wanted to marry her and he said yes, establishing herself as a face for the first time in her TNA career. After Grado found out that Van Ness was Canadian however, he called off the wedding on the September 7 episode of _Impact_. Van Ness began turning heel when she reverted to her psychotic gimmick, which later included going out in the crowd and campaigning for a husband. On November 5, at Bound for Glory, the evil Van Ness attacked Grado during his Monster's Ball match against Abyss, cementing herself as a villainess once again, only to be on the receiving end of Rosemary's mist.

On November 8, which aired on a tape delay on December 14, Van Ness defeated Rosemary in a tournament final for the vacant Impact Knockouts Championship. During that time she also returned to her normal ring gear leaving the wedding dress but continuing with her psychotic gimmick.[7][8] Reportedly, after winning the title, Green asked for her release from Impact Wrestling, but the company turned down to release her with the title. On January 15, 2018, Green was officially granted her release from the promotion after she finished out the television tapings, where she lost the Knockouts championship to Allie.[9]
