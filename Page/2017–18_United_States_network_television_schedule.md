The 2017–18 NETWORK TELEVISION SCHEDULE for the five major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers prime time hours from September 2017 to August 2018. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series canceled after the 2016–17 season.

NBC was the first to announce its fall schedule, on May 14, 2017,[1] followed by Fox on May 15,[2] ABC on May 16,[3] CBS on May 17,[4] and The CW on May 18, 2017.[5] NBC adjusted its schedule on May 30, 2017.[6]

PBS is not included; member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Ion Television and MyNetworkTV are also not included since the majority of both networks' schedules consist of syndicated reruns (with limited original programming on the former). The CW is not included on weekends since it does not carry network programming on those days. However, it will return to programming a two-hour Sunday night schedule next season.

New series are highlighted in BOLD. All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska, and Hawaii-Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.[7]

Notes

-   NBC carried primetime coverage of Notre Dame college football on September 9 and October 21, along with a special _Sunday Night Football_ game on December, a January 2018 NFL Wild Card, the NHL Stadium Series on March 3, the first, second and third round NHL playoff games in April and late May and the 2018 Coke Zero Sugar 400 on July 7, while CBS carried one SEC college football game in November, and the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in late March and Fox carried five Ultimate Fighting Championship fights on December 16, January 27, February 24, April 14 and July 28, and the 2018 Toyota Owners 400 on April 21.[9]
-   NBC's Pacific and Mountain Time Zone affiliates carry new episodes of _Saturday Night Live_ in real time with the rest of the United States, placing its airtime within the prime time period throughout this season (except for the February 3 episode due to the commitments to carry the 7th Annual NFL Honors); a re-air is broadcast after the late local news in those time zones. The network's affiliates in Alaska, Hawaii and other Pacific islands carry the show on delay as usual.
