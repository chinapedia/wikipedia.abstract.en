GRANUAILE'S CASTLE is a tower house and National Monument located in Clare Island, Ireland.[1]


Location

Granuaile's Castle is located on the east coast of Clare Island.[2][3]


History

Granuaile's Castle was built in the 16th century by the Ó Máille (O'Malley), Kings of Umaill. It was a stronghold of Gráinne Ní Mháille (Grace O'Malley, c. 1530 – c. 1603), the famous "pirate queen." Her other strongholds were at Rockfleet Castle (on Clew Bay) and Carrickkildavnet Castle.[4]

In the 1820s the castle was converted into a police barracks, when the purple slate flashing was added to the two bartizans.
