The 2013 CINCINNATI MAYORAL ELECTION took place on November 5, 2013, to elect the Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. The election was officially nonpartisan, with the top two candidates from the September 10 primary advancing to the general election, regardless of party. One of the biggest issues for this election was the proposed streetcar (now known as the Cincinnati Bell Connector) which Cranley opposed and Qualls supported.
