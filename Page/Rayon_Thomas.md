RAYON ST AUBYN THOMAS (born 22 December 1981) is a former Guyanese cricketer who represented Guyana and West Indies B in West Indian domestic cricket. He played as a right-arm fast bowler.

Thomas was born in Suddie, a small town on Guyana's Atlantic coast.[1] He is one of the few players from the Essequibo region to have played for Guyana.[2][3] In 2001, Thomas was selected to tour England with the West Indies under-19 team. He played a single ODI against the England under-19s, taking 3/41 from nine overs (including the wickets of future England internationals Ian Bell and Chris Tremlett).[4]

In April 2002, Thomas was selected for a GCB President's XI against the touring Indians, which was his inaugural first-class appearance. For the 2002–03 Carib Beer Cup, he was included in the squad of West Indies B, an under-23 development side.[5] He finished the season with eleven wickets from six matches, including 4/69 against Guyana and 3/72 against Trinidad and Tobago.[6] Thomas was contracted to Guyana for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, but in four first-class appearances took just two wickets.[7] He never represented for Guyana in limited-overs cricket.[8]
