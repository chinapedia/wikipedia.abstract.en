ROBOX is a non-linear side-scrolling game by Spanish studio Dreambox Games in which the player controls the eponymous robot and explores the depths of the alien planet. The player's progress will regularly be blocked by various obstacles that can be traversed once they discover a certain item or ability. Each time the player acquires a new power, it must be unlocked by solving a puzzle within Robox's body.


Plot

Robox is a space probe sent to a mysterious planet to investigate the disappearance of other probes.


Reception

_Robox_ received mediocre reviews, currently sitting at 50/100 on Metacritic.[1] _Nintendo Life_ gave the game 5/10 and said "Robox is a game with some good ideas that unfortunately arenâ€™t capitalised on nearly enough", concluding that players expecting a straightforward game "will wander aimlessly, bemoaning the lack of a map and swearing intermittently." It also disliked the trial-and-error gameplay, writing that the "constant repetition of quite lengthy bits of gameplay can frustrate after awhile."[2]
