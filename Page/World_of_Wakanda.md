_WORLD OF WAKANDA_ is a comic book title and a spin-off from the Marvel Comics' Black Panther title.[1][2] The series is written by Roxane Gay and poet Yona Harvey, the first two black women to author a series for Marvel.[3] Alitha E. Martinez and Afua Richardson draw the series.


History

After the success of the _Black Panther_ series relaunch in April 2016, written by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Marvel developed a companion piece set in the fictional African country of Wakanda, home to the Black Panther. Coates recommended Gay and Harvey to pen the series. He had seen Gay read a short story about zombies two years earlier that he recalled as "the most surprising, unexpected, coolest zombie story you ever want to see"; Harvey had been his classmate at Howard University and he felt her skills as a poet would lend themselves to the comic-book form, telling _The New York Times_, "That’s just so little space, and you have to speak with so much power. I thought she’d be a natural."[4]

The series debuted November 9, 2016. Harvey wrote a 10-page origin story for Wakanda's revolutionary leader Zenzi, and has said she drew on the example of Winnie Mandela as inspiration.[5] Gay has mentioned the character of Olivia Pope in the first season of _Scandal_ and the original USA version of _La Femme Nikita_ as influences for the series.[6]


Overview

_World of Wakanda_ tells stories of two African women who are also lovers, Ayo and Aneka, and former members of the Dora Milaje, the Black Panther's female security force. It also describes Zenzi, a revolutionary and villain in the _Black Panther_ series.[7]

_Black Panther: World of Wakanda #1_

_Black Panther: World Of Wakanda #1_ is a prequel to Coates's _Black Panther_ series, describing the backstory of women in Wakanda. It stars Aneka and Ayo of the Dora Milaje, and Zenzi, a revolutionary leader in Wakanda. Contrasting _World of Wakanda_ with its _Black Panther_ predecessor, Caitlin Rosberg writes at _The A.V. Club_ that "World Of Wakanda feels more intimate, and all the more powerful for it. It’s deeply invested in the identities of black women both as characters and more importantly as creators, making it clear that these aren’t just background characters in T’Challa’s [Black Panther's] life."[8] Writing for _Inverse_ magazine, Caitlin Busch called the first installment "a tear-jerking love story for the ages, encapsulating all the emotion, romance, tragedy, and fearsome intelligence of Black Panther’s Wakandan civilization."[9]
