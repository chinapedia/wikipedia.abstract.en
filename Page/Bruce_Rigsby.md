BRUCE RIGSBY (born 1937) is an American-Australian anthropologist specializing in the languages and ethnography of native peoples on both continents. He is now professor emeritus at Queensland University, and a member of both the Australian Anthropological Society and the American Anthropological Association.


Career

Bruce Rigsby was born in 1937. He obtained his bachelor's degree at the University of Louisville in international studies, specializing in the area of the Soviet bloc. He then went on to obtain a PhD in anthropology at the University of Oregon, doing fieldwork to gather materials on the Umatilla and Yakima. in 1963. He absorbed the Boasian-Sapir tradition of American ethnolinguistics, combining linguistics and anthropology. His doctoral dissertation was on the southern tribes and languages of the Columbia Plateau. He developed a particular research focus on and specialization in Sahaptin ethnography, Sahaptin language and Nass-Gitksan people, their language and history.

In 1975 he became head of the new department of Anthropology at University of Queensland, and directed his interests towards the languages and tribes of the Eastern Cape York Peninsula, and Princess Charlotte Bay. Rigsby has also been active in defending indigenous claims for native title and represented the Cape York Land Council regarding the Lakefield and Cliff Island National Parks land claims. Notably in his court appearance, when interviewing George Musgrave for his testimony, Rigsby adopted the elder's idiom of Australian English in deference to the Musgrave's age and status. He was adopted into the Lamalama tribe.[1]

Generations of students have been the beneficiaries of what Alice Gaby has called Rigsby's 'phenomenal generosity'. Comments by Peter Sutton and other colleagues on his career are available at a video recording the launching of a festschrift in his honour, available on YouTube.
