Charitable schemes

The hospital ran various charitable schemes such as Rajeev Gandhi Jeevandayee Yojana[3] and Dnyan-Pushpa arogya Yojana.[4]

Dnyan-Pushpa arogya Yojana

Medical facilities in Mumbai are expensive. Dnyan-pushpa yojana was the brainchild of Dr. Vijay D. Patil. Under this scheme poor patients with income less than 1 lakh rupees or those who have an orange ration card use to get free treatment without any delay or requirements of multiple clearances.[5] Under this scheme all eye procedures, natural deliveries and 20 surgical procedures per day were done free of cost. The patient need not be a resident of Mumbai. The patient only needed a ration card and/or Aadhar card. This scheme has benefited patients hailing from many states of India.

Rajeev Gandhi Jeevandayee Yojana

This scheme gives access to Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Above Poverty Line (APL) families (excluding White Card Holders as defined by Civil Supplies Department) to medical care for services requiring hospitalisation for surgery and therapies or consultations by health care providers.[6]

Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana (RGJAY) has been gradually rolled out in Maharashtra state over 3 years. The insurance policy/coverage under the RGJAY is for eligible families from all the 35 districts of Maharashtra.
