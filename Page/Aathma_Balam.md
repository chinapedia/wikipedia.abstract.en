During Kumar's childhood, an unfortunate incident happens in the house and as a result, Rama Rao commits suicide. Kumar witnesses this horrific incident and it impacts him very badly. Because of this, Kumar becomes a psycho. Jagadeeshwari sends her son for treatment under a popular psychiatrist (Gummadi) in a different town. To the society, she tells as if her son is studying in a boarding school. As time passes by, Kumar grows up into a loner with his father's memories and is a peculiar person. He becomes very adamant in getting whatever he yearns for. If he fails to get so, he doesn't hesitate to even kill the opposite person or abuse himself. Kumar has a habit of writing his innermost feelings in a diary. Meanwhile, Jagadeeshwari has a huge factory where an intelligent and handsome young engineer Anand (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) works. Anand falls for a beautiful woman Jaya (B. Saroja) and the story takes a real turn when Kumar arrives in the town. Jagadeeswhari requests Anand to reform Kumar and his attitude. Anand forms a good friendship with Kumar and plans to transform him with the help of Jaya. But Kumar falls for Jaya and lusts for her. When Anand tries to explain Kumar that it is not possible, Kumar tries to even kill Anand. But eventually, he kills himself. The crime falls on Anand and he is given the death sentence by the court.
