Early life and education

Born on May 8, 1964, Khouri lived on the east side of Beirut, where his father worked as a chef.[3] The Lebanese Civil War broke out when he was 11-years-old,[4] but they stayed in Beirut because his family did not have the money to relocate.[5] From a young age, Khouri sold firecrackers, canned food, drinks, and clothing to make pocket money.[6][7] During the raids, he found that there was a food shortage, he started tuna and beef in his neighborhood which he used to buy clothes and later sold them at a profit.[8]

He attended the American University of Beirut (AUB), where he received a BBA in 1986 and a MBA in business and finance in 1988.[9][10] On his way to classes at AUB, he was often in danger due to snipers in the area and he once escaped a kidnapping attempt.[11] While attending the university, Khouri worked at a financial trading company, which dealt with trading currencies, securities and bonds.[12]


Career

Early career

After graduation, Khouri went to Cyprus to work for Lance de Masi at BBDO, an advertising agency that is part of the Omnicom Group.[13] He pursued this job because he found it more interesting than finance,[14] and the move would take him away from the civil war. Also, the banking industry had become unstable due to the global financial crisis of the late 1980s.[15] He travelled frequently for TV commercial shoots to New York, Los Angeles and London[16] for clients like Yves Saint Laurent and Pepsi.[17]

In 1992, Khouri moved to Dubai, where he worked at Impact BBDO in a senior role. He returned to Beirut in 1996 and for the next four years served as the associate managing partner of Impact BBDO.[18]

Omnicom

Khouri returned to Dubai in 2001 and later established OMD (Optimum Media Direction),[19] by unbundling Omnicom's media departments within its full-service agencies.[20] The company develops advertising campaigns for their clients.[21] _Arabian Business_ states that "Khouri ditched a glamorous job in the advertising industry to set up the media agency OMD."[22] This occurred when media was a minor consideration in communication planning. With the wider use of technology, media became an important element in planning advertising campaigns.[23]

Starcom was the leading media agency in the Middle East until 2005, when OMD took the lead. The global roll-out of Omnicom Media Group's other media brand, PHD, by early 2006, saw the addition of an office in Dubai to the existing ones in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.[24] The Omnicom Media Group MENA (Middle East and North Africa), a regional holding company, was established.[25] It reports to the Omnicom Media Group in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which is based in London.[26] In 2006, Khouri moved from his regional managing director role at OMD to assume the leadership of the Omnicom Media Group MENA.

In 2007, Khouri was made regional managing director of Omnicom Media Group[27] and was subsequently appointed as CEO in 2010.

The company had eight offices in six countries; and employed 450 people by 2012.[28] By the following year, it had launched Resolution, which specializes in social and mobile advertising and programmatic buying, which are forms of performance marketing. It uses OMD Predicts and PHD BrainScape to share intellectual property. Omnicom grew more than 30% in 2013 to $2.5 billion.[29]

In 2016, OMG opened a Dubai operation for the holding’s latest agency brand, Hearts & Science, with the Egyptian food company Americana as its first client. In 2018, the group had grown to 24 offices in 16 countries, with some 700 staff.[30] It has actively been investing in data analytics, including technology, software and infrastructure, and data acquisition; content; and programmatic trading. Khouri explained in an interview how the media agency role had moved from buying media cheaply to generating tangible business performance.[31]

Khouri is a regular commentator on industry trends and one of the leading media executives in the Middle East.The group also shares and promotes its intellectual property and thought leadership with its stakeholders, notably by staging events like OMD Predicts and PHD BrainScape.[32]

Workplace strategies

[37] Khouri credits the organization's success to their "team's happiness at work."[38]

Khouri supports improving the rate at which women are employed within the industry and the Middle East. The rate at which women are employed for top positions also varies by country within the region. It is his goal to have an equal number of women and men in senior positions in his organization by 2020.[39]
