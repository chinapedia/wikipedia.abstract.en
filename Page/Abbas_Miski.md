Playing career

The son of Lebanese immigrants to Australia,[3] Miski played his junior rugby league for the Arncliffe Scots and the Kingsgrove Colts. He played S. G. Ball Cup for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, represented Lebanon at under-18 level in 2013,[4] and played for the Parramatta Eels in the National Youth Competition in 2015, scoring 12 tries in 24 matches.[5] Miski joined the North Sydney Bears in the New South Wales Cup in 2016.

After two seasons with Norths, Miski left the club as he was not included in the 2018 Intrust Super Premiership NSW squad.[6]

In 2018, Miski joined The Wentworthville Magpies. On 22 September 2018, Miski scored a try for Wentworthville in their 38-4 victory over St Marys in the Ron Massey Cup grand final.[7]

In 2019, Miski signed for the Blacktown Workers Sea Eagles, the feeder team for the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles after being released by Wentworthville. Miski made an appearance for Manly at Central Coast Stadium against the Sydney Roosters in the Community Cup scoring 3 tries in a trial match.[8]

On 4 May 2019, Miski made his first grade debut on the wing for Manly against Canterbury-Bankstown at Brookvale Oval with Manly winning the game 18-10. Miski was called into the first grade team after winger Jorge Taufua pulled out with an ankle injury.[9]

Representative career

Miski made his debut for Lebanon in their 2014 Hayne/Mannah Cup match against Fiji on 19 October 2014. On 4 August 2017, he was named in Lebanon's 40-man training squad for the 2017 World Cup.[10] Miski played on the wing for Lebanon during the 2017 World Cup playing in all four games. Before the third pool game against Australia, Miski garnered media attention for his almost mirror image look of Australian winger Josh Mansour. In the quarter final against Tonga, Miski scored two tries in Lebanon's narrow loss which ended 24-22.[11][12]
