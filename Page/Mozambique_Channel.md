The MOZAMBIQUE CHANNEL (, , ) is an arm of the Indian Ocean located between the Southeast African countries of Madagascar and Mozambique. The channel is about long and across at its narrowest point, and reaches a depth of about off the coast of Mozambique. A warm current, the Mozambique Current, flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the Agulhas Current off the east coast of South Africa.[1]


Extent

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the limits of the Mozambique Channel as follows:[2]



        _On the North._ A line from the estuary of the River Rovuma () to Ras Habu, the Northern point of Ile Grande Comore, the Northern of the Comore (Comoro) Islands, to Cap d'Ambre (Amber) the Northern extremity of Madagascar ().



        _On the East._ The West coast of Madagascar.



        _On the South._ A line from Cap Sainte-Marie, the Southern extreme of Madagascar to Ponto do Ouro on the mainland ().



        _On the West._ The mainland of South Africa.

Despite being defined as the South African coast by the IHO, the western limit of the channel is more correctly defined as the coast of Southern Africa or, more specifically, of Mozambique.
