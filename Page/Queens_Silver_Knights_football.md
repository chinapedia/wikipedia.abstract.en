The QUEENS SILVER KNIGHTS team was a college football representing Queens College, New York, USA, from 1972 to 1974.


History

The team gained approval in 1970 to begin play, but could not because of lack of funding. A team was approved for 1971, but no games were played. The team was disbanded in 1974 because of "mismanagement" by the head coach, Tony Cruz. [1][2]
