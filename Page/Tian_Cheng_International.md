TIANCHENG INTERNATIONAL AUCTIONEER LIMITED (also known as TIAN CHENG INTERNATIONAL OR TIANCHENG INTERNATIONAL) is a niche auction house that specialises in the sale of Chinese art[1] as well as jadeite.[2][3][4][5] Its headquarters is in Hong Kong, with other offices in Shanghai and Beijing.[6]

Although recently established, Tian Cheng International is considered to be a significant auction house[7][8] given the increase in its market share[9] and high-profile auctions[10][11][12] since its inception. However, between the four auction houses of China Guardian, Christie's, Sotheby's and Tian Cheng International, the latter is considered to be the smallest of the four in terms of overall market share in Asia.[13]


Background and market base

Tian Cheng International was founded in 2011. Its market is focused on classical Chinese paintings as well as contemporary Chinese art and paintings.[14]

In particular, jadeite is a stock luxury item auctioned at Tian Cheng International. For example, Tian Cheng International sold USD$38 million worth of jadeite in its June 2015 jadeite spring sale[15] and was projected to sell USD$45 million worth of jadeite in its June 2013 sale.[16]

Chinese clients account for 50% of Tian Cheng International's client base, with the rest derived from South-East Asia, Taiwan, Singapore, the United States, Russia, and the UK.[17][18]


Notable auctions by Tian Cheng International
