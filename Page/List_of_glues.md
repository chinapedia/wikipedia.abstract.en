    _See ADHESIVE for general discussion of glue._

This is a list of various types of GLUE. Historically, the term "glue" only referred to protein colloids prepared from animal flesh. The meaning has been extended to refer to any fluid adhesive.

There are many adhesive substances that are considered or commonly referred to as "glue".


Animal based adhesives

-   Animal glue, collagen based adhesives are also called:
    -   Bone glue
    -   Fish glue
    -   Hide glue
    -   Hoof glue
-   Albumin glue
-   Casein glue
-   Meat glue (culinary binding agent)


Plant based adhesives

Plant-based glues:

-   Canada balsam (natural resin)
-   pine rosin based (natural resin)
-   Coccoina
-   Gum Arabic (natural resin)
    -   Postage stamp gum
-   Latex (natural rubber)
-   Library paste (a starch-based glue)
-   Methyl cellulose
-   Mucilage
-   Resorcinol resin
-   Starch
-   Urea-formaldehyde resin


Solvent type glues

-   Polystyrene cement/Butanone (Solvent can bond by virtually welding material together)
-   Dichloromethane


Synthetic glues

Synthetic monomer glues

-   Acrylonitrile
-   Cyanoacrylate ("Superglue", "Krazy Glue")
-   Acrylic
-   Resorcinol glue

Synthetic polymer glues

-   Epoxy resins
-   Epoxy putty
-   Ethylene-vinyl acetate (a hot-melt glue)
-   Phenol formaldehyde resin
-   Polyamide
-   Polyester resins
-   Polyethylene (a hot-melt glue)
-   Polypropylene
-   Polysulfides
-   Polyurethane (used in woodworking and bookbinding, e.g. Gorilla Glue)
-   Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) Includes white glue (e.g. Elmer's Glue) and yellow carpenter's glue (Aliphatic resin) (Brands include Titebond and Lepage)
-   Polyvinyl alcohol
-   Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
-   Polyvinyl chloride emulsion (PVCE) - a water-miscible emulsion that polymerizes as it cures
-   Polyvinylpyrrolidone (component of glue sticks)
-   Rubber cement
-   Silicones
-   Silyl modified polymers
-   Styrene acrylic copolymer -e.g. "No More Nails"
