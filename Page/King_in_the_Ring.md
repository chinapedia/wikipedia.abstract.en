KING IN THE RING is a kickboxing tournament that is held in New Zealand. All the events were announced by Lt Dan Hennessey.


Tournament format

King in the Ring is a last man standing eight man tournament that is complete in one night. Seven boxing bouts will be contested in one night, each bout being scheduled for three rounds, each round being three minutes with a minute break in between rounds. If after three rounds a fight is declared a draw, an extra round may be required to determine the winner. Judges will not be encouraged to draw fights but will be accepted in the case of close contests. In the event of a draw after a fourth round, the winner will be decided in consultation with the Referee and fight Supervisor. If an injury occurs to a winning boxer that eliminates him from the competition, he is to be replaced by the most deserving or merit worthy losing boxer from the earlier competition or reserve fight winner as decided by the Supervisor. A random draw out of a hat will be conducted to determine which fighters contest each other in four quarter final matches. There is a maximum knockdown rule, where a boxer can not be knocked down more than 3 times in the night.[1]
