Reception

_Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers_ received negative reviews from several video game critics for mainly being a monotonous and boring beat-'em-up title with a lack of representation of the unique personalities and traits of each playable character.[2] The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the game a simplified rating of 21 out of 100, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews",[3] it is also the lowest-rated Nintendo 3DS game on the website. A reviewer for the _Daily Mirror_ described it as a "glorified browser flash game," and wrote that "Real talent goes into making something this bland out of characters as interesting as these."[4] _PlayStation LifeStyle_ was another publication that wrote it had the feel of a cheaply-made flash game: "Quite frankly, this feels like a Flash or Unity game, that someone decided to greenlight as a full console release."[5]

Some reviewers also criticized the padding of the game's length due to the fact that the player has to replay certain stages just to get a hidden item.[6][7] Jed Whitaker of _Destructoid_ was one of these critics, and was especially harsh towards the treatment of _Steven Universe_ material in the game; he disliked Steven's attack in the game being a bubble, whereas in the original _Steven Universe_, the bubble was only used for protection and not for attacking. He disliked one of the game's hidden items being a map to Beach City, which is where Steven already resides. He also disliked the boss in the levels based on _Steven Universe_ being Frybo instead of other various recurring antagonists from the series.[8]
