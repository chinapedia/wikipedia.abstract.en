KAITE O'REILLY is UK-based playwright, author and dramaturge of Irish descent. She has won multiple awards for her work, including the Ted Hughes Award (2011) for her version of Aeschylus' tragedy _The Persians._[1] O'Reilly's plays have been performed at venues across the UK and at the Edinburgh Festival.[2] Her work has also been shown internationally including in Europe Australia, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.[3] O'Reilly openly identifies as a disabled artist and has spoken of the importance of "identifying socially and politically as disabled" to her work.[4]


Personal life

O'Reilly was brought up in Birmingham, UK, by her parents who were Irish migrants. When she was growing up, her father was a butcher and market trader. She has described her working-class Irish heritage as "formative" in her career as a playwright.[5] She currently lives in Llanarth, Wales.[6] Kaite is sister of television presenter Miriam O'Reilly. Kaite has a visual impairment and a degenerative spinal condition.[7] However, following the social model of disability she feels disabled by attitudes, not her impairments: "I am a woman with a sensory and physical impairment, but it is society's attitudinal and physical barriers which is disabling, not the idiosyncrasies of my body".[8]


Career

Early career (up to 2002)

O'Reilly's first job in theatre was as a performer for Graeae Theatre Company in 1986.[9] In 1994, a piece of her writing appeared in _Mustn't Grumble: An Anthology of Writing by Disabled Women_ (Women's Press).[10] Her first major breakthrough came in 1998 for her play _Yard_ produced for Bush Theatre, London. The play, which addresses themes of conflict, was drafted whilst O'Reilly was working as a relief aid worker in former Yugoslavia.[11] It received critical acclaim, _The Independent_ said the script had "scathing eloquence", _The Daily Mail_ described it as "an astonishing debut" whilst _The DailyTelegraph_ said "O'Reilly is clearly a writer with promise. She has an ear for lyrical dialogue, a strong sense of setting, and a vital humour.”[12][13][14] The play was the joint winner of the Peggy Ramsay Award.[15] The following year, _Yard_ was remounted with a German translation, entitled _Schlachthaus_ that played at Maxim Gorki Theater, Berlin, where it remained in repertoire for nearly two years.[16] In 2000 O'Reilly's _Belonging_ played at Birmingham Repertory Theatre, with _The Guardian's_ Lyn Gardner describing it as "a little play but a really lovely one," awarding it three stars.[17]

Increasing mainstream exposure: from _Peeling_ to _The Almond and the Seahorse (_2002-2008)

O'Reilly's 2002 play _Peeling_ produced with Graeae Theatre Company would prove to be a watershed moment for O'Reilly with it winning plaudits for being "groundbreaking" (_The Scotsman)_ it had two national production runs, and the play text was published by Faber and Faber.[18] Whilst previous works had garnered a positive critical response _Peeling_ was lavished with praise from several major press outlets. _The Guardian_ drew comparisons to Samuel Beckett and called it "a major piece of theatre," awarding it 4 stars.[19] Joyce Macmillan in _The Scotsman_ labelled it a "minor feminist masterpiece" whilst _The Herald_ called it "one of the most entertaining and provocative shows around this year".[20][21] Benedict Nightingale in _The Times_ awarded it 4 stars calling it "a remarkably elaborate, imaginative and hard-hitting piece," whilst _The Daily Telegraph_ described it as "a droll, self-deconstructing piece of theatre that is far too clever to be pigeonholed."[22][23] Reviews praised the piece for its feminist sensibilities and disability politics, with its three characters played by disabled actresses, it highlighted how marginalised disabled people are by society at large. The play was adapted for radio and aired on Radio 3 in October 2003.[24]

Following _Peeling_'s first production in 2002, O'Reilly's _Speaking Stones_ appeared at Theater ASOU in Austria. In April 2004 O'Reilly's play _Perfect_ was shown at Contact Theatre. It won the Manchester Evening News Theatre Award (2004) for Best Play and Best Design.[25] Later that year, _Henhouse_ was produced with Arcola Theatre. Like _Yard_, it was influenced by O'Reilly's time in war-torn Yugoslavia, and covers the topic of civil war.[26] In the same month, O'Reilly's radio-play _Ambushed by Time_, which follows the lives of two couples whose lives have been affected by damaged memory functions, aired on Radio 4's 'The Friday Play'.[27] Between 2006-7 O'Reilly had three more radio-plays aired on the BBC; _Bora Bistrah_ (2007) and _Walkie Talkies_ (2007) aired on Radio 3, whilst _Rean's Girls_ (2006) aired on Radio 4.[28]

O'Reilly's next major staged production came in 2008, in the form of _The Almond and the Seahorse_ originally shown at Sherman Theatre before going on a national tour. The play explores the impact of major brain trauma, from a disability perspective. O'Reilly said she sought to challenge the "usual representations of people who survive brain injury as tragic or as victims". It was well received by the disability-specific press with Disability Arts Online calling it a "brilliant play" that "brings Disability Arts into the mainstream".[29] Other press picked up on this too, Allison Vale in _British Theatre Press_ observed: "O' Reilly passionately believes in the need to stage issues of disability in mainstream theatre. But this play goes far beyond simply providing a platform for the playwright's political agenda: this is a powerful drama, beautifully written, which says as much about the universal themes of life, love, death and devotion as it does about disability."[30] Mainstream newspapers also raved about the production, with _The Guardian_ giving it 5 stars and describing it as an "unmissable drama," whilst _The Stage_ said: "The contrasts of mood and pace in the confrontations are beautifully handled, the sensitive ensemble work is quite superb".[31][32]

Work on Unlimited Festivals and more international exposure: (2008-present)

2010's _Told by the Wind_ which was a collaboration with Phillip Zarrilli and Jo Shapland marked a decidedly experimental turn, where O'Reilly could flex her dramturgical muscles. The show has no dialogue and incorporates elements of dance and post-dramatic aesthetics of East Asia, giving the piece a "meditative" quality.[33] In the same year National Theatre Wales commissioned O'Reilly's site-specific version of Aeschylus' war tragedy _The Persians_. The play was staged in a mock-up village on Ministry of Defence land in rural Wales, where troops train. As well as receiving glowing reviews (5 stars in _The Daily Telegraph_ and 4 stars in _The Guardian_ and _The Times_) it also earned O'Reilly the 2011 Ted Hughes Award for poetry.[34][35][36]

_In Water I'm Weightless_ was an Unlimited commission as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad and featured a cast of six deaf and disabled actors. The piece is experimental in form, with "no plot, narrative or characterisation to speak of" (_The Guardian_) incorporating access elements into the aesthetic such as sign language.[37] Through "cut and paste" monologues, the play directly confronts steroetypes and barriers placed on disabled people, often inverting these; at one point a whole speech is delivered solely in British Sign Language so the majority of the audience won't be able to understand it.[38] It was well received, getting 4 stars in _The Guardian_ and The Arts Desk with the latter describing it as "almost worthy of Shakespaere".[39][40]

2014 saw O'Reilly again working with long-time collaborator Phillip Zarrilli on a 'performance text' dedicated to Frida Kahlo, _The 9 Fridas_ which was translated into Mandarin and performed by Mobius Strip Theatre at the Taipei International Arts Festival, Taiwan. The show is currently being remounted and will be shown again later in 2016 in Hong Kong.[41] In the same year O'Reilly wrote _Woman of Flowers_, a retelling of an ancient Welsh myth from the _Mabinogion._ Disability Arts Online said the script "sparkles with [O'Reilly's] trademark wit and use of evocative language," they also praised the use of integrated access including sign language and surtitles.[42] _The Stage_ were less effusive, awarding it 3 stars: "captivating as this often is, the mythic elements of the play don't always sit easy with the harder, nastier things at the core of this story."[43]

_Cosy_ was O'Reilly's second Unlimited commission which premiered at Wales Millennium Centre in March 2016. The play addresses issues of ageing and end-of-life scenarios, encompassing an integrated cast spanning 3 generations of women in a fictional family.[44] Disability Arts Online concluded: "It’s a play that you carry with you; it’s poignance and linguistic beauty and it’s clever, irreverent and oddly (considering the subject matter) life-affirming message." _Cosy_ along with 4 of O'Reilly's other performance texts appeared in _Atypical Plays for Atypical Actors_, which was published later that year by Oberon Press.[45]


Political activism

Throughout both her life and career, O'Reilly has been an outspoken advocate of rights for disabled people. In 1987, O'Reilly lay down in front of a bus at a demo calling for equal access for disabled people to public transport.[46] She told the British Council in a recent video interview "[in the 1980s] I was very involved in the disability civil rights movement, campaigning for equal access to public buildings, education and opportunities...I am incredibly disappointed at how little has changed."[47] O'Reilly has also been vocally critical of the casting of non-disabled actors in disabled roles ('cripping up') and told Gender Forum (an internet-based academic journal) in 2005 that "cripping up is the twenty-first century's answer to blacking up".[48] It is a position she has reasserted on numerous platforms, along with her 'policy' to "put crips in our scripts".[49][50] As well as speaking out on disability-related issues O'Reilly has also called for greater representation of diversity in theatre and the media, in a 2016 interview, she told _The Stage:_ "Theatre is the site where we gather collectively to explore what it is to be human. We have to have the breadth, depth and diversity of experience, rather than a monoculture or just a segment of society talking to itself."[51]
