JAMES HENRY WIGGIN (May 14, 1836 Boston - November 3, 1900) was a Unitarian minister and editor. He edited editions of _Science and Health_, as well as other of her writings, for Mary Baker Eddy.


Biography

He studied at Tufts College, and graduated in 1861 from Meadville Theological School, becoming a Unitarian minister in 1862. After serving in five pulpits in Massachusetts, in 1875 he moved to New York City where he edited the _Liberal Christian_. By 1876 he was back in Boston, and by 1881 his agnosticism compelled him to leave the ministry. In 1885, he began working as an editor for Mary Baker Eddy, where he continued until 1891 when philosophical differences separated them. Among other tasks during his tenure with Eddy, he worked on two editions (c. 1885 and 1890) of _Science and Health_, a draft of _Retrospection and Introspection_ and informally edited the _Christian Science Journal_ (1887-1889).[1]


Family

In 1864, he married Laura Emma Newman of Brattleboro, Vermont.[2] Their son Albert H. Wiggin was a noted banker.
