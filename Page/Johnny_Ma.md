JOHNNY MA (born MA NAN in Shanghai)[1] is a Chinese-Canadian film director and screenwriter.[2] He is best known for his debut feature film _Old Stone_, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2016. The film won the awards for Best Canadian First Feature Film at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival,[3] and Best First Feature at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017.[4]


Early life

Ma moved from Shanghai to Toronto, Ontario with his family when he was 10 years of age.[5] He attended the University of British Columbia,[6] studying theatre in his first year before switching to commerce at the behest of his parents,[7] and after working in Shanghai and Wenzhou,[8] decided to pursue a degree in film at Columbia University in New York City[9] in 2010.


Career

He made a number of short films before breaking through to wider success with _A Grand Canal_ in 2013.[10] That film, which premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, was named to TIFF's Canada's Top Ten list as one of the ten best Canadian short films of the year,[11] and was a Canadian Screen Award nominee for Best Live Action Short Drama at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards.[12]

His planned first feature film was _Ten Thousand Happiness_, for which he won the Beijing International Screenwriting Competition in 2013 and Telefilm Canada's Pitch This! competition in 2014.[13] After difficulty securing financing for the project, he put it on hold and instead proceeded with _Old Stone_, a script he was developing as his potential second film.[14]

At the 5th Canadian Screen Awards, _Old Stone_ was also a nominee for Best Picture; Ma was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay.[15]
