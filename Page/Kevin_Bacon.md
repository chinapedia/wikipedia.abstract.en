KEVIN NORWOOD BACON[1] (born July 8, 1958)[2] is an American actor and musician. His films include musical-drama film _Footloose_ (1984), the controversial historical conspiracy legal thriller _JFK_ (1991), the legal drama _A Few Good Men_ (1992), the historical docudrama _Apollo 13_ (1995), and the mystery drama _Mystic River_ (2003). Bacon is also known for taking on darker roles such as that of a sadistic guard in _Sleepers_ (1996) and troubled former child abuser in a critically acclaimed performance in _The Woodsman_ (2004). He is equally prolific on television, having starred in the Fox drama series _The Following_ (2013–2015). For the HBO original film _Taking Chance_ (2009), Bacon won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, also receiving a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. _The Guardian_ named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.[3] In 2003, Bacon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry.[4]

Bacon has become associated with the concept of interconnectedness (as in social networks), having been popularized by the game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon". In 2007, he created SixDegrees.org, a charitable foundation.[5]


Early life and education

Bacon, the youngest of six children, was born and raised in a close-knit family in Philadelphia.[6] His mother, Ruth Hilda (née Holmes; 1916–1991), taught at an elementary school and was a liberal activist,[7] while his father, Edmund Norwood Bacon (May 2, 1910 – October 14, 2005), was a well-respected architect and a prominent Philadelphian who was Executive Director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission for many years.[8]

Bacon attended Julia R. Masterman High School for both middle and high school.[9] At age 16, in 1975, Bacon won a full scholarship to and attended the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts at Bucknell University,[10] a state-funded five-week arts program at which he studied theater under Dr. Glory Van Scott. The experience solidified Bacon's passion for the arts.[11][12]


Acting career

Early work

Bacon left home at age 17 to pursue a theater career in New York City, where he appeared in a production at the Circle in the Square Theater School. "I wanted life, man, the real thing", he later recalled to Nancy Mills of _Cosmopolitan_. "The message I got was 'The arts are it. Business is the devil's work. Art and creative expression are next to godliness.' Combine that with an immense ego and you wind up with an actor."[13] Bacon's debut in the fraternity comedy _National Lampoon's Animal House_ (1978) did not lead to the fame he had sought, and Bacon returned to waiting tables and auditioning for small roles in theater.[14] He briefly worked on the television soap operas _Search for Tomorrow_ (1979) and _Guiding Light_ (1980–81) in New York.

1980s

In 1980, he had a prominent role in the slasher film _Friday the 13th_.[15] Some of his early stage work included _Getting Out_, performed at New York's Phoenix Theater, and _Flux_, at Second Stage Theatre during their 1981–1982 season.[16]

In 1982, he won an Obie Award for his role in _Forty Deuce_,[17] and soon afterward he made his Broadway debut in _Slab Boys_, with then-unknowns Sean Penn and Val Kilmer. However, it was not until he portrayed Timothy Fenwick that same year in Barry Levinson's film _Diner_costarring Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Tim Daly, and Ellen Barkinthat he made an indelible impression on film critics and moviegoers alike.[18]

Bolstered by the attention garnered by his performance in _Diner_, Bacon starred in the box-office smash _Footloose_ (1984).[19] Richard Corliss of _TIME_ likened _Footloose_ to the James Dean classic _Rebel Without a Cause_ and the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musicals, commenting that the film includes "motifs on book burning, mid-life crisis, AWOL parents, fatal car crashes, drug enforcement, and Bible Belt vigilantism."[20] To prepare for the role, Bacon enrolled at a high school as a transfer student named "Ren McCormick" and studied teenagers before leaving in the middle of the day.[21][22] Bacon earned strong reviews for _Footloose_,[23] and he appeared on the cover of _People_ magazine soon after its release.

Bacon's critical and box office success led to a period of typecasting in roles similar to the two he portrayed in _Diner_ and _Footloose_, and he had difficulty shaking this on-screen image. For the next several years he chose films that cast him against either type and experienced, by his own estimation, a career slump.

In 1988, he starred in John Hughes' comedy _She's Having a Baby_,[24] and the following year he was in another comedy called _The Big Picture_.[25]

1990s

In 1990, Bacon had two successful roles. He played a character who saved his town from under-the-earth "graboid" monsters in the comedy/horror film _Tremors_,[26] and he portrayed an earnest medical student experimenting with death in Joel Schumacher's _Flatliners_.[27]

In Bacon's next project he starred opposite Elizabeth Perkins in _He Said, She Said_. Despite lukewarm reviews and low audience turnout, _He Said, She Said_ was illuminating for Bacon. Required to play a character with sexist attitudes, he admitted that the role was not that large a stretch for him.[28]

By 1991, Bacon began to give up the idea of playing leading men in big-budget films and to remake himself as a character actor. "The only way I was going to be able to work on 'A' projects with really 'A' directors was if I wasn't the guy who was starring", he confided to _The New York Times_ writer Trip Gabriel. "You can't afford to set up a $40 million movie if you don't have your star."[29] He performed that year as gay prostitute Willie O'Keefe in Oliver Stone's _JFK_[30] and went on to play a prosecuting attorney in the military courtroom drama _A Few Good Men_.[31] Later that year he returned to the theater to play in _Spike Heels_, directed by Michael Greif.[32]

In 1994, Bacon earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role in _The River Wild_,[33] opposite Meryl Streep. He described the film to Chase in _Cosmopolitan_ as a "grueling shoot", in which "every one of us fell out of the boat at one point or another and had to be saved".

His next film, _Murder in the First_, earned him the Broadcast Film Critic's Association Award in 1995,[34] the same year that he starred in the blockbuster hit _Apollo 13_.[35] Bacon played a trademark dark role once again in _Sleepers_ (1996).[36] This part starkly contrasted with his appearance in the lighthearted romantic comedy, _Picture Perfect_ (1997).[37]

Bacon made his debut as a director with the television film _Losing Chase_ (1996), which was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, and won one.[38] Bacon again resurrected his oddball mystique that year as a mentally-challenged houseguest in _Digging to China_[39] and as a disc jockey corrupted by payola in _Telling Lies in America_.[40] As the executive producer of _Wild Things_ (1998), Bacon reserved a supporting role for himself and went on to star in _Stir of Echoes_ (1999), directed by David Koepp.[41]

2000s

KevinBaconTakingChanceFeb09.jpg'' in February 2009]] In 2000, he appeared in Paul Verhoeven's _Hollow Man._[42] Bacon, Colin Firth and Rachel Blanchard depict a ménage à trois in their film, _Where the Truth Lies_.[43] Bacon and director Atom Egoyan have condemned the MPAA ratings board decision to rate the film "NC-17" rather than the preferable "R". Bacon commented: "I don't get it, when I see films (that) are extremely violent, extremely objectionable sometimes in terms of the roles that women play, slide by with an R, no problem, because the people happen to have more of their clothes on."[44]

In 2003 he acted with Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in Clint Eastwood's movie _Mystic River_.

Bacon was again acclaimed for a dark starring role playing an offending pedophile on parole in _The Woodsman_ (2004), for which he was nominated for best actor and received the Independent Spirit Award.[45] He appeared in the HBO Films production of _Taking Chance_, based on an eponymous story written by Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl, an American Desert Storm war veteran.[46] The film premiered on HBO on February 21, 2009. Bacon won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for his role.

2010s

On July 15, 2010, it was confirmed that Bacon would appear in Matthew Vaughn's _X-Men: First Class_.[47] His character was mutant villain Sebastian Shaw.[48]

In March 2012, Bacon was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, _8_ – a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage – as Attorney Charles J. Cooper.[49] The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.[50][51]

From 2013 to 2015, Bacon starred as Ryan Hardy in the FOX television series _The Following_.[52] In 2013, he won a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television for that role.[53]

In 2015, he said in a _Huffington Post_ interview[54] and several magazines reported he would like to return to the _Tremors_ franchise. However, Bacon doesn't appear in _Tremors 5: Bloodline_ (2015).

Advertising work

Beginning in 2012, Bacon has appeared in a major advertising campaign for the EE mobile network in the United Kingdom, based on the Six Degrees concept and his various film roles.[55][56] In 2015, he became a commercial spokesperson for the U.S. egg industry.[57]


Personal life

Bacon has been married to actress Kyra Sedgwick since September 4, 1988; they met on the set of the PBS version of Lanford Wilson's play _Lemon Sky_. He has said: "The time I was hitting what I considered to be bottom was also the time I met my wife, our kids were born, good things were happening. And I was able to keep supporting myself; that always gave me strength."[58] Bacon and Sedgwick have starred together in _Pyrates,_ _Murder in the First_, _The Woodsman_, and _Loverboy_. They have two children, Travis Sedgwick (b. 1989) and Sosie Ruth (b. 1992). The family resides on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.[59] Bacon was previously in a five-year relationship with actress Tracy Pollan, in the 1980s.[60]

Bacon has spoken out for the separation of church and state,[61][62] and told _The Times_ in 2005 that he did not "believe in God."[63] He has also said that he is not anti-religion.[64]

Bacon and Sedgwick appeared in will.i.am's video "It's a New Day", which was released following Barack Obama's 2008 presidential win.

The pair lost part of their savings in the Ponzi scheme of infamous swindler Bernard Madoff.[65][66]

Bacon and Sedgwick learned in 2011, via their appearance on the PBS TV show _Finding Your Roots_ with Henry Louis Gates, that they are ninth cousins, once removed.[67] They also appeared in a video[68] promoting the "Bill of Reproductive Rights", supporting among other things a woman's right to choose and have access to birth control.[69]


Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

Bacon is the subject of the trivia game titled _Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon_, based on the idea that, due to his prolific screen career covering a diverse range of genres, any Hollywood actor can be linked to another in a handful of steps based on their association with Bacon. The name of the game derives from the idea of six degrees of separation. Although he was initially dismayed by the game, the meme stuck, and Bacon eventually embraced it, forming the charitable initiative SixDegrees.org, a social networking site intended to link people and charities to each other.[70]

The measure of proximity to Bacon has been mathematically formalized as the Bacon number and can be referenced at websites including Oracle of Bacon, which is in turn based upon Internet Movie Database data. In 2012, Google added a feature to their search engine, whereby searching for an actor's name followed by the words "Bacon Number" will show the ways in which that actor is connected to Kevin Bacon.[71] This feature is no longer active.

A similar measurement exists in the mathematics community, where one measures how far one is removed from co-writing a mathematical paper with the famous mathematician Paul Erdős. This is done by means of the Erdős number, which is 0 for Paul Erdős himself, 1 for someone who co-wrote an article with him, 2 for someone who co-wrote with someone who co-wrote with him, etc. People have combined the Bacon number and the Erdős number to form the Erdős–Bacon number, which is the sum of the two.[72]


Music

Kevin formed a band called The Bacon Brothers with his brother, Michael. The duo has released six albums.[73]
