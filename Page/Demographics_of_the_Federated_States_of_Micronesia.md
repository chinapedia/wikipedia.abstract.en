This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Federated States of Micronesia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA refers to the population characteristics of people who inhabit the Federated States of Micronesia. The indigenous population of the Federated States of Micronesia, which is predominantly Micronesian, consists of various ethnolinguistic groups. English has become the common language. Population growth remains high at more than 3%, but is ameliorated somewhat by net emigration.

The island of Pingelap is genetically notable for the prevalence of the extreme form of color blindness known as maskun.[1][2][3]
