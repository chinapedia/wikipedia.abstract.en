NEW ZEALAND ENGLISH (NZE) is the variant[1] of the English language spoken and written by most English-speaking New Zealanders. Its language code in ISO and Internet standards is EN-NZ.[2] English is one of New Zealand's three official languages (along with New Zealand Sign Language and the Māori language)[3] and is the first language of the majority of the population.

The English language was established in New Zealand by colonists during the 19th century. It is one of "the newest native-speaker variet[ies] of the English language in existence, a variety which has developed and become distinctive only in the last 150 years".[4] The most distinctive influences on New Zealand English have come from Australian English, English in southern England, Irish English, Scottish English, the prestige Received Pronunciation (RP), and Māori.[5] New Zealand English is most similar to Australian English in pronunciation, with some key differences.[6]


Dictionaries

The first dictionary with entries documenting New Zealand English was probably the _Heinemann New Zealand Dictionary_, published in 1979.[7] Edited by Harry Orsman (1928–2002), it is a 1,337-page book, with information relating to the usage and pronunciation of terms that were widely accepted throughout the English-speaking world, and those peculiar to New Zealand. It includes a one-page list of the approximate date of entry into common parlance of the many terms found in New Zealand English but not elsewhere, such as "haka" (1827), "Boohai" (1920), and "bach" (1905). A second edition was published in 1989 with the cover subtitle "the first dictionary of New Zealand English and New Zealand pronunciation". A third edition, edited by Nelson Wattie, was published as _The Reed Dictionary of New Zealand English_ by Reed Publishing in 2001.[8]

The first dictionary fully dedicated to the New Zealand variety of English was _The New Zealand Dictionary_, published by New House Publishers in 1994 and edited by Elizabeth and Harry Orsman.[9][10] A second edition was published in 1995, edited by Elizabeth Orsman.

In 1997, Oxford University Press produced the Harry Orsman-edited _The Dictionary of New Zealand English: A Dictionary of New Zealandisms on Historical Principles_, a 981-page book which it claimed was based on over 40 years of research. This research started with Orsman's 1951 thesis and continued with his editing this dictionary. To assist with and maintain this work, the New Zealand Dictionary Centre was founded in 1997. It has published several more dictionaries of New Zealand English, including _The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary_, edited by New Zealand lexicographer Tony Deverson in 1998, culminating in the 1,374-page _The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary_ in 2004, by Tony Deverson and Graeme Kennedy.[11] A second, revised edition of _The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary_ was published in 2006,[12] this time using standard lexicographical regional markers to identify the New Zealand content, which were absent from the first edition.

Another authoritative work is the _Collins English Dictionary_ first published in 1979 by HarperCollins, which contains an abundance of well-cited New Zealand words and phrases, drawing from the 650 million word Bank of English, a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers.[13] Although this is a British dictionary of International English there has always been a credited New Zealand advisor for the New Zealand content, namely Professor Ian Gordon from 1979 until 2002 and Professor Elizabeth Gordon[14] from the University of Canterbury since 2003. New Zealand-specific dictionaries compiled from the _Collins English Dictionary_ include the _Collins New Zealand Concise English Dictionary_ (1982), _Collins New Zealand School Dictionary_ (1999) and _Collins New Zealand Paperback Dictionary_ (2009.)

Australia's _Macquarie Dictionary_ was first published in 1981, and has since become the authority on Australian English. It has always included an abundance of New Zealand words and phrases additional to the mutually shared words and phrases of both countries.[15] Every edition has retained a New Zealander as advisor for the New Zealand content, the first being Harry Orsman[16] and the most recent being noted New Zealand lexicographer Laurie Bauer.

A more light-hearted look at English as spoken in New Zealand, _A Personal Kiwi-Yankee Dictionary_, was written by the American-born University of Otago psychology lecturer Louis Leland in 1980. This slim volume lists many of the potentially confusing and/or misleading terms for Americans visiting or emigrating to New Zealand. A second edition was published in 1990.


Historical development

From the 1790s, New Zealand was visited by British, French and American whaling, sealing and trading ships. Their crews traded European goods with the indigenous Māori.[17][18] The first settlers to New Zealand were mainly from Australia, many of them ex-convicts or escaped convicts. Sailors, explorers and traders from Australia and other parts of Europe also settled.

When in 1788 the colony of New South Wales was formed, most of New Zealand was nominally included, but no real legal authority or control was exercised. However, when the New Zealand Company announced in 1839 its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand this and the increased commercial interests of merchants in Sydney and London spurred the British to take stronger action. Captain William Hobson was sent to New Zealand to persuade Māori to cede their sovereignty to the British Crown and on 6 February 1840, Hobson and about forty Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands.[19] From this point onward there was considerable European settlement, primarily from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland; and to a lesser extent the United States, India, China, and various parts of continental Europe. Some 400,000 settlers came from Britain, of whom 300,000 stayed permanently. Most were young people and 250,000 babies were born. New Zealand ceased to be part of New South Wales and became a British colony on 1 July 1841.

Gold discoveries in Otago (1861) and Westland (1865), caused a worldwide gold rush that more than doubled the population from 71,000 in 1859 to 164,000 in 1863. Between 1864 and 1865, under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, 13 ships carrying citizens of England, Ireland and South Africa arrived in New Zealand under the Waikato Immigration Scheme.[20][21] In the 1870s and 1880s, several thousand Chinese men, mostly from Guangdong province, migrated to New Zealand to work on the South Island goldfields. Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the Otago Provincial government they quickly became a target of hostility from settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand thereafter. The European population of New Zealand grew explosively from fewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500,000 by 1881. By 1911 the number of European settlers had reached a million. This colourful history of unofficial and official settlement of peoples from all over Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Asia and the intermingling of the people with the indigenous Māori brought about what would eventually evolve into a "New Zealand accent" and a unique regional English lexicon.

A distinct New Zealand variant of the English language has been recognised since at least 1912, when Frank Arthur Swinnerton described it as a "carefully modulated murmur". From the beginning of the haphazard Australian and European settlements and latter official British migrations, a new dialect began to form by adopting Māori words to describe the different flora and fauna of New Zealand, for which English did not have words of its own.[22]

The New Zealand accent appeared first in towns with mixed populations of immigrants from Australia, England, Ireland, and Scotland. These included the militia towns of the North Island and the gold-mining towns of the South Island. In more homogeneous towns such as those in Otago and Southland, settled mainly by people from Scotland, the New Zealand accent took longer to appear.[23]

Since the latter 20th century New Zealand society has gradually divested itself of its fundamentally British roots[24] and has adopted influences from all over the world, especially in the early 21st century when New Zealand experienced an increase of non-British immigration which has since brought about a more prominent multi-national society. The Internet, television,[25] movies and popular music have all brought international influences into New Zealand society and the New Zealand lexicon. Americanization of New Zealand society and language has subtly and gradually been taking place since World War II and especially since the 1970s,[26] as has happened also in neighbouring Australia.

In February 2018, Clayton Mitchell MP from New Zealand First led a campaign for English to be recognised as an official language in New Zealand.[27][28]

: Variation in New Zealand vowels

Not all New Zealanders have the same accent, as the level of cultivation (i.e. the closeness to Received Pronunciation) of every speaker's accent differs. The phonology in this section is of an educated speaker of New Zealand English, and uses a transcription system designed by specifically to faithfully represent the New Zealand accent. It transcribes some of the vowels differently, whereas the approximant is transcribed with the symbol even in phonemic transcription.


Vocabulary

New Zealand English has a number of dialectal words and phrases. These are mostly informal terms that are more common in casual speech. Numerous loanwords have been taken from the Māori language or from Australian English.

New Zealand adopted decimal currency in 1967 and the metric system in 1974. Despite this, several imperial measures are still widely encountered and usually understood, such as feet and inches for a person's height, pounds and ounces for an infant's birth weight, and in colloquial terms such as referring to drinks in pints.[29][30][31] In the food manufacturing industry in New Zealand both metric and non-metric systems of weight are used and usually understood owing to raw food products being imported from both metric and non-metric countries. However per the December 1976 Weights and Measures Amendment Act, all foodstuffs must be retailed using the metric system.[32] In general, the knowledge of non-metric units is lessening.

The word _spud_ for _potato_, now common throughout the English-speaking world, originated in New Zealand English.[33]

As with Australian English, but in contrast to most other forms of the language, some speakers of New Zealand English use both the terms _bath_ and _bathe_ as verbs, with _bath_ used as a transitive verb (e.g. _I will bath the dog_), and _bathe_ used predominantly, but not exclusively, as an intransitive verb (e.g. _Did you bathe?_).

Both the words _amongst_ and _among_ are used, as in British English. The same is true for two other pairs, _whilst_ and _while_ and _amidst_ and _amid_.

Australian English influences

NZE terms of Australian origin include _bushed_ (lost or bewildered), _chunder_ (to vomit), _drongo_ (a foolish or stupid person), _fossick_ (to search), _jumbuck_ (sheep, from Australian pidgin), _larrikin_ (mischievous person), _Maccas_ (slang for McDonald's food), _maimai_ (a duckshooter's hide; originally a makeshift shelter, from aboriginal _mia-mia_), _paddock_ (field, or meadow), _pom_ or _pommy_ (an Englishman), _skite_ (verb: to boast), _station_ (for a very large farm), _wowser_ (non-drinker of alcohol, or killjoy), and _ute_ (pickup truck).

American English influences

Advancing from its British and Australian English origins, New Zealand English has developed to include many Americanisms and American vocabulary in preference over British terms as well as directly borrowed American vocabulary. Some examples of American words used instead of British words in New Zealand English are _bobby pin_ for British _hair pin_, _muffler_ for the British _silencer_, _truck_ for the British _lorry_, _station wagon_ for the British _estate car_, _stove_ over _cooker_, _creek_[34] over _brook_, _hope chest_ over _bottom drawer_, _eggplant_ instead of _aubergine_, _hardware store_ instead of _ironmonger_, _median strip_ for _central reservation_, _stroller_ for _pushchair_, _pushup_ for _press-up_, _potato chip_ instead of _potato crisp_, _licence plate_ for _registration plate_, _cellphone_ or _cell_ for British and Australian _mobile phone_ and _mobile_, and _ice block_ instead of British _ice lolly_ (or Australian _icy pole_).[35]

Directly borrowed American vocabulary include _the boonies_, _bucks_ (dollars), _bushwhack_ (fell timber), _butt_ (replacing British/Australian _arse_ although _arse_ can still be used), _ding_ (dent), _dude_, _duplex_, _faggot_ and _fag_ (interchangeable with the British _poof_ and _poofter_), _figure_[36] (to think or conclude; consider), _hightail it_, _homeboy_, _hooker_, _lagoon_, _lube_ (oil change), _man_ (in place of _mate_ or _bro_ in direct address), _major_ (to study or qualify in a subject), _to be over_ [some situation] (be fed up), _rig_ (large truck), _sheltered workshop_ (workplace for disabled persons), _spat_[37] (a small argument), _subdivision_, and _tavern_.[38]

New Zealandisms

In addition to word and phrase borrowings from Australian, British and American English, New Zealand has its own unique words and phrases[39] derived entirely in New Zealand. Not considering slang, some of these New Zealandisms are:

-   _heaps_ (adjective, adverb) – abundant, plenty, plentifully. Examples: "There are heaps of cops surrounding the house." "I love you heaps." "Give it heaps!" – Give it your best effort!
-   _hokey pokey_ (noun) – the New Zealand term for honeycomb toffee; also a flavour of ice cream consisting of plain vanilla ice cream with small, solid lumps of honeycomb toffee.[45][46][47][48]
-   _jandals_ (noun) – the NZ term for flip-flops. Originally a trademarked name derived from 'Japanese sandals'.[49]
-   _Kiwi_ (adj) – Not only does Kiwi mean 'a New Zealand person', but it is sometimes used to replace the word New Zealand in NZ businesses or titles, such as KiwiRail, Kiwibank and KiwiBuild, or New Zealand-related nouns, e.g. "Kiwi-ism". It is also used to address something that is particularly related to New Zealand, e.g. "that house is pretty kiwi"

-   _wee_ (adjective) – 1) a short time, a little bit, as in "my chicken was a wee bit overcooked." 2) small, little, as in "he was a wee boy." This is directly from Scottish English and is in common formal use throughout New Zealand whereas in other English speaking countries, apart from Scotland and Northern Ireland, this usage is uncommon or used only informally. It is not part of Australian English, for example. Often used redundantly e.g. "it was a little wee house."
-   _whiteware_ – major kitchen appliances (white goods in UK)

Differences from Australian English

Many of these relate to words used to refer to common items, often based on which major brands become eponyms.

The common Australian general term is white-out.[75] Liquid Paper is also a brand name which is sometimes used as a generic term in Australia or New Zealand. As with other countries (but not Australia) the European brand Tipp-Ex is also available in New Zealand and is sometimes used as a generic term as well.                                                       |

| "Howdy"            | "G'day"                   | Although the greeting "G'day" is as common in New Zealand as it is in Australia, the term "Howdy" can be heard throughout New Zealand[76][77] but not frequently in Australia. This contraction of "how do you do?" is actually of English origin (South English dialect ca. 1860), however is contemporarily associated with Southern American English, particularly Texan where it is a common greeting. It is possible the NZ origin is from the earlier British usage. In present day, Howdy is not commonly used and is generally replaced by "Hello". |

Usage

Some New Zealanders often reply to a question with a statement spoken with a rising intonation at the end. This often has the effect of making their statement sound like another question. There is enough awareness of this that it is seen in exaggerated form in comedy parody of New Zealanders, such as in the 1970s comedy character _Lyn Of Tawa_.[80] This rising intonation can also be heard at the end of statements that are not in response to a question but to which the speaker wishes to add emphasis. High rising terminals are also heard in Australia.

In informal speech, some New Zealanders use the third person feminine _she_ in place of the third person neuter _it_ as the subject of a sentence, especially when the subject is the first word of the sentence. The most common use of this is in the phrase "She'll be right" meaning either "It will be okay" or "It is close enough to what is required". Similar to Australian English are uses such as "she was great car" or "she's a real beauty, this [object]".

Another specific New Zealand usage is the way in which New Zealanders refer to the country's two main islands. They are always (except on maps) referred to as "the North Island" and "the South Island". And because of their size, New Zealanders tend to think of these two islands as being 'places', rather than 'pieces of land', so the preposition "in" (rather than "on") is usually used – for example, "my mother lives in the North Island", "Christchurch is in the South Island". This is true only for the two main islands; for smaller islands, the usual preposition "on" is used – for example, "on Stewart Island" (the third largest), or "on Waiheke Island" (the third most populous).


Māori influence

Many local everyday words have been borrowed from the Māori language, including words for local flora, fauna, place names and the natural environment.

The dominant influence of Māori on New Zealand English is lexical. A 1999 estimate based on the Wellington corpora of written and spoken New Zealand English put the proportion of words of Māori origin at approximately 0.6%, mostly place and personal names.[81]

The everyday use of Māori words, usually colloquial, occurs most prominently among youth, young adults and Māori populations. Examples are _kia ora_ ("hello"), _nau mai_ ("welcome"), and _kai_ ("food").[82]

Māori is ever present and has a significant conceptual influence in the legislature, government, and community agencies (e.g. health and education), where legislation requires that proceedings and documents be translated into Māori (under certain circumstances, and when requested). Political discussion and analysis of issues of sovereignty, environmental management, health, and social well-being thus rely on Māori at least in part. Māori as a spoken language is particularly important wherever community consultation occurs.


Dialects and accents

Recognisable regional variations are slight, with the exception of Southland and the southern part of neighbouring Otago, where the "Southland burr" is heard. This southern area formed a traditional repository of immigration from Scotland (see Dunedin). Several words and phrases common in Scots or Scottish English persist in this area: examples include the use of _wee_ to mean "small", and phrases such as _to do the messages_ meaning "to go shopping". Other Southland features that have been identified and which may also relate to early Scottish settlement are the use of the in a set of words (dance, castle), which is also found in some Australia English regions, and in the maintenance of the /ʍ/ ~ /w/ distinction (e.g. _which_ and _witch_ are not homophonous for such speakers).[83]

Recent research (2012) suggests that postvocalic /r/ is not restricted to Southland, but is found also in the central North Island where there may be a Pasifika influence, but also a possible influence from modern New Zealand hip‐hop music, which has been shown to have high levels of non‐prevocalic /r/ after the vowel.[84]

Taranaki has been said to have a minor regional accent, possibly due to the high number of immigrants from the South-West of England. However, this is becoming less pronounced.[85]

Some Māori have an accent distinct from the general New Zealand accent; and also tend to include Māori words more frequently. Comedian Billy T. James and the bro'Town TV programme were notable for featuring exaggerated versions of this.[86] Linguists recognise this as "Māori English", and describe it as strongly influenced by syllable-timed Māori speech patterns.[87] Linguists count "Pākehā English" as the other main accent, and note that it is beginning to adopt similar rhythms, distinguishing it from other stress-timed English accents.[88]


Spelling

-   Where there is a difference between British and US spelling (such as _cancelling_/_canceling_ and _jewellery_/_jewelry_), the British spelling of double-_L_ is universally used. The British use of single-_L_ is also universally used in words such as _enrol_.
-   New Zealanders use _tyres_, not _tires_, except for trademarks such as Cooper Tires.[89]
-   The Commonwealth spelling of _kerb_ (at roadside) is used over US _curb_.[90]
-   New Zealand spelling of _-re_ words such as _centre_, _mitre_, _litre_, and _theatre_ have always officially followed the British spelling as opposed to American _center_, _miter_, _liter_, and _theater_, although in practice American spellings are often used such as in real estate listings,[91] buy-and-sell websites such as Trade Me,[92] AutoTrader,[93] and others.
-   Words with the _-ce_ suffix such as _defence_ and _pretence_ are usually spelt with _-ce_ as opposed to the American _defense_ and _pretense_.
-   With _-our_ words like _colour_/_color_ or _behaviour_/_behavior_ the spelling of _-our_ is always used[94] unless a Trademark, such as Colorsteel[95] or The Color Run,[96] etc. Foreign official awards such as the FBI Medal Of Valor always retain their US spelling in New Zealand texts. Additionally the online version of _The New Zealand Herald_ newspaper republishes articles with US spelling when the original article is written with US spelling, such as articles from the Associated Press. Since the advent of Word Processors with spell-checkers, in modern assignment writing in New Zealand universities the rule is to use either 100% British spelling or 100% American spelling, the emphasis being consistency.[97]
-   For words ending in _-(e)ment_, the _e_ is always included.
-   New Zealand English retains the distinctions between _program_ ("computer heuristic") and _programme_ ("schedule", "broadcast show"), _disk_ ("information storage device") and _disc_ ("flat circular object"), and _analog_ (as in _analog stick_) and _analogue_ (all other senses) as found in British and often in Australian[98] English.
-   It is usual to form past tenses and past participles of certain verbs with _-t_ and not _-ed_ in New Zealand English. For example, _learn_ becomes _learnt_, _spoil_ becomes _spoilt_, _burn_ becomes _burnt_, _dream_ becomes _dreamt_ , and _lean_ becomes _leant_ . These verb forms are pronounced with a final unvoiced sound, meaning _spoilt_ is pronounced not . This contrasts with American English, where _-ed_ is far more common and is pronounced (e.g. _dwelled_ is an American form of _dwelt_ ). _Learned_, the adjective meaning "wise", is universally spelt thus and pronounced as two syllables (). The past tenses and past participles of _earn_ and _boil_ are _earned_ and _boiled_ respectively, though they may be pronounced ending with a sound.
-   Words with the digraphs _ae_ and _oe_ in British English are usually spelt as such in New Zealand English (e.g. _faeces_ not _feces_) rather than with just _e_ as with American English. There are some exceptions where certain words are becoming universally spelt with _e_ such as _encyclopaedia_, _chamaeleon_, _hyaena_, and _homoeopathy_ which are now spelt _encyclopedia_, _chameleon_, _hyena_, and _homeopathy_ respectively. Coincidentally, this is also occurring in British English in these cases too.
-   In hyperbolic statements, the spellings of _ton_ and _tons_ are commonly used (e.g. _I have tons of friends_ and _I feel tons better_), despite the metric system with its tonne having been introduced in the 1970s.
-   In words that may be spelt with either an _-ise_ or an _-ize_ suffix (such as _organise_/_organize_) New Zealand English, like Australian English, mainly prefers _-ise_. This contrasts with American English, where _-ize_ is generally preferred, and British English, where _-ise_ is also generally preferred but by some, including the Oxford Dictionary, _-ize_ is preferred. In New Zealand it is not wrong to use either spelling.
-   New Zealand favours _fiord_ over _fjord_, unlike most other English-speaking countries. The _fiord_ spelling was the normal one in English until the early 1920s,[99] and is preserved in many place names worldwide. In New Zealand it is used in Fiordland, a rugged region in the south-west.
-   When spelling words borrowed from Māori, New Zealand English can either spell them with macrons or without (e.g. _Maori_ and _Māori_ are both accepted spellings). In informal writing, macrons are not usually kept.
-   New Zealand always uses _jail_ over British and Australian _gaol._[100][101][102]
-   Gram, the unit of mass, is commonly spelt as such and not _gramme_, which is somewhat found in British English. The same holds true for the word's derivates (e.g. _kilogram_ is more common than _kilogramme_).
-   All abbreviations of words where the last letter of the abbreviation corresponds to the last letter of the full-length word are abbreviated without a full stop in New Zealand English. Thus the abbreviation of _Doctor_ is _Dr_ and the abbreviation of _Mister_ is _Mr_ do not have full stops after them, as opposed to _Dr._ and _Mr._ in American English. Initialisms and acronyms such as _USA_ and _NASA_ (or _Nasa_), are also abbreviated without full stops in New Zealand English. This practice has been in place in New Zealand since the late 1970s.

[63] In larger cities in New Zealand _convenience store_ is used due to immigration (and to current NZ law forbidding a dairy from selling alcohol ), though _dairy_ is used commonly in conversation. In New Zealand in the 1950s and 1960s _milk bar_ referred to a soda shop. In some states of Australia "milk bar" is used; other states use "deli". "Deli" is used in New Zealand to refer to a store selling high quality meats.
