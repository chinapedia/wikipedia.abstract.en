HELEN EMILY LOWE (died 21 March 1882 in Torquay) was a British travel writer. Lowe made travels to Scandinavia and southern Europe together with her mother. Her experiences were published in two books: _Unprotected Females in Norway, or the Pleasantest Way of Travelling there, Passing through Denmark and Sweden_. 1857, G. Routledge & Co. and _Unprotected Females in Sicily, Calabria and on the Top of Mount Aetna_. 1859, G. Routledge & Co.

When travelling, Lowe intentionally brought a minimum of luggage. In her first book she writes: “The only use of a gentleman in travelling is to look after the luggage, and we take care to have no luggage.” Lowe appears, sometimes as Emily and sometimes as Helen, in several essays and books on women and travelling in the 19th Century, such as:
