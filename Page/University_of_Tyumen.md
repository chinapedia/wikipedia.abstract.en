History

The development of universal primary education created a desperate need for professional teaching staff, for which reason in 1930 the first Tyumen higher educational institution was founded. Students of the Agricultural and Pedagogical Institute of Tyumen could study agriculture, chemistry, biology and physics.

The second half of 1930s saw the start of academic research. In 1935, an experimental plot was created. Scientific expeditions to the north of the Altai, studies of indigenous northern language and folklore and regional teaching courses for locals took place from 1936-1940.[3]

Everything changed with the start of World War II in July 1941. During its first year, more than a hundred of students, professors and other staff members went to the front. Nevertheless, the Institute continued working. In February 1942, it hosted an academic conference where 20 papers in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, geography, psychology, literature, Russian language and anti-fascism were presented. Among the participants were scientists from Boris Zbarsky’s laboratory, who came to Tyumen as an escort to the mummy of Lenin that was being evacuated from Moscow. The head of the department of natural sciences, Ilya Zbarsky, was a senior research fellow of the laboratory.

In the 1960's, the fast development of West Siberian oil and gas industry influenced the Institute, which focused on finding the most effective ways of oil and gas extraction. On January 1, 1973, by the decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, the Pedagogical Institute became a State University. The first rector of the University was a doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Igor Aleksandrov.[4]

Overview

The UT campus is a unique urban infrastructure. Its territory includes educational classrooms, research and scientific centers, and multiple laboratories. The main territory of the UT campus is conveniently located in the historical part of the city of Tyumen. The student residences are located here as well. Rector of the UT (since 2013) is Valery Falkov, PhD in Law, Associate Professor, Chairman of the Tyumen region’s Council of University Rectors.

The University has more than 100 student associations dedicated to research, information, multicultural, creative, social, and sport activities. The University’s developed infrastructure allows for field trips to Lukashino (Tyumen Oblast), Maksimikha (Republic of Buryatia), Solnyshko (Krasnodar region), Lake Kurchak (Tyumen Oblast), Priobsky proving ground (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug).

Within the Tempus Project and in order to promote a barrier-free learning environment at the University, the International Center of Inclusive Educationhas been established. Equipment for persons with special needs was purchased with grant funds. The engineer of the International Competence Center of Inclusive Education developed the world’s first electronic textbook for blind people – SEEALL.[6] The device enables obtaining writing skills and reading Braille, as well as sending text and audio messages from one module to another.

The development of international activity of the UT is based on cooperation with international partners in research, education, and cultural spheres. Currently, the University has 84 [7] cooperation agreements with international higher education institutions and organizations, seven of which are the world’s leading universities featured in the Top 200 according to the international Times, QS and ARWU rankings. The result of the cooperation is joint events at an international level and implementation of research and educational projects.

The University holds 4 international summer schools:

-   STEP in Russian Energy: Society, Technology, Environment, Policy – educational program for international students. The School contributes to the students’ competence in the field of economy and geography of the Northern territories and basic knowledge of energy and natural resources regulations. One of the School’s emphases is on studying Russian language, culture and history.
-   Western Siberia: Life, History and Culture. The School’s main purpose is teaching participants an anthropological approach to the study of Siberia and the North, as well as modern concepts of anthropology.

Partner of the Program is Gazprom Neft Company.[9] The main distinction and advantage of the Program is direct contacts with Russian and international technology companies and with leading research, design and engineering centers in Russia. The students participate in the implementation of engineering projects for the deposits of Gazprom Neft.

Basic Department of Measurement of Oil and Gas Flow

The basic department is used for educational and research purposes. A unique scientific test bench was created within a joint project of the UT and the HMS Neftemash Enterprise, within the framework of Government Regulations. In the course of the training, UT students participate in active industrial projects for designing and implementing machinery and equipment for the development of oil and gas sites. Knowledge of modern industrial technologies and experience of applied research extends the scope of competence of the graduates.
