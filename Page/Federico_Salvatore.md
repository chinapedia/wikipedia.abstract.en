FEDERICO SALVATORE (born 17 September 1959) is an Italian singer-songwriter and comedian.


Life and career

Born in Naples, Salvatore started his career in the late 1980s as a stand-up comedian and as a singer-songwriter of humorous and satirical songs. After enjoying a local success, he became nationally well-known during the 1990s thanks to the semi-regular participation to the Canale 5 program _Maurizio Costanzo Show_. Produced by Giancarlo Bigazzi, he got a significant success with the albums _Azz..._ and _Il mago di Azz_, which were both certified platinum.[1][2]

In 1996 he entered the main competition at the 46th edition of the Sanremo Music Festival with the song "Sulla porta", the first Sanremo Festival song having homosexuality as main theme.[3][4] In 2001 he entered the Festival di Napoli competition with "Se io fossi San Gennaro", a ballad about Naples which raised large controversities because of his lyrics critical of the social situation of the city.[5]
