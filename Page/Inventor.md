An INVENTOR is a person who creates or discovers a new method, form, device or other useful means that becomes known as an invention. The word _inventor_ comes from the Latin verb _invenire_, _invent-_, to find.[1][2] The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists.[3]
