_TREMBLE_ is a debut extended play by Australian pop singer Nicole Millar. It was released on 5 February 2016. The EP was written between Australia and the USA and sees Millar working with an array of after writers including Alexander Burnett, Dennis Dowlut, Kristy Lee Peters, Louis Schoorl, Loston and Dan Farber.

Millar said she was inspired by The Weeknd, Major Lazer and MØ and upon release, said; “I listen to a lot of R&B and their lyrics are quite full on. I wanted to take the female angle on that and own it. In a lot of pop songs, the girl is always so sad because the boy’s broken their heart. I wanted to make her far more powerful and assertive.”[1]

Millar promoted the EP with 'The Tremble Tour' across Australia throughout March and April.[2]


Critical reception

The Foundry Brisbane said; “Nicole has created an immense hype towards this release after her successful debut single "Wait" was released in late October last year. "Tremble" boasts beats and synths that make the track feel full and compliment the depth of Nicole’s voice. Starting off smooth and ultra sultry, it kicks up the tempo quickly, adding a power and playfulness that sees Nicole take you on a journey from beginning to end.”[3]

AAA Backstage gave the EP 3 out of 5, particularly complementing the tracks "Tremble" and "Cover Me".[4]
