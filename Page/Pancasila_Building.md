PANCASILA BUILDING () is a historic building located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The name Pancasila refers to the speech delivered by Sukarno in the building on which he explained the concept of Pancasila, a philosophical concept which would be the foundation of the Indonesian Nation, on June 1, 1945. Built in the early 1830s, the building is one of the many 19th-century colonial landmarks in Jakarta. The Pancasila Building currently belongs to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It was built in 1830 as a residence for Prince (Hertog) Bernhard van Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792-1862), a German-born Dutch Royal Army Commander.[1] It was designed in a Neoclassical Empire Style on the east bank of the Ciliwung. The adjacent park and street Hertogspark (also called Jalan Pejambon) was named after him.[2]

It received the name _Volksraadgebouw_ or Building of the Volksraad).

With the dissolution of the Volksraad during the Japanese occupation in 1942, the building was re-purposed for the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (Indonesian ''Badan Penyelidik Usaha-usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan '' or _Dokuritsu Zyunbi Tyoosakai_).[3]

After the independence period, in early 1950, the building was transferred to the State Department, and then to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was renamed _Gedung Pancasila_ or Pancasila Building on June 1, 1964. During the 1960s, the building was used to educate prospective diplomats. Today, the building is mainly used for important ceremonies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[4]
