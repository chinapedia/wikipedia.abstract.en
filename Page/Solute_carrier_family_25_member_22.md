SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 25 MEMBER 22 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the _SLC25A22_ gene. This gene encodes a mitochondrial glutamate carrier. Mutations in this gene are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy.[1] Expression of this gene is increased in colorectal tumor cells.[2]


Structure

The _SLC25A22_ gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 11 in position 15.5 and has 9 exons spanning 7,807 base pairs.[3] The gene produces a 34.5 kDa protein composed of 323 amino acids.[4][5][6] The encoded protein is a multi-pass transmembrane protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane.[7][8]


Function

The protein encoded by _SLC25A22_ is involved in the transport of glutamate, cotransported with H+, across the inner mitochondrial membrane.[9][10] Both _SLC25A22_ and _SLC25A18_ are mitochondrial glutamate/H+ symporters.[11]


Clinical significance

Epileptic encephalopathy

Mutations in the _SLC25A22_ gene cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 3 (EIEE3), a severe form of epilepsy characterized by frequent tonic seizures or spasms beginning in infancy with a specific EEG finding of suppression-burst patterns, characterized by high-voltage bursts alternating with almost flat suppression phases. Epileptic encephalopathy early infantile type 3 is characterized by a very early onset, erratic and fragmentary myoclonus, massive myoclonus, partial motor seizures and late tonic spasms. The prognosis is poor, with no effective treatment, and children with the condition either die within 1 to 2 years after birth or survive in a persistent vegetative state.[12][13]

Migrating partial seizures in infancy, caused by a specific G110R mutation in the _SLC25A22_ gene, can be inherited.[14]

Although expression of _SLC25A22_ is high in most tissues, expression is particularly strong in the developing brain, with regions of the brain involved in the genesis and control of myoclonic seizures specifically expressing _SLC25A22_ during human development.[15][16][17][18][19]

Colorectal cancer

_SLC25A22_ expression is increased in colorectal tumor tissues compared to matched nontumor colon tissues. Increased expression of the encoded protein was associated with decreased survival times in colorectal cancer patients. Knockdown of this gene in mutant colorectal cells decreased their migration, proliferation, and invasion.[20]


Interactions

The encoded protein interacts with SLC38A1, NDUFAF4, and 43 other proteins.[21]
