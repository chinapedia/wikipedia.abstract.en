WINGS OF CHANGE is an Austrian aircraft manufacturer based in Fulpmes, founded by Markus Gründhammer. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of paragliders in the form of ready-to-fly aircraft.[1]

By 2003 the company had a range of gliders in their line including the Chinhook Bi two-place tandem, the intermediate Taifun and Twister, plus the performance Tsunami.[2]

Reviewer Noel Bertrand said of the company in a 2003 profile, "Markus Gründhammer still manages to make the safest paragliders without losing anything in performance."[3]

The company's 2011 and later line includes gliders with such names as the Deathblade, Predator and Psychohammer.[4]

Designer Gründhammer said of his Deathblade paraglider, a glider with an aspect ratio of 13.01:1, wing with 113 cells and a top speed of , "finally, a wing that meets my expectations of performance and flying qualities and equally challenges my skills. Some guys need a Ferrari. As for me, I build my own paragliders in order to advance as a test pilot and also on a personal scale. To me, the motivation of finding ever new dimensions and testing out the limits of feasibility means developing mental strength and feeling 'pure life'."[5]

The company also builds the Skyman line of lightweight mountain gliders for activities such as bivouac flying.[6]
