_THE GUERILLA BAND_ is an album by American pianist Hal Galper released on the Mainstream label in 1971.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

The Allmusic review by Jim Todd states "While not one of the classics of the jazz fusion movement of the early '70s, _The Guerilla Band_ does attempt to say something substantial and avoids the genre's commercial pitfalls ... Galper writes long, impressionistic lines that are played over busy, skittering, rhythms â€“ imagine Miles Davis's _In a Silent Way_ merged with a funky, Isley Brothers' track ... this band produces a distinctive brand of jazz fusion that deserves a place in any thorough documentation of the genre's short-lived, peak creative year".[4]
