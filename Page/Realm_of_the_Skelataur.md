_REALM OF THE SKELATAUR_ is the fourteenth studio album by the Christian metal band, Mortification.[1]


Title

Jefferson Guedes Giammelaro wrote "The Mortification has already announced some time ago that it would launch a new CD, and now the band released the name of the work, which will be "Realm Of The Skelator", and is already in pre-production phase.

Steve Rowe says it will be brutal, and have a mixture of styles like Death Metal, Grind, Thrash and Heavy Metal Traditional. Have strong tendencies of CDs _Break The Curse_ 1990 _Scrolls of the Megilloth_ and _EnVision EvAngelene_. Recording will take place between September and October, with the sound engineer Mark McCormack."[2]


Critical reception

Peter John Willboughby reported "It is worth mentioning that the production on here is much better than their previous album and makes a fitting end to the Australian megabeast that is Mortification."[3] Parat Magazine stated "In March MORTFICATION reminded the new album "Realm Of The Skeletaur," which was the reason for Steve to reach out and ask him lots of attractions. Whether his confession what he wants, one must leave: It's a tremendously brave man who fell through hard music. Despite the fact that it is almost paralyzed and plagued him and many other health problems."[4] Matthias Salomon reports "If I had to describe "Realm Of The Skeletaur" with an adjective, it would be "funny". Perhaps it is because Death Metal and Christian world views are not all too well tolerated. Perhaps, however, it is only the compulsive attempt to put prefabricated texts into some melodies. But somehow there is also much cult in this album and in MORTIFICATION. Whoever has been passing through his own thing for so long, may well be a curious addition to the metallic encyclopaedia."[5]
