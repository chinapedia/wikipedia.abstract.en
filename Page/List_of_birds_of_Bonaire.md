This is a LIST OF THE BIRD SPECIES RECORDED IN BONAIRE. The avifauna of Bonaire (an island of the Leeward Antilles in the Caribbean Sea) has 208 confirmed species, of which four have been introduced by humans and 62 are rare or vagrants (including a species introduced elsewhere in the region). None are endemic. An additional four species are hypothetical (see below).

Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society.[1][2] The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC.

The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence.

-   (V) VAGRANT - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Bonaire
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species introduced to Bonaire by human actions
-   (H) HYPOTHETICAL - a species recorded but with "no tangible evidence" according to the SACC
