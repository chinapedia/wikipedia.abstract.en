    _Not to be confused with the Gandhian social movement by the same name._

The LOK SEWAK SANGH ('Union of Servants of the People', abbreviated LSS), or MANBHUM LOK SEWAK SANGH, was a political party in Purulia District, India.[1] LSS was founded in 1948.[2] The party was the main political force in Purulia District from the independence of India until the fall of the second United Front cabinet.[3]


Background

LSS had been set up as a local social movement in Manbhum, by leaders like Nibaranchandra Dasgupta and Bibhuti Dasgupta, who had been released from jail in the early 1930s.[4] LSS was a Gandhian movement working for Swaraj and social reform.[5] They challenged caste hierarchies, preaching to Adivasis and Dalits to participate in social and political life on equal terms with upper caste Hindus.[6] The organization sought to fight against discrimination against lepers.[7]


Foundation

LSS was constituted as a political party by former leaders of the Indian National Congress, who had played a leading role in the Quit India movement in Purulia District.[8][9] Notable members of this group included Bibhuti Dasgupta and Arun Ghosh.[10] Through forming LSS they wanted to promote use of Bengali language in Bengali-dominated areas in southern Bihar state.[11] They labelled the imposition of Hindi language as 'linguistic imperialism'.[12] After breaking with the Indian National Congress its elected officials resigned and were re-elected on LSS tickets.[13]

The party adhered to Gandhian socialism.[14] LSS published _Mukti_ ('Liberation') as its organ.[15] Bibhuti Dasgupta, the general secretary of the party, edited _Mukti_.[16] The publication had been founded during the independence struggle.[17]


1951–1952 elections

The party contested the 1951–1952 parliamentary elections as well as the first assembly elections, being able to defeat Congress candidates in some constituencies.[18] In the election to the Lok Sabha (Lower House of the Parliament of India), LSS won the Manbhum South-cum-Dhalbum constituency, which elected two parliamentarians.[19] The LSS parliamentarians were Bhajahari Mahaton and Chaitan Manjhi.[20] LSS had fielded 4 candidates, won together mustered 309,940 votes (0.29% of the national vote).[21]

In the 1952 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, LSS fielded 12 candidates out of whom 7 were victorious.[22] The LSS elected legislators were Sirish Chandra Banerjee (Baghmundi), Dimo Charmahar (Purulia-cum-Hura), Samarendra Nath Ojha (Purulia-cum-Hura), Nitai Singh Sardar (Manbazar-cum-Patamda), Satya Kinkar Mahata (Manbazar-cum-Patamda), Bhim Chandra Mahato (Barabazar-cum-Chandil) and Atul Chandra Singh Bhuiya (Barabazar cum Chandil).[23] In total the 12 LSS candidates mustered 148,921 votes (1.56% of the statewide vote).[24]


Struggle for inclusion in West Bengal

Ahead of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, LSS organised a movement in 1955 to secure the transfer of Bengali-speaking areas of Bihar into West Bengal.[25] The party organized a march of satyagrahis by foot from Pakbirah village (Manbhum District) to Calcutta, a 480 km walk.[26] The march lasted 16 days, gathering some 1,000 participants.[27] When reaching the vicinity of the West Bengal government headquarters, the march was broken up by police and participants arrested.[28] Some were jailed.[29]

After the reorganisation of the states of India in 1956, most of the areas where LSS was active became part of West Bengal.[30] As of 1956 the leader of the party was Sirish Chandra Banerjee, who became of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1956.[31] In the 1957 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election LSS fielded candidates in all 11 assembly seats in Purulia District.[32]

LSS contested the 1962 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, fielding 11 candidates. LSS obtained 68,583 votes (0.72% of the statewide vote), winning 4 seats.[33]


United Front

Ahead of the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election LSS entered into a seat-sharing agreement with both the People's United Left Front and the United Left Front.[34][35] After the election Bibhuti Dasgupta of LSS was named Minister for Panchayats and Social Welfare in the first United Front government.[36][37]

LSS fielded 6 candidates in the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, winning 4 seats.[38] The party obtained 99,844 (0.74%).[39] After the election LSS politician Bibhuti Dasgupta was named Panchayat Minister in the second United Front cabinet.[40]


After the fall of the United Front

The LSS dominance over Purulia politics was broken after the fall of the United Front.[41] In the 1971 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election LSS fielded 11 candidates, but none was elected.[42] The party obtained 52,980 votes (0.41% of the statewide vote).[43]

The party went into rapid decline.[44] Most of its erstwhile supporters joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist).[45]
