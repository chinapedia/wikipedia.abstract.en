The Voluntary State Police Services in Germany

Depending on the state´s laws in Germany auxiliary police forces are established. The denomination differs between _Voluntary Police Force_ (Freiwilliger Polizeidienst), _Security Watch_ (Sicherheitswacht) or _Security Partner_ (Sicherheitspartner). It is intended to maintain or establish public security and order through the service of assigned territory.

An auxiliary police service exists in Germany in the states of Baden-Württemberg, Brandenburg, Bavaria, Hesse and Saxony under supervision of the responsible state police. The establishment of a voluntary police service is the sole responsibility of the states. While the voluntary police service in Baden-Württemberg was already established in May 1963, Hesse decided to set up in 2000.

Volunteering is often limited to 40 hours per month and without any salary, but the volunteer get some benefits. It is not a profession but a function in the state-social community. In some states, the volunteers in service are legally on the same stage like full-time police officers.


Baden-Württemberg

The _Baden-Württemberg Voluntary Police Service_ was introduced in May 1963. On 31 December 2015, 744 citizens were volunteers. Its tasks include, as a general rule, the safeguarding and monitoring of road traffic, the safeguarding of buildings and installations, the motor vehicle service, the telecommunication service and similar technical services as well as the field service. Since the beginning of 1998, the voluntary police service has also been used in the area of municipal crime prevention.

From 2013 to 2016 the service was in liquidation, after the Green-Red coalition state government, which came into office in March 2011, had resolved its medium-term dissolution. The budget (EUR 2.2 million per year) for the voluntary police service was frozen, the recruitment process was terminated and funds released were reallocated for full-time staff. These measures were heavily criticized by the CDU opposition. The Green-Black government coalition, which came into office in 2016, wants to "create a new basis for the use of police volunteers as part of an overall concept for secure public spaces. Until then, the existing voluntary police service will be continued on the current level. "

The training lasts two weeks for basic training as well as a subsequent introductory use and takes place in a police station of the standby police or at the installation services (usually the police officers). Further training takes place individually at the respective departments (for example, districts) and collected in further training courses.

The members of the voluntary police service have the position of a police officer in the sense of the police network in Baden-Württemberg. This means that they can carry out all police measures such as security, police seizures, searches. Furthermore, they are also entitled to the exercise of the police force, including direct constraint.

They are subject to the principle of legality (prosecution) without being an investigator of the public prosecutor's office.

They carry the same police uniform with the same sleeve badge as the full-time police officers and carry essentially the same equipment, such as handcuffs, an irritant sprayer and a BOS radio. However, the now outdated Walther P5 is still run as a service weapon. On the other hand, the full-time members of the police carry the modern HK P2000. Signs of obligatory green or blue bars are provided as a grade of service sign according to the duration of the membership (one bar per five years of service). As a general rule, they carry out their duties with a full-time police officer and are entitled to carry service vehicles, for example patrol cars.


Bavaria

The _Bavarian Security Watch_ is subordinated to the Bavarian police but does not belong to it. The security watch law came into force on 31 December 1996, after a three-year pilot trial in Nuremberg, Ingolstadt and Deggendorf had proved successful. In addition to the power of the so-called "citizen's" arrest, members of the security watch have the right to interrogate persons, to question them, and to determine their personal data, should this be necessary for a crime (identity determination). In addition, they can provide space references. However, their actions can not be enforced with direct compulsion.

The ideals of the security watch are removed from terms such as the auxiliary police and the civil defense, since it was formed to prevent uncontrolled mergers. It offers citizens the opportunity to actively support the Bavarian police without working as a police officer.

The security watch is mainly used in areas where there is a risk of crime but is not so high that police officers must be on the spot all the time. It mainly works in larger residences, public facilities and facilities in which the vandalism rate is high.

As a rule, members of the security watch are on foot or by bicycle and can reach the next police station in case of suspicious or dangerous incidents. They are equipped with an irritant spraying device (CS-gas), among others.

The persons are in civilian clothes on the beat and bear on the left breast a security guard passport with photo as well as an additional light green armband with the Bavarian state coat of arms and the retroreflective inscription "Sicherheitswacht" or a dark blue blouson with retroreflektierenderderschrift and the Bavarian state coat of arms.

Meanwhile, the security watch can be used at 118 locations, In Munich, Straubing, Nuremberg, Neumarkt, Bayreuth, Regensburg, Ingolstadt, Deggendorf, Gunzburg, Amberg, Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Schwandorf, Cham and Weiden. Since 2010 the establishment of a security watch has been possible in municipalities with less than 20,000 inhabitants.


Brandenburg

In Brandenburg there were established about 200 security partners along the Polish border as well as around Berlin. The legal basis is a decree of the Minister of the Interior of 11 October 1995. In contrast to the voluntary police services in the other states, in Brandenburg there is no training at all and the service is carried out unarmed. The security partners only receive a deed of the state, a jacket with the inscription _Sicherheitspartner_ and 25, - EUR per month. Furthermore, the security partners should not intervene, but, if necessary call the police.[1][2]


Hessen
