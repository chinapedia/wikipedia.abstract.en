The INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIP TEST, GRADE III, para-equestrian dressage event at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was contested on 11 September at Olympic Equestrian Centre in Rio.[1]

The competition was assessed by a ground jury composed of five judges placed at locations designated E, H, C, M, and B. Each judge rated the competitors' performances with a percentage score. The five scores from the jury were then averaged to determine a rider's total percentage score.
