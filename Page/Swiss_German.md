SWISS GERMAN (Standard German: _Schweizerdeutsch_, ,[2] and others) is any of the Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in some Alpine communities in Northern Italy bordering Switzerland. Occasionally, the Alemannic dialects spoken in other countries are grouped together with Swiss German as well, especially the dialects of Liechtenstein and Austrian Vorarlberg, which are closely associated to Switzerland's.

Linguistically, Swiss German forms no unity. The linguistic division of Alemannic is rather into Low, High and Highest Alemannic, varieties all of which are spoken both inside and outside Switzerland. The only exception within German-speaking Switzerland is the municipality of Samnaun where a Bavarian dialect is spoken. The reason "Swiss German" dialects constitute a special group is their almost unrestricted use as a spoken language in practically all situations of daily life, whereas the use of the Alemannic dialects in other countries is restricted or even endangered.

The dialects of Swiss German must not be confused with Swiss Standard German, the variety of Standard German used in Switzerland. Most people in Germany do not understand Swiss German. Therefore, when an interview with a Swiss German speaker is shown on German television, subtitles are required.[3] Although Swiss German is the native language, from age 6, Swiss school students additionally learn Swiss Standard German at school and are thus capable of understanding, writing and speaking Standard German with varying abilities mainly based on the level of education.


Use

Unlike most regional languages in modern Europe, Swiss German is the spoken everyday language for the majority of all social levels in industrial cities, as well as in the countryside. Using the dialect conveys neither social nor educational inferiority and is done with pride.[4] There are a few settings where speaking Standard German is demanded or polite, e.g., in education (but not during breaks in school lessons, where the teachers will speak in the dialect with students), in multilingual parliaments (the federal parliaments and a few cantonal and municipal ones), in the main news broadcast or in the presence of non-Alemannic speakers. This situation has been called a "medial diglossia", since the spoken language is mainly the dialect, whereas the written language is mainly (the Swiss variety of) Standard German.

In 2014, about 87% of the people living in German-speaking Switzerland were using Swiss German in their everyday lives.[5]

Swiss German is intelligible to speakers of other Alemannic dialects, but largely unintelligible to speakers of Standard German without adequate prior exposure, including for French- or Italian-speaking Swiss who learn Standard German at school. Swiss German speakers on TV or in films are thus usually dubbed or subtitled if shown in Germany.

Dialect rock is a music genre using the language; many Swiss rock bands, however, alternatively rather sing in English.

The Swiss Amish of Adams County, Indiana, and their daughter settlements also use a form of Swiss German.


Variation and distribution

Swiss German is a regional or political umbrella term, not a linguistic unity. For all dialects, there are idioms spoken outside Switzerland that are more closely related to them than some Swiss German dialects. The main linguistic divisions within Swiss German are those of Low, High and Highest Alemannic, and mutual intelligibility across those groups is almost fully seamless, though with some minor exceptions, mainly regarding vocabulary. Low Alemannic is only spoken in the northernmost parts of Switzerland, in Basel and around Lake Constance. High Alemannic is spoken in most of the Swiss Plateau, and is divided in an eastern and a western group. Highest Alemannic is spoken in the Alps.

Each dialect is separable into numerous local subdialects, sometimes down to a resolution of individual villages. Speaking the dialect is an important part of regional, cantonal and national identities. In the more urban areas of the Swiss plateau, regional differences are fading due to increasing mobility, and a growing population of non-Alemannic descent. Despite the varied dialects, the Swiss can still understand one another, but may particularly have trouble understanding Walliser dialects.


History

Most Swiss German dialects, being _High German_ dialects, have completed the High German consonant shift (synonyms: Second Germanic consonant shift, High German sound shift[6][7]), that is, they have not only changed _t_ to or and _p_ to or , but also _k_ to or . There are, however, exceptions, namely the idioms of Chur and Basel. Basel German is a _Low Alemannic_ dialect (mostly spoken in Germany near the Swiss border), and Chur German is basically _High Alemannic_ without initial or .

Examples:

+----------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| High Alemannic | Low Alemannic | Standard German | Translation |
+================+===============+=================+=============+
|                |               |                 | _box_       |
+----------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
|                |               |                 | _Caribbean_ |
+----------------+---------------+-----------------+-------------+

The High German consonant shift happened between the fourth and 9th centuries south of the Benrath line, separating _High_ German from Low German, where _high_ refers to the geographically higher regions of the German-speaking area of those days (combining Upper German and Central German varieties - also referring to their geographical locations). North of the Benrath line up to the North Sea, this consonant shift did not happen.

The Walser migration, going on between the 12th and 13th centuries, spread upper Wallis varieties towards the east and south, into Grisons and even further to western Austria and northern Italy. Informally, a distinction is made between the German-speaking people living in the canton of Valais, the _Walliser_, and the migrated ones, the _Walsers_ (to be found mainly in Graubünden, Vorarlberg in Western Austria, Ticino in South Switzerland, south of the Monte Rosa mountain chain in Italy (e.g. in Issime in the Aosta valley), Tirol in North Italy, and Allgäu in Bavaria).

Generally, the Walser communities were situated on higher alpine regions, so were able to stay independent of the reigning forces of those days, who did not or were not able to follow and monitor them all the time necessary at these hostile and hard to survive areas. So, the Walser were pioneers of the liberalization from serfdom and feudalism. And, Walser villages are easily distinguishable from Grisonian ones, since Walser houses are made of wood instead of stone.

: Bernese German consonant system

Like all other Southern German dialects, Swiss German dialects have no voiced obstruents. However, they have an opposition of consonant pairs such as and or and . Traditionally, that distinction is said to be a distinction of fortis and lenis, but it has been claimed to be a distinction of quantity.[8]

Swiss German keeps the fortis–lenis opposition at the end of words. There can be minimal pairs such as _graad_ 'straight' and _Graat_ 'arête' or _bis_ 'be (imp.)' and _Biss_ 'bite'. That distinguishes Swiss German and Swiss Standard German from German Standard German, which neutralizes the fortis–lenis opposition at the ends of words. The phenomenon is usually called final-obstruent devoicing even though, in the case of German, phonetic voice may not be involved.

Swiss German are not aspirated. Aspirated have (in most dialects) secondarily developed by combinations of prefixes with word-initial /h/ or by borrowings from other languages (mainly Standard German): 'keep' (standard German _behalten_ ); 'tea' (standard German _Tee_ ); 'salary' (standard German _Gehalt_ ). In the dialects of Basel and Chur, aspirated is also present in native words. All typically-voiced consonant sounds are voiceless. Stop sounds being , and fricatives as .

Unlike Standard German, Swiss German does not have the allophone but is typically , with the allophone . The typical Swiss shibboleth features this sound: _Chuchichäschtli_ ('kitchen cupboard'), pronounced .

Most Swiss German dialects have gone through the Alemannic _n_-apocope, which has led to the loss of final _-n_ in words such as _Garte_ 'garden' (standard German _Garten_) or _mache_ 'to make' (standard German _machen_). In some Highest Alemannic dialects, the _n_-apocope has also been effective in consonant clusters, for instance in _Hore_ 'horn' (High Alemannic _Horn_) or _däiche_ 'to think' (High Alemannic _dänke_). Only the Highest Alemannic dialects of the Lötschental and of the Haslital have preserved the -_n_.

The phoneme is pronounced as an alveolar trill in many dialects, but some dialects, especially in the Northeast or in the Basel region, have a uvular trill , like in many German varieties of Germany.

A labiodental approximant is used in Swiss German, as the sound is present in Standard German.

: Zürich dialect vowel system

Most Swiss German dialects have rounded front vowels, unlike other High German dialects.[9] Only in Low Alemannic dialects of northwestern Switzerland (mainly Basel) and in Walliser dialects have rounded front vowels been unrounded. In Basel, rounding is being reintroduced because of the influence of other Swiss German dialects.

Like Bavarian dialects, Swiss German dialects have preserved the opening diphthongs of Middle High German: : in 'lovely' (standard German _lieb_ but pronounced ); 'hat' (standard German _Hut_ ); 'cool' (Standard German _kühl_ ). Some diphthongs have become unrounded in several dialects. Sounds like the monophthong can frequently become unrounded to among many speakers.

Like in Low German, most Swiss German dialects have preserved the old West-Germanic monophthongs : 'arrow' (Standard German _Pfeil_ ); 'belly' (Standard German _Bauch_ ); 'pillar' (Standard German _Säule_ ). A few Alpine dialects show diphthongization, like in Standard German, especially some dialects of Unterwalden and Schanfigg (Graubünden) and the dialect of Issime (Piedmont).

+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+-------------+

: Diphthongization in some dialects

Some Western Swiss German dialects like Bernese German have preserved the old diphthongs , but the other dialects have like Standard German or . Zürich German, and some other dialects distinguish primary diphthongs from secondary ones that arose in hiatus: Zürich German from Middle High German versus Zürich German from Middle High German ; Zürich German 'leg, woman' from Middle High German _bein, vrouwe_ versus Zürich German 'free, building' from Middle High German _frī, būw_.

Suprasegmentals

In many Swiss German dialects, consonant length and vowel length are independent from each other, unlike other modern Germanic languages. Here are examples from Bernese German:

+-------+--------+-------------------+
|       | short  | long              |
+-------+--------+-------------------+
| short | 'bowl' | 'the honest ones' |
+-------+--------+-------------------+
| long  | 'apes' | 'to sleep'        |
+-------+--------+-------------------+

Lexical stress is more often on the first syllable than in Standard German, even in French loans like or "thanks". However, there are many different stress patterns, even within dialects. Bernese German has many words that are stressed on the first syllable: 'casino' while Standard German has . However, no Swiss German dialect is as consistent as Icelandic in that respect.


Grammar

The grammar of Swiss dialects has some specialties compared to Standard German:

-   There is no preterite indicative (yet there is a preterite subjunctive).
-   The preterite is replaced by perfect constructs (this also happens in spoken Standard German, particularly in Southern Germany and Austria).
-   It is still possible to form pluperfect phrases, by applying the perfect construct twice to the same sentence.
-   There is no genitive case, though certain dialects have preserved a possessive genitive (for instance in rural Bernese German). The genitive case is replaced by two constructions: The first of these is often acceptable in Standard German as well: possession + Prp. _vo_ (std. German _von_) + possessor: _es Buech vomene Profässer_ vs. Standard German _ein Buch von einem Professor_ ("a book of a professor"), _s Buech vom Profässer_ vs. Standard German _das Buch des Professors_ ("the professor's book"). The second is still frowned on where it appears in Standard German (from dialects and spoken language): dative of the possessor + the possessive pronoun referring to the possessor + possession: _em Profässer sis Buech_ ("the professor his book").[10]
-   The order within verb groups may vary, e.g. _wo du bisch cho/wo du cho bisch_ vs. standard German _als du gekommen bist_ "when you have come/came".[11]
-   All relative clauses are introduced by the relative particle _wo_ (‘where’), never by the relative pronouns _der, die, das, welcher, welches_ as in Standard German, e.g. _ds Bispil, wo si schrybt_ vs. Standard German _das Beispiel, das sie schreibt_ (‘the example that she writes’); _ds Bispil, wo si dra dänkt_ vs. Standard German _das Beispiel, woran sie denkt_ (‘the example that she thinks of’). Whereas the relative particle _wo_ replaces the Standard German relative pronouns in the Nom. (subject) and Acc. (direct object) without further complications, in phrases where _wo_ plays the role of an indirect object, a prepositional object, a possessor or an adverbial adjunct it has to be taken up later in the relative clause by reference of (prp. +) the personal pronoun (if _wo_ refers to a person) or the pronominal adverb (if _wo_ refers to a thing). E.g. _de Profässer won i der s Buech von em zeiget ha_ ("the professor whose book I showed you"), _de Bärg wo mer druf obe gsii sind_ ("the mountain that we were upon").[12]
-   In combinations with other verbs, the verbs _gah_ or _goh_ "go", _cho_ "come", _la_ or _lo_ "let" and _aafa_ or _aafo_ "begin" reduplicate, prefixed to the main verb.

    {|

!example: |Si |chunt |üse |Chrischtboum |cho |schmücke. |- !literal translation: |she |comes |our |Christmas tree |_come_ |decorate |- !translation | colspan=6 | She comes to decorate our Christmas tree. |- !standard German: | colspan=6 | Sie kommt unseren Christbaum schmücken. |}

    {|

!example: |Si |lat |ne |nid |la |schlafe. |- !literal translation: |she |lets |him |not |_let_ |sleep |- !translation: | colspan=6 | She doesn't let him sleep. |- !standard German: | colspan=6 | Sie lässt ihn nicht schlafen. |}

    This is probably a generalization of a close association of these verbs with the following verb in perfect or modal verb constructions:
    {|

!perfect: |Si |het |ne |nid |_la schlafe_. |- !literal translation: |she |has |him |not |let sleep |- !translation: | colspan=5 | She hasn't/didn't let him sleep. |- !standard German: | colspan=6 | Sie hat ihn nicht schlafen lassen. _or_ Sie ließ ihn nicht schlafen. |}

    {|

!modal verb: |Si |wot |ne |nid |_la schlafe_. |- !literal translation: |she |wants |him |not |let sleep |- !translation: | colspan=5 | She doesn't want to let him sleep. |- !standard German: | colspan=6 | Sie will ihn nicht schlafen lassen. |}


Vocabulary

The vocabulary is varied, especially in rural areas: many specialized terms have been retained, e.g., regarding cattle or weather. In the cities, much of the rural vocabulary has been lost. A Swiss German greeting is _Grüezi_, from _Gott grüez-i_ (Standard German _Gott grüsse Euch_) or "God bless you".[13]

Most word adoptions come from Standard German. Many of these are now so common that they have totally replaced the original Swiss German words, e.g. the words _Hügel_ 'hill' (instead of _Egg, Bühl_), _Lippe_ 'lip' (instead of _Lefzge_). Others have replaced the original words only in parts of Switzerland, e.g., _Butter_ 'butter' (originally called _Anken_ in most of Switzerland). Virtually any Swiss Standard German word can be borrowed into Swiss German, always adapted to Swiss German phonology. However, certain Standard German words are never used in Swiss German, for instance _Frühstück_ 'breakfast', _niedlich_ 'cute' or _zu hause_ 'at home'; instead, the native words _Zmorge_, _härzig_ and _dehei_ are used.

Swiss dialects have quite a few words from French and Italian, which are perfectly assimilated. _Glace_ (ice cream) for example is pronounced in French but or in many Swiss German dialects. The French word for 'thank you', _merci_, is also used as in _merci vilmal_, literally "thanks many times". Possibly, these words are not direct adoptions from French but survivors of the once more numerous French loanwords in Standard German, many of which have fallen out of use in Germany.

In recent years, Swiss dialects have also taken some English words which already sound very Swiss, e.g., ('to eat', from "food"), ('to play computer games', from "game") or or – ('to snowboard', from "snowboard"). These words are probably not direct loanwords from English but have been adopted through standard German intermediation. While most of those loanwords are of recent origin, some have been in use for decades, e.g. (to play football, from "shoot").

There are also a few English words which are modern adoptions from Swiss German. The dishes müesli, and rösti have become English words, as did loess (fine grain), flysch (sandstone formation), kepi, landammann, kilch , schiffli, and putsch in a political sense. The term bivouac is sometimes explained as originating from Swiss German,[14] while printed etymological dictionaries (e.g. the German _Kluge_ or _Knaurs Etymological Dictionary_) derive it from Low German instead.


Literature

Written forms that were mostly based on the local Alemannic varieties, thus similar to Middle High German, were only gradually replaced by the forms of New High German. This replacement took from the 15th to 18th centuries to complete. In the 16th century, the Alemannic forms of writing were considered the original, truly Swiss forms, whereas the New High German forms were perceived as foreign innovations. The innovations were brought about by the printing press and were also associated with Lutheranism. An example of the language shift is the Froschauer Bible: Its first impressions after 1524 were largely written in an Alemannic language, but since 1527, the New High German forms were gradually adopted. The Alemannic forms were longest preserved in the chancelleries, with the chancellery of Bern being the last to adopt New High German in the second half of the 18th century.[15]

Today all formal writing, newspapers, books and much informal writing is done in Swiss Standard German, which is usually called _Schriftdeutsch_ (written German). Certain dialectal words are accepted regionalisms in Swiss Standard German and are also sanctioned by the Duden, e.g., _Zvieri_ (afternoon snack). Swiss Standard German is virtually identical to Standard German as used in Germany, with most differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and orthography. For example, Swiss Standard German always uses a double s (_ss_) instead of the eszett (_ß_).

There are no official rules of Swiss German orthography. The orthographies used in the Swiss-German literature can be roughly divided into two systems: Those that try to stay as close to standard German spelling as possible and those that try to represent the sounds as well as possible. The so-called _Schwyzertütschi Dialäktschrift_ was developed by Eugen Dieth, but knowledge of these guidelines is limited mostly to language experts. Furthermore, the spellings originally proposed by Dieth included some special signs not found on a normal keyboard, such as instead of for or instead of for . In 1986, a revised version of the _Dieth-Schreibung_ was published, designed to be written "on a normal typewriter".[16]

A few letters are used differently from the Standard German rules:

-   (and ) are used for the affricate .

-   is used for the unaspirated fortis .

-   (and sometimes ) traditionally stands for the (in many dialects shortened to , but still with closed quality) that corresponds to Standard German , e.g. in _Rys_ ‘rice’ (standard German _Reis_ ) vs. _Ris_ ‘giant’ (standard German ). This usage goes back to an old ij-ligature. Many writers, however, don't use , but /, especially in the dialects that have lost distinction between these sounds, compare Zürich German _Riis_ ‘rice’ or 'giant' to Bernese German _Rys_ 'rice' vs. _Ris_ (‘giant’). Some use even , influenced by Standard German spelling, which leads to confusion with for .

-   represents , slightly different from Standard German as .

-   usually represents , and can also represent or .

-   represents , represents , and represents .

-   Since is written as , is written as , though in eastern Switzerland is often used for both of these phonemes.

Since the 19th century, a considerable body of Swiss German literature has accumulated. The earliest works were in Zürich German (Johann Martin Usteri, Jakob Stutz); the works of Jeremias Gotthelf which were published at the same time are in Swiss Standard German, but use many expressions of Bernese German.
