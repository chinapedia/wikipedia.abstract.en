DYUDEN (or Tudan) was a brother of Toqta the Khan of the Golden Horde and the great grandson of Batu Khan. He was appointed as a general by Toqta and "Dyuden's campaign" devastated fourteen towns in the territory of modern Russia in 1293,[1] including Moscow,[2] while Toqta himself captured Tver forcing the Grand Prince to abdicate.

Dyudan had a son, Shchelkan, who was ambassador of the Uzbek Khan in Tver in 1327.[3]
