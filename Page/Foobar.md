The terms FOOBAR (), or FOO and others are used as metasyntactic variables and placeholder names in computer programming or computer-related documentation.[1] They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.


History and etymology

driving a "foomobile"]] The etymology of _foo_ is obscure. Its use in connection with _bar_ is generally traced to the World War II military slang FUBAR, later bowdlerised to _foobar_.[2] The word _foo_ on its own was used earlier. Between about 1930 and 1952 it appeared in the comic _Smokey Stover_ by Bill Holman, who stated that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in Chinatown, San Francisco, purportedly signifying "good luck".[3] This may be related to the Chinese word _fu_ ("福", sometimes transliterated _foo_), which can mean _happiness_ or _blessing_.[4]

The first known use of the terms in print in a programming context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT's _Tech Engineering News_.[5] _Foobar_ may have come about as a result of the pre-existing "Foo" being conjoined with "bar", an addition borrowed from the military's FUBAR. The use of _foo_ in a programming context is generally credited to the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) of MIT from circa 1960.[6] In the complex model system, there were scram switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch, the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word "FOO"; at TMRC the scram switches are, therefore, called "Foo switches". Because of this, an entry in the 1959 _Dictionary of the TMRC Language_ went something like this: "FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase 'foo mane padme hum.' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning."[7] One book describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labeled "foo" and "bar". These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the _Abridged Dictionary of the TMRC Language_ states:[8]

The shift from the military expression FUBAR to foobar may also have been driven by the latter being a computer science pun. Since overbars designate repeating decimal numbers, the word foobar also signifies a number in hexadecimal, a base typically used in low level programming. That number is 0.F00F00F00 ... , which equals the decimal fraction 256/273.

The term _foobar_ was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s by system manuals from Digital Equipment Corporation. _Foobar_ was also used as a variable name in the Fortran code of _Colossal Cave Adventure_ (1977 Crowther and Woods version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in saying the magic phrase "Fee Fie Foe Foo".


Example use in code

In this Hello World code sample in C, _foo_ and _bar_ are used to illustrate string concatenation:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
       const char *foo = "Hello";
       const char *bar = "World!";
       fprintf(stdout, "%s %s\n", foo, bar);

       return 0;
    }

    ;; scheme code

    (define foobar
       (lambda (x)
          (display x)))
    (foobar "Hello World!")

-   During the _United States v. Microsoft Corp._ trial, some evidence was presented that Microsoft had tried to use the Web Services Interoperability organization as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which top executives including Bill Gates referred to the WS-I using the codename "foo".[9]
-   foobar2000 is an audio player.
-   Google uses a web tool called foo.bar to recruit new employees.[10]
