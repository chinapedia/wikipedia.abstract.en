DE MOSS SPRINGS is an unincorporated community in Sherman County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.[1] It is about northeast of Moro along U.S. Route 97.[2]

De Moss Springs had a post office from 1887 to 1923. In 1900, the Columbia Southern Railway established a station known as _De Moss_ along its line to Shaniko. The springs and station were named for the De Moss family, which grew wheat, operated a recreation park at the springs, and formed a musical touring company called the _Lyric Bards_. The leader of the company, James M. De Moss, had moved to Sherman County from North Powder in 1883. He had managed the stagecoach station in North Powder.[3]
