Biography

Margaret M. "Marge" Hurlburt was born and lived in Painesville, Ohio.[2] She graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1938 and went on to teach school in Ohio.[3] In the early 1940s, she took up flying at the airport in Willoughby, Ohio.[4]

The pioneering aviator Jacqueline Cochran recruited her into the Womens Air Service Pilots (WASP) in 1943.[5] Between 1943 and 1945, she ferried aircraft around the country and towed targets for gunners, flying C-60s, B-24s, and B-17s.[6][7]

After the war, she obtained her rating as a flight instructor and worked at the Willoughby airfield, where she began learning aerobatics in the AT-6 aircraft. Not long afterwards, she won the top prize at the women's Halle Trophy Race at the Cleveland Air Races.[8]

In 1947, Hurlburt set a new international women's flight-speed record of 337 miles per hour, besting the previous women's record of 292.27 mph set by Cochran a decade earlier.[9] She set the record in a loaned FG-1 Corsair. Following her record-setting flight, the media dubbed her "Queen of the Air".[10]

During this period, she served on the board of directors of the Professional Race Pilots Association, representing the interests of female pilots.[11]

That same year, she joined the Flying Tigers aerial circus to raise money for a midget racer she was designing known as the "Hurlburt Hurricane."[12] Only a few days later, she was taking part in an air show at Decorah, Iowa, in a borrowed AT-6, when her aircraft crashed during a slow roll, killing her instantly.[13][14] The International Woman's Air & Space Museum holds some artifacts from her life.[15][16]
