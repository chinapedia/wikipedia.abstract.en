Plot

On New Year's Eve in 1997, Shane Batesman organizes a big party to which he invites all of his friends and classmates, but around 200 guests show up. In the house across the street the McIntoshes are also celebrating with some friends, but they are disturbed by the noise. Bob the householder decides to go looking for Shane to ask him to turn down the volume. Bob can not find Shane, who is away buying more alcohol for the unexpected guests, and finds himself in what presumably is the master bedroom. Here a group of boys has secluded themselves away to drink and take drugs. Bob, knowing the father of Shane, asks the boys to get out but they react badly, attacking him. Bob is found on the ground severely injured, and the intervention of the ambulance is useless. He dies during the ride to hospital.

Katy, Bob's widow, is distraught. After learning that her husband did not die of a heart attack as was initially hypothesized, but was murdered, she seeks justice. She presses on Jackson, the detective, to find the culprit. They come up against the silence of the boys and their parents, who do everything to protect them. The community is also opposed to Katy because they feel she is persecuting innocent young people. Just when you think Katy is throwing in the towel, one of the boys sends an anonymous email which sheds a new light on the investigation That light is Jordan, who has realized that her boyfriend Ryan is hiding something.

Ryan is arrested but at first does not want to answer questions from the police. Then Katy convinces him to tell the truth about the incident and promises that in return he will have all her support. Ryan decides to confess, and admits that he was the one who hit Bob repeatedly and kicked him, while his friends only shoved him. He blames the influence of alcohol. Ryan was sentenced to five years in prison and, once released, he and Katy start speaking at high schools to warn young people about the dangers of alcohol.
