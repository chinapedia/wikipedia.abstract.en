_MIN MARION_ (My Marion) is a Norwegian drama film from 1975 directed by Nils R. Müller.[1][2] It is based on Terje Stigen's 1972 novel _Min Marion_.[3]


Plot

The film tells the story of a love affair between two adults, Marion and Georg. Marion (played by Ulrikke Greve) is disabled and her face is disfigured since birth. Georg (played by Sverre Anker Ousdal) was disabled as the result of a car accident. The two people of them have experienced good and bad in life and have encountered much resistance. Together they find strength in each other, and the two of them limp along together on their own legs. The film is a sensitive portrayal of a different kind of love story.
