Editions

Edition 1 and 2

The first and second Edition of Campus Diaries was launched by MTV with B'lue. This edition was live 365 days, across 200+ campuses, through monthly engagements, vignettes on TV, microsite and presence on Facebook that feeds in continuous chatter about college news and gossip. It began at the start of the new academic year. MTV unleashed a series of fun engagements across cities and colleges, including dance-mobs, fresher’s parties, college face-offs, celeb-diaries and much more. Under this programme, a fun dance-mob-face-off was launched across the country. Over 50 colleges took part in the challenge and youngsters took to the street to show off their best dance-mob moves. With the closure of admissions, MTV kicked in more excitement through fun fresher’s parties. But, colleges had to earn their own MTV fresher’s bash. Students needed to be creative and share their idea of coolest fresher’s bash to impress MTV. And, MTV did get impressed with four colleges across four cities and, together with B’lue, hosted the craziest fresher’s bash for the winning colleges across Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata and Ahmedabad. These parties were covered on TV as well as digital. MTV also allowed youngsters to blog about their campus life on MTV’s official website created for this initiative. Students were and are still encouraged to upload images from their colleges on to the website and through MTV’s Facebook page. MTV has also created videos of celebrities remembering their own campus lives.[5][6][7]

Edition 3

The 3rd Edition was launched by MTV with Amazon.com Amazon Campus Diaries by MTV, a college connect digital platform, associated with Teach for India (TFI) movement on Independence Day, to bring the youth close to the education crisis. This time the channel planned to curate large scale experiences with the college network and drive real time interactivity across colleges in India. Campus Diaries began scouring the country to find campus stories, flavours, festivals of colleges around India and associate with 35 colleges through the year.[8]

Under the partnership, MTV facilitated five Campus Diaries volunteers in each of TFI's seven cities including Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai. Each volunteer shadowed a TFI Fellow in the classroom for a total of five times across four months. The idea was to bring them face to face with the education crisis and help them understand how TFI Fellows try to address the same. At the end of these four months, volunteers submitted a white paper/article on their experience with educational inequity and their individual vision to address it. The campaign amplified through the massive social footprint of MTV India across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The initiative connected 300 colleges across India across TV, web, mobile and social was always alive and buzzing across 365 days.[9]

Another engagement that was started in this edition and continued through the year was the 'Wacky Wednesday' initiative, with one new challenge every Wednesday.[10]
