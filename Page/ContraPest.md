CONTRAPEST is a contraceptive pest control product designed to reduce fertility in brown and black rats, developed by the U.S. biotechnology company SenesTech.[1][2][3] It is a flavored liquid, designed to be attractive to, and to be consumed by, the target animals in order to reduce the population over time. ContraPest is a contraceptive, not a sterilant, so a continuous supply maintains reduced populations. [4] ContraPest was initially tested in Indonesian rice fields, South Carolina pig farms, the suburbs of Boston and the New York City subway, and caused a reduction in rat populations of roughly 40% over a period of 12 weeks. [5] The product was approved for commercial use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in August 2016.[6]


History

The formula was originally used by Dr. Loretta Mayer and Dr. Cheryl Dyer as part of a research program to study heart disease in post-menopausal women through menopausal mice.[7] The active ingredient of ContraPest is the chemical 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), which is a known killer of oocytes in immature ovarian follicles.[8][9][10][11] ContraPest also contains triptolide, which the company reports has adverse reproductive effects on both males and females.[12]


Deployment

Currently the city of Washington D.C. is utilizing a 5,000 unit, four-year supply of ContraPest for all eight wards of the city in an attempt to combat the rat population. [13]
