Wu was appointed to the first board of directors of New China Hong Kong Group Limited in 1992, resigning in February 1993 to serve on its Executive Committee and act as Financial Advisor[5] thereafter until its collapse in early 1999 with HK$1.5 billion in unpaid creditors. At the same time as being Vice-Chairman of Ernst & Young, the company's auditor, Wu, in addition to being a member of the company's executive committee, was an authorised signatory to 13 of its bank accounts, had significant personal dealings with its subsidiaries and lent money to it.

Professional misconduct

In 2014, Wu was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants for acting concurrently both as financial advisor to and auditor of New China Hong Kong Group prior to its collapse in 1999. He was struck off for two years and fined HK$250,000 plus the Institute's costs.[11] The Institute, exceptionally, issued a statement in July 2014 in response to unrepentant remarks by Wu, in which it stated that his breaches had been "persistent, flagrant and inexcusable".[12]
