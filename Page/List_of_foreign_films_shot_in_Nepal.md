Nepal has provided an exotic and mystical backdrop to numerous international films set mostly or partly in Nepal. A good many overseas films shot in Nepal come from Bollywood and Hollywood film industries, which are two of the biggest cinema industries in the world.

The following is a compilation of foreign films shot largely or partly in Nepal. The list, however, doesn't cover those that were set in Nepal but shot elsewhere, such as The Expendables 2.
