In the Principality of Serbia, Kingdom of Serbia and Yugoslavia, the _SREZ_ (; / срезови) was a second-level administrative unit, a district that included several town- or village municipalities. It was abolished in 1963–67 in SFR Yugoslavia. The unit is no longer used, although the _katastarski srez_ is used in cadastral classification of property.


History

The _srez_ was noted as a second-level administrative unit in the 1903 Constitution of Serbia[1] and the 1921 Constitution of Yugoslavia, below the _okrug_ and above the _opština_.
