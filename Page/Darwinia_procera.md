_DARWINIA PROCERA_ is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae and is endemic to a small area in New South Wales. It is a shrub with laterally compressed leaves, so that they are thicker than wide. The flowers are reddish-purple and arranged in groups of four near the ends of the branches. Although rare in nature, this species is often grown by native plant enthusiasts.


Description

_Darwinia procera_ is an erect shrub which grows to a height of about and has upright branches. The leaves are laterally compressed and arranged in a decussate pattern along the branches. The leaves are long, glabrous, have a bluish tinge, curve upwards and taper to a point.[1][2][3]

The flowers are arranged in clusters of about four on the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. the groups surrounded by reddish bracts long. The floral cup is long and about wide and the petals form a white tube surrounding and enclosing the stamens. The style is white, long and extends beyond the end of the flower tube. Flowering occurs between late winter and early summer.[4][5][6]


Taxonomy

The first formal description of _Darwinia procera_ was by Barbara Briggs in 1962 and the description was published in _Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium_.[7] The specific epithet (_procera_) is derived a Latin word meaning "tall", "slender" or "long",[8] possibly referring to the growth habit of the plant.[9]


Distribution and habitat

This darwinia grows in forest and scrub near the top of sandstone gullies on the central coast north of Sydney.[10][11][12]


Conservation

_Darwinia procera_ is a rare plant but is not considered to be in danger at present. A significant population is preserved in the Brisbane Water National Park.[13][14]


Use in horticulture

_Darwinia procera_ is reasonably well-known in horticulture with its unusual foliage being a feature. It can be propagated from seed but is easier to raise from cuttings. It is hardy in well-drained, sandy soil in a partly-shaded situation with occasional watering in long dry spells.[15][16]
