_ENTER THE DRAGON_ is a 1973 martial arts action film produced by and starring Bruce Lee.[1] The film, which co-stars John Saxon and Jim Kelly, was directed by Robert Clouse. It would be Bruce Lee's final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at age 32. A joint American and Hong Kong production, it premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death and went on to gross worldwide,[2] equivalent to adjusted for inflation.

Enter the Dragon is considered to be one of the greatest martial arts films of all time.[3] In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[4] Among the first films to combine martial arts action with the emerging Blaxploitation genre, its success led to a series of similar productions combining both genres.[5] Its themes have also generated scholarly debate about how they reflect the changes taking place within post-colonial Asian societies following the end of World War II.[6]


Plot

Lee, a highly proficient Shaolin martial artist and instructor from Hong Kong, is approached by Braithwaite, a British intelligence agent investigating the suspected crime lord Han. Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island in order to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that his sister's killer, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.

At the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organization. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper ever refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams' fate.

Lee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a grueling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.

Production

Due to the success with his earlier films, Warner Bros began helping Bruce Lee with the film in 1972. They brought in producers Fred Weintraub and Paul Heller.[12]

Writing

The screenplay title was originally named _Blood and Steel_. The story features Asian, White and Black heroic protagonists because the producers wanted a film that would appeal to the widest possible international audiences.[13] The scene in which Lee states that his style is "Fighting Without Fighting" is based upon a famous anecdote involving the 16th century samurai Tsukahara Bokuden.[14][15]

Casting

John Saxon is a black belt in Judo and Shotokan Karate,[16] who studied under grandmaster Hidetaka Nishiyama for three years.[17] In negotiations, his agent told the film's producers that if they wanted him they would have to change the story so that the character of Williams would be killed, not Roper. They agreed and the script was changed.[18]

Rockne Tarkington was originally cast in the role of Williams. However, he unexpectedly dropped out days before the production was about to begin in Hong Kong. Producer Fred Weintraub knew that karate world champion, Jim Kelly had a training dojo in Crenshaw, Los Angeles so he hastily arranged a meeting. Weintraub was immediately impressed, and Kelly was cast in the film.[19] The success of Kelly's appearance launched his career as a star: after _Enter the Dragon_, he signed a three-film deal with Warner Bros[20] and went on to make several martial arts-themed blaxploitation films in the 1970s.[21]

Jackie Chan appears as a guard during the underground lair battle scene and gets his neck snapped by Lee. He also performed several stunts for the film, including the scene where Lee's character quickly climbs a rooftop at night. However, Yuen Wah was Lee's main stunt double for the film.[22]

Sammo Hung appears in a brief fight scene against Lee at the start of the film.

An urban legend surrounding the making of _Enter The Dragon_ claims that actor Bob Wall did not like Bruce Lee and that their fight scenes were not choreographed. However, Wall has denied this stating he and Lee were actually good friends.[23]

Filming

The film was shot on location in Hong Kong. All scenes were filmed without sound: dialogue and sound effects were added or dubbed in during post-production. Bruce Lee, after he had been goaded or challenged, fought several real fights with the film's extras and some set intruders during filming.[24] The scenes of Han's Island were filmed at a residence known as Palm Villa near the coastal town of Stanley.[25]

Soundtrack

Argentinian musician Lalo Schifrin composed the film's musical score. While Schifrin was widely known at the time for his jazz scores, he also incorporated funk and traditional film score elements into the film's soundtrack.[26] He composed the score by sampling sounds from China, Korea, and Japan. The soundtrack has sold over 500,000 copies, earning a gold record.[27]


Release

Box office

_Enter the Dragon_ was heavily advertised in the United States before its release. The budget for advertising was over $1,000,000. It was unlike any promotional campaign that had been seen before, and was extremely comprehensive. In order to advertise the film, the studio offered free Karate classes, produced thousands of illustrated flip books, comic books, posters, photographs, and organized dozens of news releases, interviews, and public appearances for the stars. _Esquire_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _Time_, and _Newsweek_ all wrote stories on the film.[28]

The filmed earned a profit of in the United States,[29] against a tight budget of $850,000.[30] It was one of the most successful films of 1973.[31] In Hong Kong, the film grossed HK$3,307,536[32]—huge business for the time, but substantially less than Lee's _Fist of Fury_ and _Way of the Dragon_.

In Japan, the film grossed .[33] In India, the movie was released in 1975 and opened to full houses, including a packed 32-week run in Bombay.[34] In France, it was one of the top five highest-grossing films of 1974 (above two other Lee films, _Way of the Dragon_ at #8 and _Fist of Fury_ at #12), with 4,444,582 box office admissions.[35] In Germany, it was one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1974, with 1.7million box office admissions.[36]

Worldwide, the film grossed ,[37] including in international markets outside of the United States.[38] The film's worldwide gross is equivalent to when adjusted for inflation.

Critical reception

The film was well received by critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1973.[39][40][41][42] Critics have referred to _Enter the Dragon_ as "a low-rent James Bond thriller",[43][44] a "remake of _Dr. No_" with elements of Fu Manchu.[45] J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters wrote, "Of course the real showcase here is the obvious star here, Bruce Lee, whose performance as an actor and a fighter are the most enhanced by the perfect sound and video transfer. While Kelly was a famous martial artist and a surprisingly good actor and Saxon was a famous actor and a surprisingly good martial artist, Lee proves to be a master of both fields."[46]

Many acclaimed newspapers and magazines reviewed the film. _Variety_ described it as "rich in the atmosphere", the music score as "a strong asset" and the photography as "interesting".[47] Additionally, The _New York Times_ gave the film a rave review. The review stated "The picture is expertly made and well-meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color. It is also the most savagely murderous and numbing hand-hacker (not a gun in it) you will ever see anywhere."[48]

The film currently holds a 93% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, with 46 reviews counted and an average rating of 7.8/10.[49] In 2004, the film was deemed "culturally significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.[50]

The film also ranks No. 474 on _Empire_ magazine's 2008 list of _The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time_.[51]


Censorship and home video

_Enter the Dragon_ has remained one of the most popular martial arts films since its premiere and has been released numerous times worldwide on every home video format. For almost three decades, many theatrical and home video versions were censored for violence, especially in the West. Since 2001, the film has been released uncut in the UK and most other territories.[52][53]

Most DVDs and Blu-rays come with a wide range of extra features in the form of documentaries, interviews, etc. In 2013, a second, remastered HD transfer appeared on Blu-ray, billed as the "40th Anniversary Edition".[54][55]


Legacy

The film has been parodied and referenced in places such as the 1976 film _The Pink Panther Strikes Again_, the satirical publication _The Onion_,[56] the Japanese game-show _Takeshi's Castle_, and the 1977 John Landis comedy anthology film _Kentucky Fried Movie_ (in its lengthy "A Fistful of Yen" sequence, basically a comedic, note for note remake of _Dragon_) and also in the film _Balls of Fury_. It was also parodied on television in _That '70s Show_ during the episode "Jackie Moves On" with regular character Fez taking on the Bruce Lee role. Several clips from the film are comically used during the theatre scene in _The Last Dragon_.

In August 2007, the now defunct Warner Independent Pictures announced that television producer Kurt Sutter would be remaking the film as a noir-style thriller entitled _Awaken the Dragon_ with Korean singer-actor Rain starring.[57][58][59] It was announced in September 2014 that Spike Lee would work on the remake. In March 2015, Brett Ratner revealed that he wanted to make the remake.[60][61] In July 2018, David Leitch is in early talks to direct the remake.[62]

The little-known 1985 Nintendo arcade game _Arm Wrestling_ contains voice leftovers from the film, as well as their original counterparts.

The popular video game _Mortal Kombat_ borrows multiple plot elements from _Enter the Dragon_.

The popular 1980s martial arts video game _Double Dragon_ features two enemies named Roper and Williams, a reference to the two characters Roper and Williams from _Enter the Dragon_. The sequel includes opponents named Bolo and O'Hara.

Lee's martial arts films were broadly lampooned in the recurring _Almost Live!_ sketch _Mind Your Manners with_ _Billy Quan_.
