_GESTA ANNALIA_ ("Yearly Deeds") is an important medieval chronicle detailing the history of Scotland.

The history seems to be split into two main sections. Whilst _Gesta Annalia I_ seems to concern events to February 1285, _Gesta Annalia II_ appears to concern events between October 1285 to 1363.[1] The composition of _Gesta Annalia I_ was likely completed in 1285, between February and the middle of April.[2]
