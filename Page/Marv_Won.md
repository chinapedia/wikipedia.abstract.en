Career

Worlds's Largest Group

O'Neal and Shabazz Ford has started The Fat Killahz along with Shim-E-Bango and King Gordy in 2001. The rap group of all four skilled emcees torn down local Detroit spots like the Lush Lounge, the Blind Pig, Motor, St. Andrew's Hall, the Shelter, the State Theater, and rapidly gained respect in the streets and a devoted following. In 2002 the quartet decided it was time to hit the studio, and they released the _2 Fat, 2 Furious_ mixtape to positive reactions throughout Detroit city. Making an appearance on King Gordy's debut solo album ''The Entity, ''they followed up a successful run supporting Gordy as the opening act on D12's US tour in 2004 with the release of their _WFKR 31.3 FKM: FK Radio The Mixtape_. On March 15, 2005, the World's Largest Group dropped their debut studio album _"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"_ via No Tyze Entertainment, featuring production by notable Mr. Porter and B.R. Gunna among others and Marv also co-produced one track off the record.

_Way Of The Won_ and _Wayne Fontes Music_

Due to Fat Killahz hiatus until 2011, the band members still participated in their individual projects and Marv has featured on many fellow rappers projects. That was the material for the debut solo release, and in December 2009 has been released he eleven track album named _"The Way Of The Won"_ featured audio production from Kon Artis and Black Milk (with whom Marv worked during F.K.'s first project) among others, and featured guest appearances by Danny Brown, Bilal, Fatt Father & Shim-E-Bango. Marv was signed to Kon Artis and Kuniva's record label Runyon Ave Records and released his next project "Wayne Fontes Music" a month after his previous album, on January 1, 2010. The fourteen track LP featured the likes of Dwele, Riodata, Fatt Father & Shim-E-Bango.

_Heavy Is The Head_ and Twin Towers

In 2011, Marv and The Fat Killahz teamed up once again to drop their extended play _The E.P._, and to be featured on Shim-E-Bango's _The Bridgecard_ and Gordy's _Jesus Christ's Mistress_ projects before the band's second hiatus. Porter resigned O'Neil on his brand new My Own Planet imprint and they began to work on the new project. The nine track album _Heavy Is The Head..._ has been released on October 16, 2012. It featured guest appearances from Royce Da 5'9", Young R.O.C. and The Fat Killahz, among with audio production notably handled by both Denaun and Marv who also served as executive producers.[2] In 2012, Marv appeared in the intro track on Slaughterhouse album _Welcome to: Our House_.

Battle rap

Ever since he's become a staple of freestyle battles.[9] Marv has been prominent on the battle rap scene for more than a decade, gaining international attention since as early as the World Rap Championships.[10] He continues to participate in the rap battles, sometimes as a double team with Kimani Graham (known as Quest Mcody).[11][12]


Filmography

Marv was one of many Detroit rappers who appeared as an extra in "8 Mile", He rapped against Eminem in a battling scene, but that scene was left out of the movie. Marv explained, when the DVD was released, "It was really huge for me because that was one of the main scenes they sold the DVD on. That was the footage they sent to 'Entertainment Tonight,' 'Extra' and 'Access Hollywood'..."[13]
