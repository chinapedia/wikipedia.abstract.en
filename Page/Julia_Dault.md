JULIA DAULT (born 1977 in Toronto) is a Canadian artist. She is best known for her abstract paintings and Formica and Plexiglas sculptures. She lives and works in Toronto.


Early life and education

Dault was born to Gary Michael Dault, an art critic, and Margaret Crawford, who is an art teacher.[1][2] She attended McGill University, Montreal, and received a BA in Art History in 2001. After having worked as an art critic for The National Post and other publications,[3] she attended Parsons, the New School for Design, New York, and received MFA in Fine Arts in 2008.[4]


Work

SCULPTURE

Dault has been making sculptures that are all called _Untitled_ with a number since she made _Untitled No.1_ in 2008 for her thesis show for Parsons.[5] _Untitled_ sculptures are made with industrial materials, such as Formica and Plexiglas, and they are built without glue or screws.[6] Sculptures are fabricated strictly on site without any pretreatment of materials. Each of them is also titled with a date and time stamp to reflect the amount of time it took for Dault to construct the sculpture.[7] The stamp also reflects new iteration in case of reinstallation.[8]

PAINTING

The use of various hand tools and the idea of removal is fundamental in Dault's paintings.[9] She often paints layers of patterns and then scrapes the top monochrome layer to reveal the patterns underneath.[10] Scraping is done with unique tools, such as door handles, combs created from a sheet of rubber, and plaster tools for home decoration.[11]


Exhibitions

Dault has had solo exhibitions internationally at Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, Canada (2015); Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York (2015); China Art Objects Galleries, Los Angeles, CA (2014); Galerie Bob van Orsouw Zurich, Switzerland (2013); White Cube Bermondsey, London, UK (2012).

Her work has also been included in group shows including Pérez Art Museum Miami, Miami (2013); Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, Houston, TX (2013); Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw, Poland (2013); New Museum, New York, NY (2012); The Museum of Public Fiction, Los Angeles, CA (2010); Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans, LA.
