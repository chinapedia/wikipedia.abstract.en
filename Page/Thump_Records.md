THUMP RECORDS is a record label specialized in various genres of music. Founded by Bill Walker and Al Lopez for $10,000. In 1997 Bill Walker became its sole C.E.O. and President. Thump's success was ignited by the popularity of its Old School and Low Rider compilation series (co-branded with Low Rider Magazine). While a majority of the label's releases contain repertoire licensed from major labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner Bros., Thump has also signed many artists under its own banner. Thump is currently distributed by the Universal Music Group.
