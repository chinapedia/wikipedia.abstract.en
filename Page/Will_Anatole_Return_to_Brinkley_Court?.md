Plot

Anatole was the supremely skilled French chef of Aunt Dahlia at her country house Brinkley Court. He gave notice when Bertie recommended that they make a hunger strike in order to provoke feelings of guilt in others and to go without dinner made by the chef. Jeeves returns to London to persuade Anatole to return to Brinkley Court, whereto Bertie subsequently goes to reconcile Angela Travers with Tuppy Glossop, who is growing increasingly suspicious and jealous of his relationship with her.

In order to bolster Gussie Fink-Nottle's courage to deliver the prizes and propose to Madeline Bassett, both Bertie and Jeeves spike his orange juice. Jeeves finally sorts out all the fractured relationships with a plan to set off the fire alarm.
