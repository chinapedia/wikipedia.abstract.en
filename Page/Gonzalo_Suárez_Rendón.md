GONZALO SUÁREZ RENDÓN (1503, Málaga, Castile – 1590 (or 1583),[1] Tunja, New Kingdom of Granada) was a Spanish conquistador, known as the founder of the capital of Boyacá; Tunja. He took part in the Spanish conquest of the Muisca people led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, and later by his brother Hernán Pérez de Quesada. On August6, 1539, he founded Tunja on the site of the former seat of the _zaque_ (ruler) of the Hunza.[2]

Gonzalo Suárez Rendón is mentioned in the work of uncertain authorship _Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada_ as "Suarex".[3]

American expeditions

The Suárez River, which the conquistadors followed to reach the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in early 1537, was named after Suárez Rendón when his horse drowned in it.[6]

Together with Hernán Pérez de Quesada and Gonzalo García Zorro, Suárez Rendón was one of the torturers of the last _zipa_, Sagipa.[7]


House in Tunja

The house built by Suárez Rendon, (_Casa del Fundador Gonzalo Suárez Rendón_), between August7, 1539, the day after the foundation of Tunja, and 1570, still exists as the oldest colonial building in Tunja and the only remaining house of a colonial city founder in Latin America; it has been a museum since 1965.[8]
