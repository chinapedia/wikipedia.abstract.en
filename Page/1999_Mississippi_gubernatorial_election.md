The 1999 MISSISSIPPI GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 2, 1999, in order to elect the Governor of Mississippi. Incumbent Governor Kirk Fordice, a member of the Republican Party who had been in office since 1992, was ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.

In the general election, Democrat Lieutenant Governor Ronnie Musgrove won a plurality of the vote over Republican Congressman Mike Parker. Per the Mississippi Constitution, since no candidate had received a majority of the vote, the election was decided by the Mississippi House of Representatives. On January 4, 2000, the House voted 86-36 along partisan lines to elect Musgrove governor.[1] As of , this is the most recent election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Mississippi.

Under the 1890 Constitution of Mississippi, gubernatorial candidates must win a majority of the popular vote. In addition, the Mississippi House of Representatives acts as an electoral college, with each county apportioned electoral votes equal to its number of representatives â€“ in a reflection of the closeness of the election, each candidate received 61 electoral votes.

The constitution prescribes that in the absence of a popular- _and_ electoral-vote majority, the House of Representatives, where the Democrats had a supermajority at the time, decides between the top two candidates by popular vote. Parker refused to concede, and the House elected Musgrove 86-36 along partisan lines.[2]
