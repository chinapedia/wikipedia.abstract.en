BEIT QAD () is a Palestinian rural village in the West Bank governorate of Jenin. The village is located 5km from the city of Jenin and according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 2016 it had a population of 1,799.[1]


History

The village is associated by some scholars with a biblical locality in the Kingdom of Israel, located between the city of Jezreel and the kingdom's capital Samaria.[2] It is mentioned in the Book of Kings as _Beth Ekad of the Shepherds_ () which can be translated as "meeting place of the shepherds". In this place, Jehu, king of Israel, slaughtered 42 relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah.[3] The village is also associated with a village mentioned in the Onomasticon (Gazetteer) of the Greek historian Eusebius called _Beth Ekamat_.[4]

Some intact Roman buildings can be found in the village,[5] and ceramics from the Byzantine era have also been found there.[6]

Ottoman era

Beit Qad, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596, the village appeared in the _nahiya_ of Jenin in the _liwa_ of Lajjun. It had a population of 20 households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 9,500 akçe.[7] Beit Qad was described by the census as a hamlet.[8]

In 1838, _Beit Kad_ was noted as one of a range of villages round a height, the other villages being named as Deir Abu Da'if, Fuku'a, Deir Ghuzal and Araneh.[9]

In 1870 Victor Guérin found the village to have 200 inhabitants.[10] In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described Beit Kad as “a small village on a knoll near the plain. It has a large cemented cistern, now broken. The houses are of stone and mud.”[11]

British era

In the 1922 census of Palestine the population of the village was 199 Muslims,[12] decreasing slightly in the 1931 census to 185, in 35 households.[13]

In the 1944/5 statistics, the population was 290, all Muslim,[14] with a total of 8,915 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.[15] Of this, 608 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 6,976 dunams for cereals,[16] while 10 dunams were built-up (urban) land.[17]

Jordanian era

In 1948 Palestinian refugees from Mount Gilboa were absorbed in the village and stayed there as sharecroppers.[18] The refugees who arrived to Beit Qad had the opportunity to resettle in the village instead of moving to refugee camps.[19] In 1951 they built, with the aid of the Jordanian government, another agriculture-based village, 2km north of Beit Qad, called _Mashru' Beit Qad_ which means "_Project of Beit Qad_"[20]

The Jordanian census conducted in 1961 recorded 247 persons in Beit Qad and 197 persons in Mashru' Beit Qad.[21]

1967, aftermath

After the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Qad has been under Israeli occupation.

In a census conducted by Israel after it occupied it, Beit Qad "south" (respectively "north") were reported to have 223 (respectively 216) residents, including 86 (respectively 53) persons in households whose head was a refugee from Israeli territory.[22]


Geography

The village is located north of Deir Abu Da'if in the Jezreel Valley (known in Arabic as "Marj Ibn Āmir"). The village is split into two sections: the south and north (which is called Mashru Beit Qad) and is surrounded by fields. The village has an ancient mosque built from ancient building stones and an old Arabic maqam.[23][24]
