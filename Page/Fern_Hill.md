FERN HILL (1945) is a poem by Dylan Thomas, first published in the October, 1945, Horizon magazine, with its first book publication as the last poem in _Deaths and Entrances_.

The house Fernhill is just outside Llangain in Carmarthenshire. Thomas had extended stays here in the 1920s with his aunt Annie and her husband, Jim Jones, and wrote about the house in his short story, _The Peaches_. His holidays here have been recalled in interviews with his schoolboy friends, and both the house and the Thomas family network in the area are detailed in the same book.[1] A further account describes both Thomas’ childhood and later years on the family farms between Llangain and Llansteffan, as well as questioning whether the poem Fern Hill was inspired by the house Fernhill.[2]


Linguistic considerations

The poem starts as a straightforward evocation of his childhood visits to his Aunt Annie's farm:

    Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
    About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
    The night above the dingle starry,

In the middle section, the idyllic scene is expanded upon, reinforced by the lilting rhythm of the poem, the dreamlike, pastoral metaphors and allusion to Eden.

    All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
    Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air...
    With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
    Shining, it was Adam and maiden,

By the end, the poet's older voice has taken over, mourning his lost youth with echoes of the opening:

    Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
    Time held me green and dying
    Though I sang in my chains like the sea.[3]

The poem uses internal half rhyme and full rhyme as well as end rhyme. Thomas was very conscious of the effect of spoken or intoned verse and explored the potentialities of sound and rhythm, in a manner reminiscent of Gerard Manley Hopkins. He always denied having conscious knowledge of Welsh, but "his lines chime with internal consonantal correspondence, or _cynghanedd_, a prescribed feature of Welsh versification".[4]


Legacy

_Fern Hill_ has been set to music by the American composer John Corigliano, for SATB chorus with orchestral accompaniment.[5]

Samples of the _Fern Hill_ poem read by Dylan Thomas himself are used in the track _Apple Towns_[6] by the one-man act _Reflection Nebula_.[7]

_Happy as the Grass Was Green_ became the title of a 1973 drama film.
