VICTORIA J. ORPHAN is a geobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who studies the interactions between marine microorganisms and their environment.[1][2]


Education

Dr. Orphan received her B.A. (1994) and Ph.D. (2001) from the University of California, Santa Barbara.[3] Her postdoctoral research was at the NASA Ames Research Center (2002-2004). Currently, Dr. Orphan is the James Irvine Professor of Environmental Science and Geobiology at the California Institute of Technology[4] She is also an adjunct scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) (since 2009)[5] and Senior Scientist of the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations, a Science and Technology Center funded by the National Science Foundation and headquartered at the University of Southern California.[6]


Professional Work

Dr. Orphan's research focuses on microbially-mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in deep sea sediment.[7] Specifically, she looks at the relationships between two groups of marine microbes: an archaea and a bacteria. Dr. Orphan uses tools such as nanoSIMs to visualize these organisms at the microscale and track how and when they exchange energy.[8] Through her research, Dr. Orphan has helped to provide insight into the relationship between microbes and large-scale geochemical processes.
