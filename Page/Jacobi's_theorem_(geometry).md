In plane geometry, a JACOBI POINT is a point in the Euclidean plane determined by a triangle _ABC_ and a triple of angles _α_, _β_, and _γ_. This information is sufficient to determine three points _X_, _Y_, and _Z_ such that ∠_ZAB_ = ∠_YAC_ = _α_, ∠_XBC_ = ∠_ZBA_ = _β_, and ∠_YCA_ = ∠_XCB_ = _γ_. Then, by a theorem of , the lines _AX, BY,_ and _CZ_ are concurrent,[1][2][3] at a point _N_ called the Jacobi point.[4]

The Jacobi point is a generalization of the Napoleon points, which are obtained by letting _α_ = _β_ = _γ_ = 60°.

If the three angles above are equal, then _N_ lies on the rectangular hyperbola given in areal coordinates by

_y__z_(cot _B_ − cot _C_) + _z__x_(cot _C_ − cot _A_) + _x__y_(cot _A_ − cot _B_) = 0,

which is Kiepert's hyperbola. Each choice of three equal angles determines a triangle center.
