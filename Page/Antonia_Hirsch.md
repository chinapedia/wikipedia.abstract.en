ANTONIA HIRSCH (born 1968, Frankfurt on Main, Germany) is an interdisciplinary artist who lives and works in Berlin.[1]


Life and work

Antonia Hirsch was educated at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London, Great Britain. From 1994 to 2010, she lived and worked in Vancouver, Canada.[2]

Hirsch's work engages a variety of media, including installation, film, video, and photography.

In her preface to _Negative Space: Orbiting Inner and Outer Experience_ curator and writer Melanie O'Brian states "Antonia Hirsch's practice testifies to a long-standing engagement with the quantitative, spatial, and syntactic systems that structure an understanding of our universe… Hirsch's work relates these ordering structures to embodied and visual experience, considering how the equivocal and often ideological nature of these representational systems is expressed through a level of abstraction."[3]
