The CHIESA DELLA MADONNA DELLA GRAZIE is a Roman Catholic church located just outside the town of Petriolo, at the point where the Strada provincial 36 splits toward either Mogliano or the Abbey of Fiastra and Macerata, in the province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.


History

The small brick church is located on the road from Petriolo to Mogliano. The church was built in the second half of the 18th century in simple Neoclassical lines, and houses a venerated fresco depicting a standing forward-facing _Madonna and Child_, felt to be miraculous.

The main altarpiece depicts _Saints Martini and Mark_ on the local landscape, painted by Luigi Fontana (1827-1908).[1]
