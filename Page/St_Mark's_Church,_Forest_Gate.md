ST MARK'S CHURCH is a Church of England parish church in Forest Gate, east London.[1]


History

It is sited on Tylney Road and originated as a mission church of Emmanuel Church. It was meant to serve the area between Wanstead Flats and the Romford Road and initially held services in a rented cowshed, until a site was acquired in 1888 for a permanent church, built in three stages between 1893 and 1898. This church was given a separate parish in 1894 by splitting off areas from Emmanuel and All Saints.[2]

Present day

St Mark's stands in the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England.[3]
