The COLLEGE ANCHIETA is a private school located in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil . The institution is one of the twenty-two works of the Society of Jesus in Southern Brazil. It has more than three thousand students and approximately three hundred members on its staff.


History

José_de_Anchieta_(zincogravura)_1807.jpg The "College of the Fathers", as it was initially known, was founded on 13 January 1890. Fr. Francisco Trappe received from Rome permission to buy the house of the Fialho family, located at Church Street (now Duque de Caxias).

In the beginning, the College of the Fathers was intended only for boys, divided into two sections, German and Brazilian. In its first year of operation, the number of students began at 42 and rose to 80. The boys were ages 9 through 12, and were only admitted if they could read.

In 1897 the College of the Fathers changed its name to St. Joseph, and then to Anchieta Gymasium. It progressed gradually. The current name Anchieta College was adopted in 1901, at the suggestion of the then director Conrado Menz, in tribute to José de Anchieta.

Anchieta College grew and required more space than it had on Duque de Caxias Street. The growth of Porto Alegre also put pressure on the requirements. In 1954 a plot on Nile Pecanha Avenue was bought and a new school was built. A new church was added in 1967.
