JOSHUA SAMUEL SIMS (born 28 March 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger for Premier League side Southampton.


Personal life

He has one younger sister Ellie, and an older brother Adam. Sims grew up in the town of Gillingham, Dorset and attended Gillingham School.[1]


Club career

Sims joined Southampton's Academy from the Elite Training Centre in 2011.[2][3] After impressing with the under-23 side, Sims made his professional debut for Southampton on 27 November 2016 against Everton in a Premier League match. He took only a few moments to achieve his first assist of his senior career when he set up Charlie Austin for a headed goal in the first minute. Sims ended the first half with 95% passing accuracy, the best among all players on the pitch, as Southampton went on to win 1–0.[4]

Sims made his Europa League debut for Southampton on 8 December, in a 1–1 draw against Hapoel Be'er Sheva.[5]

Sims continued to stay in the mix for the first team into January and provided the game-winning assist for Shane Long in a 1–0 away win against Liverpool to send Southampton into the 2017 EFL Cup final.[6]

On 20 August 2018, Sims joined Reading on a season-long loan.[7] He made his debut for Reading two days later, in a 2–2 away draw with Blackburn Rovers in the Championship. Sims was brought on just after the hour-mark to replace Sone Aluko.[8] He was recalled in January.


International career

Sims has represented England at U17 through to U20 level. He was a part of the squad that won the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship.[9]
