TESTOSTERONE PALMITATE, also known as TESTOSTERONE HEXADECANOATE, TESTOSTERONE 17Β-PALMITATE, and ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-PALMITATE, is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β palmitate (hexadecanoate) ester of testosterone – which was never marketed.[1][2][3] It is a prodrug of testosterone and, when administered via intramuscular injection, is associated with a long-lasting depot effect and extended duration of action.[4]

Testosterone palmitate is a longer-chain ester of testosterone compared to testosterone undecanoate.[5] Relative to testosterone undecanoate, testosterone palmitate shows higher oral bioavailability.[6] However, no free testosterone was observed after administration of testosterone palmitate, suggesting that it is not hydrolyzed as well.[7] On the other hand, another study found that testosterone palmitate was hydrolyzed in humans.[8]
