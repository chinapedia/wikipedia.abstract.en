Early life

Career

Trinidad Fernandez Legarda was English-language editor of _The Woman's Outlook_, a pro-suffrage publication in the Philippines. She was also president of the National Federation of Women's Clubs, and a leader in the Filipina suffrage movement.[4] Her 1931 essay in _Philippine Magazine_, "Philippine Women and the Vote", drew from American rhetoric, but also quoted a Hindu proverb, in making the case for suffrage.[5] She was president of the Manila Symphony Society from 1933 to 1958.[6]

During World War II she set up a convalescent home for veterans and war widows. In 1946, she led the reorganization of the National Federation of Women's Clubs, which had lost most of its assets during the war. In 1949, she ran unsuccessfully for a senate seat.[7]

She represented the Philippines at international meetings after World War II.[8] In 1953, Trinidad F. Legarda was named Civic Leader of the Year.[9] She was appointed ambassador to South Vietnam in 1958, and served in that role until 1962.[10] She was the first woman ambassador to represent the Philippines.[11]
