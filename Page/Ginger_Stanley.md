Biography

Stanley left her home in Georgia at the age of 15 and moved to Sebring, Florida to live with her older sister.[3] While competing in a festival in Leesburg, Florida, she met Newt Perry, a swimming coach, promoter, and consultant for movies that used underwater scenes. He hired her to be a professional mermaid at the Weeki Wachee Springs tourist attraction.[4][5] She worked there for 2 years.[6]

From 1953 to 1956, Stanley worked at Silver Springs as a swimmer and underwater performer with Bruce Mozert, a pioneer of underwater photography, becoming one of his "most recognized"[7] models.[8] At this time, she also had her two roles in the _Creature from the Black Lagoon_ and _Revenge of the Creature_, filmed at Silver Springs.

She was also the body double for Esther Williams in _Jupiter's Darling_ (1955).[9] At the time Williams was recovering from a perforated eardrum and her time underwater was limited.[10]

In 1956 Stanley married Albert V. Hallowell Jr. and they moved to Orlando, Florida. They had three daughters.[11] She hosted "Browsing with Ginger", a women's talk show on a local Orlando television station, and then spent twenty-three years as a runway model, working for various charities, department stores, and Walt Disney World.[12]

In 2012, she was inducted into the _Mermaid Hall of Fame_ at Weeki Wachee Springs.[13]

As an actress, she had uncredited roles in four movies.

Stanley also appeared as herself in the documentaries, _Creature Feature: 50 Years of the Gill-Man_ (2004) and _Creature Feature: 60 Years of the Gill-Man_ (2014), about the filming and marketing of the horror film, _Creature From the Black Lagoon_.
