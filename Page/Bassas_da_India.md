BASSAS DA INDIA is an uninhabited, roughly circular French atoll that is part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. Located in the southern Mozambique Channel, about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar (about further east) and around northwest of Europa Island, the rim of the atoll averages around 100 m in width and encloses a shallow lagoon of depth no greater than 15 m. Overall, the atoll is about in diameter, rising steeply from the seabed 3000 m below to encircle an area (including lagoon) of . Its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), in size, is contiguous with that of Europa Island.

The atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling 0.2 km² (.077 sq mi) in area. Those on the north and east sides are 2.1 to 3 m high, while those on the west and south sides are 1.2 m high. The reef, whose coastline measures , is completely covered by the sea from three hours before high tide to three hours afterward. The region is also subject to cyclones, making the atoll a long-time maritime hazard and the site of numerous shipwrecks.

Jaguar Seamount and Hall Tablemount lie, respectively, about 40 and 70 km further southwest.

History

The Bassas da India was first recorded by Portuguese explorers in the early sixteenth century as the "_BAIXO DA_ JUDIA" ("_Jewess_ Shoals"). The _Judia_ ("_Jewess_", for the ancestry of its owner Fernão de Loronha[1]) was the Portuguese ship that discovered the feature by running aground on it in 1506.[2] The name became "BASSAS DA INDIA" due to transcription errors by cartographers. The _Santiago_ broke up on the shoal in 1585.

It was rediscovered by the _Europa_ in 1774, whence the name "Europa Rocks".[3] The _Malay_ was lost 27 July 1842 on the Europa Rocks.[4]

In 1897, the shoal became a French possession, later being placed under the administration of a commissioner residing in Réunion in 1968. Madagascar became independent in 1960 and claims sovereignty over the shoal since 1972.


Tourism

Mooring at Bassas da India requires a permit from the French Government.[5] Fishing without such a permit may result in the boat being expelled or even confiscated.[6] Several illegal tourism charters departing from Mozambique or South Africa have been seized since 2013 by the French navy.[7] [8]
