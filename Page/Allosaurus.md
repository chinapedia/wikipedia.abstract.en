_ALLOSAURUS_ ([1][2]) is a genus of carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian[3]). The name "_Allosaurus"_ means "different lizard" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its discovery). It is derived from the Greek /_allos_ ("different, other") and /_sauros_ ("lizard / generic reptile"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life.

_Allosaurus_ was a large bipedal predator. Its skull was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth. It averaged in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over . Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an allosaurid, a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated taxonomy, and includes an uncertain number of valid species, the best known of which is _A. fragilis_. The bulk of _Allosaurus_ remains have come from North America's Morrison Formation, with material also known from Portugal and possibly Tanzania. It was known for over half of the 20th century as _Antrodemus_, but a study of the copious remains from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry brought the name "_Allosaurus"_ back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.

As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, _Allosaurus_ was at the top of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret _Allosaurus_ as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses.


Description

_Allosaurus_ was a typical large theropod, having a massive skull on a short neck, a long, slightly sloping tail and reduced forelimbs. _Allosaurus fragilis_, the best-known species, had an average length of ,[4] with the largest definitive _Allosaurus_ specimen (AMNH 680) estimated at long,[5] and an estimated weight of .[6] In his 1976 monograph on _Allosaurus_, James H. Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of .[7] As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between , , and for modal adult weight (not maximum).[8] John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that is reasonable for large adults of _A. fragilis_, but that is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized thigh bones he has measured.[9] Using the subadult specimen nicknamed "Big Al", researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately to approximately .[10]

Several gigantic specimens have been attributed to _Allosaurus_, but may in fact belong to other genera. The closely related genus _Saurophaganax_ (OMNH 1708) reached perhaps in length,[11] and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus _Allosaurus_ as _Allosaurus maximus_, though recent studies support it as a separate genus.[12] Another potential specimen of _Allosaurus_, once assigned to the genus _Epanterias_ (AMNH 5767), may have measured in length.[13] A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of New Mexico; this large allosaurid may be another individual of _Saurophaganax_.[14]

David K. Smith, examining _Allosaurus_ fossils by quarry, found that the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry (Utah) specimens are generally smaller than those from Como Bluff (Wyoming) or Brigham Young University's Dry Mesa Quarry (Colorado), but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites.[15] A later study by Smith incorporating Garden Park (Colorado) and Dinosaur National Monument (Utah) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation; skull variation was most common and was gradational, suggesting individual variation was responsible.[16] Further work on size-related variation again found no consistent differences, although the Dry Mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus, an ankle bone.[17] Kenneth Carpenter, using skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site, found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the horns, and the proposed differentiation of "A. jimmadseni" based on the shape of the jugal.[18]

Skull

]] The skull and teeth of _Allosaurus_ were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist Gregory S. Paul gives a length of for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long.[19] Each premaxilla (the bones that formed the tip of the snout), held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, narrower, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils.[20]

The skull had a pair of horns above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the lacrimal bones,[21] and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns.[22] The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye,[23] being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species[24][25] (although they were fragile).[26] There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.[27]

Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held glands, such as salt glands.[28] Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as _Ceratosaurus_ and _Marshosaurus_; they may have been related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain.[29] The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape.[30] The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.[31]

Postcranial skeleton

_Allosaurus_ had nine vertebrae in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the sacrum supporting the hips.[32] The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50,[33] while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less.[34] There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae.[35] Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration.[36] The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like _Ceratosaurus_.[37] _Allosaurus_ had gastralia (belly ribs), but these are not common findings,[38] and they may have ossified poorly.[39] In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life.[40] A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia.[41][42] The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier.[43] This proposal has not attracted further attention, however. The forelimbs of _Allosaurus_ were short in comparison to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults)[44] and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws.[45] The arms were powerful,[46] and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2 ulna/humerus ratio).[47] The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal[48] also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest,[49] and diverged from the others.[50] The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four.[51] The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods.[52] Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles.[53] There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.[54]


Discovery and history

Early discoveries and research

The discovery and early study of _Allosaurus_ is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the Bone Wars of the late 19th century. The first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden in 1869. It came from Middle Park, near Granby, Colorado, probably from Morrison Formation rocks. The locals had identified such bones as "petrified horse hoofs". Hayden sent his specimen to Joseph Leidy, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus _Poekilopleuron_ as _Poicilopleuron_ _valens_.[55] He later decided it deserved its own genus, _Antrodemus_.[56]

_Allosaurus_ itself is based on YPM 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name _Allosaurus fragilis_ in 1877. _Allosaurus_ comes from the Greek _allos/αλλος_, meaning "strange" or "different" and _sauros/σαυρος_, meaning "lizard" or "reptile".[57] It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery.[58][59] The species epithet _fragilis_ is Latin for "fragile", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, north of Cañon City.[60] Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of _Allosaurus_. These include Marsh's _Creosaurus_[61] and _Labrosaurus_,[62] and Cope's _Epanterias_.[63]

In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of _Allosaurus_ in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete _Allosaurus_ and several partial skeletons.[64] In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view.[65] This is the well-known mount poised over a partial _Apatosaurus_ skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.[66]

The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as Samuel Wendell Williston suggested that too many names had been coined.[67] For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish _Allosaurus_ from _Creosaurus_.[68] The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by Charles W. Gilmore in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named _Antrodemus_ by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of _Allosaurus_, and _Antrodemus_ thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority.[69] _Antrodemus_ became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that _Allosaurus_ should be used because _Antrodemus_ was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the geological formation that the single bone of _Antrodemus_ came from is unknown).[70] "_Antrodemus_" has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.[71]

Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries

Although sporadic work at what became known as the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County, Utah had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William L. Stokes in 1945,[72] major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40 institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965.[73] The quarry is notable for the predominance of _Allosaurus_ remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod _Allosaurus fragilis_ (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46 _A. fragilis_ have been found there, out of at minimum 73 dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to drought-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep.[74] Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved _Allosaurus_ remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than [75] to long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused.[76]

Recent work: 1980s–present

The period since Madsen's monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning _Allosaurus_ in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation,[77] growth,[78][79] skull construction,[80] hunting methods,[81] the brain,[82] and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care.[83] Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens),[84][85] new discoveries in Portugal,[86] and several very complete new specimens[87][88][89] have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.

"Big Al" and "Big Al Two"

.]] In 1991 "Big Al" (MOR 693), a 95% complete, partially articulated specimen of _Allosaurus_ was discovered. It measured about 8 meters (about 26 ft) in length. MOR 693 was excavated near Shell, Wyoming, by a joint Museum of the Rockies and University of Wyoming Geological Museum team.[90] This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber. In 1996 the same team discovered a second _Allosaurus_, "Big Al Two", which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date.[91]

The completeness, preservation, and scientific importance of this skeleton gave "Big Al" its name; the individual itself was below the average size for _Allosaurus fragilis_,[92] and was a subadult estimated at only 87% grown.[93] The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996.[94] Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of infection, which may have contributed to "Big Al's" death. Pathologic bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed osteomyelitis, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait.[95] Al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an involucrum. The infection was long lived, perhaps up to 6 months.[96] Big Al Two is also known to have multiple injuries.[97]

Species

, when it was still partially encased in matrix]] There are currently four valid and one undescribed species of _Allosaurus_ (_A. amplus_,[98] _A. europaeus_,[99] the type species _A. fragilis_,[100] the as-yet not formally described "A. jimmadseni",[101] and _A. lucasi_[102]).

_A. fragilis_ is the type species and was named by Marsh in 1877.[103] It is known from the remains of at least sixty individuals, all found in the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.[104] Details of the humerus (upper arm) of _A. fragilis_ have been used as diagnostic among Morrison theropods,[105] but the discovery of "A. jimmadseni" indicates that this will no longer be the case at the species level.[106]

Daniel Chure's work on Morrison allosaurid remains has been responsible, directly or indirectly, for "A. jimmadseni" and _A. maximus_. "A. jimmadseni" is the proposed name for a new species of Morrison allosaur, based on a nearly complete skeleton and skull.[107][108] It differs from _A. fragilis_ in several anatomical details including a jugal or cheekbone with a straight lower margin, and is confined to the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, while _A. fragilis_ is only present in the higher Brushy Basin Member.[109]

_A. fragilis_, "A. jimmadseni", _A. amplus_, and _A. lucasi_ are all known from remains discovered in the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. _A. fragilis_ is regarded as the most common, known from the remains of at least sixty individuals.[110] For a while in the late 1980s and early 1990s it was common to recognize _A. fragilis_ as the short-snouted species, with the long-snouted taxon being _A. atrox_;[111][112] however, subsequent analysis of specimens from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Como Bluff, and Dry Mesa Quarry showed that the differences seen in the Morrison Formation material could be attributed to individual variation.[113][114] A study of skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns, and the proposed differentiation of "A. jimmadseni" based on the shape of the jugal.[115] _A. europaeus_ was found in the Kimmeridgian-age Porto Novo Member of the Lourinhã Formation,[116] but may be the same as _A. fragilis_.[117]

_Allosaurus_ material from Portugal was first reported in 1999 on the basis of MHNUL/AND.001, a partial skeleton including a quadrate, vertebrae, ribs, gastralia, chevrons, part of the hips, and hindlimbs. This specimen was assigned to _A. fragilis_,[118] but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck (ML 415) near Lourinhã, in the Kimmeridgian-age Porto Novo Member of the Lourinhã Formation, spurred the naming of the new species _A. europaeus_. It differs from other species of _Allosaurus_ in cranial details.[119] However, more material may show it to be _A. fragilis_, as originally described.[120]

The issue of species and potential synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of _Allosaurus fragilis_ (catalog number YPM 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, and thus the genus _Allosaurus_ itself or at least the species _A. fragilis_ would be a _nomen dubium_ ("dubious name", based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, Gregory S. Paul and Kenneth Carpenter (2010) submitted a petition to the ICZN to have the name "_A. fragilis"_ officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a neotype). This request is currently pending review.[121]

Synonyms

_Creosaurus_, _Epanterias_, and _Labrosaurus_ are regarded as junior synonyms of _Allosaurus_.[122] Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of _A. fragilis_, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is _Labrosaurus ferox_, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down.[123] Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal,[124] and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction.[125] It is now regarded as an example of _A. fragilis._[126]

In his 1988 book _Predatory Dinosaurs of the World_, the freelance dinosaurologist Gregory Paul proposed that _A. fragilis_ had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species _A. atrox_, and was not a different gender due to rarity.[127] _Allosaurus atrox_ was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, _Creosaurus_, and is based on YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones.[128] Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works,[129] the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to _atrox_, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative _A. atrox_ specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.[130]

"Allosaurus agilis", seen in Zittel, 1887, and Osborn, 1912, is a typographical error for _A. fragilis._[131] "Allosaurus ferox" is a typographical error by Marsh for _A. fragilis_ in a figure caption for the partial skull YPM 1893,[132] and YPM 1893 has been treated as a specimen of _A fragilis._[133] Likewise, "Labrosaurus fragilis" is a typographical error by Marsh (1896) for _Labrosaurus ferox_.[134] "A. whitei" is a nomen nudum coined by Pickering in 1996 for the complete _Allosaurus_ specimens that Paul referred to _A. atrox_.[135]

Formerly assigned species and fossils

'' holotype tail vertebra (above) compared to same of _Allosaurus_ (below)]] Several species initially classified within or referred to _Allosaurus_ do not belong within the genus. _A. medius_ was named by Marsh in 1888 for various specimens from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland,[136] although most of the remains were removed by Richard Swann Lull to the new ornithopod species _Dryosaurus grandis_, except for a tooth.[137] Gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to _Dryptosaurus_, as _D. medius_.[138] The referral was not accepted in the most recent review, and _Allosaurus medius_ was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod.[139] It may be closely related to _Acrocanthosaurus_.[140]

_Allosaurus valens_ is a new combination for _Antrodemus valens_ used by Friedrich von Huene in 1932;[141] _Antrodemus valens_ itself may also pertain to _Allosaurus fragilis_,[142] as Gilmore suggested in 1920.[143]

_A. lucaris_, another Marsh name, was given to a partial skeleton in 1878.[144] He later decided it warranted its own genus, _Labrosaurus_,[145] but this has not been accepted, and _A. lucaris_ is also regarded as another specimen of _A. fragilis_.[146] _Allosaurus lucaris_, is known mostly from vertebrae, sharing characters with _Allosaurus_.[147] Paul and Carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species, YPM 1931, was from a younger age than _Allosaurus_, and might represent a different genus. However, they found that the specimen was undiagnostic, and thus _A. lucaris_ was a _nomen dubium_.[148]

_Allosaurus sibiricus_ was described in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin on the basis of a bone, later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal, from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia, Russia.[149] It was transferred to _Chilantaisaurus_ in 1990,[150] but is now considered a _nomen dubium_ indeterminate beyond Theropoda.[151]

_Allosaurus meriani_ was a new combination by George Olshevsky for _Megalosaurus meriani_ Greppin, 1870, based on a tooth from the Late Jurassic of Switzerland.[152][153] However, a recent overview of _Ceratosaurus_ included it in _Ceratosaurus_ sp.[154]

_Apatodon mirus_, based on a scrap of vertebra Marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of _Allosaurus fragilis_.[155][156] However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure,[157] and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of _Apatodon_ with _Allosaurus_ was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the _Apatodon_ holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.[158]

_A. amplexus_ was named by Gregory S. Paul for giant Morrison allosaur remains, and included in his conception _Saurophagus maximus_ (later _Saurophaganax_).[159] _A. amplexus_ was originally coined by Cope in 1878 as the type species of his new genus _Epanterias_,[160] and is based on what is now AMNH 5767, parts of three vertebrae, a coracoid, and a metatarsal.[161] Following Paul's work, this species has been accepted as a synonym of _A. fragilis_.[162] A 2010 study by Paul and Kenneth Carpenter, however, indicates that _Epanterias_ is temporally younger than the _A. fragilis_ type specimen, so is a separate species at minimum.[163]

_A. maximus_ was a new combination by David K. Smith for Chure's _Saurophaganax maximus_, a taxon created by Chure in 1995 for giant allosaurid remains from the Morrison of Oklahoma. These remains had been known as _Saurophagus_, but that name was already in use, leading Chure to propose a substitute.[164] Smith, in his 1998 analysis of variation, concluded that _S. maximus_ was not different enough from _Allosaurus_ to be a separate genus, but did warrant its own species, _A. maximus_.[165] This reassignment was rejected in the most recent review of basal tetanurans.[166]

There are also several species left over from the synonymizations of _Creosaurus_ and _Labrosaurus_ with _Allosaurus_. _Creosaurus potens_ was named by Lull in 1911 for a vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland.[167] It is now regarded as a dubious theropod.[168] _Labrosaurus stechowi_, described in 1920 by Janensch based on isolated _Ceratosaurus_-like teeth from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania,[169] Although Donald F. Glut listed it as a species of _Allosaurus_,[170] it is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to _Ceratosaurus_.[171][172] _L. sulcatus_, named by Marsh in 1896 for a Morrison theropod tooth,[173] which like _L. stechowi_ is now regarded as a dubious _Ceratosaurus_-like ceratosaur.[174][175] _A. tendagurensis_ was named in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) found in the Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania.[176] Although tabulated as a tentatively valid species of _Allosaurus_ in the second edition of the Dinosauria,[177] subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid.[178][179] Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around 10 meters long (33 ft) and 2.5 metric tons (2.8 short tons) in weight.[180]

Kurzanov and colleagues in 2003 designated six teeth from Siberia as _Allosaurus_ sp. (meaning the authors found the specimens to be most like those of _Allosaurus_, but did not or could not assign a species).[181] Also, reports of _Allosaurus_ in Shanxi, China go back to at least 1982.[182]

An astragalus (ankle bone) thought to belong to a species of _Allosaurus_ was found at Cape Paterson, Victoria in Early Cretaceous beds in southeastern Australia. It was thought to provide evidence that Australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere.[183] This identification was challenged by Samuel Welles, who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid,[184] but the original authors defended their identification.[185] With fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at, Daniel Chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not _Allosaurus_, but could represent an allosauroid.[186] Similarly, Yoichi Azuma and Phil Currie, in their description of _Fukuiraptor_, noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus.[187] This specimen is sometimes referred to as "Allosaurus robustus", an informal museum name.[188] It may have belonged to something similar to, or the same as, _Australovenator_,[189] or it may represent an abelisaur.[190]


Classification

_Allosaurus_ was an allosaurid, a member of a family of large theropods within the larger group Carnosauria. The family name Allosauridae was created for this genus in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh,[191] but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that eventually became a wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of _Antrodemus_ for _Allosaurus_ during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on _Allosaurus_ in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name "Megalosauridae" instead of "Allosauridae" include Gilmore, 1920,[192] von Huene, 1926,[193] Romer, 1956 and 1966,[194][195] Steel, 1970,[196] and Walker, 1964.[197]

Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to _Allosaurus_ included _Indosaurus_, _Piatnitzkysaurus_, _Piveteausaurus_, _Yangchuanosaurus_,[198] _Acrocanthosaurus_, _Chilantaisaurus_, _Compsosuchus_, _Stokesosaurus_, and _Szechuanosaurus_.[199] Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like _Acrocanthosaurus_ and _Yangchuanosaurus_, are members of closely related families.[200] Below is a cladogram by Benson _et al._ in 2010.[201]

Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae,[202] Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae.[203] Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's _Predatory Dinosaurs of the World_,[204] but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria.[205] Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only _Saurophaganax_ and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides _Allosaurus_ in the most recent review.[206] Another genus, _Epanterias_, is a potential valid member, but it and _Saurophaganax_ may turn out to be large examples of _Allosaurus_.[207] Recent reviews have kept the genus _Saurophaganax_ and included _Epanterias_ with _Allosaurus_.[208][209]


Paleobiology

Life history

]] The wealth of _Allosaurus_ fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggs—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of _Allosaurus_.[210] Based on histological analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28 years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like _Tyrannosaurus_. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age 15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150 kilograms (330 lb) per year.[211]

Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds) has been reported in at least one _Allosaurus_ specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry.[212] Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the _Allosaurus_ individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this _Allosaurus_ individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this _Allosaurus_ individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead.[213] However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of _Tyrannosaurus_, it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the _Allosaurus_ in question was indeed female.[214] The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger _Allosaurus_ were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood.[215] The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression.[216] Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.[217]

Feeding

]] Paleontologists accept _Allosaurus_ as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on _Stegosaurus_, including an _Allosaurus_ tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a _Stegosaurus_ tail spike, and a _Stegosaurus_ neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an _Allosaurus_ snout.[218] Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones.[219] However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, _Allosaurus_ was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods.[220] Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults.[221][222] Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing _Allosaurus_ to Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although _Allosaurus_ did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.[223] (1998) and Rayfield _et al._ (2001).]] Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using finite element analysis on an _Allosaurus_ skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 8,724 N,[224][225] but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500 N of vertical force against the tooth row.[226] The authors suggested that _Allosaurus_ used its skull like a machete against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike _Tyrannosaurus_, which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods.[227] Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey.[228] The original authors noted that _Allosaurus_ itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress.[229] Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like _Allosaurus_ were "flesh grazers" which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later.[230] An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea.[231] This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey.[232] Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager _et al._ from the University of Bristol also indicate _Allosaurus_ could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with _Tyrannosaurus_ and the therizinosaurid _Erlikosaurus_ in the same study, it was found that _Allosaurus_ had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 92 degree angle at maximum. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.[233][234]

A biomechanical study published in 2013 by Eric Snively and colleagues found that _Allosaurus_ had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the longissimus capitis superficialis neck muscle compared to other theropods such as _Tyrannosaurus_. This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to falcons, such as kestrels: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh. This differs from the prey-handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids, which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull, similar to crocodilians.[235] In addition, _Allosaurus_ was able to "move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control", at the cost of power.[236] Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of _Allosaurus_ limited potential binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks.[237] The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close,[238] and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things.[239] Finally, the top speed of _Allosaurus_ has been estimated at 30 to 55 kilometers per hour (19 to 34 miles per hour).[240]

A new paper on the cranio-dental morphology of _Allosaurus_ and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off to allow for the widened gape.[241]

Social behavior

It has been speculated since the 1970s that _Allosaurus_ preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups.[242] Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature.[243][244][245] Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food.[246] However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods,[247] and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia[248] and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named _Labrosaurus ferox_ is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.[249]

Although _Allosaurus_ may have hunted in packs,[250] it has been argued that _Allosaurus_ and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple _Allosaurus_ individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that _Allosaurus_ individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites.[251] There is some evidence for cannibalism in _Allosaurus_, including _Allosaurus_ shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade,[252] and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.[253]

Brain and senses

The brain of _Allosaurus_, as interpreted from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was more consistent with crocodilian brains than those of the other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so _Allosaurus_ probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.[254]

Paleopathology

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. _Allosaurus_ was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that _Allosaurus_ had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than _Albertosaurus_, _Ornithomimus_ or _Archaeornithomimus_. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in "statistically indistinguishable" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined _Allosaurus_ fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in _Allosaurus_ provide evidence for "very active" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.[255]

The left scapula and fibula of an _Allosaurus fragilis_ specimen catalogued as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and "formed pseudoarthroses". A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male _Allosaurus fragilis_ was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the gastralia right scapula, manual phalanx I left ilium metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had "a large hole... caused by a blow from above".The near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an involucrum.[256] Other pathologies reported in _Allosaurus_ include: Willow breaks in two ribs. Healed fractures in the humerus and radius. Distortion of joint surfaces in the foot possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues. Osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia.[257] Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues. "[E]xtensive 'neoplastic' ankylosis of caudals," possibly due to physical trauma as well as the fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra near the end of the tail. Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. "[E]xtensive exostoses" in the first phalanx of the third toe. Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae. Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals. Exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease. A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture.[258]


Paleoecology

'' rearing to defend itself against a pair of _Allosaurus_]] _Allosaurus_ was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens,[259] and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web.[260] The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains.[261] Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the _Araucaria_-like conifer _Brachyphyllum_.[262] (yellow) where _Allosaurus_ remains have been found]] The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods _Ceratosaurus_, _Ornitholestes_, _Tanycolagreus_, and _Torvosaurus_, the sauropods _Haplocanthosaurus_, _Camarasaurus_, _Cathetosaurus_, _Brachiosaurus_, _Suuwassea_, _Apatosaurus_, _Brontosaurus_, _Barosaurus_, _Diplodocus_, _Supersaurus_, and _Amphicoelias_, and the ornithischians _Camptosaurus_, _Dryosaurus_, and _Stegosaurus_.[263] _Allosaurus_ is commonly found at the same sites as _Apatosaurus_, _Camarasaurus_, _Diplodocus_, and _Stegosaurus_.[264] The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where _Allosaurus_ is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger marine influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly _Allosaurus_, _Ceratosaurus_, _Torvosaurus_, and _Stegosaurus_), or have a close counterpart (_Brachiosaurus_ and _Lusotitan_, _Camptosaurus_ and _Draconyx_).[265]

_Allosaurus_ coexisted with fellow large theropods _Ceratosaurus_ and _Torvosaurus_ in both the United States and Portugal.[266] The three appear to have had different ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains.[267] _Ceratosaurus_, better known than _Torvosaurus_, differed noticeably from _Allosaurus_ in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth.[268] _Allosaurus_ was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an _Allosaurus_ pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably _Ceratosaurus_ or _Torvosaurus_. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the _Allosaurus_ was being scavenged.[269]


In popular culture

Along with _Tyrannosaurus_, _Allosaurus_ has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in western popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in American museums, due in particular to the excavations at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38 museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts.[270] _Allosaurus_ is the official state fossil of Utah alongside _Utahraptor_.[271]

_Allosaurus_ has been depicted in popular culture since the early years of the 20th century. It is top predator in both Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel, _The Lost World_, and its 1925 film adaptation, the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs.[272] _Allosaurus_ was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film _The Beast of Hollow Mountain_,[273] and the 1969 film _The Valley of Gwangi_, two genre combinations of living dinosaurs with Westerns. In _The Valley of Gwangi_, Gwangi is billed as an _Allosaurus_, although Ray Harryhausen based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a _Tyrannosaurus_. Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview "They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other."[274] In the 1974 Sid and Marty Krofft Saturday morning live-action series _Land of the Lost_, an _Allosaurus_ dubbed "Big Alice," created using stop-motion animation, was the primary antagonist in many episodes. In _Dinosaucers_, an animated television series of 1987, Allo is an evolved _Allosaurus_ and the leader of the Dinosaucers, a group composed of intelligent anthropomorphic dinosaurs or other prehistoric saurian species from the planet Reptilon. The 1998 animated film _The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock_ features an _Allosaurus_ as the main antagonist, bent on making a meal out of the main characters. It also appears in a flashback in the 2007 TV series. _Allosaurus_ is featured in _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ as among the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar trying to escape a volcano eruption, and eventually transferred to the mainland.

_Allosaurus_ appeared in the second and fifth episode of the 1999 BBC television series _Walking with Dinosaurs_ and the follow-up special _The Ballad of Big Al_, which speculated on the life of the "Big Al" specimen, based on scientific evidence from the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton, and it is the only dinosaur to feature in multiple episodes of the documentary series.[275] _Allosaurus_ also made an appearance in the Discovery Channel series _Dinosaur Revolution_. Its depiction in this series was based upon a specimen with a smashed lower jaw that was uncovered by paleontologist Thomas Holtz.[276] _Allosaurus_ appears in the 2011 BBC docu-mini-series _Planet Dinosaur_ in the episode "Fight for Life".
