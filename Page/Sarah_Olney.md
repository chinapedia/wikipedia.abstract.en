SARAH JANE OLNEY (__ MCGIBBON; born 1977)[1][2][3] is a British Liberal Democrat politician and an accountant. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park for six months from a by-election in December 2016 to the general election in June 2017, having won the seat from the Conservatives.


Early life and career

Olney was born in Surrey.[4] She was educated at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham and then studied English Literature at King's College London.[5][6]

Olney is a qualified accountant.[7] She worked as an accountant at Barclays, Arts & Business, Distilled Ltd, SCi Sales Group and the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington until she entered politics after the 2015 General Election.[8][9]


Political career

Olney joined the Liberal Democrats in July 2015, soon after the general election, in realisation that she was a liberal dissatisfied with the direction of the United Kingdom.[10][11]

On 25 October 2016, Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith announced his resignation from the House of Commons over his objection to his party's support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, triggering a by-election in his seat of Richmond Park.[12] Goldsmith stood in the by-election as an independent candidate although he remained a Conservative party member. On 30 October 2016, Olney was announced as the Liberal Democrats' candidate for the by-election.[13][14]

On 1 December 2016, Olney was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park.[15] She received 20,510 votes (49.6% of total votes), giving her a majority of 1,872 votes (4.5%).[16] She was the only female Liberal Democrat MP in the 2015–2017 parliament.

In the 2017 general election, Olney narrowly lost her seat to Goldsmith, who stood as the Conservative candidate, polling 45.07% of the vote to Goldsmith's 45.14%, giving Goldsmith a majority of 45.[17]

On 9 September 2017 it was announced that she would be taking up the post of chief of staff for Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable.[18] On 6 November 2017, Olney announced that she had resigned from the job after just six weeks, citing her determination to re-contest her former parliamentary constituency, and the incompatibility of this with the Chief of Staff job. Instead, she was retained by the party on her full-time Chief of Staff salary of £68,000, but for a part-time role as "Special Projects Manager".[19]

It was reported in April 2018 that Olney had been interviewed under caution by the police for allegedly breaking official spending limits in the Richmond Park by-election. The Crown Proecution Service ruled that there was no evidence to show that the breach of spending limits was deliberate, so the case was later closed.[20]

In 2019, it was reported by the Guido Fawkes political blog that Olney had been deselected by her local party as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Richmond Park.[21] However, a week later she was officially confirmed as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the next general election.[22]

Views

Olney opposes the building of a third runway at Heathrow Airport.[23] On the topic of Brexit, Olney voted against the triggering of Article 50, as she had indicated during the by-election campaign that she would do.[24][25] She believes another referendum should be held once the exact terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been announced.[26]

_Sunday Times_ Political Editor Tim Shipman subsequently wrote that at the 2017 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats had been due to announce a policy legalising prostitution and taxing the proceeds, but that the policy had been shelved three days prior to their manifesto's launch due to Olney's opposition, citing her belief that the policy would be "morally indefensible on the doorstep."[27]


Personal life

Olney has two children with her husband Ben, a town planner.[28]
