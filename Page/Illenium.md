Several of his songs have appeared on the _Billboard_ Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart including, most recently, the collaborative single with Jon Bellion, "Good Things Fall Apart", which peaked at number 8. Illenium has also worked on numerous notable remixes, including those for The Chainsmokers' "Don't Let Me Down" and Flume's "Say It", the latter of which won the award for "Remix of the Year" at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards in 2017.


Early life and education

Nicholas D. Miller was born in Chicago[1] but grew up largely in San Francisco.[2] In 2008, Miller began making electronic music. In the summer of 2012, he saw Bassnectar perform at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and decided to focus on music more earnestly after that.[3] That year, he also suffered a heroin overdose, a fact he shared with his fans in 2018. The experience was the inspiration for his 2018 song, "Take You Down".[4] In 2013, Miller moved to Denver, where he continues to reside.[5][6] He also enrolled in (but never finished) the music-business program at the University of Colorado Denver while working on his first EP. In the meantime, he coached lacrosse and delivered sushi to support himself.[7]


Career

2013–2015: Early career, two EPs, and collaborations

Illenium released his first self-titled EP in May 2013 on Prep School Recordings.[8] That year, he also released a remix of Florence and the Machine's "Over the Love".[9] In January 2014, he independently released his follow-up EP, _Risen_, which contained the song "Drop Our Hearts" featuring Sirma.[10] He also continued releasing remixes, including those for Lana Del Rey's "Flipside"[11] and Odesza's "Always This Late".[12]

In 2015, Illenium released several singles, including "Chosen You",[13] "Painted White" (with Said the Sky and Christina Soto),[14] and "I'll Be Your Reason" (featuring Eden). The latter song was released on Skrillex's Nest HQ platform.[15] Illenium's remixes that year included those for Galantis' "Gold Dust"[16] and Kaskade's "Disarm You" (featuring Ilsey).[17]

2017–2018: _Awake_ and numerous appearances on _Billboard_ charts

In February 2017, Illenium released the song "Fractures" featuring Nevve.[32] He followed that with the collaborative single, "Feel Good", with Gryffin and featuring Daya in March 2017.[33] Both songs charted on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart (at number 42 and 17, respectively).[34] In July 2017, Illenium collaborated with EDM duo, Zeds Dead, to produce the track "Where The Wild Things Are".[35] The following month, he released the single, "Crawl Outta Love" featuring Annika Wells.[36] The song would peak at number 35 on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart[37] and also won Illenium (and his writing partners) the top prize of the International Songwriting Competition the following year.[38]

In September 2017, Illenium released his sophomore album, _Awake_, on Seeking Blue Records and Kasaya Records.
