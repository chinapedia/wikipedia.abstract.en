An ATTRACT-KILL PATTERN is an interaction between plant roots and pathogen, which plays an important role in suppression of _Phytophthora_ disease in intercropping systems. The recent research from Key Laboratory of Agro-Biodiversity and Pest Management of Education Ministry of China indicated that maize roots attracted the zoospores of _Phytophthora capsici_ and inhibited their motility. Then a large amount of cystospores closed to maize roots were lysed. The phenomenon has been widely found in various interactions between roots of non-host plant and _Phytophthora_.
