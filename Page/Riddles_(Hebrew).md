RIDDLES in Hebrew are referred to as _ḥidot_ (singular _ḥidah_). They have at times been a major and distinctive part of literature in Hebrew and closely related languages. At times they have a complex relationship with proverbs.[1]


In the Bible

Riddles are not common in the Bible,[2] nor in Midrashic literature,[3] though other tests of verbal wit are. The most prominent riddle in the Bible is Samson's riddle: Samson outwitted the Philistines by posing a riddle about the lion and the beehive until they learned the answer from his Philistine bride, costing Samson 30 suits of clothes (Judges 14:5-18).[4] However, some passages in the Book of Proverbs in which sets of three or four objects are mentioned (e.g. 30:15 _et seq._) were likely originally in the form of riddles, while Ezekiel 17:1-10 is also a riddle of sorts.[5]


In post-Biblical and rabbinic literature

Sirach mentions riddles as a popular dinner pastime.

The Talmud contains several riddles, such as this one from the end of Kinnim: 'What animal has one voice living and seven voices dead?' ('The ibis, from whose carcass seven different musical instruments are made').[6]

The Aramaic _Story of Ahikar_ contains a long section of proverbial wisdom that in some versions also contains riddles.[7]

Solomon and the Queen of Sheba

The Bible describes how the Queen of Sheba tests Solomon with riddles, but without giving any hint as to what they were.[8] On this basis, riddles were ascribed to the Queen in later writings. Four riddles are ascribed to her in the tenth- or eleventh-century _Midrash Proverbs_,[9][10] including the following: 'She said to him: "Seven exit and nine enter, two pour and one drinks". He said to her: "Surely, seven days of menstruation exit and nine months of pregnancy enter, two breasts pour and the baby drinks".’[11] These plus another fourteen or fifteen tests of wisdom, some of which are riddles, appear in the _Midrash ha-Ḥefez_ (1430 CE), for example:[12]

-   There is an enclosure with ten doors: when one is open nine are shut; when nine are open, one is shut. — The womb, the bodily orifices, and the umbilical cord.
-   Living, moves not, yet when its head is cut off it moves. — A ship in the sea (made from a tree).
-   What was that which is produced from the ground, yet produces it, while its food is the fruit of the ground? — A wick.[13]

The early medieval Aramaic _Targum Sheni_ also contains three riddles posed by the Queen to Solomon.[14]


In the Middle Ages

Under the influence of Arabic literature in medieval al-Andalus, there was a flourishing of literary Hebrew riddles in verse during the Middle Ages. Dunash ben Labrat (920-990), credited with transposing Arabic metres into Hebrew, composed a number of riddles, mostly apparently inspired by folk-riddles.[15] Exponents included Moses ibn Ezra, Yehuda Alharizi, Judah Halevi, [16] and Abraham ibn Ezra.[17] Immanuel the Roman wrote riddles, as did Israel Onceneyra.[18] The tradition extended to Italy from the twelfth century, beginning with the work of Yerahmiel Bar Shlomo.[19]

For example, Moses ibn Ezra asked 'What is the sister of the sun, though made for the night? The first causes her tears to fall, and when she is near dying they cut off her head'. (The answer is 'a candle'.)[20] Judah Halevi asked:

      Evincing the infinite--

          the size of your palm--

      what it holds is beyond you,

          curious, at hand.[21]

(The answer is 'hand-mirror'.)

There is also 'a curious riddle' at the end of the Haggadah.[22]


Post-medieval

In Hebrew-speaking Spain and Italy during around 1650-1850, a baroque sub-genre of the literary riddle called _ḥiddat hatsurah vehalo‘ez_ (literally 'riddles of an emblem with foreign-language passages', known in English simply as 'emblem riddles') flourished. The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (_lo‘ez_) in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase _Eh ko nistarti_ ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word _eco_ ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew _hed_) is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an 'emblem' (_tsurah_) near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were occasional, composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.[23]
