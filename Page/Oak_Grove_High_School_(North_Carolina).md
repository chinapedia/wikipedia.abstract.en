OAK GROVE HIGH SCHOOL is a public high school in Midway, North Carolina, which opened in August 2017. The school is a part of the Davidson County Schools system, and is to help with the overcrowded Ledford Senior and North Davidson High Schools.


History

Oak Grove first came to light in 2012, when the Davidson County Schools Board of Education approved a middle school in the Oak Grove area, to help with overcrowding at North Davidson and Ledford Middle schools. At the time, North Davidson High and Ledford Senior were past max student capacity. The long-awaited news came when the board approved for a new high school to be built near the current Oak Grove Middle School, and a bid was formally accepted in November 2015, for Samet to start construction.[1] Hiring for Oak Grove began in early January 2017, with the posting guidance and athletic staff. Most of the school officially opened to students on August 28, 2017, (excludes the gym, Auxiliary gym, Fine Arts department, auditorium, and athletic facilities). The second half of the building opened on October 2, 2017.

For the first year of the school, it is only open to Freshman and Sophomores, Juniors will be added in year two, and Seniors the following year. The "Class of 2020" will be Oak Grove's first graduating class and the "Class of 2021" will be the first four-year graduating class.
