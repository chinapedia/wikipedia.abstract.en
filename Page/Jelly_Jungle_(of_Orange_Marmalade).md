"JELLY JUNGLE (OF ORANGE MARMALADE)" is a song written and composed by Paul Leka (who also produced it) and Shelly Pinz. It was the final chart hit by the 1960s Ohio-based rock group The Lemon Pipers.

Released in the spring of 1968, it spent five weeks on the U.S. _Billboard_ Hot 100, peaking at No. 51, and seven weeks on the _Cash Box_ Top 100, peaking at No. 30.[1] It reached No. 26 in Australia and No. 20 in Canada.[2]

The song contains psychedelic imagery, mostly focused on the color orange: marmalade jelly jungle, sunshine boy, rainbow ladder, yellow ball of butter, fluffy parachute clouds, tangerine dreams, pumpkin drum, carrot trumpets, and violins growing like peaches.
