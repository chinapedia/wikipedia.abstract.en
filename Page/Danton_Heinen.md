DANTON HEINEN (born July 5, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Bruins in the fourth round, 116th overall, of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.


Playing career

Heinen played junior hockey in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) for the Merritt Centennials and Surrey Eagles before playing American collegiate hockey for the University of Denver Pioneers from 2014 to 2016.[1]

On April 12, 2016, Heinen concluded his collegiate career after his sophomore season with the Pioneers in signing a three-year, entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins, the organization that drafted him in the fourth round, 116th overall, at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.[2] He immediately made his professional debut with the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Bruins, to complete the 2015–16 season.

After his first training camp with Boston, Heinen impressed and was surprisingly kept on the opening night roster for the 2016–17 season. He made his NHL debut on October 13, 2016, in a victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.[3]

Heinen was assigned to the AHL on October 17, 2017, after playing three games during the 2017–18 season.[4] He was called up on October 26, 2017, when he scored his first two NHL goals in a 2–1 win over the San Jose Sharks.[5]
