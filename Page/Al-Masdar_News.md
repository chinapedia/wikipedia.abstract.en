_AL-MASDAR NEWS_ (sometimes abbreviated _AMN_) () is an online newspaper founded by Leith Abou Fadel.[1] Al-Masdar is Arabic for "the source".[2] Al-Masdar's coverage focuses largely on conflict zones in the Middle East: Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Al-Masdar has been described as being pro-president Bashar al-Assad.


Background

_Al-Masdar News_ (AMN) was launched in August 2014 as a media service that provides frontline news and analysis from the Middle East.[3]


Criticism

Following the April 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in the Idlib Governorate, _al-Masdar News_ published an opinion article entitled "Jumping to conclusions; something is not adding up in Idlib chemical weapons attack".[4] A report by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) published three days later described a "digital forensics" trail which showed how this _al-Masdar_ opinion article was later linked by conspiracy, pro-Russian and far-right websites. It described _al-Masdar News_ as "an unofficial government outlet" and said that it had "repeatedly attacked regime critics and witnesses to regime atrocities, notably the White Helmets."[5] _Business Insider_ showed the conclusions in the AMN article differing markedly from those of other analysts.[6] After deputy editor Paul Antonopoulos (author of the controversial opinion article _Jumping to conclusions_) was shown to be active on the neo-Nazi site Stormfront, he was forced to resign from al-Masdar on 28 April 2017.[7] _Al-Masdar_ issued a statement on behalf of its board of directors,[8] saying they found his behaviour "wholly unacceptable" and strongly condemned it, while also apologizing to its readers and all those offended by his actions.[9]

The website was described by the BBC and _Newsweek_ as having a pro-Syrian government viewpoint,[10][11] while _The Independent_ describes it as "sympathetic to the Syrian regime".[12] _The New York Times_ has described it as a "pro-government website".[13] Leonid Bershidsky writing in Bloomberg News, also calls al-Masdar "somewhat pro-Assad."[14]

_Business Insider_ reporter Natasha Bertrand has described Leith Abou Fadel, the editor of _al-Masdar_, as someone who had pushed a conspiracy theory in the past, and described him as an "Assad loyalist".[15]

_The New York Times_ also accused Fadel of spreading unfounded misinformation about a victim of the Petra László incident.[16]
