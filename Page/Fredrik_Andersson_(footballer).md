FREDRIK ANDERSSON (born 25 October 1988 in Skene) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Örgryte IS.


Club career

Andersson started his senior career at his youth club Skene IF. After just one season with the senior team he moved to Division 1 club Örgryte IS. He served as a back-up for three seasons before he became a regular starter in 2014. After an impressive year-and-a-half as the first choice goalkeeper he was signed by reigning Swedish Champions Malmö FF on 27 July 2015.[1] He has since served as the back-up goalkeeper behind Johan Wiland and Johan Dahlin. On 26 October 2016 Andersson made his first team debut for Malmö when he replaced an injured Wiland with 13 minutes to go of the title decider against Falkenbergs FF. Malmö were in the lead by 3-0 at that point, which was also the final score of the game.[2]
