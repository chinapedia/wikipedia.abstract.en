_ROBO RECALL_ is a virtual reality first-person shooter game developed and published by Epic Games for Microsoft Windows. The game uses the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, and was released on March 1, 2017.[1] Players that activate their Oculus Touch virtual reality controllers with its software are able to download the game for free.[2]


Plot

Players control Agent 34, an employee of RoboReady, a leading manufacturer of service robots. As a Recaller, it is the player's job to remove "defective" robots from circulation. After a virus causes RoboReady's products to rebel against their human masters, the Recaller must disable all defective models and find the cause of the virus.


Gameplay

Gameplay takes place from a first-person perspective. The player can access four different weapons: a pistol, a revolver, a shotgun, and a plasma rifle, holstered on the hip or back.[3] Players move by teleporting, which is controlled with the thumbstick. Although principally a shooter, the game allows players to physically grab enemies, dismantle them, throw them, and in some cases use their weaponry against other enemies. Enemy projectiles like bullets and missiles can also be caught and thrown back at enemies. The game awards point bonuses for certain types of kills, and a multiplier for unbroken kill streaks. Scores are uploaded to online rankings at the end of a stage.


Reception

On the day of release the game received an 8.5 out of 10 rating for IGN.[4] _The Guardian_ gave it a score of 5 stars out of 5.[5] It was nominated for "Best VR Game" in _Destructoid_{{'}}s Game of the Year Awards,[6] and for "Best Shooter" and "Best VR Experience" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.[7][8] It won the award for "Best Virtual Reality Game" in _Game Informer_{{'}}s Best of 2017 Awards,[9] and for "Best VR Shooter" in their 2017 Shooter of the Year Awards.[10]
