For several years he also met weekly with Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter to discuss the latter’s multi-faceted career as an international civil servant, MP, cabinet minister, journalist and author. At the same time, he published three books in four years: _1939, The Making of the Second World War_, _Anthony Eden: A Biography_, and _The “X” Documents, The Secret History of Foreign Office Contacts with the German Resistance 1937-1939_. He also acted as a book reviewer for _The Daily Telegraph_.

After a stay of 12 years in London, Aster returned to Canada in 1976 to take up a position with the Department of History, University of Toronto. His teaching interests ranged widely over the span of British history, 1485–present, Irish history from the beginnings to “the time of trouble,” the Welfare State, and diplomatic relations between the great powers.
