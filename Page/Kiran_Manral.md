Biography

Born in Mumbai on 22 June 1971, Manral graduated in English from Mithibai College in 1991. After working as an advertising copywriter, she joined the news service at Mumbai's DSJ TV and went on to work as a feature writer for _The Times of India_ and _Cosmopolitan India_. In 2000, she became a freelance journalist and, from 2005, a blogger creating "Thirtysixandcounting" and "Karmickids". At their height, both were considered to be among the most popular blogs in India,[5][6] before she closed them down in order to devote more time to motherhood.[7]

She then turned to writing, publishing _The Reluctant Detective_ in 2011. Telling the humorous story of how a bored housewife confronted with successive murders becomes a detective, it received generally positive reviews.[8][9] _Once upon a Crush_ which followed in 2014 describes the romance experienced by an office girl who constantly runs into misfortunes.[10] Manral comes up with another intriguing romance in her _All Aboard_ (2015), this time set on a Mediterranean cruise ship. Even _The Times of India_ recommended it as a novel which could not simply be dismissed as "chick-lit". [11]

The same year, Manral published her first non-fiction work, _Karmic Kids_, describing her experience of bringing up her spirited son from childbirth to age ten. One highly positive review calls for the book "to be read by everyone", not just mothers.[12] Set in the Himalayan foothills, her most recent novel, _The Face at the Window_, is in sharp contrast to her earlier works. Described as "a dark brooding story of mysterious, concealed identities", it presents the frightening experiences of a retired school teacher which begin during a violent thunderstorm.[13]
