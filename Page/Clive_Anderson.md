CLIVE STUART ANDERSON (born 10 December 1952 in Stanmore, Middlesex[1]) is an English television and radio presenter, comedy writer and former barrister. Winner of a British Comedy Award in 1991,[2] Anderson began experimenting with comedy and writing comedic scripts during his 15-year legal career, before starring in _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ on BBC Radio 4, then later Channel 4. He has also hosted a number of radio programmes, and made guest appearances on _Have I Got News for You_, _Mock the Week_ and _QI_.[3]


Early life

Anderson was educated at Stanburn Primary School and Harrow County School for Boys[4] where his group of friends included Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Portillo. His Scottish father was manager of the Bradford & Bingley's Wembley branch.[5] Anderson attended Selwyn College, Cambridge, where, from 1974 to 1975, he was President of Footlights.[6] He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1976 and became a practising barrister, specialising in criminal law. While still practising law, he continued performing, including taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe in 1981 with Griff Rhys Jones.[7]


Career

Television

Anderson was involved in the fledgling alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s and was the first act to come on stage at The Comedy Store when it opened in 1979.[8] He made his name as host of the improvised television comedy show _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_, which ran for 10 series.[9]

Anderson hosted his own chat-show, _Clive Anderson Talks Back_, on Channel 4, which ran for 10 series. Anderson moved to the BBC in 1996. The show's name was changed to _Clive Anderson All Talk_ and it was aired on BBC1. In one incident in 1996, Anderson interviewed the Bee Gees, and throughout the interview he repeatedly joked about their songs from the Saturday Night Fever era, ultimately prompting the band to walk out.[10] Anderson once had a glass of water poured over his head by a perturbed Richard Branson, to which Anderson remarked "I'm used to that; I've flown Virgin".[11] He also said to Jeffrey Archer, "There's no beginning to your talents." Archer retorted that "The old jokes are always the best," for Anderson to reply "Yes, I've read your books." The last series of _Clive Anderson All Talk_ aired in 2001.

He has made ten appearances on _Have I Got News for You_. He has also frequently appeared on _QI_. In 2007, he featured as a regular panellist on the ITV comedy show _News Knight_. One heated exchange on _Have I Got News for You_ occurred when he joked to fellow guest Piers Morgan that the _Daily Mirror_ was now, thanks to Morgan (then its editor), almost as good as _The Sun_. When asked by Morgan, "What do you know about editing newspapers?", he swiftly replied, "About as much as you do."

In 2005 he presented the short-lived quiz _Back in the Day_ for Channel 4. On 25 February 2008, he started presenting _Brainbox Challenge_, a new game show, for BBC Two. Later that year, he presented a reality TV talent show-themed television series produced by the BBC entitled _Maestro_, starring eight celebrities. In 2009, Anderson was the television host of the BBC's _Last Night of the Proms_.
