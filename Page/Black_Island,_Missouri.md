BLACK ISLAND is an extinct town in Pemiscot County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

The exact location of the community is unknown to the GNIS.[2] However, coordinates are listed by the GNIS for a church and schoolhouse, now defunct, which once belonged to the community.[3][4] The town was so named on account of their rich soil and for the fact the elevated town site was prone to becoming an island during high water.[5]
