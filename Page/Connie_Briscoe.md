CONNIE BRISCOE (born 1952) is an American writer of romantic and historical fiction. Briscoe's first novel, _Sisters and Lovers_ (1994), sold nearly 500,000 copies in cloth and paperback combined in its first two years.

Darryl Dickson-Carr has characterized Briscoe as "among the better writers to emerge in and benefit from the strong wave of interest in African American fiction that arose in the early 1990s after the publication of Terry McMillan's _Waiting to Exhale_ (1992)."[1]
