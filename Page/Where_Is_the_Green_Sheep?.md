_WHERE IS THE GREEN SHEEP?_ is a children's picture book by Mem Fox and Judy Horacek. It is about various coloured sheep doing various things, with the protagonist, the green sheep, not being seen until the final pages.


Reception

_Booklist_ wrote "Little ones will bounce with anticipation as the simple yet clever text takes them to visit one sheep and then another. .. Laughs and interactive play will ensue among readers and listeners, alone or in groups."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ stated "Basic beginning vocabulary is repeated in this easy-to-read rhyme about different kinds of sheep. .. A welcome addition to the year's flock of easy-readers."[2]

_Kirkus Reviews_ called it "Ideally easy and well-designed."[3] and _Publishers Weekly_ wrote "Parents intrigued by Fox's ideas about early literacy (as expounded in _Reading Magic_, for example) will find this book a useful vehicle for putting her suggestions into practice."[4] _The Horn Book Magazine_ wrote "And here's a book one doesn't see every day: a narrative perfectly attuned to a toddler's sense of playful discovery. .. Horacek's uncluttered watercolors merrily counterbalance the straightforward text and provide numerous opportunities for listeners to identify colors and animals as well as to count objects." and concluded "..this bedtime story is as satisfying as a goodnight kiss."[5] _January Magazine_', in its review, wrote "..this book is .. aimed squarely at children, though it is a surprise for those who know the artist's other work to see her mark on this book.", and described it as "a joyous romp through the lives of sheep" and"a perfect book for bedtime reading with your toddler".[6]

_Where is The Green Sheep?_ appears on the School Library Journal Top 100 Picture Books List[7] and the New York Public Library 100 Great Children's Books of the Last 100 Years list.[8]
