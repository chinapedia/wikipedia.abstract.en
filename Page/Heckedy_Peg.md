Reception

_Booklist_, in a review of _Heckedy Peg_, found "The inherent drama of the story, combined with the haunting images the art provides, gives the picture book a timeless quality. "[1] and the _School Library Journal_ wrote "This story, deep and rich with folk wisdom, is stunningly illustrated with Don Wood's luminous paintings. .. A tour de force in every way."[2] _Kirkus Reviews_ called it "An original fairy tale" and "Admirable, yet, for all its proficiency, almost stolid--perhaps a little less definition would leave more room for the imagination."[3]

_Publishers Weekly_ wrote "Although text and art in this picture book match as hand and glove, it is really the ornate illustrations that carry it aloft to the dimension of classic fairytale" and "The story has essential elements of playfulness and eeriness; also evident is a poetic license that effects a looseness in structure."[4] while Betty Criscoe wrote "A well-written and beautifully illustrated tale, _Heckedly Peg_ contains the characteristics of a classic."[5]
