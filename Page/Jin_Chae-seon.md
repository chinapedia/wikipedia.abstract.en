JIN CHAE-SEON (born 1842[1] or 1847[2]) was a Korean pansori singer, widely regarded as the first female master of a male dominated genre, although she was probably not the first woman to perform pansori, as gisaeng courtesans might have performed it before her.[3][4] She was a master of performing _Chunhyangga_ and _Simcheongga_.[5]


Life and career

Jin was born in what is today Gochang County in North Jeolla province, as the daughter of a female shaman. She had a talent for singing since her childhood. She was discovered by pansori patron Shin Jae-hyo at the age of 17 and learnt pansori singing and performance at his school. He took her in as his student despite the social stigma that did not allow women to perform pansori at the time. At age 22, she was sent by Shin to the palace to perform at a celebratory dinner, disguised as a man. There she caught the attention of Heungseon Daewongun (the father of Gojong of Korea). The Daewongun appreciated Jin's singing talent and kept her at the palace as a court singer. According to the _Doosan Encyclopedia_, Jin became the Daewongun's concubine, as well.[6][7][8]

Shin became devastated at the loss of his student, for whom he had romantic feelings. He dedicated a pansori to her, titled _The song of the Peach Blossom_ (도리화가). When the Daewongun fell out of power, Jin returned to her already ill mentor and stayed by his side until his death. After Shin's passing, she disappeared without a trace and neither the date nor the place of her death is known.[9][10]
