EUGENE CURRAN KELLY (August 23, 1912 – February 2, 1996) was an American dancer, actor of film, stage, and television, singer, film director, producer, and choreographer. He was known for his energetic and athletic dancing style, his good looks, and the likable characters that he played on screen.

Best known today for his performances in films such as _An American in Paris_ (1951), _Anchors Aweigh_ (1945)— for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor—and _Singin' in the Rain_ (1952), he starred in musical films until they fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. He starred in, choreographed, or co-directed some of the most well-regarded musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, debuting with Judy Garland in _For Me and My Gal_ (1942), and followed by _Du Barry Was a Lady_ (1943), _Thousands Cheer_ (1943), _The Pirate_ (1948), _On the Town_ (1949), and _It's Always Fair Weather_ (1955), among others. Later, he starred in two films outside the musical genre: _Inherit the Wind_ (1960) and _What a Way to Go!_ (1964).[1] Kelly directed films without a collaborator (in some of which he starred), including _Hello, Dolly!_ (1969),[2][3][4] which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.[5][6]

His many innovations transformed the Hollywood musical, and he is credited with almost single-handedly making the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.[7]

Kelly received an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for his career achievements, the same year _An American in Paris_ won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He later received lifetime achievement awards in the Kennedy Center Honors (1982), and from the Screen Actors Guild and American Film Institute. In 1999, the American Film Institute also ranked him as the 15th greatest male screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.


Early life

GKellyPittSeniorYB.jpg]]

Kelly was born in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. He was the third son of James Patrick Joseph Kelly, a phonograph salesman, and his wife, Harriet Catherine Curran.[8] His father was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, to an Irish Canadian family. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Derry, Ireland, and his maternal grandmother was of German ancestry.[9] When he was eight, Kelly's mother enrolled him and his brother James in dance classes. As Kelly recalled, they both rebelled: "We didn't like it much and were continually involved in fistfights with the neighborhood boys who called us sissies  ... I didn't dance again until I was 15." [10] At one time, his childhood dream was to play shortstop for the hometown Pittsburgh Pirates.[11] By the time he decided to dance, he was an accomplished sportsman and able to defend himself. He attended St. Raphael Elementary School[12] in the Morningside neighborhood of Pittsburgh and graduated from Peabody High School at age 16. He entered the Pennsylvania State College as a journalism major, but the 1929 crash forced him to work to help his family. He created dance routines with his younger brother Fred to earn prize money in local talent contests. They also performed in local nightclubs.[13]

In 1931, Kelly enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh to study economics, joining the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.[14] He became involved in the university's Cap and Gown Club, which staged original musical productions.[15] After graduating in 1933, he continued to be active with the Cap and Gown Club, serving as the director from 1934 to 1938. Kelly was admitted to the University of Pittsburgh Law School.[16]

His family opened a dance studio in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1932, they renamed it the Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance and opened a second location in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1933. Kelly served as a teacher at the studio during his undergraduate and law-student years at Pitt. In 1931, he was approached by the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Pittsburgh to teach dance, and to stage the annual Kermesse. The venture proved a success, Kelly being retained for seven years until his departure for New York.[17]

Kelly eventually decided to pursue a career as a dance teacher and full-time entertainer, so he dropped out of law school after two months. He increased his focus on performing and later claimed: "With time I became disenchanted with teaching because the ratio of girls to boys was more than ten to one, and once the girls reached 16, the dropout rate was very high."[18] In 1937, having successfully managed and developed the family's dance-school business, he finally did move to New York City in search of work as a choreographer.[19] Kelly returned to Pittsburgh, to his family home at 7514 Kensington Street, by 1940, and worked as a theatrical actor.[20]


Stage career

After a fruitless search for work in New York, Kelly returned to Pittsburgh to his first position as a choreographer with the Charles Gaynor musical revue _Hold Your Hats_ at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in April 1938. Kelly appeared in six of the sketches, one of which, _La cumparsita_, became the basis of an extended Spanish number in the film _Anchors Aweigh_ eight years later.

His first Broadway assignment, in November 1938, was as a dancer in Cole Porter's _Leave It to Me!_—as the American ambassador's secretary who supports Mary Martin while she sings "My Heart Belongs to Daddy". He had been hired by Robert Alton, who had staged a show at the Pittsburgh Playhouse where he was impressed by Kelly's teaching skills. When Alton moved on to choreograph the musical _One for the Money_, he hired Kelly to act, sing, and dance in eight routines. In 1939, he was selected for a musical revue, _One for the Money_, produced by the actress Katharine Cornell, who was known for finding and hiring talented young actors.

Kelly's first big breakthrough was in the Pulitzer Prize–winning _The Time of Your Life_, which opened on October 25, 1939—in which, for the first time on Broadway, he danced to his own choreography. In the same year, he received his first assignment as a Broadway choreographer, for _Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe_. He began dating a cast member, Betsy Blair, and they got married on October 16, 1941.

In 1940, he got the lead role in Rodgers and Hart's _Pal Joey_, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role propelled him to stardom. During its run, he told reporters: "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique get in the way of mood or continuity."[21] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in _Pal Joey_—recalled: "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since 8 in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage ... I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing ... Gene."[22]

Offers from Hollywood began to arrive, but Kelly was in no hurry to leave New York. Eventually, he signed with David O. Selznick, agreeing to go to Hollywood at the end of his commitment to _Pal Joey_, in October 1941. Prior to his contract, he also managed to fit in choreographing the stage production of _Best Foot Forward_.


Film career

1941–45: Becoming established in Hollywood

Gene_Kelly_dancing_with_Jerry_Mouse_("Anchors_Aweigh",_1945).gif of Tom and Jerry in _Anchors Aweigh_ (1945), an iconic performance, which changed at least one critic's opinion of Kelly's skills.]]

Selznick sold half of Kelly's contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for his first motion picture: _For Me and My Gal_ (1942) starring box-office champion Judy Garland. Kelly claimed to be "appalled at the sight of myself blown up 20 times. I had an awful feeling that I was a tremendous flop." _For Me and My Gal_ performed very well, and in the face of much internal resistance, Arthur Freed of MGM picked up the other half of Kelly's contract.[23] After appearing in a cheap B-movie drama, _Pilot No. 5_ (1943) and in _Christmas Holiday_ (1944), he took the male lead in Cole Porter's _Du Barry Was a Lady_ (1943) with Lucille Ball (in a part originally intended for Ann Sothern). His first opportunity to dance to his own choreography came in his next picture, _Thousands Cheer_ (1943), where he performed a mock-love dance with a mop.

He achieved a significant breakthrough as a dancer on film when MGM lent him to Columbia to work with Rita Hayworth in _Cover Girl_ (1944), a film that foreshadowed the best of his future work.[24] He created a memorable routine dancing to his own reflection. Despite this, critic Manny Farber was moved to praise Kelly's "attitude", "clarity", and "feeling" as an actor while inauspiciously concluding, "The two things he does least well—singing and dancing—are what he is given most consistently to do."[25] At the end of 1944, Kelly enlisted in the U.S. Naval Air Service and was commissioned as lieutenant, junior grade. He was stationed in the Photographic Section, Washington D.C., where he was involved in writing and directing a range of documentaries, and this stimulated his interest in the production side of filmmaking.[26][27]

In Kelly's next film, _Anchors Aweigh_ (1945), MGM gave him a free hand to devise a range of dance routines, including his duets with co-star Frank Sinatra and the celebrated animated dance with Jerry Mouse—the animation for which was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. That iconic performance was enough for Farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of Kelly's skills. Reviewing the film, Farber enthused, "Kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in Hollywood movies."[28] _Anchors Aweigh_ became one of the most successful films of 1945 and Kelly was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In _Ziegfeld Follies_ (1946)—which was produced in 1944 but delayed for release—Kelly collaborated with Fred Astaire, for whom he had the greatest admiration, in "The Babbitt and the Bromide" challenge dance routine.

1946–52: MGM

After Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used him in a routine, black-and-white movie: _Living in a Big Way_ (1947). The film was considered so weak that the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines; they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a lead part in his next picture, with Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli—a musical film version of S.N. Behrman's play, _The Pirate_ (1948), with songs by Cole Porter, in which Kelly plays the lead opposite Garland. _The Pirate_ gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism. It features Kelly's work with the Nicholas Brothers—the leading black dancers of their day—in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was ahead of its time, but flopped at the box office.

An_American_in_Paris_(1951)_trailer_1.jpg and Kelly in the trailer for _An American in Paris_ (1951)]] MGM wanted Kelly to return to safer and more commercial vehicles, but he ceaselessly fought for an opportunity to direct his own musical film. In the interim, he capitalized on his swashbuckling image as d'Artagnan in _The Three Musketeers_ (also 1948)—and also appeared with Vera-Ellen in the _Slaughter on Tenth Avenue_ ballet in _Words and Music_ (1948 again). He was due to play the male lead opposite Garland in _Easter Parade_ (1948), but broke his ankle playing volleyball. He withdrew from the film and convinced Fred Astaire to come out of retirement to replace him.[29] There followed _Take Me Out to the Ball Game_ (1949), his second film with Sinatra, where Kelly paid tribute to his Irish heritage in "The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day" routine. This musical film persuaded Arthur Freed to have Kelly make _On the Town_ (also 1949), in which he partnered with Frank Sinatra for the third and final time. A breakthrough in the musical film genre, it has been described as "the most inventive and effervescent musical thus far produced in Hollywood."[30]

Stanley Donen, brought to Hollywood by Kelly to be his assistant choreographer, received co-director credit for _On the Town_. According to Kelly: "when you are involved in doing choreography for film, you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one to work with the cameraman on the timing ... without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney, and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. When we came to do _On the Town_, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss–assistant anymore but co-creators."[31][32] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the "Day in New York" routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett, and Miller.[33]

Kelly asked the studio for a straight acting role and he took the lead role in the early mafia melodrama _Black Hand_ (1950). This exposé of organized crime is set in New York's "Little Italy" during the late 19th century and focuses on the Black Hand, a group that extorts money upon threat of death. In real-life incidents upon which this film is based, it was the Mafia, not the Black Hand, who functioned as the villain. Filmmakers had to tread gingerly whenever dealing with big-time crime, it being safer to go after a "dead" criminal organization than a "live" one. There followed _Summer Stock_ (1950)—Garland's last musical film for MGM—in which Kelly performed the "You, You Wonderful You" solo routine with a newspaper and a squeaky floorboard. In his book "Easy the Hard Way", Joe Pasternak, head of one of the other musical units within MGM, singled out Kelly for his patience and willingness to spend as much time as necessary to enable the ailing Garland to complete her part.[34]

Then followed in quick succession two musicals that secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film. First, _An American in Paris_ (1951) and—probably the most admired of all film musicals—_Singin' in the Rain_ (1952). As co-director, lead star, and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force in both of these films. Johnny Green, the head of music at MGM at the time, said of him,

  Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel, but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something, he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.[35]

_An American in Paris_ won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film also marked the debut of 19-year-old ballerina Leslie Caron, whom Kelly had spotted in Paris and brought to Hollywood. Its dream ballet sequence, lasting an unprecedented 17 minutes, was the most expensive production number ever filmed at that time. Bosley Crowther described it as, "whoop-de-doo ... one of the finest ever put on the screen."[36] Also in 1951, Kelly received an honorary Academy Award for his contribution to film musicals and the art of choreography.

Singin'_In_The_Rain_Lobby_Card_1_(cropped).jpg for _Singin' in the Rain_]] The following year, _Singin' in the Rain_ featured Kelly's celebrated and much imitated solo dance routine to the title song, along with the "Moses Supposes" routine with Donald O'Connor and the "Broadway Melody" finale with Cyd Charisse. Though the film did not initially generate the same enthusiasm _An American in Paris_ created, it has subsequently overtaken the earlier film to occupy its current pre-eminent place in the esteem of critics.[37]

1953–57: The decline of the Hollywood musical

At the peak of his creative powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some see as a mistake.[38] In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for 19 months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one of these pictures was a musical, _Invitation to the Dance_, a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.

When Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture _Brigadoon_ (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing him to make the film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also had him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the "I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen" routine in _Deep in My Heart_ (1954). MGM's refusal to lend him out for _Guys and Dolls_ and _Pal Joey_ put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract that involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, _It's Always Fair Weather_ (1955), co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his roller-skate dance routine to _I Like Myself_, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result _It's Always Fair Weather_ premiered at 17 drive-in theatres around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, _Les Girls_ (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. It, too, sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, _The Happy Road_ (1957), set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work.

1958–96: After MGM

In 1958, Kelly directed Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical play _Flower Drum Song_.[39] Early in 1960, Kelly, an ardent Francophile and fluent French speaker, was invited by A. M. Julien, the general administrator of the Paris Opéra and Opéra-Comique,[40] to select his own material and create a modern ballet for the company, the first time an American had received such an assignment. The result was _Pas de Dieux_, based on Greek mythology, combined with the music of George Gershwin's _Concerto in F_. It was a major success, and led to his being honored with the _Chevalier_ of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.

Kelly continued to make some film appearances, such as Hornbeck in the Hollywood production of _Inherit the Wind_ (1960) and as himself in _Let's Make Love_ (also 1960). However, most of his efforts were now concentrated on film production and directing. In Paris, he directed Jackie Gleason in _Gigot_ (1962), but the film was drastically recut by Seven Arts Productions and flopped.[41] Another French effort, Jacques Demy's homage to the MGM musical, _The Young Girls of Rochefort_ (_Les Demoiselles de Rochefort_, 1967), in which Kelly appeared, was a box-office success in France and nominated for Academy Awards for Best Music and Score of a Musical Picture (Original or Adaptation), but performed poorly elsewhere.

He was asked to direct the film version of _The Sound of Music_, which had been previously turned down by Stanley Donen. He escorted Ernest Lehman out of his house, saying, "Go find someone else to direct this piece of shit."[42]

His first foray into television was a documentary for NBC's _Omnibus_, _Dancing is a Man's Game_ (1958), where he assembled a group of America's greatest sportsmen—including Mickey Mantle, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Bob Cousy—and reinterpreted their moves choreographically, as part of his lifelong quest to remove the effeminate stereotype of the art of dance, while articulating the philosophy behind his dance style.[43] It gained an Emmy nomination for choreography and now stands as the key document explaining Kelly's approach to modern dance.

Kelly appeared frequently on television shows during the 1960s, including _Going My Way_ (1962–63), which was based on the 1944 film of the same name. It enjoyed great popularity in Roman Catholic countries outside the US.[44] He also appeared in three major TV specials: _The Julie Andrews Show_ (1965), _New York, New York_ (1966), and _Jack and the Beanstalk_ (1967)—a show he produced and directed that again combined cartoon animation and live dance, winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program.

In 1963, Kelly joined Universal Pictures for a two-year stint. He joined 20th Century Fox in 1965, but had little to do—partly due to his decision to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit _A Guide for the Married Man_ (1967), in which he directed Walter Matthau. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox—buoyed by the returns from _The Sound of Music_ (1965)—commissioned Kelly to direct _Hello, Dolly!_ (1969), again directing Matthau along with Barbra Streisand. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won three.

In 1970, he made another television special: _Gene Kelly and 50 Girls_ and was invited to bring the show to Las Vegas, Nevada—which he did for an eight-week stint on the condition he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there.[45] He directed veteran actors James Stewart and Henry Fonda in the comedy Western _The Cheyenne Social Club_ (1970), which performed poorly at the box office. In 1973, he worked again with Frank Sinatra as part of Sinatra's Emmy-nominated TV special, _Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra_. He appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit _That's Entertainment!_ (1974). He subsequently directed and co-starred with his friend Fred Astaire in the sequel _That's Entertainment, Part II_ (1976). It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire—who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired—into performing a series of song-and-dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for the glory days of the American musical film.

Kelly starred in the poorly received action film _Viva Knievel!_ (1977), with the then high-profile stuntman, Evel Knievel. Kelly continued to make frequent TV appearances. His final film role was in _Xanadu_ (1980), an expensive theatrical flop.[46] In Kelly's opinion, "The concept was marvelous, but it just didn't come off."[47] In the same year, he was invited by Francis Ford Coppola to recruit a production staff for American Zoetrope's _One from the Heart_ (1982). Although Coppola's ambition was for him to establish a production unit to rival the Freed Unit at MGM, the film's failure put an end to this idea.[48] Kelly served as executive producer and co-host of _That's Dancing!_ (1985), a celebration of the history of dance in the American musical. Kelly's final on-screen appearance was to introduce _That's Entertainment! III_ (1994). His final film project was the animated film _Cats Don't Dance_, not released until 1997, on which Kelly acted as an uncredited choreographic consultant. It was dedicated to his memory.


Working methods and influence on filmed dance

When he began his collaborative film work, he was influenced by Robert Alton and John Murray Anderson, striving to create moods and character insight with his dances. He choreographed his own movement, along with that of the ensemble, with the assistance of Jeanne Coyne, Stanley Donen, Carol Haney, and Alex Romero.[49] He experimented with lighting, camera techniques, and special effects to achieve true integration of dance with film, and was one of the first to use split screens, double images, and live action with animation, and is credited as the person who made the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.[50]

A clear progression was evident in his development, from an early concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms.[51] Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: "I don't have a name for my style of dancing ... It's certainly hybrid ... I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance—tap-dancing, jitterbugging ... But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared."[52] He especially acknowledged the influence of George M. Cohan: "I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness—which is a good quality for a male dancer to have."[53] He was also heavily influenced by an African-American dancer, Robert Dotson, whom he saw perform at Loew's Penn Theatre around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York.[54] However, his main interest was in ballet, which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early 1930s. As biographer Clive Hirschhorn explains: "As a child, he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods—anywhere, just as long as he could feel the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933, he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression."[55] He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, Rita Hayworth's uncle.[56] Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance—as in the title song for _Singin' in the Rain_ or "I Got Rhythm" in _An American in Paris_, whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in "Heather on the Hill" from _Brigadoon_ or "Our Love Is Here to Stay" from _An American in Paris_.[57]

Kelly_in_rehearsal.jpg and assistant Jeanne Coyne in the NBC _Omnibus_ television special _Dancing is a Man's Game_ (1958)]] According to Delamater, Kelly's work "seems to represent the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s". While Fred Astaire had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers, while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles, and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer a greater number of directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the "Prehistoric Man" sequence from _On the Town_ and "The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day" from _Take Me Out to the Ball Game_.[58] In 1951, he summed up his vision as: "If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, this must be the focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, _your eye_".[59]

Kelly's athleticism gave his moves a distinctive broad, muscular quality,[60] and this was a very deliberate choice on his part, as he explained: "There's a strong link between sports and dancing, and my own dancing springs from my early days as an athlete ... I think dancing is a man's game and if he does it well he does it better than a woman."[61] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing, which, in his opinion, "tragically" stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: "Dancing _does_ attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately, he dances badly—just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ballplayers ... but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies."[62] In his view, "one of our problems is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements—they are soft, limp, and feminine."[63] He acknowledged that in spite of his efforts—in TV programs such as _Dancing: A Man's Game_ (1958) for example—the situation changed little over the years.[64]

He also sought to break from the class-conscious conventions of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, so as to make his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they, too, could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles ... he democratized the dance in movies."[65] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique did not suit such refined elegance: "I used to envy his cool, aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born—I put them on and look like a truck driver."[66]

In 1989 Kelly voiced a Don Lockwood animatronic on the Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios.


Personal life

Marriages

Gene_Kelly_Allan_Warren.jpg, in 1986]] Kelly married three times. His first marriage was to the actress Betsy Blair in 1941. They had one child, Kerry (b. 1942), and divorced in April 1957.[67]

In 1960, Kelly married his choreographic assistant Jeanne Coyne, who had previously been married to Stanley Donen between 1948 and 1951. Kelly and Coyne had two children, Timothy (b. 1962) and Bridget (b. 1964). This marriage lasted until Coyne's death in 1973.

Kelly married Patricia Ward in 1990. Their marriage lasted for six years until his death.[68]

Political and religious views

Kelly was a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party. His period of greatest prominence coincided with the McCarthy era in the US. In 1947, he was part of the Committee for the First Amendment, the Hollywood delegation that flew to Washington to protest at the first official hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. His first wife, Betsy Blair, was suspected of being a communist sympathizer, and when United Artists, which had offered Blair a part in _Marty_ (1955), were considering withdrawing her under pressure from the American Legion, Kelly successfully threatened MGM's influence on United Artists with a pullout from _It's Always Fair Weather_ unless his wife was restored to the part.[69][70] He used his position on the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America West on a number of occasions to mediate disputes between unions and the Hollywood studios.

He was raised as a Roman Catholic, and he was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.[71] However, after becoming disenchanted by the Roman Catholic Church's support for Francisco Franco against the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War,[72] he officially severed his ties with the church in September 1939. This separation was prompted, in part, by a trip Kelly made to Mexico in which he became convinced that the church had failed to help the poor in that country.[73] After his departure from the Catholic Church, Kelly became an agnostic, as he had previously described himself.[74]

He retained a lifelong passion for sports and relished competition. He was known as a big fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Yankees. From the mid-1940s through the early 1950s, Blair and he organized weekly parties at their Beverly Hills home, and they often played an intensely competitive and physical version of charades, known as "The Game".[75]

His papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.

Late in life, Kelly was awarded Irish citizenship under Ireland's Citizenship by Foreign Birth program. The application was initiated on his behalf by his wife Patricia Ward Kelly.[76]

Material loss

On June 25, 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Gene Kelly among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[77]


Illness and death

Kelly's health declined steadily in the late 1980s. In July 1994, he suffered a stroke and stayed in a hospital for seven weeks. In early 1995, he had another stroke in Beverly Hills. Kelly died on February 2, 1996 at the age of 83. His body was cremated, without a funeral or memorial service.[78]

In 2005, Kelly's widow gave permission for Volkswagen to use his likeness to promote the Golf GTi car. The advertisement, shown only outside the US, used CGI to mix footage of Gene Kelly, from _Singin' in the Rain_, with footage of professional breakdancer David Elsewhere.

The tricks Dotson was doing were absolutely fresh. He went back to see that act a few times and admitted pinching several steps for his own use ... Just as he had done with Dotson, Gene made up his mind to 'steal' as much as he could from numerous touring shows ... both Fred and he were absolutely shameless when it came to pilfering, and very good at it."
