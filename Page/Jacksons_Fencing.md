JACKSONS FENCING is a British fencing manufacturing company based in Stowting Common near Ashford in Kent.[1]

The company employs over 250 staff, was established in 1947 by Harold Sands Jackson and his son Ian Jackson who originally began selling chestnut stakes and agricultural fencing to local farmers.

In April 2010, the company became the first to have a timber security fence system certified by Loss Prevention Certification Board (LPCB[2]) when its Jakoustic Class 3 system was certified to LPS 1175 Security Rating 3 (SR3). It went onto develop security fencing systems in steel, timber and novel timber and steel combinations with LPCB LPS 1175 security ratings covering SR1 to SR5. LPCB LPS 1175 SR5[3] is the highest security rating attained by a fencing system and is held by Jacksons Trident 5 system.

In 2016 the company reported an increase in pre-tax profits[4] following the win of the Eurotunnel contract to supply and install security fencing[5] and gate upgrades[6] around the terminal's perimeter in Coquelles, France.[7]

In June 2017 The Sunday Times featured the organisation in their International Track 200 League Table for its involvement in the Eurotunnel project and projects in Russia[8].

In May 2018, the company announced its successful transition to the most up to date international quality management standard ISO 9001:2015[9], (a requirement for continued certification to LPCB LPS 1175 certification). Headed by Peter Jackson[10] since October 2014, the company remains in private, family ownership and serves both consumers
