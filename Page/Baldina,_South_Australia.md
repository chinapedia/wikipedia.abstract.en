BALDINA is a rural locality in the Mid North region of South Australia, situated in the Regional Council of Goyder.[1] It was established in August 2000, when boundaries were formalised for the "long established local name".[2]

The name Baldina stems from an Aboriginal word for a set of springs on Baldina Creek. The name was used for two pastoral runs in the area: the Baldina Run, established by Henry Ayers in 1851, and the Baldina Creek Run by Alfred Barker in 1855-1856.[3] The cadastral Hundred of Baldina was proclaimed on 30 December 1875; the hundred boundaries also include roughly half of modern Worlds End and a section of Burra Eastern Districts.[4]

Baldina School opened in 1885 and closed in 1930, held in a Lutheran chapel.[5][6] There were at least four former churches in the Hundred of Baldina: the Upper Bright (Baldina) Lutheran Church (1887-1960), the Baldina Plains (St Paul's) Lutheran Church (1878-1913) east of the Burra-Morgan Road, the Baldina Methodist Church, and the Douglas Primitive Methodist Church.[7][8] A hotel, Midwinter's Hotel, was licensed in 1880 and served as a local meeting place, but was destroyed by fire in 1887.[9][10] Baldina also once had its own post office.[11]

The locality also includes the Red Banks Conservation Park, claimed to be one of the richest megafauna sites in Australia, and the Baldina pastoral station.[12] Baldina Cemetery is now located in Burra Eastern Districts due to changes to local boundaries.[13][14]

There are also two former towns within the current boundaries: Douglas and Kilto. Douglas, along Eastern Road in the north of Baldina, was surveyed in March 1877 and declared to have ceased to exist on 18 June 1981.[15] Kilto, now in the south of Baldina, was gazetted as an unbounded locality; it had originally been named Klaebes, but was one of the Germanic place names renamed during World War I.[16][17] Klaebes Post Office opened in August 1879, closed in December 1910, and reopened around 1913; its final closure date is unknown.[18][19]
