of Ninigi-no-Mikoto, the grandson of Amaterasu]]

or _KAMI-NO-MICHI_ (as well as other names) is the ethnic religion of Japan that focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past.[1]

Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written historical records of the _Kojiki_ and _Nihon Shoki_ in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified religion, but rather to a collection of native beliefs and mythology.[2] Shinto today is the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of "spirits", "essences" or "gods" (_kami_),[3] suited to various purposes such as war memorials and harvest festivals, and applies as well to various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual, dating from around the time of the Nara and Heian periods (8th–12th centuries).[4]

The word _Shinto_ (_Way of the Gods_) was adopted, originally as _Jindō_[5] or _Shindō_,[6] from the written Chinese _Shendao_ (神道, ),[7] combining two _kanji_: , meaning "spirit" or _kami_; and , "path", meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word _dào_).[8][9] The oldest recorded usage of the word _Shindo_ is from the second half of the 6th century.[10] _Kami_ is rendered in English as "spirits", "essences", or "gods", and refers to the energy generating the phenomena.[11] Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, _kami_ also refers to the singular divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, objects, places, and people can be said to possess the nature of _kami_.[12] Kami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.[13]

As much as nearly 80% of the population in Japan participates in Shinto practices or rituals, but only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys.[14][15] This is because _Shinto_ has different meanings in Japan. Most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech _kami_ without belonging to an institutional Shinto religion.[16] There are no formal rituals to become a practitioner of "folk Shinto". Thus, "Shinto membership" is often estimated counting only those who do join organised Shinto sects.[17] Shinto has about 81,000 shrines and about 85,000 priests in the country.[18] According to surveys carried out in 2006[19] and 2008,[20] less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organised religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions. In 2008, 26% of the participants reported often visiting Shinto shrines, while only 16.2% expressed belief in the existence of a god or in general.[21]

According to Inoue (2003): "In modern scholarship, the term is often used with reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices. In these contexts, 'Shinto' takes on the meaning of 'Japan's traditional religion', as opposed to foreign religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth."[22]


Types

]]

Shinto religious expressions have been distinguished by scholars into a series of categories:[23]

-   , the main tradition of Shinto, has always been a part of Japan's history. It consists of taking part in worship practices and events at local shrines. Before the Meiji Restoration, shrines were disorganized institutions usually attached to Buddhist temples; in the Meiji Restoration, they were made independent systematized institutions. The current successor to the imperial organization system, the Association of Shinto Shrines, oversees about 80,000 shrines nationwide.

-   are the religious rites performed exclusively by the imperial family at the three shrines on the imperial grounds, including the Ancestral Spirits Sanctuary (Kōrei-den) and the Sanctuary of the Kami (Shin-den).[24]

-   includes the numerous folk beliefs in deities and spirits. Practices include divination, spirit possession, and shamanic healing. Some of their practices come from Buddhism, Taoism or Confucianism, but most come from ancient local traditions.

-   is a legal designation originally created in the 1890s to separate government-owned shrines from local organised religious communities. These communities originated especially in the Edo period. The basic difference between Shrine Shinto and Sect Shinto is that sects are a later development and grew self-consciously. They can identify a founder, a formal set of teachings and even sacred scriptures. Sect Shinto groups are thirteen, and usually classified under five headings: pure Shinto sects (_Shinto Taikyo_, _Shinrikyo_ and _Izumo Oyashirokyo_), Confucian sects (_Shinto Shusei-ha_ and _Taiseikyo_/), mountain worship sects (_Jikkokyo_, _Fusokyo_ and _Mitakekyo_ or _Ontakekyo_), purification sects (_Shinshukyo_ and _Misogikyo_), and faith-healing sects (_Kurozumikyo_/, _Konkokyo_/ and its branching _Omotokyo_/ and _Tenrikyo_/.[25]

-   , literally 'Old Shinto', is a reconstructed "Shinto from before the time of Buddhism", today based on Ainu religion and Ryukyuan practices. It continues the restoration movement begun by Hirata Atsutane.

Many other sects and schools can be distinguished.[26] is a grouping of Japanese new religions developed since the second half of the 20th century that have significantly departed from traditional Shinto and are not always regarded as part of it.


Theology and cosmology

_Kami_

_Kami_, _shin_, or, archaically, _jin_ () is defined in English as "god", "spirit", or "spiritual essence", all these terms meaning "the energy generating a thing".[27] Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, _kami_ refers to the divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms. Rocks, trees, rivers, animals, objects, places, and people can be said to possess the nature of _kami_.[28] Kami and people exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.[29]

Early anthropologists called Shinto "animistic" in which animate and inanimate things have spirits or souls that are worshipped. The concept of animism in Shinto is no longer current, however.[30] Shinto gods are collectively called , an expression literally meaning "eight million kami", but interpreted as meaning "myriad", although it can be translated as "many kami". There is a phonetic variation, _kamu_, and a similar word in the Ainu language, _kamui_. An analogous word is _mi-koto_.[31]

_Kami_ refers particularly to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder (the sacred), testifying to the divinity of such a phenomenon.[32] It is comparable to what Rudolf Otto described as the _mysterium tremendum et fascinans_, which translates as "fearful and fascinating mystery".[33]

The _kami_ reside in all things, but certain objects and places are designated for the interface of people and kami: _yorishiro_, _shintai_, shrines, and _kamidana_. There are natural places considered to have an unusually sacred spirit about them and are objects of worship. They are frequently mountains, trees, unusual rocks, rivers, waterfalls, and other natural things. In most cases they are on or near a shrine grounds. The shrine is a building in which the kami is enshrined (housed). It is a sacred space, creating a separation from the "ordinary" world. The _kamidana_ is a household shrine that acts as a substitute for a large shrine on a daily basis. In each case the object of worship is considered a sacred space inside which the kami spirit actually dwells, being treated with the utmost respect.

_Kannagara_

In Shinto, , meaning "way [path] of [expression] of the _kami_", refers to the law of the natural order.[34] It is the sense of the terms _michi_ or _to_, "way", in the terms "kami-no-michi" or "Shinto".[35] Those who understand _kannagara_ know the divine, the human, and how people should live.[36] From this knowledge stems the ethical dimension of Shinto, focusing on sincerity (_makoto_), honesty (_tadashii_) and purity.[37]

_Amenominakanushi_

According to the _Kojiki_,[38] is the first _kami_, and the concept of the source of the universe according to theologies.[39][40] In mythology, he is described as a "god who came into being alone" (_hitorigami_), the first of the _zōka sanshin_("three _kami_ of creation"), and one of the five _kotoamatsukami_ ("distinguished heavenly gods").[41]

Amenominakanushi had been considered a concept developed under the influence of Chinese thought,[42] but now most scholars believe otherwise.[43] With the flourishing of _kokugaku_ the concept was studied by scholars.[44] The theologian Hirata Atsutane identified Amenominakanushi as the spirit of the North Star, master of the seven stars of the Big Dipper.[45] The god was emphasised by the _Daikyōin_ in the Meiji period, and worshiped by some Shinto sects.[46]

The god manifests in a duality, a male and a female function, respectively and .[47] In other mythical accounts, the originating _kami_ is called or , the latter used in the _Nihon Shoki_.[48]

Creation of Japan

The generation of the Japanese archipelago is expressed mythologically as the action of two gods: Izanagi ("He-who-invites") and Izanami ("She-who-is-invited").[49] The interaction of these two principles begets the islands of Japan and a further group of _kami_.[50]

The events are described in the _Kojiki_ as follows:

-   Izanagi-no-Mikoto (male) and Izanami-no-Mikoto (female) were called by all the myriad gods and asked to help each other to create a new land which was to become Japan.
-   They were given a spear with which they stirred the water, and when removed water dripped from the end, an island was created in the great nothingness.
-   They lived on this island, and created a palace. Within the palace was a large pole.
-   When they wished to bear offspring, they performed a ritual each rounding a pole, male to the left and female to the right, the female greeting the male first.
-   They had two children (islands) which turned out badly and they cast them out. They decided that the ritual had been done incorrectly the first time.
-   They repeated the ritual but according to the correct laws of nature, the male spoke first.
-   They then gave birth to the eight perfect islands of the Japanese archipelago.
-   After the islands, they gave birth to the other Kami. Izanami-no-Mikoto died in childbirth, however, and Izanagi-no-Mikoto tried to revive her.
-   His attempts to deny the laws of life and death have bad consequences.

In the myth, the birth of the god of fire (_Kagu-tsuchi_) causes the death of Izanami, who descends into _Yomi-no-kuni_, the netherworld. Izanagi chases her there, but runs away when he finds the dead figure of his spouse.[51] As he returns to the land of the living, Amaterasu (the sun goddess) is born from his left eye, Tsukiyomi (the moon deity) from his right eye, and Susanoo (the storm deity) is born from Izanagi's nose.[52]

Impurity

Shinto teaches that certain deeds create a kind of ritual impurity that one should want cleansed for one's own peace of mind and good fortune rather than because impurity is wrong. Wrong deeds are called , which is opposed to . Normal days are called "day" (_ke_), and festive days are called "sunny" or, simply, "good" (_hare_).[53]

Those who are killed without being shown gratitude for their sacrifice will hold a (grudge) and become powerful and evil _kami_ who seek revenge (_aragami_).[54] Additionally, if anyone is injured on the grounds of a shrine, the area must be ritually purified.

Purification

Purification rites called Harae are a vital part of Shinto. They are done on a daily, weekly, seasonal, lunar, and annual basis. These rituals are the lifeblood of the practice of Shinto.[55] Such ceremonies have also been adapted to modern life. New buildings made in Japan are frequently blessed by a Shinto priest called during the , and many cars made in Japan have been blessed as part of the assembly process. Moreover, many Japanese businesses built outside Japan have a Shinto priest perform ceremonies. On occasion, priests visit annually to re-purify.


Afterlife

It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a Buddhist funeral at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called , a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This _yomi_ very closely resembles the Greek Hades; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even Elysium-like descriptions such as in the legend of Okuninushi and Susanoo. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called _kegare_. However, death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shinto as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor Ōjin, who was enshrined as Hachiman, the God of War, after his death.

Unlike many religions, one does not need to publicly profess belief in Shinto to be a believer. Whenever a child is born in Japan, a local Shinto shrine adds the child's name to a list kept at the shrine and declares him or her a . After death an _ujiko_ becomes a . One may choose to have one's name added to another list when moving and then be listed at both places. Names can be added to the list without consent and regardless of the beliefs of the person added to the list. This is not considered an imposition of belief, but a sign of being welcomed by the local _kami_, with the promise of addition to the pantheon of _kami_ after death.

Shinto funeral

Shinto funerals were established during the Tokugawa period and focused on two themes: concern for the fate of the corpse and maintenance of the relationship between the living and the dead.[56] There are at least twenty steps involved in burying the dead. Mourners wear solid black in a day of mourning called Kichu-fuda and a Shinto priest will perform various rituals. People will give monetary gifts to the deceased's family called Koden, and Kotsuge is the gathering of the deceased's ashes. Some of the ashes are taken by family members to put in their home shrines at the step known as Bunkotsu.[57]


Shrines

The principal worship of _kami_ is done at public shrines or worship at small home shrines called . The public shrine is a building or place that functions as a conduit for _kami_. A fewer number of shrines are also natural places called _mori_. The most common of the _mori_ are sacred groves of trees, or mountains, or waterfalls. All shrines are open to the public at some times or throughout the year.

While many of the public shrines are elaborate structures, all are characteristic Japanese architectural styles of different periods depending on their age. Shrines are fronted by a distinctive made of two uprights and two crossbars denoting the separation between common space and sacred space. The _torii_ have 20 styles and matching buildings based on the enshrined kami and lineage.

There are a number of symbolic and real barriers that exist between the normal world and the shrine grounds including: statues of protection, gates, fences, ropes, and other delineations of ordinary to sacred space. Usually there will be only one or sometimes two approaches to the Shrine for the public and all will have the _torii_ over the way. In shrine compounds, there are a or public hall of worship, or hall of offerings and the or the main hall. The innermost precinct of the grounds is the _honden_ or worship hall, which is entered only by the high priest, or worshippers on certain occasions. The _honden_ houses the symbol of the enshrined _kami_.

The heart of the shrine is periodic rituals, spiritual events in parishioners' lives, and festivals. All of this is organized by priests who are both spiritual conduits and administrators. Shrines are private institutions, and are supported financially by the congregation and visitors. Some shrines may have festivals that attract hundreds of thousands, especially in the New Year season.

Practices

_Omairi_

Any person may visit a shrine and one need not be Shinto to do this. Doing so is called _Omairi_. Typically there are a few basic steps to visiting a shrine.

-   At any entrance gate, bow respectfully before passing through.
-   If there is a hand washing basin provided, perform Temizu: take the dipper in your right hand and scoop up water. Pour some onto your left hand, then transfer the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, holding the handle of the dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it.
-   Approach the shrine; if there is a bell, you may ring the bell first (or after depositing a donation); if there is a box for donations, leave a modest one in relation to your means; then bow twice, clap twice, and hold the second clap with your hands held together in front of your heart for a closing bow after your prayers.
-   There is variation in how this basic visitation may go, and depending on the time of year and holidays there may also be other rituals attached to visitations.
-   Be sincere and respectful to the staff and other visitors, and if at all possible, be quiet. Do be aware that there are places one should not go on the shrine grounds. Do not wear shoes inside any buildings.

_Harae_

The rite of ritual purification, _harae_ or _harai_, usually done daily at a shrine, is a ceremony of offerings and prayers of several forms. Shinsen (food offerings of fruit, fish, and vegetables), tamagushi (sakaki tree branches), shio (salt), gohan (rice), mochi (rice cake), and sake (rice wine) are all typical offerings. On holidays and other special occasions the inner shrine doors may be opened and special offerings made.

_Misogi_

Misogi _harai_, or , is the term for water purification.

The practice of purification by ritual use of water while reciting prayers is typically done daily by regular practitioners, and when possible by lay practitioners. There is a defined set of prayers and physical activities that precede and occur during the ritual. This will usually be performed at a shrine, in a natural setting, but can be done anywhere there is clean running water.[58]

The basic performance of this is the done at the entrance to a shrine. The more dedicated believer may perform misogi by standing beneath a waterfall or performing the ritual ablutions in a river.[59] This practice comes from Shinto history, when the kami Izanagi-no-Mikoto first performed misogi after returning from the land of Yomi, where he was made impure by Izanami-no-Mikoto after her death.

_Imi_

Another form of ritual cleanliness is avoidance, which means that a taboo is placed upon certain persons or acts. To illustrate, one would not visit a shrine if a close relative in the household had died recently. Killing is generally unclean and is to be avoided. When one is performing acts that harm the land or other living things, prayers and rituals are performed to placate the Kami of the area. This type of cleanliness is usually performed to prevent ill things from happening.

Amulets and talismans

]] Ema are small wooden plaques that wishes or desires are written upon and left at a place in the shrine grounds so that one may get a wish or desire fulfilled. They have a picture on them and are frequently associated with the larger Shrines.[60]

_Ofuda_ are talismans—made of paper, wood, or metal—that are issued at shrines. They are inscribed with the names of kami and are used for protection in the home. They are typically placed in the home at a kamidana. Ofuda may be kept anywhere, as long as they are in their protective pouches, but there are several rules about the proper placement of kamidana. They are also renewed annually.[61]

_Omamori_ are personal-protection amulets that are sold by shrines. They are frequently used to ward off bad luck and to gain better health. More recently, there are also amulets to promote good driving, good business, and success at school. Their history lies with Buddhist practice of selling amulets.[62] They are generally replaced once a year, and old omamori are brought to a shrine so they can be properly disposed of through burning by a priest.

_Omikuji_ are paper lots upon which personal fortunes are written.[63] The fortunes can range from , meaning "great good luck," to , meaning "great bad luck."[64]

A _daruma_ is a round, paper doll of the Indian monk, Bodhidharma. The recipient makes a wish and paints one eye; when the goal is accomplished, the recipient paints the other eye. While this is a Buddhist practice, darumas can be found at shrines, as well. These dolls are very common.[65]

Other protective items include _dorei_, which are earthenware bells that are used to pray for good fortune. These bells are usually in the shapes of the zodiacal animals:[66] _hamaya_, which are symbolic arrows for the fight against evil and bad luck;[67] and _Inuhariko_, which are paper dogs that are used to induce and to bless good births.[68]

_Kagura_

_Kagura_ is the ancient Shinto ritual dance of shamanic origin. The word "kagura" is thought to be a contracted form of _kami no kura_ or "seat of the kami" or the "site where the kami is received."[69] There is a mythological tale of how _kagura_ dance came into existence. The sun goddess Amaterasu became very upset at her brother so she hid in a cave. All of the other gods and goddesses were concerned and wanted her to come outside. Ame-no-uzeme began to dance and create a noisy commotion in order to entice Amaterasu to come out. The kami (gods) tricked Amaterasu by telling her there was a better sun goddess in the heavens. Amaterasu came out and light returned to the universe.[70]

Music plays a very important role in the _kagura_ performance. Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the gods and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called _kami uta_ in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the gods. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for incantation rather than aesthetics.[71]

In both ancient Japanese collections, the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, Ame-no-uzeme's dance is described as _asobi_, which in old Japanese language means a ceremony that is designed to appease the spirits of the departed, and which was conducted at funeral ceremonies. Therefore, _kagura_ is a rite of _tama shizume_, of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the Heian period (8th–12th centuries) this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the _tama shizume_ festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: "Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave!"[72] This rite of purification is also known as _chinkon_. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of _tama furi_ (shaking the spirit), to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called _asobi_. The ritual of _chinkon_ continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendents of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun goddess during the low point of the winter solstice.[73]

There is a division between the _kagura_ that is performed at the Imperial palace and the shrines related to it, and the _kagura_ that is performed in the countryside. Folk _kagura_, or _kagura_ from the countryside is divided according to region. The following descriptions relate to _sato kagura_, _kagura_ that is from the countryside. The main types are: _miko kagura_, _Ise kagura_, _Izumo kagura_, and _shishi kagura_.

_Miko kagura_ is the oldest type of _kagura_ and is danced by women in Shinto shrines and during folk festivals. The ancient miko were shamanesses, but are now considered priestesses in the service of the Shinto Shrines. _Miko kagura_ originally was a shamanic trance dance, but later, it became an art and was interpreted as a prayer dance. It is performed in many of the larger Shinto shrines and is characterized by slow, elegant, circular movements, by emphasis on the four directions and by the central use of torimono (objects dancers carry in their hands), especially the fan and bells.[74]

_Ise kagura_ is a collective name for rituals that are based upon the _yudate_ (boiling water rites of Shugendō origin) ritual. It includes _miko_ dances as well as dancing of the _torimono_ type. The _kami_ are believed to be present in the pot of boiling water, so the dancers dip their _torimono_ in the water and sprinkle it in the four directions and on the observers for purification and blessing.[75]

_Izumo kagura_ is centered in the Sada shrine of Izumo, Shimane prefecture. It has two types: _torimono ma_, unmasked dances that include held objects, and _shinno_ (sacred No), dramatic masked dances based on myths. _Izumo kagura_ appears to be the most popular type of _kagura_.[76]

_Shishi kagura_ also known as the Shugen-No tradition, uses the dance of a _shishi_ (lion or mountain animal) mask as the image and presence of the deity. It includes the _Ise daikagura_ group and the _yamabushi kagura_ and _bangaku_ groups of the Tohoku area (Northeastern Japan). _Ise daikagura_ employs a large red Chinese type of lion head which can move its ears. The lion head of the _yamabushi kagura_ schools is black and can click its teeth. Unlike other _kagura_ types in which the _kami_ appear only temporarily, during the _shishi kagura_ the _kami_ is constantly present in the shishi head mask. During the Edo period, the lion dances became showy and acrobatic losing its touch with spirituality. However, the _yamabushi kagura_ tradition has retained its ritualistic and religious nature.[77]

Originally, the practice of _kagura_ involved authentic possession by the _kami_ invoked. In modern-day Japan, it appears to be difficult to find authentic ritual possession, called _kamigakari_, in _kagura_ dance. However, it is common to see choreographed possession in the dances. Actual possession is not taking place but elements of possession such as losing control and high jumps are applied in the dance.


History

Historical records

There is no core sacred text in Shinto, as the Bible is in Christianity or Quran is in Islam. Instead there are books of lore and history which provide stories and background to many Shinto beliefs:[78]

-   The Kojiki (Record of Ancient Matters). The oldest book of Japanese history, it describes the origin myths of Japan and the Imperial Family beginning from 628.[79]
-   The Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan), and its Shoku Nihongi (Continuing Chronicles of Japan), describes events up to 697. Some of the stories in the Nihongi are more detailed, but contradictory, to the stories of the Kojiki.
-   The Rikkokushi (Six National Histories) includes the Nihon Shoki and Shoku Nihongi.
-   The Engishiki contains a section describing Shinto rituals in thorough detail.[80]
-   The Jinnō Shōtōki (a study of Shinto and Japanese politics and history), written in the 14th century.

Origins

Shinto has very ancient roots in the Japanese islands. The recorded history dates to the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), but archeological records date back significantly further. Both are compilations of prior oral traditions. The Kojiki establishes the Japanese imperial family as the foundation of Japanese culture, being the descendants of Amaterasu Omikami.[81] There is also a creation myth and a genealogy of the gods. The Nihon Shoki was more interested in creating a structural system of government, foreign policy, religious hierarchy, and domestic social order.

There is an internal system of historical Shinto development that configures the relationships between Shinto and other religious practices over its long history; the inside and outside Kami (spirits). The inside Kami, or _ujigami_ (_uji_ meaning clan), roles that supports cohesion and continuation of established roles and patterns; and the _hitogami_ or outside Kami, bringing innovation, new beliefs, new messages, and some instability.

Jōmon peoples of Japan used natural housing, predated rice farming, and frequently were hunter-gatherers; the physical evidence for ritual practices are difficult to document. There are many locations of stone ritual structures, refined burial practices and early Torii that lend to the continuity of primal Shinto. The Jōmon had a clan-based tribal system developed similar to much of the world's indigenous people. In the context of this clan based system, local beliefs developed naturally and when assimilation between clans occurred, they also took on some beliefs of the neighboring tribes. At some point there was a recognition that the ancestors created the current generations and the reverence of ancestors (_tama_) took shape. There was some trade amongst the indigenous peoples within Japanese islands and the mainland, as well as some varying migrations. The trade and interchange of people helped the growth and complexity of the peoples spirituality by exposure to new beliefs. The natural spirituality of the people appeared to be based on the worship of nature forces or _mono_, and the natural elements to which they all depended.

The gradual introduction of methodical religious and government organizations from mainland Asia starting around 300 BCE seeded the reactive changes in primal Shinto over the next 700 years to a more formalized system. These changes were directed internally by the various clans frequently as a syncratic cultural event to outside influences. Eventually as the Yamato gained power a formalization process began. The genesis of the Imperial household and subsequent creation of the Kojiki helped facilitate the continuity needed for this long term development through modern history. There is today a balance between outside influences of Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, Abrahamic, Hindu and secular beliefs. In more modern times Shinto has developed new branches and forms on a regular basis, including leaving Japan.

Jōmon Period

By the end of the Jōmon period, a dramatic shift had taken place according to archaeological studies. New arrivals from the continent seem to have invaded Japan from the West, bringing with them new technologies such as rice farming and metallurgy. The settlements of the new arrivals seem to have coexisted with those of the Jōmon for some time. Under these influences, the incipient cultivation of the Jōmon evolved into sophisticated rice-paddy farming and government control. Many other elements of Japanese culture also may date from this period and reflect a mingled migration from the northern Asian continent and the southern Pacific areas. Among these elements are Shinto mythology, marriage customs, architectural styles, and technological developments such as lacquerware, textiles, laminated bows, metalworking, and glass making. The Jōmon is succeeded by the Yayoi period.[82]

Yayoi Period

Japanese culture begins to develop in no small part due to influences from mainland trade and immigration from China. During this time in the pre-writing historical period, objects from the mainland start appearing in large amounts, specifically mirrors, swords, and jewels. All three of these have a direct connection to the imperial divine status as they are the symbols of imperial divinity and are Shinto honorary objects. Also the rice culture begins to blossom throughout Japan and this leads to the settlement of society, and seasonal reliance of crops. Both of these changes are highly influential on the Japanese people's relationship to the natural world, and likely development of a more complex system of religion. This is also the period that is referenced as the beginning of the divine imperial family. The Yayoi culture was a clan based culture that lived in compounds with a defined leader who was the chief and head priest. They were responsible for the relationship with their "gods" Kami and if one clan conquered another, their "god" would be assimilated. The earliest records of Japanese culture were written by Chinese traders who described this land as "Wa". This time period led to the creation of the Yamato culture and development of formal Shinto practices.[83]

The development of _niiname_ or the (now) Shinto harvest festival is attributed to this period as offerings for good harvests of similar format (typically rice) become common.

Kofun Period

The great bells and drums, Kofun burial mounds, and the founding of the imperial family are important to this period. This is the period of the development of the feudal state, and the Yamato and Izumo cultures. Both of these dominant cultures have a large and central shrine which still exists today, Ise Shrine in the North East and Izumo Taisha in the South West. This time period is defined by the increase of central power in Naniwa, now Osaka, of the feudal lord system. Also there was an increasing influence of Chinese culture which profoundly changed the practices of government structure, social structure, burial practices, and warfare. The Japanese also held close alliance and trade with the Gaya confederacy which was in the south of the peninsula. The Paekche in the Three Kingdoms of Korea had political alliances with Yamato, and in the 5th century imported the Chinese writing system to record Japanese names and events for trade and political records. In 513 they sent a Confucian scholar to the court to assist in the teachings of Confucian thought. In 552 or 538 a Buddha image was given to the Yamato leader which profoundly changed the course of Japanese religious history, especially in relation to the undeveloped native religious conglomeration that was Shinto. In the latter 6th century, there was a breakdown of the alliances between Japan and Paekche but the influence led to the codification of Shinto as the native religion in opposition to the extreme outside influences of the mainland. Up to this time Shinto had been largely a clan ('uji') based religious practice, exclusive to each clan.[84]

Asuka Period

The Theory of Five Elements in Yin and Yang philosophy of Taoism and the esoteric Buddhism had a profound impact on the development of a unified system of Shinto beliefs. In the early Nara period, the _Kojiki_ and the _Nihon Shoki_ were written by compiling existing myths and legends into a unified account of Japanese mythology. These accounts were written with two purposes in mind: the introduction of Taoist, Confucian, and Buddhist themes into Japanese religion; and garnering support for the legitimacy of the Imperial house, based on its lineage from the sun goddess, Amaterasu. Much of modern Japan was under only fragmentary control by the Imperial family, and rival ethnic groups. The mythological anthologies, along with other poetry anthologies like the _Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves_ (_Man'yōshū_) and others, were intended to impress others with the worthiness of the Imperial family and their divine mandate to rule.[85]

In particular the Asuka rulers of 552–645 saw disputes between the more major families of the clan Shinto families. There were disputes about who would ascend to power and support the imperial family between the Soga and Mononobe/Nakatomi Shinto families. The Soga family eventually prevailed and supported Empress Suiko and Prince Shōtoku, who helped impress Buddhist faith into Japan. However, it was not until the Hakuho ruling period of 645–710 that Shinto was installed as the imperial faith along with the Fujiwara Clan and reforms that followed.[86]

Hakuho Period

Beginning with Emperor Tenmu (672–686), continuing through Empress Jitō (686–697) and Emperor Monmu (697–707) Court Shinto rites are strengthened and made parallel to Buddhist beliefs in court life. Prior to this time clan Shinto had dominated and a codification of "Imperial Shinto" did not exist as such. The Nakatomi family are made the chief court Shinto chaplains and chief priests at Ise Daijingū which held until 1892. Also the practice of sending imperial princesses to the Ise shrine begins.[87] This marks the rise of Ise Daijingū as the main imperial shrine historically. Due to increasing influence from Buddhism and mainland Asian thought, codification of the "Japanese" way of religion and laws begins in earnest. This culminates in three major outcomes: Taihō Code (701 but started earlier), the _Kojiki_ (712), and the _Nihon Shoki_ (720).[88]

The Taiho Code also called was an attempt to create a bulwark to dynamic external influences and stabilize the society through imperial power. It was a liturgy of rules and codifications, primarily focused on regulation of religion, government structure, land codes, criminal and civil law. All priests, monks, and nuns were required to be registered, as were temples. The Shinto rites of the imperial line were codified, especially seasonal cycles, lunar calendar rituals, harvest festivals, and purification rites. The creation of the imperial Jingi-kan or Shinto Shrine office was completed.[89]

Nara Period

This period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to Heijō-kyō, or Nara, in AD 710 by Empress Genmei due to the death of the Emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to "death impurity" is then abolished by the Taihō Code and rise in Buddhist influence.[90] The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taihō Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under Taihō and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.[91]

During this time, Buddhism becomes structurally established within Japan by Emperor Shōmu (r. 724–749), and several large building projects are undertaken. The Emperor lays out plans for the Buddha Dainichi (Great Sun Buddha), at Tōdai-ji assisted by the Priest Gyogi (or Gyoki) Bosatsu. The priest Gyogi went to Ise Daijingu Shrine for blessings to build the Buddha Dainichi. They identified the statue of Viarocana with Amaterasu (the sun goddess) as the manifestation of the supreme expression of universality.[92]

The priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.[93] The priest Gyogi conferred boddhisattva precepts on the Emperor in 749 effectively making the Imperial line the head of state and divine to Shinto while beholden to Buddhism.[94]

Syncretism with Buddhism

With the introduction of Buddhism and its rapid adoption by the court in the 6th century, it was necessary to explain the apparent differences between native Japanese beliefs and Buddhist teachings. One Buddhist explanation saw the _kami_ as supernatural beings still caught in the cycle of birth and rebirth (reincarnation). The _kami_ are born, live, die, and are reborn like all other beings in the karmic cycle. However, the _kami_ played a special role in protecting Buddhism and allowing its teachings of compassion to flourish.

This explanation was later challenged by , who saw the _kami_ as different embodiments of the Buddhas themselves (_honji suijaku_ theory). For example, he linked Amaterasu (the sun goddess and ancestor of the Imperial family) with Dainichi Nyorai, a central manifestation of the Buddhists, whose name means literally "Great Sun Buddha". In his view, the _kami_ were just Buddhas by another name.

_Kokugaku_

Buddhism and Shinto coexisted and were amalgamated in the _Shinbutsu-shūgō_ and Kūkai's syncretic view held wide sway up until the end of the Edo period. There was no theological study that could be called "Shinto" during medieval and early modern Japanese history, and a mixture of Buddhist and popular beliefs proliferated. At that time, there was a renewed interest in "Japanese studies" (_kokugaku_), perhaps as a result of the closed country policy.

In the 18th century, various Japanese scholars, in particular , tried to tear apart the "real" Shinto from various foreign influences. The attempt was largely unsuccessful, however, the attempt did set the stage for the arrival of State Shinto, following the Meiji Restoration (c. 1868), when Shinto and Buddhism were separated (_shinbutsu bunri_).

State Shinto

in Seoul]] Fridell argues that scholars call the period 1868–1945 the "State Shinto period" because, "during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building."[95] However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the Tenpō Reforms. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason Ānanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a "state religion" or a "theocracy" during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.[96]

The Meiji Restoration reasserted the importance of the emperor and the ancient chronicles to establish the Empire of Japan, and in 1868 the government attempted to recreate the ancient imperial Shinto by separating shrines from the temples that housed them. During this period, numerous scholars of _kokugaku_ believed that this national Shinto could be the unifying agent of the country around the Emperor while the process of modernization was undertaken with all possible speed. The psychological shock of the Western "Black Ships" and the subsequent collapse of the shogunate convinced many that the nation needed to unify in order to resist being colonized by outside forces.

In 1871, a Ministry of Rites (_jingi-kan)_ was formed and Shinto shrines were divided into twelve levels with the Ise Shrine (dedicated to Amaterasu, and thus symbolic of the legitimacy of the Imperial family) at the peak and small sanctuaries of humble towns at the base. The following year, the ministry was replaced with a new Ministry of Religion, charged with leading instruction in "_shushin_" (moral courses). Priests were officially nominated and organized by the state, and they instructed the youth in a form of Shinto theology based on the official dogma of the divinity of Japan's national origins and its Emperor. However, this propaganda did not take, and the unpopular Ministry of Rites was dissolved in the mid-1870s.

Although the government sponsorship of shrines declined, Japanese nationalism remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the _kokugaku_ scholars. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to "offer yourselves courageously to the State" as well as to protect the Imperial family. Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early Shōwa period, coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost the war in the Pacific. On 1 January 1946, Emperor Shōwa issued the Ningen-sengen, in which he quoted the Five Charter Oath of Emperor Meiji and declared that he was not an _akitsumikami_ (a deity in human form).

Post-war

The imperial era came to an abrupt close with the end of World War II, when Americans declared that Japanese nationalism had been informed by something called "State Shinto", which they attempted to define with the Shinto Directive. The meaning of "State Shinto" has been a matter of debate ever since.

In the post-war period, numerous "New Religions" cropped up, many of them ostensibly based on Shinto, but on the whole, Japanese religiosity may have decreased. However, the concept of religion in Japan is a complex one. A survey conducted in the mid-1970s indicated that of those participants who claimed not to believe in religion, one-third had a Buddhist or Shinto altar in their home, and about one quarter carried an _omamori_ (an amulet to gain protection by _kami_) on their person. Following the war, Shinto shrines tended to focus on helping ordinary people gain better fortunes for themselves through maintaining good relations with their ancestors and other _kami_. The number of Japanese citizens identifying their religious beliefs as Shinto has declined a great deal, yet the general practice of Shinto rituals has not decreased in proportion, and many practices have persisted as general cultural beliefs (such as ancestor worship), and community festivals (_matsuri_)—focusing more on religious practices. The explanation generally given for this anomaly is that, following the demise of State Shinto, modern Shinto has reverted to its more traditional position as a traditional religion which is culturally ingrained, rather than enforced. In any case, Shinto and its values continue to be a fundamental component of the Japanese cultural mindset.

Shinto has also spread abroad to a limited extent, and a few non-Japanese Shinto priests have been ordained. A relatively small number of people practice Shinto in America. There are several Shinto shrines in America. Shrines were also established in Taiwan and Korea during the period of Japanese imperial rule, but following the war, they were either destroyed or converted into some other use.

Sect Shinto

Within Shinto, there are a variety of sects which are not a part of Shrine Shinto and the officially defunct State Shinto. Sect Shinto, like Izumo Taishakyo Mission of Hawaii and Konkokyo, have unique practices which originated alongside older Shinto practices before the classification and separation of Shinto practices of the Meiji era in 1868.
