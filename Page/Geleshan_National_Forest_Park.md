The GELESHAN NATIONAL FOREST PARK () or GELE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL FOREST PARK, is a nationally protected park in China, located in Geleshan, Shapingba District, 16 km west of Chongqing city centre.[1]


Etymology

In Chinese, gēlè (歌乐) means to sing and dance. According to legends, Gele Mountain obtained its name from ancient times when Yu the Great (大禹; pinyin: _Dà Yǔ_, c. 2200 – 2101 BC) supposedly invited guests to sing and dance on the mountain to celebrate the success of controlling local floods.[2]


Physical features

Due to its mountainous landscapes and lush green forests, which consist mostly of pine and cypress, Geleshan is poetically referred to as the "Emerald Fortress" (). Natural features of the park also include prairie meadows, streams, springs, caves, and waterfalls.[3]

The highest point of Geleshan National Forest Park is 693 metres (2273.62 ft).[4]
