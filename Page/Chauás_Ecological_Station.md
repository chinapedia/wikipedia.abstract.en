The CHAUÁS ECOLOGICAL STATION () is an ecological station in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It protects an area of lagoons and marshes in the Atlantic Forest biome, and is home to several endangered species. It is strictly protected, and is not open to the public.


Location

The Chauás Ecological Station (ESEC) is in the municipality of Iguape, São Paulo. It has an area of . Governor Paulo Egidio Martins issued decree 12.327 on 26 September 1978 to transfer an area of vacant land in Iguape to the State Secretariat of Agriculture. The Chauás Ecological Station was created by decree 26.719 of 6 February 1987 in this area of vacant land. The reserve is strictly protected and is not open to tourists.

The ESEC covers part of the Iguape-Cananéia lagoon complex in the extreme south of the state of São Paulo. The Momuna and Covuçu rivers run through the ESEC, which is in the Ribeira de Iguape River basin. It consists of periodically flooded plains, flood plains, and small terra firma terraces. There is some higher land in the north end. The ESEC is part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve. It is part of the Lagamar Mosaic:


Flora

The thousands of kilometers of mangroves that extend to Paranaguá in the state of Paraná are important breeding grounds for South Atlantic marine life. The forests of the slopes and coastal plains hold a great diversity of species. Vegetation is typical broad leaf forest of the coastal plain and marshes. It is mostly covered with high _restinga_ forest, rich in _Bromeliaceae_ and _Araceae_. There is also dense alluvial rainforest of the Atlantic Forest biome including _Tabebuia cassinoides_, palm trees, lianas and epiphytes. The _caxeta_ (_Tabebuia cassinoides_) grows on the banks of the Momuna River. This tree, which grows in the flooded areas, has softwood that is used to make pencils and shoes, and is threatened by predatory logging. The palmito _Euterpe edulis_ is also threatened.


Fauna

The dark water rivers are home to freshwater turtles and the broad-snouted caiman (_Caiman latirostris_). Mammals such as the neotropical otter (_Lontra longicaudis_) and capybara live in the wetlands. The cougar (_Puma concolor_) is also present. 220 species of birds have been identified. These include blue manakin (_Chiroxiphia caudata_), yellow-legged tinamou (_Crypturellus noctivagus_), spot-winged wood quail (_Odontophorus capueira_), southern tamandua (_Tamandua tetradactyla_). Birds typical of the freshwater marshes include wren-like rushbird (_Phleocryptes melanops_) and orange-breasted thornbird (_Phacellodomus ferrugineigula_). Threatened bird species include the red-browed amazon (_Amazona rhodocorytha_), red-tailed amazon (_Amazona brasiliensis_), aracari and solitary tinamou (_Tinamus solitarius_).
