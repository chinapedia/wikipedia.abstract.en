GERALD JONES is a London-based philosopher, educator and textbook author.

Gerald Jones has spent his professional career in adult education. Since 1990 he has written and lectured in Philosophy and Critical Thinking, and was a visiting lecturer at the Institute of Education between 1996 and 2006. He later became an educational administrator and educational theorist. He was Head of Humanities at the Mary Ward Centre [1] before becoming head of the community education service for the London Borough of Ealing, and afterwards the head of adult learning for the London Borough of Lewisham. As editor of the collection _Gatekeepers, Midwives and Fellow Travellers: The Craft and Artistry of the Adult Educator_ (2005) he put forward a practical approach to understanding adult education and its aims.

Jones has authored or co-authored more than ten books aimed at learners in philosophy, including _Exploring Ethics_. Along with Jeremy Hayward and Dan Cardinal, he has co-written the best-selling Philosophy in Focus textbooks, published by Hodder Education and intended to assist with the AQA A level philosophy syllabus.[2]

Jones is also notable as a pioneer of teaching philosophy through games, and has devised many such games, often in collaboration with Jeremy Hayward.[3]
