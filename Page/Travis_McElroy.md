Podcasting

Since 2010, Travis McElroy, along with his brothers Justin and Griffin, has co-hosted the comedy podcast _My Brother, My Brother and Me_, an "advice show for the modern era" hosted as part of the Maximum Fun network. The brothers also starred in a 2017 TV show based on the podcast, which originally aired on Seeso.[5]

In 2014, the McElroy brothers, along with their father Clint McElroy, launched a tabletop role-playing game podcast entitled _The Adventure Zone_.[6] Initially playing _Dungeons & Dragons_, the show moved into other game systems in later arcs. During the first arc, _Balance_, Travis McElroy portrays Magnus Burnsides, a human fighter. The first sub-arc of _Balance_, named _Here There Be Gerblins_, was adapted into a graphic novel, co-written by the McElroys and published by First Second Books in 2018.[7] It was followed by a second graphic novel, _Murder on the Rockport Limited!_, in 2019.[8]

From 2015 to 2016, McElroy also co-hosted the podcast _Can I Pet Your Dog?_ with Allegra Ringo and Renee Colvert, leaving after the 57th episode due to the fact that he was moving house and expecting a child.[9] However, McElroy did later return as a guest star for episodes 71 and 81.[10][11] McElroy also co-hosted the "doomsday prepping" comedy podcast _Bunker Buddies_ with Andie Bolt from 2014 to 2018, at which point he retired from the show and was replaced by Ben Ellis. McElroy currently co-hosts the podcasts _Trends Like These_ with former roommate Brent Black and writer Courtney Enlow, and _Shmanners_ since 2016 with his wife, Teresa.[12]

McElroy and his brothers also co-host a yearly podcast with Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery, released every American Thanksgiving since 2015, called _Til Death Do Us Blart_[13] where they review the film _Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2_. The brothers also host the documentary podcast _The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls 2,_ which ultimately resulted in the announcement that all three were set to make cameo appearances in the film.[14][15]

In 2018, Travis McElroy appeared as a guest star on _Dice, Camera, Action_ as part of the _Stream of Many Eyes_, a _Dungeons & Dragons_ event promoting the new _Waterdeep_ storyline.[16][17]

Voice acting

Travis provides voice commentary for the 2017 video game _100ft Robot Golf_, along with Justin and Griffin.[18]

In September 2018, following a successful podcasting campaign, Travis, Justin and Griffin confirmed that they would be voicing characters in the animated film _Trolls World Tour_.[19]
