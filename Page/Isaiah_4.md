ISAIAH 4 is the fourth chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies spoken by the prophet Isaiah, and is a part of the Book of the Prophets.[1]


Text

The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is the shortest in the Book of Isaiah, with only 6 verses. American theologian Albert Barnes argued that "there was no reason why these six verses should have been made a separate chapter" from Isaiah 3.[2]

The New King James Version calls verses 2-6 "The Renewal of Zion".

Textual witnesses

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew language:

-   Masoretic Text (10th century)
-   Dead Sea Scrolls:
    -   1QIsa^(a): complete
    -   4QIsa^(a) (4Q55): extant: verses 5-6

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; ùîä^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: ùîä^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; ùîä^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; ùîä^(Q); 6th century).


Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[3] Isaiah 4 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    [{S} 3:18-26] 4:1 {S} 4:2-6 {P}


Verses 3:25‚Äì4:1

This section, which starting from 3:25, states without any imagery how the city in actuality is bereft.

Verse 1

    _And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,_

        _"We will eat our own food and wear our own apparel;_
        _Only let us be called by your name,_
        _To take away our reproach."_[4]

The New King James Version treats verse 1 as a continuation of chapter 3 and reformation theologian John Calvin argued that "this verse certainly ought not to have been separated from the preceding".[5] Whereas in the _men_ "take hold of" (__) a man to get a ruler, in this verse the _women_ "take hold of" (__) a man to get a husband. The women supplying their own food and apparel is a reversal of the marriage ordering in .


Verse 2

    _In that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious;_

        _And the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and appealing_

    _For those of Israel who have escaped._[6]

The text in the Septuagint is different:

    _In that day, God shall shine in counsel with glory upon the earth, to exalt, and to glorify the remnant of Israel._[7]
