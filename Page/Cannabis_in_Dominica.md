CANNABIS IN DOMINICA is a Class B drug to cultivate, sell or possess. This means that possession is punishable by 12 months and $12,000 (summary) or 2 years and $20,000 (on indictment). Supplying, production, or importation are punishable by 3 years and $100,000 (summary) or 14 years and $200,000 (on indictment).[1]

In 1995, the US government described Dominica as a minor cannabis producer but "increasingly exploited transit route", with some cannabis cultivated on the island but mostly consumed locally. In 1994 Dominican authorities seized 741Â kg of cannabis and eradicated 48,855 plants.[2]

A 2011 report noted that Dominica had large-scale cannabis cultivation for both trafficking and local use, with an estimated 210 acres of cannabis cultivated annually.[3]
