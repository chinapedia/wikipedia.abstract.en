_DARK HORSES_ is the tenth studio album by Australian musician, Jon English. The album was co-produced by English and former Sebastian Hardie band member, Mario Millo. It was released in Australia in May 1987, following a 4-year break where he returned to the theatre playing in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera _The Pirates of Penzance_, winning three consecutive 'Entertainer of the Year' Mo Awards between 1983-85.

Jon English wrote on the album sleeve “Oh, by the way _Dark Horses_ is a bastardised metaphor meaning loosely; Whatever is possible will be achieved by someone or something least expected. When it happens, however, no one will be surprised...”
