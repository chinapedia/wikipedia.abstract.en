History

The stadium was established in the year 2017. This was the dream project of Udit Sheth, Narendra Modi and Government of Gujarat since 2009. After eight years of work, the multi-purpose stadium was inaugurated by honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2016. The stadium hosted the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup even before it was inaugurated.

In 2009, Sheth got the idea of using technology from StadiArena U.K. from "stadiologist" and former English footballer Paul Fletcher. Fletcher has spent 40 years in the football business and 20 years as a player. TransStadia realized that there is this prime property at Abad Dairy near Kankaria Lake in the middle of the city which is not utilized except some games are played every week. The company wrote a letter to Narendra Modi, the then chief minister of Gujarat to seek permission for construction of a multi-purpose stadium with a vision of indulging sports in the culture of Gujarat. The state's budget for sports increased from 35 crores to ₹350 crores which increased furthermore with the construction of this stadium. The stadium also helps the government in nurturing the talent of young India and develop new athletes for India to shine on the world sports map. Amount of ₹550 crores were put into the construction of this marvelous structure. State government handed over 9.24 acres of land to the company. TransStadia was also committed to not take large profits, unlike other stadiums. The costs will be covered over the span of next 7–9 years.[2]


Naming Rights

The stadium is currently named for its developer, TransStadia, although naming rights will be sold at a later date. The company believes, inspiration has always been a pre-requisite for commitment and it was therefore decided to use all elements that would inspire the name. Sports has always been a patriotic subject, hence the colors of the Indian national flag, the tricolor was used in the shield logo very creatively to instill a sense of belonging to everyone.[3]


Opening

The stadium and Sports Performance and Rehab Centre were inaugurated on 30 June 2017 by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi with the presence of Gujarat's chief minister, Vijay Rupani and various Indian sports stars like, former badminton player and coach, Pullela Gopichand, Indian shuttler, Srikanth Kidambi, former Indian football captain and commentator, Baichung Bhutia, Paralympian, Deepa Malik, Olympians, Gagan Narang and Sushil Kumar, Indian kabaddi captain, Anup Kumar and Gujarat cricket team captain, Parthiv Patel along with other cricketers from the state like, Irfan Pathan, Cheteshwar Pujara and Jaydev Unadkat.[4]

The assessment and training equipment available at the center is one of the first in the country which consists of a Pro Reaction Timer, a Swift SpeedLight, a Touch Mat/Speed-Mat and more such equipment which might prove helpful in the all-round development of athletes. The prime minister also visited the mobile medical van equipped with specialized doctors to test and guide children across the country, giving them insights into different sports best suited to their skills.

Narendra Modi while addressing the gathering at the stadium said that the country must adopt a culture where sports is appreciated and supported by everyone, starting from the family. Further commending sportspersons of the country, he added: "Khel Mahakumbh" has brought in a change and encouraged a sporting culture in Gujarat. Speaking on the occasion, TransStadia managing director, Udit Sheth thanked Narendra Modi to inaugurate the very project he envisioned with them. They have created a viable sports infrastructure with world-class technology and thus creating diverse and strong revenue models where sports can become an industry.[5]

The stadium addresses a serious problem faced by many stadiums in India, they are generally underutilised and are financially overbearing to the state. TransStadia came up with this self-sustained design of the stadium to overcome this major problem and develop a building in the heart of the city which can support a range of sports and other events at the same time. The developers mentioned that the design is largely inspired by some of the greatest sporting venues like Wembley Stadium in the U.K., Tokyo Dome in Japan and Amsterdam Arena in the Netherlands.[7]

The stadium has a sprawling 1.3 million sq. feet of sports and entertainment area built with an idea to maximize profit through multi-dimensional usage.

The pitch has been designed with an idea to increase stadium utilization capacity from the worldwide average of 2% to 67% per annum. This technology combined with the world-class facilities has attracted the attention of various sporting venues across the globe. Paul Fletcher, C.E.O., StadiArena has also shown his interest in adopting this technology in the UK, to provide clubs with a true community building, every aspect of which is used.[8]

Indoor Arena

It also provides a unique mobile spectator experience using a smart alternative to the conventional brick and mortar modular grandstand spectator seating through T-Box technology that enables sporting events to be constructed, retracted, transformed, removed, downsized and made to disappear within a matter of days. It is a modular, multi-purpose and flexible technique which is helpful in providing efficient space utilization.
