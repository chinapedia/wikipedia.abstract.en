_MONSTER OF THE DEEP: FINAL FANTASY XV_ is a downloadable virtual reality (VR) simulation video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR peripheral. The game was released on November 21, 2017. It forms part of the multimedia project surrounding the 2016 video game _Final Fantasy XV_. Players interact with the four main characters of _Final Fantasy XV_ while taking part in fishing around a variety of locations.

VR-based content for _Final Fantasy XV_ was under consideration for some time. _Monster of the Deep_ was the first VR-based video game ever developed by Square Enix. The project's initial form was a first-person shooter add-on to the main game, with a demo being created for E3 2016 around this premise. The game was changed into a fishing simulation due to the latter's higher level of immersion.


Premise and gameplay

_Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV_, a virtual reality (VR) simulation game, takes place within Eos, an Earth-like fantasy world that serves as the setting for the 2016 role-playing game _Final Fantasy XV_. The player, while interacting with main protagonist Noctis Lucis Caelum and his three companions, takes part in fishing in ponds, hunting and catching various fish. A major goal is catching the titular "monster", a powerful fish which can attack the player and end the game.[1][2] As a VR-based experience, players have a 360 degree view of their surroundings.[3]


Development

_Monster of the Deep_ forms part of "_Final Fantasy XV_ Universe", a multimedia project based around _Final Fantasy XV_ that includes additional story episodes, a feature film, and original net animation: the story of _Final Fantasy XV_ was large enough to have covered several games, but as the team did not want to create any additional games, they decided to produce additional media.[4][5][6] _XV_ and its associated media likewise hold a thematic connection to _Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy_, a compilation of games and associated media sharing a common mythos while boasting unconnected stories and settings. While distanced from the _Fabula Nova Crystallis_ brand for marketing purposes, the world of _XV_ still uses its mythos and design elements.[7][8][9][10][11][12] Unlike most of the other "_Final Fantasy XV_ Universe" content—which came prior to the game's release—_Monster of the Deep_ was planned for release in the year following, forming part of Square Enix's dedicated post-launch content plan.[13][14]

VR-based content had been tested for the main game for the game's passive moments, but it was discarded as it would require wearing a VR headset for hours.[15] Speaking in an interview in June 2016, _Final Fantasy XV_{{'}}s director Hajime Tabata said that the VR content was first suggested by Sony Interactive Entertainment for their in-development PlayStation VR. The team were initially reluctant, but after experiencing the VR headset for themselves, they agreed to the collaboration.[16] _Monster of the Deep_ was the first time Square Enix had developed VR-based content.[17] The original version of the VR game was a first-person shooter scenario featuring party member Prompto Argentum.[18][19] Retelling the events of the 2015 commercial demo _Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae_, it was originally announced as downloadable content for the main game. The narrative and structure of _Episode Duscae_ needed to be redone due to the nature of VR gaming and the clashing of mechanics with what the main game had become. At the time, the team were also considering similar content featuring the other party members.[20]

_Monster of the Deep_ was the first time Square Enix had developed VR-based content.[21] Following the initial reveal of the VR prototype, according to director Masashi Takizawa, the project was reassessed and it was decided that the shooter-based mechanics were neither immersive nor entertaining enough, in addition to requiring a much longer development period. The fishing simulation would allow them to achieve both, so the VR game's content was reworked.[22] According to the game's lead designer Wan Hazmer, the team went on a fishing trip to Yokohama Bay with Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character supervisor for _Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV_ due to his experience with fishing—this was so the team could gain authentic experience that they could put into the game.[23]


Release

The game was first announced during at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo.[24] While its initial announcement inferred that the entire game of _Final Fantasy XV_ would be made playable on the PlayStation VR, it was later clarified that the playable VR content was limited to the shooting side game.[25] As such, its release date went from alongside the regular version of _Final Fantasy XV_ on September 30, 2016,[26] to "unlikely to release alongside the game"[27] to "sometime after September 30".[28] to even missing the October launch of PlayStation VR as well.[29] The game was not given a new release date after the main game's delay to November 29, 2016, but it was initially planned to be released as free downloadable content (DLC) for the main game.[30] The project was re-revealed under its current title at E3 2017, having been set for release in September 2017. Rather than the original plan to have been released as downloadable content to FFXV itself, the game is a standalone project that can be played without even needing to own _Final Fantasy XV_.[31] The game ultimately released on November 21, 2017.[32]


Reception

Speaking of the initial 2016 demo, Griffin McElroy of _Polygon_ sharply criticized it for being too simplistic, stating that "The PlayStation VR event was full of upcoming games that are using the hardware to execute some very cool ideas, but the Final Fantasy 15 VR Experience simply wasn't one of them. It was unflinchingly single-faceted, and its single facet wasn't particularly fun. This demo was specifically created for E3 attendees...here's hoping it can turn into something more substantial in the coming months, because right now, that experience is a mess.[33] Patrick Klepek of _Kotaku_ agreed, stating that the game "doesn’t take meaningful advantage of virtual reality" and concluded that "the mechanics aren’t satisfying. You hold down a button, point in the direction of the monster, and win! Perhaps this’ll change when Square Enix delivers the whole thing later this year, but if it’s more of what I played yesterday, temper your expectations."[34] Andrew Webster of _The Verge_ agreed with the sentiment, stating that it was "hard to muster much enthusiasm for the VR element" when the game lacked so much of the common element of the _Final Fantasy_ series and instead felt more like an entry to the arcade shooting game _House of the Dead_.[35] Jeff Grubb of VentureBeat went as far as to call it "the worst VR game I’ve played from a professional studio", also citing the concern that it was too much like a simple arcade shooter.[36] Meghan Sullivan of IGN was generally impressed with it despite conceding simplistic gameplay, citing a sense of immersion and nostalgia impossible to feel without virtual reality, concluding that "...I began to tear up with happiness. This was my first taste of VR, and although I knew I wasn't really in a car, driving down a road in a world where Behemoths dwell and humans can magically teleport, just for a few minutes, it felt like I was."[37]
