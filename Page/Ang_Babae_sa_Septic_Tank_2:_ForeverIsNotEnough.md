_ANG BABAE SA SEPTIC TANK 2: FOREVER IS NOT ENOUGH_ (; its subtitle stylized as _#FOREVERISNOTENOUGH_) is a 2016 Filipino comedy film distributed by Quantum Films. It is the sequel to the 2011 film _Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank_. The film was directed by Marlon Rivera, written by Chris Martinez, and stars Eugene Domingo, Jericho Rosales, Kean Cipriano (as film director Rainier de la Cuesta), Cai Cortez (as Rainier's line producer, Jocelyn), Khalil Ramos and Joel Torre.[1] While the first film was a satire on the Philippine indie film industry and the dishonesty of Filipino filmmakers participating in foreign film festivals, _Ang Babae sa Septic Tank 2_ satirizes the mainstream film industry.[2]

The film was an official entry to the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival.[3]

Another sequel, _Ang Babae sa Septic Tank 3: The Real Untold Story of Josephine Bracken_ was released in iWant as a series sequel.

Reception

Oggs Cruz of Rappler praised lead star Eugene Domingo stating that "Domingo, who plays the same hilariously histrionic version of herself from the first movie, wholeheartedly commits to Chris Martinez’s cleverly designed script that spells out his stark observations on how commercial romantic movies are so formulaic that even the performances in those films can be categorized." [4] Bubbles Salvador of PEP commented that "despite using the same old formula for the sequel, the movie sees Eugene at her best, never appearing self-conscious about purposely overacting or contorting her body to deliver her exaggerated lines." Salvador concluded that "without being preachy, Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank 2 #ForeverIsNotEnough serves as an eye opener about the diversity of movie audiences, and that the conflict between commercial value and film quality is one that is not impossible to resolve over a period of time."[5]
