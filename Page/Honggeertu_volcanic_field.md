HONGGEERTU is a volcanic field in China, in the Nei Mongol Province.[1]

The field is formed by twelve basaltic cinder cones.[2] Some of the cones formed on a fault.[3] It may be of Holocene age.[4] Young lava flows from this field look much younger than these of Quaternary volcanoes in the neighbourhood.[5] The volcanism may originate in the tectonic effects of the movement of the Ordos Block. Seismic tomography indicates the presence of a low velocity region at the volcano.[6]
