The River Hawks, led by fourth-year head coach Pat Duquette, played most of their home games at Costello Athletic Center, with five home games at the Tsongas Center.

UMass Lowell was in the fourth and final year of a transition to Division I and thus ineligible for the postseason, including the America East Tournament.
