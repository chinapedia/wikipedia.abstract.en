ANDREA ANDREANI (1540–1623) was an Italian engraver on wood, who was among the first printmakers in Italy to use chiaroscuro, which required multiple colours.

Born and generally active in Mantua about 1540 (Brulliot says 1560) and died at Rome in 1623. His engravings are scarce and valuable, and are chiefly copies of Mantegna, Albrecht Dürer, Parmigianino and Titian. The most remarkable of his works are _Mercury and Ignorance_, the _Deluge_, _Pharaoh's Host Drowned in the Red Sea_ (after Titian), the _Triumph of Caesar_ (after Mantegna), and _Christ retiring from the judgment-seat of Pilate_ after a relief by Giambologna.[1] He was active 1584–1610 in Florence.[2]
