THE WINNSBORO NEWS is a weekly newspaper in Winnsboro, Texas, serving Wood and Franklin Counties. Current circulation is 2,293.[1]

Stories differ on how the newspaper was formed. Histories of the city of Winnsboro indicate that the newspaper was formed in 1908 by a merger of the "wet" and "dry" newspapers in the town--one newspaper serving those holding views against the sale of liquors and one serving those holding views favoring the sale of liquors--the Winnsboro News and the Winnsboro Messenger.[2] The Texas Press Association, however, fixes September 24, 1908 as the specific date of the founding of the News as a weekly newspaper.[3]

The newspaper was later sold to Judge R.M. Smith.[4] A former publisher, Grayford M. Jones, built the current 9,800 square foot newspaper plant for the News at 105 E. Locust Street in Winnsboro. The plant has a five-unit Goss Community press. The newspaper is currently owned by Tom and Karen Pendergast, who bought the news June 1, 1985.[5]
