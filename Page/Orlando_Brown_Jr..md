Orlando Brown}}

ORLANDO CLAUDE BROWN JR. (born May 2, 1996) is an American football offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Oklahoma, and was drafted by the Ravens in the third round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Brown is the son of the late offensive tackle Orlando Brown, who also played for the Ravens.


High school career

Brown Jr. attended Peachtree Ridge High School in Suwanee, Georgia, where he played high school football.[1] He was a three-star prospect. He received scholarship offers from many major NCAA schools.[2]


College career

Brown first committed to Tennessee but later decided to attend the University of Oklahoma.[3] Brown redshirted his freshman year in 2014.[4] In 2015, he was named the starting left tackle.[5] On January 3, 2018, Brown announced via Twitter he was forgoing a fifth season and entering the 2018 NFL Draft.[6]

He fared poorly at the combine, putting up 14 reps on bench press, 5.85 40-yard dash (same as his father's Pro Day score), 82-inch broad jump, and a 19.5 vertical jump. He recovered at his Pro Day, achieving better results in all categories, including 18 reps on bench press, 5.63 40 yard dash, 89" broad jump and 25.5" vertical jump.[7][8]


Professional career

On January 3, 2018, Brown announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2018 NFL Draft.[9] Brown attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and performed all of the combine and positional drills, but had a poor performance. His 40-yard dash time was the slowest among any prospect at the combine and was described as a "historically bad time" by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. He also finished last in the bench press, vertical jump, and broad jump among all offensive linemen at the combine.[10] The performance possibly hurt his draft stock after he was widely considered a first round pick among draft experts and scouts.[11] On March 14, 2018, Brown attended Oklahoma's pro day and chose to attempt to improve his combine numbers. He succeeded and improved his 40-yard dash (5.68s), 20-yard dash (3.28s), 10-yard dash (1.88s), bench press (18), vertical jump (25 1/2"), and broad jump (7'5"). Brown attended visits and private workouts with multiple teams, including the Jacksonville Jaguars, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, and Detroit Lions.[12][13] At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Brown was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts.[14] He was ranked as the fourth best offensive tackle in the draft by Sports Illustrated, was ranked the sixth best offensive tackle DraftScout.com and Scouts Inc., and was ranked the eighth best offensive tackle by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.[15][16][17] The Baltimore Ravens selected Brown in the third round (83rd overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft.[18] Brown was the ninth offensive tackle drafted in 2018 and was considered by analysts to be one of the biggest steals in the draft.[19] On May 16, 2018, the Baltimore Ravens signed Brown to a four-year, $3.49 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $865,720.[20] In his rookie season, he appeared in all 16 games and started ten. He started in the Wild Card loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.[21]
