DIETHYLSTILBESTROL DIPALMITATE (brand names PALMESTRIL, STILPALMITATE), also known as STILPALMITATE, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group and an ester of diethylstilbestrol (DES) that was formerly marketed but is now no longer available.[1][2] Its actions and uses are essentially the same as those of DES, but it is absorbed more slowly and for this reason has a much longer duration of action and improved tolerability in comparison.[3] A single 5 mg intramuscular injection of DES dipalmitate in oil solution has been found to have an average duration of action of 8 to 10 weeks in terms of relief of menopausal symptoms, with a duration of as long as 15 to 16 weeks occurring in some women.[4][5][6] A single 15 or 20 mg intramuscular injection of DES dipalmitate in oil solution will control menopausal symptoms for 3 months or longer.[7] DES dipalmitate in aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection has been studied as well.[8]
