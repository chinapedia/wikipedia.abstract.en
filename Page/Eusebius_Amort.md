Eusebius_Amort.jpg EUSEBIUS AMORT (November 15, 1692 â€“ February 5, 1775) was a German Roman Catholic theologian.


Life

Amort was born at Bibermuhle, near Tolz, in Upper Bavaria. He studied at Munich, and at an early age joined the Canons Regular at Polling, where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and philosophy. The Parnassus Boicus learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustinian fathers: Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671-1731), a famous preacher in the German language and Agnellus Kandler (1692-1745), a genealogist and librarian. The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first volume of the _Parnassus Boicus_ journal, communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences.

In 1733 Amort went to Rome as theologian to Cardinal Niccolo Maria Lercari (d. 1757). He returned to Polling in 1735 and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in Bavaria. He died at Polling in 1775.


Works

Amort, who had the reputation of being the most learned man of his age, was a voluminous writer on every conceivable subject, from poetry to astronomy, from dogmatic theology to mysticism. His best known works are:

-   A manual of theology in 4 vols, _Theologia eclectica, moralis et scholastica_ (Augsburg, 1752; revised by Pope Benedict XIV for the 1753 edition published at Bologna)
-   A defence of Catholic doctrine, entitled _Demonstratio critica religionis Catholicae_ (Augsburg, 1751)
-   A work on indulgences, which has often been criticized by Protestant writers, _De Origine, Progressu, Valore, et Fructu Indulgentiorum_ (Augsburg, 1735)
-   A treatise on mysticism, _De Revelationibus et Visionibus, etc._ (2 vols, 1744)
-   The astronomical work _Nova philosophiae planetarum et artis criticae systemata_ (Nuremberg, 1723).

The list of his other works, including his three erudite contributions to the question of authorship of the _Imitatio Christi_, will be found in C. Toussaint's scholarly article in Alfred Vacant's _Dictionnaire de theologie_ (1900, cols 1115-1117).
