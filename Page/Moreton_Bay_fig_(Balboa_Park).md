San_Diego,_2016_-_507.jpg The Moreton Bay fig in San Diego's Balboa Park is one of the largest trees in the U.S. state of California.[1][2][3][4]


History

It began its life when it was planted in 1914.[5] During the Panamaâ€“California Exposition it was part of the San Diego County garden exhibit; as of 2017 it is the last remaining plant from the exhibit.[6] The area underneath it was fenced off to the public in 1989 due to damage to the fig caused by foot traffic.[7]
