Biography

Miller is a Detroit-based disc jockey, producer, singer and percussionist as well as a pioneer of Detroit house music.

Miller became interested in progressive dance music in the mid 1980s. He came to Detroit willing to create a club dedicated to electronic music. Music Institute[1] was founded in 1988 by Miller, George Baker and Chez Damier.

The Music Institute closed in 1989 and Miller left for Toronto, where he hosted a radio show. He returned to Detroit and started producing on KMD Records, Kevin Saunderson’ record label founded in 1987. He played his first European gig in Italy alongside Derrick May the next year, and worked for Transmat at the same period. He signed some hits outside of Detroit including the track "Energy Flash" from Joey Beltram.[2]

During the 1990s, Miller played in many clubs around the world, and moved to Paris from 1996 to 1998. There, he developed several artistic collaborations and friendships with French artists. He then lived in South African in 2011 and returned the next year in Detroit. 2015 saw him re-introduce his label InnerMuse Recordings with his own signature sound on Whereabouts Known. During Movement 2016 in Detroit, Miller played with Chez Damier for the first time since the Music Institute closed in 1989, during a party organized by fellow DJ Kai Alce.[3] In July 2016, Miller inaugurated the new Adeen Record Japan label with a first EP, called “More Positive Things”. He released another EP “The Vault” on Italian DJ Volcov’ record label, Neroli early October 2016.
