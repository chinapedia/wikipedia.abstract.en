FOBBING MARSH is a 75.7 hectare nature reserve east of Fobbing in Essex. It is managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust.[1]

The site is mainly grazing marshes, but there are also areas of rough grassland, saltmarsh, seawalls and reedbed. Flowering plants include hairy buttercup, knotted hedge-parsley and the nationally rare least lettuce. There are breeding birds such as Corn buntings and yellow wagtails.[2]

There is access by a footpath from Marsh Lane.[3]
