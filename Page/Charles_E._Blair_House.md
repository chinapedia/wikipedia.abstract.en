The CHARLES E. BLAIR HOUSE is a late Victorian-style house in Laramie, Wyoming. Built in 1911 it represents a late, austere version of Victorian architecture, using a yellowish "blond" brick that became available after 1900 in Wyoming. The plan is rectangular with two projecting bays crowned by deep gables above the second floor. A broad porch fronts the house. An entry hall in the left front corner contains the stairs. Rooms are mainly accessed from each other.[1]

The Blair House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 1980.[2]
