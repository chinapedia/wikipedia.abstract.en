The PROTECTED LANDSCAPE OF BARREIRO DA FANECA () is a geological region and protected landscape in the civil parish of São Pedro, in the municipality of Vila do Porto, on the Portuguese island of Santa Maria, archipelago of the Azores.


History

Geography

Sma_tagarete_ilheu_lagoinhas.JPG SMA_VPO_20090829_SaoPedro_BarreiroFaneca.JPG The Protected Landscape of Barreiro da Faneca extends from Ponta dos Frades until the northern cliff of the island, and includes not only Barreiro da Faneca and the bays of Raposo, Cré and Tagarete; the protected area includes a superficie of approximately 1542 hectares.[2] Contiguous to the protected area is the Bay of Cré, known for the accumulation of sediments, such as limestone and fossilized conglomerates, with visible marine fossils. The Bay of Raposo, nearby is known for its cliffs, waterfall and river mouth, while the Bay of Tagarete is also known for deposits of marine fossils.

Physical geography

Barreiro da Fancea is a superficial area of arid and clay terrain, built up from the geological area known as _Formação de Feteiras_ (_Feteiras Formation_), that corresponds to the most recent volcanism that was essentially explosive, and constituted of pyroclastic materials.[3] Later, these projectiles and deposits were altered in reddish clays due to the warm and humid climate, resulting in an area of semi-desert-like geology composed of yellowish-red sands.[4]

The location is situated at above sea level and includes a hummocky surface, with gentle slopes of 4-5% incline and a limited drainage capability.[5] The areas with limited or lacking vegetation the soils are susceptible to erosion, resulting in the formation of dunes caused by hydrological or wind-based erosion.[6] These conditions have resulted in a landscape that is completely unique to Santa Maria in the archipelago, resulting in it becoming named the _Deserto Vermelho dos Açores_ (_Red Desert of the Azores_).[7]

Biome

At the same time, there has been encroachment of vegetation in 70% of the area, including the spontaneous blooming of endemic species, such as Heather (_Erica azorica_), White wood (_Picconia azorica_), Globe daisy shrub(_Scabiosa nitens_), Spurge (_Euphorbia azorica_), and other species of important Laurel and Faia-da-terra.[8]

The group of bays are limited by large cliffs with extreme slopes, with altitudes ranging from above sea level, and are recognized for their ecological importance and distinct landscapes, that include the islet of Lagoinhas, known for support of marine bird habits. Populations of migratory and marine birds like Shearwaters (_Calonectris diomedea borealis_), Garajau-comum (_Sterna hirundo_) and Garajau-rosado (_Sterna dougallii_).
