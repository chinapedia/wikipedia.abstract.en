GDAŃSK ŚRÓDMIEŚCIE RAILWAY STATION is a railway station serving the city of Gdańsk, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland. The station opened on 1 April 2015 [1] and is located on the Gdańsk Śródmieście–Rumia railway. The train services are operated by SKM Tricity.

The station is an extension of the SKM Tricity train service from Gdansk main station and serves the purpose of transport hub as an interchange between train, tram and bus.


History

A few hundred metres south of the station there used to be the station _Gdańsk Biskupia Górka_ until the mid-1960s.

SKM Tricity aimed to open the station in the period 2008-2014. Originally it intended to have the station in use in time for Euro 2012, however this was not achieved as the contract for the construction work was not ready. This contract was signed on 31 July 2013. Two further deadlines were missed (mid-2014 and the start of 2015), with the station opening on 1 April 2015. The investment cost about 80 million zł. The project site was prepared in part simultaneously with the renovation of the Warsaw–Gdańsk railway.

Since April 2015 trains serve the new station. The trains between Gdynia, Gdańsk and Tczew do not stop at the station, as they use the Warsaw–Gdańsk railway which does not have a platform here.


Train services

The station is served by the following services:

-   Szybka Kolej Miejska services (SKM) _Wejherowo - Reda - Rumia - Gdynia - Sopot - Gdansk_
