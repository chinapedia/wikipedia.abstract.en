_HERE COMES MOTHER GOOSE_ is a children's picture book by Iona Opie. It is a collection of 56 Mother Goose nursery rhymes, chosen by Opie and is the second such collaboration between her and illustrator Rosemary Wells.


Reception

A _Horn Book_ review of _Here Comes Mother Goose_ wrote "This companion volume to My Very First Mother Goose (rev. 11/96) is even more successful than the first-more cohesive in terms of quality of art and totality of design, more venturesome in the selection of the nursery rhymes."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ found it "another captivating collection" concluding "Make room on the shelves for this must-have title."[2] The _New York Times_ especially commended the illustrator, writing "Wells .. is at the height of her powers in this generously large-format book, where she can stir a little mischief into the mix." and found it "a lovely assortment".[3]

_Kirkus Reviews_ concluded "in general the book is plainly the work of a match made in heaven, and merits as much popularity as its predecessor."[4] and _Publishers Weekly_ in a star review wrote "Even if this volume isn't quite as illuminating as Opie and Wells's _My Very First Mother Goose_, it abounds with charm and wit; there is no one like Opie for collecting traditional verse, and no one like Wells for radiant, childlike visual interpretation." and concluded "Beautiful and beguiling, this book will win over just about everyone."[5]

Parents' Choice awarded it a 1999 Gold Award for picture books, wrote "she (Mother Goose) receives a fresh interpretation in this large, hold-on-the-lap volume. Rhymes familiar and uncommon are cheerfully illustrated with Wells' charming animals and the occasional pineapple."[6]

_Here Comes Mother Goose_ has also been reviewed by _Booklist_,[7] _Parenting_,[8] _Reading Time_,[9] _The Reading Teacher_,[10] _Teacher Librarian_,[11] and _Good Housekeeping_.[12]
