_DASYMALLA TECKIANA_ is a flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. It is a small, openly branched, sticky shrub with mauve and white, bugle-shaped flowers.


Description

_Dasymalla teckiana_ is an openly branched shrub which grows to a height of and which is sticky due to the glandular hairs which cover its branches. Its leaves are stalkless, have their base partly wrapped around the stem, oval to egg-shaped, long and wide. They are sticky, glabrous and green with a few blunt teeth along their edges near the ends.[1]

The flowers are white and mauve, purple, lilac or violet and are usually arranged singly in upper leaf axils on a stalk long and covered with glandular hairs. The flowers are surrounded by green, leafy, oblong bracts, long and green, hairy, glandular bracteoles long. The five sepals are long and sticky with linear lobes and joined to form a short tube near their bases. The five petals are joined to form a tube long with a few hairs on the outside and glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary. There are five lobes on the end of the petal tube, the lower one elliptic to almost round and slightly larger than the other four lobes.[2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

This species was first formally described in 1889 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name _Chloanthes teckiana_ and published the description in the _Victorian Naturalist_. The type specimen was collected by John Forrest.[4][5] In 1904, Georg August Pritzel changed the name to _Pityrodia teckiana_[6] and in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber changed it to _Dasymalla teckiana_.[7][8] The specific epithet (_teckiana_) honours Francis, Duke of Teck.[9]


Distribution

_Dasymalla teckiana_ occurs in the south-west of Western Australia, mostly north of the Great Eastern Highway, as far east as Kalgoorlie[10] in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Dampierland and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions growing in a range of soils near granite outcrops.[11][12]


Conservation

_Dasymalla teckiana_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife[13]
