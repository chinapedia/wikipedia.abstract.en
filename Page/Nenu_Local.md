Plot

College student, Babu, struggles to clear his final exam for completing his Engineering Degree. However, the exam supervisor helps him to copy and clear his course. After that exam, Babu meets Keerthy and falls in love with her at the first sight. After few encounters with Keerthy, Babu finally impresses her (after he helps her best friend to marry her boyfriend). Just when Babu and Keerthy are about to meet each other, Keerthy's ex-fiancé, Siddharth Verma enters and claims that he should marry Keerthy.

Babu gets to know that, four years ago, Siddharth vowed to get a job so that Keerthy's father marries him to her. Coming back to the present, Keerthy lands in a dilemma when her father asks her to marry Siddharth (as she had promised her father that she would marry the man of his choice). But, Keerthy tells Babu to convince her father about his love for her so that they can marry each other. Days pass. But Babu gets no 'special moment' to convince Keerthy's father, who despises Babu for his carefree attitude (he was also the same person who allowed Babu to copy during the exams and never show his face to him again).

However, on the day of Keerthy's wedding, the man whose daughter's marriage got abandoned due to Babu, comes to the ceremony and asks for Keerthy's would-be. Keerthy's father calls Siddharth whereas Keerthy's mother calls Babu. Even in front of impending death, Babu tells the irritated man about his story and also convinces him that his daughter could never be happy after marriage because his daughter's fiancé had loved Keerthy's best friend. Keerthy's father however thinks Babu's speech to be just a drama and taunts him. An embittered Babu shoots himself with the irritated man's gun to prove that he truly loves Keerthy, and gets severely injured. Babu is rushed to the hospital and Keerthy's father gets convinced about Babu's love for his daughter. This proves to be the "special moment" which Babu had been waiting for. The film ends with Babu and Keerthy getting married happily and Siddharth Verma asking his father to find out if his would-be doesn't have a boyfriend like Babu. Finally the film ends up Babu became a Corporator with huge majority to his constituency by using the "local" feeling.
