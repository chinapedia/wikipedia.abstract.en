_MIMOSA_ is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. The generic name is derived from the Greek word (_mimos_), an "actor" or "mime," and the feminine suffix â€“_osa_, "resembling", suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.[1][2]

Two species in the genus are especially notable. One is _Mimosa pudica_, because of the way it folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat. It is native to southern Central and South America but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. Outdoor cultivation has led to weedy invasion in some areas, notably Hawaii. The other is _Mimosa tenuiflora_, which is best known for its use in shamanic ayahuasca brews due to the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine found in its root bark.


Taxonomy

The taxonomy of the genus _Mimosa_ has had a tortuous history, having gone through periods of splitting and lumping, ultimately accumulating over 3,000 names, many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera. In part due to these changing circumscriptions, the name "Mimosa" has also been applied to several other related species with similar pinnate or bipinnate leaves, but are now classified in other genera. The most common examples of this are _Albizia julibrissin_ (silk tree) and _Acacia dealbata_ (wattle).


Description

Mimosa_pudica_leaves_folding_when_touched_2.ogv'' leaves closing when touched]] Sun_rays_permeate_the_wild_flowers_in_Palestine.jpg Yellow_wild_flowers_with_mountain_view.jpg Members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement; examples outside of _Mimosa_ include the telegraph plant, Aldrovanda, some species of Drosera and the famous venus flytrap. The leaves of the Mimosa pudica close quickly when touched. Some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night, and experiments done by Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks.[3]

_Mimosa_ can be distinguished from the large related genera, _Acacia_ and _Albizia_, since its flowers have 10 or fewer stamens. Note that, botanically, what appears to be a single globular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones. Mimosa contains some level of heptanoic acid.

Uses[4]

The bark, leaves and flowers have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. The bark is still known as 'Collective Happiness Bark' and is used for cleansing the body's energetic pathways (heart and liver meridians), allegedly providing a spiritual boost for those who take it.

The ancient Mayans also used it regularly to treat injuries and burns.

Despite this, modern research remains surprisingly insignificant, but the powdered bark is commonly used by homeopaths as an anti-inflammatory, anti-septic, cough/cold relief and painkiller.
