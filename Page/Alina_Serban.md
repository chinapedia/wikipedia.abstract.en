Biography

Alina Serban was born in 1987 in a Romanian Roma family in Bucharest, Romania. She was 8 years old when her parents lost their home and were forced to move to her father’s extended family. A few years later her mother went to prison and Alina spent her teenage years in a children's home from where she went directly to the university. She used her diaries from those years to write the early versions of I DECLARE AT MY OWN RISK – SLUMDOG ROMA and TWO WEEKS, MAXIMUM ONE MONTH, MAYBE SIX YEARS[2] – which she performed at the International Romani Art Festival in 2009 and 2010 [3]

In 2011 Serban received a scholarship and moved to London for a master’s program at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The following year she received the "BEST ROMANIAN STUDENT IN THE UK”, prize, but she could not afford the expenses associated with the trip from London to Edinburgh so she could not pick up the prize in person.

In March 2014 the actress was invited to the Street Child World Cup to give a speech in front of 2000 people at Royal Albert Hall.[4] In 2016 Alina Serban published the first COLLECTION OF ROMA FAIRY TALES in Romania, as told by her aunt – Tanti Veta.

Currently she has projects in Romania, UK, Belgium, and Germany, including two feature films in which she will play the main character.
