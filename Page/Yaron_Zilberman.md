YARON ZILBERMAN (born October 2, 1966) is an Israeli-American director, screenwriter and producer.


Career

Zilberman directed, co-wrote and produced _A Late Quartet_ which starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christopher Walken, Catherine Keener, Mark Ivanir and Imogen Poots. The film premiered in the Special Presentation program at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. Inspired by and structured around Beethoven's Opus 131, the film follows the world-renowned Fugue String Quartet after its cellist Peter Mitchell (Christopher Walken) is diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.[1] Cinematographer Frederick Elmes lensed the film and composer Angelo Badalamenti composed the score for the film. The Brentano String Quartet played the quartet music for the soundtrack and Anne Sofie von Otter appears as the cellist's late wife, singing Korngold's "Marietta's Song" from _Die tote Stadt._ The film was theatrically released in over 30 countries and was critically acclaimed.[2][3] It was a New York Times Critics Pick.[4] _Rolling Stone_’s Peter Travers called it “a shining gem of a movie”[5] and Roger Ebert said “it does one of the most interesting things any film can do. It shows how skilled professionals work.”[6]

Zilberman made his directorial debut with his theatrical feature documentary _Watermarks_ (2004), which follows the champion women swimmers of Hakoah Vienna as they reunite at their old swimming pool 65 years after they were forced by the Nazis to flee Austria. Watermarks won nine film festival awards and enjoyed a successful theatrical run internationally.[7]
