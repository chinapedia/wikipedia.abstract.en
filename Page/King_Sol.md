BENJAMIN SOLOMON (born May 31, 1998),[1] known by his stage name KING SOL, is an American recording artist from San Francisco, California. He gained online recognition in 2014 through a series of mixtape releases. _Be Somebody_, his first album, was released on May 22, 2016 and executive engineered by DJ Khaled's _We the Best Studios_. Solomon's most popular song to date is "DeLorean," a time-travel exploration story.[2]


Career

Solomon collaborated with Austrian EDM duo Leaving Las Vegas in 2015, creating the hit "Varth Dader." The song was released simultaneously with Disney's revival of _Star Wars._ He is also known for his involvement in a school spirit video that included an appearance by NBA star Stephen Curry.[3] Solomon has performed with _Billboard_-charting artist George Watsky (both musicians attended the same high school in San Francisco). In June 2016, he appeared on the front page of _SF Weekly_.[4] The rapper attends Tufts University in Massachusetts.[5]

In early 2017, Solomon began debuting new songs on a weekly basis, calling the release days "Winter Wednesdays." The releases culminated with a project entitled "Winter Thoughts EP" on February 24, 2017.[6] Later that year, new KING SOL singles were released including the popular record "OFF AT IT." A full album was released on January 26, 2018. Solomon cites this as the most important and sonically diverse project he has ever worked on. A twitter post calls it his "first year of college in 35 minutes."[7] Album topics include gun control and college relationships.

Later in 2018, the KING SOL Twitter account began referencing another studio album.[8] "The Insomnia Project" was released in December to generally positive reviews.[9] Although some songs failed to compete with Solomon's earlier work, the single "Bill Gates" became wildly successful. This album refined the KING SOL style to a more concrete hip-hop/pop sound. Solomon says he wrote "The Insomnia Project" during bouts of insomnia he experienced in college.[10]
