_QUICK, DRAW!_ is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the drawings represent.[1][2][3] The AI learns from each drawing, increasing its ability to guess correctly in the future.[4] The game is similar to Pictionary in that the player only has a limited time to draw (40seconds).[5] The concepts that it guesses can be simple, like 'foot', or more complicated, like 'animal migration'.[6] This game is one of many simple games created by Google that are AI based as part of a project known as 'A.I. Experiments'.


Gameplay

The player starts with an object to draw (for example it may say "Draw a chair in under 20 seconds"). Then the player has twenty seconds to draw that object. Based on what they draw, the AI guesses what they are drawing. When the drawing is close enough to the item they were given to draw, it will say something like "I know, it's a chair!" and the player will be moved on to the next round. There are six rounds in a game of _Quick, Draw!_ and at the end the game shows what other people have drawn in the categories the player didn't draw successfully.
