SIDNEY SELBY (born July 23, 1931), known as "GUITAR CRUSHER" and formerly as "BONE CRUSHER", is an American blues singer and guitarist, for many years based in Berlin, Germany. Primarily a singer, billed as "The Big Voice from New York", he also plays guitar and blues harmonica.


Life and career

Selby was born at Lake Landing, in Hyde County, North Carolina.[1] He sang gospel in the Mt. Pilgrim Baptist Church and on the radio as a schoolboy. At the age of 15 he went to live with his mother in New York. He started a band _The Midnight Rockers_ and performed in colleges and clubs in the NY area.[2] In the 1960s he recorded a number of singles on King[3] and other labels.[4][5] He also toured with artists such as Ben E. King, The Drifters and The Isley Brothers.[6][7]

In 1982, he went to Berlin, Germany with New York guitarist Nick Katzman, and began to attract an audience. With the new _Midnight Rockers_ they soon performed in clubs and on major festivals all over Europe. Their repertoire included Selby's originals, R&B standards, ballads and soul classics. On his recordings and live gigs he was backed by artists such as Katie Webster, Eb Davis, "Detroit" Gary Wiggins, Christian Rannenberg,[8][9] Tyree Glenn Jr., Alvin Lee, Charles 'Honeyboy' Otis, Wild Jimmy Spruill, Benny Bailey, Calvin Owens, Marcos Coll, Thomm Jutz and Hans McMinamin and many others.[10]

Originally known as "Bone Crusher", Selby's name changed to "Guitar Crusher" after he smashed his guitar over the head of an unruly customer in a club during his show.[11] He has been called a "living legend" by the press in Germany several times.[12][13][14][15]

Selby is married to Mara von Hartz-Selby.[16] He is the grandfather of rapper Sidney Selby III, also known as Desiigner.[17][18][19]
