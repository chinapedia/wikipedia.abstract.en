PEGGY-KAY HAMILTON (1922â€“1959) was an American Research Associate in Mineralogy in the Department on Geology at Columbia University. One of Hamilton's first research breakthroughs was developing Research Project 49, otherwise known as the study of reference to clay minerals. Additionally, she became involved full-time in the study of uranium. With her interest in mineralogy growing, she became dedicated in finding the origin and nature of uranium. Her work on uranium was published multiple times to the Division of Raw Materials of the Atomic Energy Commission. Her work was also published in the American Mineralogist and the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. Overall, Hamilton demonstrated excellence with her work in geology, mineralogy, and uranium particle work.[1]

Hamilton was also a member of the international non-profit honor society known as Sigma Xi[2] as well as a member of the Mineralogical Association of Canada.[3]


Early life

Hamilton was born in Illinois, 1922. After graduating from Vassar College in 1944, Hamilton continued to Columbia University where she studied in the field of mineralogy and geology. In June 1947 she completed her master's degree. Although she was qualified to receive several doctorates in recognition of her contribution in research and various publications, she was reluctant to complete the special requirements to further her degree, and preferred to continue her work as a research assistant at Columbia.[4][5]


Death

Hamilton had experienced a sudden sickness which was followed by a surgical operation for cancer in the cerebral of her brain. As a result, Hamilton died on September 19, 1959 (age 37) in the Lawrence Hospital, Bronxville, New York.[6]
