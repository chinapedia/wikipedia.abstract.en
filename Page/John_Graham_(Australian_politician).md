JOHN EDWARD GRAHAM is an Australian politician. He was assistant general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party until October 2016, when he was appointed to fill the vacancy on the council resulting from the resignation of Sophie Cotsis to contest the Canterbury state by-election.[1]

Graham was considered for preselection for Canterbury, and was confident he had the support of the rank-and-file members,[2] however Cotsis was preselected after NSW Labor leader Luke Foley intervened over concerns that Graham lived in Redfern (in the electorate of Newtown) and Foley wanted the candidate to be a woman.[3]

Graham is married to federal senator Jenny McAllister.[4] He is a member of NSW Labor's left faction.[5]
