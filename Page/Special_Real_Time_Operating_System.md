SPECIAL REAL TIME OPERATING SYSTEM (SRTOS) is a discontinued IBM real time operating system, originally designed for use in the electricity industry, but later also applied in other areas of industrial process control.[1][2][3] It formed part of the Realtime Plant Management System (RPMS) and Advanced Control System (ACS).[4][5] Rather than a standalone operating system, it was designed as an extension to the OS/VS1 and OS/VS2 (later MVS) operating systems.[6][7] It was also used in the paper industry.[8] SRTOS was originally released in 1976,[9] but continued to be used through the 1980s.
