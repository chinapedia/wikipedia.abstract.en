]] A POLYMERASE is an enzyme (EC 2.7.7.6/7/19/48/49) that synthesizes long chains of polymers or nucleic acids. DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase are used to assemble DNA and RNA molecules, respectively, by copying a DNA template strand using base-pairing interactions or RNA by half ladder replication.

A DNA polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium, _Thermus aquaticus_ (_Taq_) (PDB 1BGX, EC 2.7.7.7) is used in the polymerase chain reaction, an important technique of molecular biology.


Types

-   DNA polymerase
    -   Family A: DNA polymerase I; Pol γ, θ, ν
    -   Family B: DNA polymerase II; Pol α, δ, ε, ζ
    -   Family C: DNA polymerase III holoenzyme
    -   Family X: DNA polymerase IV (DinB) – SOS repair polymerase; Pol β, λ, μ
        -   Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT), which lends diversity to antibody heavy chains.[1]
    -   Family Y: DNA polymerase V (UmuD'2C) - SOS repair polymerase; Pol η, ι, κ
-   Reverse transcriptase, an enzyme used by RNA retroviruses like HIV, which is used to create a complementary strand to the preexisting strand of viral RNA before it can be integrated into the DNA of the host cell. It is also a major target for antiviral drugs.
-   RNA polymerase
    -   Multi-subunit, DNA-directed: RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase III
    -   Single-subunit, DNA-directed: T7 RNA polymerase, POLRMT
    -   RNA replicase
    -   Primase, PrimPol

In general, viral single-subunit RNA polymerases/replicases/reverse transcriptase shares a common origin with DNA polymerase. They have a conserved "palm" domain.[2] Multi-subunit RNA polymerase forms an unrelated group.[3] Primases have a more complex story: bacterial primases with the Toprim domain are related to topoisomerase and mitochrondrial helicase,[4] while archaea and eukaryotic primases form a unrelated family, possibly related to the polymerase palm. Both families nevertheless associate to the same bunch of helicases.[5]
