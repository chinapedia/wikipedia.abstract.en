It has lyrics written by Sam Lewis, which describes a girl's pounding heart as she falls in love for the first time. It is a pop song with heavy electronic influences and steady snare beats.[8][9] Of the song, Twice member Jihyo said "We've got a song that best shows Twice's energetic, bright vibe that we've shown since 'Like Ooh-Ahh' and 'Cheer Up'".[10]

Dahyun is White Rabbit of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ while Sana is Hit-Girl of _Kick-Ass_ comic series. Chaeyoung is The Little Mermaid and Nayeon is a cute devil. Mina is a female pirate reminiscent of _Pirates of the Caribbean_.
