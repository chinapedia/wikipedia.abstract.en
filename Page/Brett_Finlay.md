B. BRETT FINLAY, (born 4 April 1959)[1] is a Canadian microbiologist well known for his contributions to understanding how microbes cause disease in people and developing new tools for fighting infections, as well as the role the microbiota plays in human health and disease. Science.ca describes him as one of the world's foremost experts on the molecular understanding of the ways bacteria infect their hosts.[2] He also led the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative [3](SAVI) and developed vaccines to SARS and a bovine vaccine to E. coli O157:H7. His current research interests focus on pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella pathogenicity, and the role of the microbiota in infections, asthma, and malnutrition. He is currently the UBC Peter Wall Distinguished Professor[4] and a Professor in the Michael Smith Laboratories, Microbiology and Immunology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,[5] and Co-director and Senior Fellow for the CIFAR Humans and Microbes program.[6] He is also co-author of the book _Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving Your Child from an Oversanitized World_ and _The Whole-Body Microbiome: How to Harness Microbes - Inside and Out - For Lifelong Health. B._ Finlay is the author of over 500 publications in peer-reviewed journals and served as editor of several professional publications for many years.


Education

Finlay received his B.Sc.(Honors) (1981) and Ph.D. (1986) in Biochemistry from the University of Alberta, and did his post-doctoral work at Stanford University with Dr. Stanley Falkow (1986-1989).


UBC Lab

Finlay's lab is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in the Michael Smith Laboratories at the University of British Columbia, and involves a multidisciplinary research program exploring how microbes contribute to both human health and disease.[7] The lab specifically focuses on type III secreted virulence factors from Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli, how microbiota influence infectious diarrhea outcomes, and the role of the microbiota in asthma, malnutrition, and environmental enteropathy.

Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving your child from an oversanitized world

Finlay has co-authored a book for general audiences, _Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving your child from an oversanitized world_, about the critical role microbes play in early childhood development, having a major impact on both health and disease. It was published by Algonquin Books (USA) and Greystone (Canada) in Sept 2016, and is being translated into 11 languages


The Whole-Body Microbiome: How to harness microbes - inside and out - for lifelong health

In _The Whole-Body Microbiome,_ microbiologist Dr. Brett Finlay and his environmental gerontologist daughter Dr. Jessica Finlay focus on the teeming world of microbes everywhere in and around us. In this book, the Finlays suggest improvements to lifestyle, diet, and household practices to promote the right kind of microbial exposure._The Whole-Body Microbiome_ offers exciting new ways to pursue lifelong well-being and longevity.
