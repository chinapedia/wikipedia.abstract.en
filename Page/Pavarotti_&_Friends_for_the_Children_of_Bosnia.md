Between 1992 and 2003 Luciano Pavarotti hosted 10 concerts at Parco Novi Sad in Modena, Italy. These events were known as Pavarotti & Friends and were in support of humanitarian causes. For the most part Pavarotti invited non opera singers to sing with him which resulted in a very innovative and well received collaboration between Pavarotti and popular popstars. Pavarotti donated the proceeds from some of these concerts to Afghan, Angolan and Iraqi refugees.[1][2] In 1995 the concert was for the children of Bosnia affected by the war. The event featured artists such as U2 and Meat Loaf and was attended by Diana, Princess of Wales. Bono and Edge played the live debut of Miss Sarajevo.[3] Proceeds from this concert were used to help build the Pavarotti Music Center in Mostar.[4][5]
