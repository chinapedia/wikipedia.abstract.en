FUE LEE (born 1991)[1] is a Hmong American community organizer and activist from Minneapolis, Minnesota.[2] He is the state Representative for House District 59A in the Minnesota House of Representatives.[3] Elected in 2016, Lee is the first person of color and of Asian descent to represent that district in the Minnesota House.[4] He is the fourth Hmong American elected to a state legislature. In 2018, he was re-elected by a landslide and became Assistant Majority Leader in the MN House of Representatives -- making him the highest ranking official of Hmong descent; however state Sen. Foung Hawj claims to be the top, but the DFL senator is only a committee lead in the GOP controlled MN Senate. [5]

Lee was born in a refugee camp in Thailand to Hmong parents from Laos, and came to Minneapolis as a toddler in 1992.[6] He is a graduate of Carleton College, and was an employee in the office of the Minnesota Secretary of State.[7][8] He co-founded the Asian American Organizing Project and Progressive Hmong American Organizers with former state Senator Mee Moua, DFL activist Yee Chang, and state Representative Jay Xiong; and has previously worked under then-Representative Steve Simon, Representative John Lesch, and Congressman Keith Ellison.[9]

Community leaders encouraged Fue Lee to run into the primaries after losing the DFL convention endorsement during the first round of voting by a delegate.[10] Many felt the local senate district DFL and current lawmaker was not representative of the people. According to Lee, "One of the reasons I decided to run for office is because candidates that were supposed to represent all of the city and its communities weren’t doing their job. I want to be able to respect my community by understanding the issues we’re facing on a daily basis."[11]

On August 9, 2016, Fue Lee unseated 20-year incumbent Joe Mullery who was backed by the DFL political establishment including state Senator Foung Hawj, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Governor Mark Dayton,.[12]

Lee won the primary election decisively, receiving 55.5% of the vote, to 44.5% for Mullery.[13] His Republican opponent in the November 8, 2016 election was Jessica Newville.[14] Lee was elected on November 8, 2016 [15] receiving 81.3% of the vote. [16]
