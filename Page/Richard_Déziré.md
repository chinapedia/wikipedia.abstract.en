RICHARD DÉZIRÉ (born 24 September 1972) is a French football manager and former player.


Life and career

Déziré was born in Mont-Saint-Aignan, Seine-Maritime.[1] He played as a midfielder for Rouen, the major club in his local area, for whom he made eight appearances in Division 2, and went on to represent Tours, Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, Raon-l'Étape and Saint-Dié before retiring as a player in 2001.[2]

He began his managerial career the following year, with his old club, Raon-l'Étape.[3] In his first season, he led them to promotion from the Championnat de France Amateur (CFA) to the third-tier Championnat National, and kept them up for the next two seasons, albeit leaving it to the last match of the season in each case.[4] After a season with US Quevilly, in which he kept the team in the CFA, Déziré quit.[5]

He returned to Raon during the 2006–07 season, but was unable to prevent their relegation back to the CFA. He stayed for a further five years, and led the team to two appearances in the last 32 of the Coupe de France. He left at the end of the 2011–12 season,[6] and joined CFA team US Avranches. In his second season, he led Avranches to promotion to the Championnat National, and kept them up in 2014–15, as well as taking the team to the last 32 of the Coupe de France. Nevertheless, his contract was not renewed; the club's president had no complaints about his footballing or financial performance but found him too difficult to work with.[7]

In June 2015, Déziré signed a two-year contract as manager of CFA2 (fifth-tier) club Le Mans.[8]
