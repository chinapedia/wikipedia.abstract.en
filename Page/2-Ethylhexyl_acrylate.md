2-ETHYLHEXYL ACRYLATE chemical compound which belongs to the acrylates. It is a colorless liquid with a sweet odour.


Preparation

The racemic 2-ethylhexyl acrylate can be prepared with a high yield by esterification of acrylic acid with racemic 2-ethylhexanol in the presence of hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor and a strong acid such as methanesulfonic acid by reactive distillation using toluene as azeotroping agent.[1]


Properties

2-Ethylhexyl acrylate does polymerize easily. The polymerization can be initiated by light, peroxides, heat or even contaminates. It can react violently when combined with strong oxidants and can form explosive mixtures with air at temperatures above . The chemical, physical and toxicological properties, however, can be greatly modified by additives or stabilizers.


Use

2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is together with butyl acrylate one of the major base monomers for the preparation of acrylate adhesives. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate can be react by free-radical polymerization to macromolecules having a molecular weight of up to 200,000 g/mol. Other monomers such as vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, styrene or molecules having functional groups may be copolymerized to modify the properties of the resulting polymer.[2]
