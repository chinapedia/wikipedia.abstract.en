_WOLFSHEAD_ is a collection of fantasy and horror short stories by author Robert E. Howard. It was published by Lancer Books in 1968.

The stories have very widely divergent backgrounds. Some of them take place in very distant past times, others in the present or relatively recent history, and in some of them modern people relive the experiences of their former incarnations. Geographically, the stories' locations range from The Middle East, Africa, Ireland, Hungary and Texas. However, virtually all of them share the theme of an ancient horror of one kind or another coming back to haunt the protagonist(s) - often as the result of unwise meddling.

Most of the stories had originally appeared in the magazine _Weird Tales_.
