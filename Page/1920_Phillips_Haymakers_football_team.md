The 1920 PHILLIPS HAYMAKERS FOOTBALL TEAM represented Phillips University during the 1920 college football season. John Maulbetsch coached the team.[1] Phillips joined the Southwest Conference for the 1920 season and was outscored 97–0 in conference play against Texas A&M (47–0), Texas (27–0), and Arkansas (20–0). _The Galveston Daily News_ noted that Maulbetsch's 1920 team could not "compare with the strong team" he surprised Texas with in 1919.[2] At the end of the 1920 season, Phillips withdrew from the Southwest Conference, and Maulbetsch accepted a new position at Oklahoma A&M.
