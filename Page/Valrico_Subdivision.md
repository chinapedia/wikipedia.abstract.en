The VALRICO SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned and operated by CSX Transportation in Central Florida. The line runs from a junction with the CSX S Line in Valrico east and south to Bowling Green for a total of 47 miles. It also junctions with the Plant City Subdivision at Welcome, the Brewster Subdivision at Edison, and the Achan Subdivision at South Mulberry.[1][2]


Operation

The Valrico Subdivision is currently CSX's busiest rail line thorough Bone Valley and carries large amounts of phosphate traffic. The line is mostly dispatched by Track Warrant Control, though there is a small Centralized Traffic Control signal system around Mulberry between IMC and Ridgewood.[3]


History

The 47 miles of track that are today the Valrico Subdivision were built incrementally from the late 1800s and early 20th century as the phosphate industry in Bone Valley began expanding. It was mostly built and operated historically by CSX predecessors Seaboard Air Line Railroad and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

Valrico to Bartow and Homeland

MulberryXing.jpg The Seaboard Air Line Railroad built the segment of the line from Welcome to Nichols around 1905. It was built as an extension of the Plant City, Arcadia, and Gulf Railroad (which is today CSX's Plant City Subdivision), which Seaboard had bought earlier that year. Seaboard extended the line east to Mulberry and Bartow in 1912. The line crossed the Winston and Bone Valley Railroad (which by then was an Atlantic Coast Line branch and is today CSX's Bone Valley Subdivision) in Mulberry. The junction of these two lines is today located in the median of State Road 37. The line also connected to the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (currently CSX's Achan Subdivision) in Mulberry which at the time went as far as Port Boca Grande where a vast majority of phosphate was shipped in the early 20th century.

By 1916, Seaboard would extend the line east from Bartow to Lake Wales and Alcoma, though track east of Bartow to Lake Wales has since been abandoned (the junction where the Plant City Subdivision meets the CSX S Line is still known today as Lake Wales Junction because of this extension). The track from Bartow south to Homeland was part of a Seaboard spur built in 1914 to the Coronet Pembroke Mine.

Seaboard built the VALRICO CUTOFF in 1925 which connected the Seaboard main line (CSX's S Line) at Valrico with the track at Welcome. This is today is the westernmost trackage of the Valrico Subdivision. With the Valrico Cutoff in place, this line became an important route for Seaboard's passenger trains as it provided a direct route from Tampa to Miami (which was accessed through another Seaboard line in Lake Wales).

Homeland to Bowling Green

CSX_Fort_Meade.jpg The oldest trackage of the Varico Subdivision is its south-easternmost trackage from Homeland (just south of Bartow) to Fort Meade and Bowling Green. This segment was built in 1886 by the Florida Southern Railway (which later became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). This segment of the Valrico Subdivision is a segment of track that historically extended from Lakeland south to Naples.[4] (Other discontinuous segments of this historic line include CSX's CH Subdivision near Lakeland and the Seminole Gulf Railway south of Arcadia). Today, this segment of the Valrico Subdivision ends less than a mile south of the Polk/Hardee County line in Bowling Green. The line was abandoned between Bowling Green and Arcadia in the 1980s. Former Atlantic Coast Line depots still stand along the line in Fort Meade and Bowling Green. The Bowling Green depot stands about a hundred yards south of where the track now ends.

Later years

The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged in 1967 to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which brought all of the track under a single owner. In the Seaboard Coast Line era, the Valrico Subdivision designation covered the line from Valrico east through Bartow as it does today, but continued east to West Lake Wales, which was still in service at the time. At this time, the track from Homeland to Bowling Green (which continued to Arcadia at the time) was part of the Fort Myers Subdivision.[5] Track was removed east of Bartow by 1982.[6] When the Fort Myers Subdivision south of Bowling Green was abandoned in the late 1980s, the remaining track became part of the Valrico Subdivision. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.


Milepost numbers

Despite being a continuous line today, the milepost numbers on the Valrico Subdivision are not continuous throughout and remain as they originally were under predecessor companies (the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line).

The segment from Valrico to Welcome Junction (the Valrico Cutoff) is numbered independently from the rest of the line since that was the last track segment to be built. It is numbered SZ 0.0 through SZ 11.8.

From Welcome Junction east to Bartow, the mileposts are numbered SV 834.2 through SV 851.1 (numbering which continues from the Plant City Subdivision). When the line turns south on to the former Seaboard Pembroke Mine spur in Bartow, the numbering continues with the prefix SVE since the SV prefix continued along the former east continuation to West Lake Wales.

In Homeland, where the line transitions to the former Atlantic Coast Line track, the mileposts abruptly change at approximately SVE 857.3 to AX 870.8 reflecting the Atlantic Coast Line numbering. The line today ends at AX 882.7.[7]
