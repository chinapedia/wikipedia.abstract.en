AWI0005S3X is a 45 Myr old [1] star system in the Carina constellation with a debris disk orbiting an M-type red dwarf about 212 lightyears from Earth.

On October 21, 2016, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center announced that its citizen science project, Disk Detective, discovered a debris disk around WISE J080822.18-644357.3, a M5.5V dwarf with significant infrared excess at both 12 and 22 μm. Classified as DDOI AWI0005x3s, a BANYAN II Bayesian analysis revealed (with 93.9% probability) the star's radial velocity as 20.6 ± 1.4 km/s, associating it with Carina's ∼45 Myr old young moving group. Since most M dwarf debris disks fade in less than 30 million years, this would be the oldest M dwarf debris disk detected in a moving group, implying a change in understanding of constraint in M dwarf debris disk evolution.[2]
