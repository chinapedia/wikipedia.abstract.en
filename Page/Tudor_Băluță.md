TUDOR CRISTIAN BĂLUȚĂ (; born 27 March 1999) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays mainly as a defensive midfielder for Brighton & Hove Albion FC and the Romania national team.


Club career

Băluță began his career in native Craiova, joining the Gheorghe Popescu Football School at age 8. Six years later, he moved to Viitorul Constanța's academy.[1] Băluță made his professional debut in the Liga I on 2 May 2016, aged 17, replacing Ianis Hagi in the 54th minute of a 6–1 thrashing of ASA Târgu Mureș.[2][3]

On 24 August that year, Băluță recorded his European debut in a UEFA Europa League play-off round 0–4 loss to Red Bull Salzburg.[4] On 30 August 2018, he scored his first goal—and the only of the match—in a league win over Astra Giurgiu.[5]

Băluță agreed to a three-and-a-half-year contract with English club Brighton & Hove Albion on 31 January 2019, and he was immediately loaned back to Viitorul Constanța for the remainder of the campaign.[6] Press reported the transfer fee at €3 million, which made him the club's most expensive sale at the time, tied with Florinel Coman.[7]

On 25 May, he was a starter and played the full match in the Cupa României final 2–1 success against Astra Giurgiu.[8]


International career

Băluță earned his first senior cap for Romania on 31 May 2018, entering as a 71st-minute substitute for former Viitorul Constanța teammate Dragoș Nedelcu in a 3–2 friendly victory against Chile.[9]

Despite not playing in the qualification phase, he was selected in Romania's squad for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Italy. Băluță scored on his debut against Croatia on 19 June that year, which ended in a 4–1 win for his side.[10] He recorded three more games as _Tricolorii mici_ were eliminated by Germany in the semi-finals, following a 2–4 defeat.[11]


Style of play

Băluță is deployed primarily as a defensive midfielder, but started out as a central defender.[12] He has been likened to former Romanian international and Barcelona captain Gheorghe Popescu, also a native of Dolj County, who in his turn described Băluță as an "intelligent player" with "exceptional qualities".[13]
