In mathematics, a CHAOS MACHINE is a class of algorithms constructed on the base of chaos theory (mainly deterministic chaos) to produce pseudo-random oracle. It represents the idea of creating a universal scheme with modular design and customizable parameters, which can be applied wherever randomness and sensitiveness is needed.[1]

Theoretical model was published in early 2015 by Maciej A. Czyzewski.[2] It was designed specifically to combine the benefits of hash function and pseudo-random function. However, it can be used to implement many cryptographic primitives, including cryptographic hashes, message authentication codes and randomness extractors.[3][4]
