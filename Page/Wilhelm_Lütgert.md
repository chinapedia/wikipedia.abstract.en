WILHELM LÜTGERT (9 April 1867, in Heiligengrabe – 21 February 1938, in Berlin) was a German Protestant theologian.

He studied theology at the University of Greifswald as a pupil of Hermann Cremer, then furthered his education in Berlin, where he attended lectures given by Adolf von Harnack. In 1892 he obtained his habilitation at Greifswald, and three years later, became an associate professor of New Testament exegesis. In 1902 he succeeded Willibald Beyschlag as professor of New Testament exegesis at the University of Halle, where in 1912 he replaced Martin Kähler as chair of systematic theology. In 1917/18 he served as university rector. From 1929 onward, he was a professor of systematic theology at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin.[1][2][3]

With Hermann Cremer, Adolf Schlatter and others, he was a prominent member of the so-called _Greifswalder Schule_ of theology.[4] He was in disagreement with the dialectical theology of his era, and was equally opposed to the Deutsche Christen movement. He viewed the Confessing Church favorably, but never joined as a member.[5]
