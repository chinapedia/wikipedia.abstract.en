ENNIO MORRICONE, Knight Grand Cross[1] (; born 10 November 1928) is an Italian composer, orchestrator, conductor, and former trumpet player, writing in a wide range of musical styles. Since 1961, Morricone has composed over 400 scores for cinema and television, as well as over 100 classical works. His score to 1966's _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ is considered one of the most influential soundtracks in history[2] and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[3] Ennio Morricone has influenced many artists from film scoring to other styles and genres, including Hans Zimmer,[4] Danger Mouse,[5] Dire Straits,[6] Muse,[7] Metallica,[8] and Radiohead.[9]

His filmography includes over 70 award-winning films, including all Sergio Leone films (since _A Fistful of Dollars_), all Giuseppe Tornatore films (since _Cinema Paradiso_), _The Battle of Algiers_, Dario Argento's _Animal Trilogy_, _1900_, _Exorcist II_, _Days of Heaven_, several major films in French cinema, in particular the comedy trilogy _La Cage aux Folles I_, _II_, _III_ and _Le Professionnel_, as well as _The Thing_, _The Mission_, _The Untouchables_, _Mission to Mars_, _Bugsy_, _Disclosure_, _In the Line of Fire_, _Bulworth_, _Ripley's Game_ and _The Hateful Eight_.[10]

After playing the trumpet in jazz bands in the 1940s, he became a studio arranger for RCA Victor and in 1955 started ghost writing for film and theatre. Throughout his career, he has composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for westerns. With an estimated 10 million copies sold, _Once Upon a Time in the West_ is one of the best-selling scores worldwide.[11]

He also scored seven westerns for Sergio Corbucci, Duccio Tessari's _Ringo_ duology and Sergio Sollima's _The Big Gundown_ and _Face to Face_. Morricone worked extensively for other film genres with directors such as John Carpenter, Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Roman Polanski and Henri Verneuil. His acclaimed soundtrack for _The Mission_ (1986)[12] was certified gold in the United States. The album _Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone_ stayed 105 weeks on the Billboard Top Classical Albums.[13]

Morricone's best-known compositions include "The Ecstasy of Gold", "Se Telefonando", "Man with a Harmonica", "Here's to You", the UK No. 2 single "Chi Mai", "Gabriel's Oboe" and "E Più Ti Penso". He functioned during the period 1966–1980 as a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives. , Ennio Morricone has sold over 70 million records worldwide. In 1971, he received a "Targa d'Oro" for the worldwide sales of 22 million.[14]

In 1969, he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. From the 1970s, Morricone excelled in Hollywood, composing for prolific American directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter and Quentin Tarantino. In 1977, he composed the official theme for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. He continued to compose music for European productions, such as _Marco Polo_, _La piovra_, _Nostromo_, _Fateless_, _Karol_ and _En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait_. Morricone's music has been reused in television series, including _The Simpsons_ and _The Sopranos_, and in many films, including _Inglourious Basterds_ and _Django Unchained_.

In 2007, he received the Academy Honorary Award "for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music." He has been nominated for a further six Oscars. In 2016, Morricone received his first Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino's film _The Hateful Eight_ (2015), at the time becoming the oldest person ever to win a competitive Oscar. His other achievements include three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven Nastro d'Argento, two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award and the Polar Music Prize in 2010.


Life and career

Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician.[15] His family came from Arpino, near Frosinone. Morricone, who had four siblings, Adriana, Aldo, Maria and Franca, lived in Trastevere, in the centre of Rome, with his parents. Mario was a trumpet player who worked professionally in different light-music orchestras, while Libera set up a small textile business.[16]

Classical education

His first teacher was his father Mario Morricone, who taught him how to read music and also to play several instruments. Compelled to take up the trumpet, he entered the National Academy of St Cecilia, to take trumpet lessons under the guidance of Umberto Semproni.[17] Goffredo.petrassi2.jpg, Morricone's teacher]]

Morricone formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program. He completed it within six months. He studied the trumpet, composition, and choral music, under direction of Goffredo Petrassi, who influenced him; Morricone has since dedicated his concert pieces to Petrassi. In 1941, Morricone was chosen among the students of the National Academy of St Cecilia to be a part of the Orchestra of the Opera directed by Carlo Zecchi on the occasion of a tour of the Veneto region.[18] In 1946, he received his Diploma in Trumpet.[19] After he graduated, he continued to work in classical composition and arrangement.

Although the composer had received the _Diploma in Instrumentation for Band Arrangement_ (fanfare) with a mark of 9/10 in 1952, his studies concluded at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1954 and obtained a final 9.5/10 in his Diploma in Composition, under the composer Goffredo Petrassi.[20]

First compositions

Morricone wrote his first compositions when he was six years old and was encouraged to develop his natural talents.[21] In 1946, he composed "Il Mattino" ("The Morning") for voice and piano on a text by Fukuko, first in a group of seven "youth" Lieder.

In the following years, he continued to write music for the theatre as well as classical music for voice and piano, such as "Imitazione", based on a text by Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi, "Intimità", based on a text by Olinto Dini, "Distacco I" and "Distacco II" with words by R. Gnoli, "Oboe Sommerso" for baritone and five instruments with words by poet Salvatore Quasimodo and "Verrà la Morte", for contralto and piano, based on a text by novelist Cesare Pavese.[22]

In 1953, Morricone was asked by Gorni Kramer and Lelio Luttazzi to write an arrangement for some medleys in an American style for a series of evening radio shows. The composer continued with the composition of other 'serious' classical pieces, thus demonstrating the flexibility and eclecticism which has always been an integral part of his character. Many orchestral and chamber compositions date, in fact, from the period between 1954 and 1959: _Musica per archi e pianoforte_ (1954), _Invenzione, Canone e Ricercare per piano_; _Sestetto per flauto, oboe, fagotto, violino, viola e violoncello_ (1955), _Dodici Variazione per oboe, violoncello e piano_; _Trio per clarinetto, corno e violoncello_; _Variazione su un tema di Frescobaldi_ (1956); _Quattro pezzi per chitarra_ (1957); _Distanze per violino, violoncello e piano_; _Musica per undici violini, Tre Studi per flauto, clarinetto e fagotto_ (1958); and the _Concerto per orchestra_ (1957), dedicated to his teacher Goffredo Petrassi.[23]

Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film.[24]

COMPOSING FOR RADIO, TELEVISION AND POP ARTISTS

Morricone's career as an arranger started in 1950, by arranging the piece _Mamma Bianca_ (Narciso Parigi).[25] In occasion of the "Anno Santo" (Holy Year), he arranged a long group of popular songs of devotion for radio broadcasting.[26]

In 1956, Morricone started to support his family by playing in a jazz band and arranging pop songs for the Italian broadcasting service RAI. He was hired by RAI in 1958, but quit his job on his first day at work when he was told that broadcasting of music composed by employees was forbidden by a company rule. Subsequently, Morricone became a top studio arranger at RCA Victor, working with Renato Rascel, Rita Pavone, and Mario Lanza.

Throughout his career Morricone has composed songs for several national and international jazz and pop artists. In 1962 Morricone worked with American jazz singer Helen Merrill as an arranger on an EP "Helen Merrill sings Italian Songs" on the RCA Italiana label.[27] Gianni Morandi (_Go Kart Twist_, 1962), Alberto Lionello (_La donna che vale_, 1959), Edoardo Vianello (_Ornella_, 1960; _Cicciona cha-cha_, 1960; _Faccio finta di dormire_, 1961; _T'ho conosciuta_, 1963; ), Nora Orlandi (_Arianna_, 1960), Jimmy Fontana (_Twist no. 9_; _Nicole_, 1962), Rita Pavone (_Come te non-ce nessuno_ and _Pel di carota_ from 1962, arranged by Luis Bacalov), Catherine Spaak (_Penso a te_; _Questi vent'anni miei_, 1964), Luigi Tenco (_Quello che conta_; _Tra tanta gente_; 1962), Gino Paoli (_Nel corso_ from 1963, written by Morricone with Paoli), Renato Rascel (_Scirocco_, 1964), Paul Anka (_Ogni Volta_), Amii Stewart, Rosy Armen (_L'Amore Gira_), Milva (_Ridevi_, _Metti Una Sera A Cena_), Françoise Hardy (_Je changerais d'avis_, 1966), Mireille Mathieu (_Mon ami de toujours_; _Pas vu, pas pris_, 1971; _J'oublie la pluie et le soleil_, 1974) and Demis Roussos (_I Like The World_, 1970).[28][29]

In 1963, the composer co-wrote (with Roby Ferrante) the music for the composition "Ogni volta" ("Every Time"), a song that was performed by Paul Anka for the first time during the Festival di San Remo in 1964. This song was arranged and conducted by Morricone and sold over three million copies worldwide, including one million copies in Italy alone.[30] Another particular success was his composition, "Se telefonando."[31] Performed by Mina, it was a standout track of _Studio Uno 66_, the fifth-biggest-selling album of the year 1966 in Italy.[32] Morricone's sophisticated arrangement of "Se telefonando" was a combination of melodic trumpet lines, Hal Blaine–style drumming, a string set, a '60s Europop female choir, and intensive subsonic-sounding trombones. The Italian Hitparade No. 7 song had eight transitions of tonality building tension throughout the chorus. During the following decades, the song was covered by several performers in Italy and abroad most notably by Françoise Hardy and Iva Zanicchi (1966), Delta V (2005), Vanessa and the O's (2007), and Neil Hannon (2008).[33] _Françoise Hardy – Mon amie la rose_ site in the reader's poll conducted by the la Repubblica newspaper to celebrate Mina's 70th anniversary in 2010, 30,000 voters picked the track as the best song ever recorded by Mina.[34]

In 1987, Morricone co-wrote 'It Couldn't Happen Here' with the Pet Shop Boys. Other notable compositions for international artists include: _La metà di me_ and _Immagina_ (1988) by Ruggero Raimondi, _Libera l'amore_ (1989) performed by Zucchero, _Love Affair_ (1994) by k.d. lang, _Ha fatto un sogno_ (1997) by Antonello Venditti, _Di Più_ (1997) by Tiziana Tosca Donati, _Come un fiume tu_ (1998), _Un Canto_ (1998) and _Conradian_ (2006) by Andrea Bocelli, _Ricordare_ (1998) and _Salmo_ (2000) by Angelo Branduardi and _My heart and I_ (2001) by Sting.[35]

First film scores

After graduating in 1954, Morricone started writing and arranging music as a ghost writer for films credited to other already well-known composers, while also arranging for many light music orchestras of the RAI television network, working most notably with Armando Trovajoli, Alessandro Cicognini and Carlo Savina. He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as DAN SAVIO and LEO NICHOLS.[36]

In 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for Mario Nascimbene's score to _Morte Di Un Amico_ (Death of a Friend), an Italian drama directed by Franco Rossi. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show _Il Lieto Fine_ by Luciano Salce.

The 1960s began on a positive note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's _Il Federale (The Fascist)_. In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, _My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors_.[37]

_Il Federale_ marked the beginning of a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962 Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce's comedy _La voglia matta (Crazy Desire)_. That year Morricone arranged also Italian singer Edoardo Vianello's summer hit "Pinne, Fucile e Occhiali", a cha-cha song, peppered with added water effects, unusual instrumental sounds and unexpected stops and starts.[38]

Morricone wrote more works in the climate of the Italian avant-garde. A few of these compositions have been made available on CD, such as "Ut", his trumpet concerto dedicated to the soloist Mauro Maur, one of his favorite musicians; some have yet to be premiered.

The Group and New Consonance

From 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, he was part of _Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza_ (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded avant-garde free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of improvisation and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore "New Consonance."[39]

Known as "The Group" or "Il Gruppo," they released seven albums across the Deutsche Grammophon, RCA and Cramps labels: _Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza_ (1966), _The Private Sea of Dreams_ (1967), _Improvisationen_ (1968), _The Feed-back_ (1970), _Improvvisazioni a Formazioni Variate_ (1973), _Nuova Consonanza_ (1975) and _Musica su Schemi_ (1976). Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled _The Feed-back_, which combines free jazz and avant-garde classical music with funk; the album is frequently sampled by hip hop DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching over $1,000 at auction.[40] Gruppoimprovvisazione.jpg]] Morricone played a key role in The Group and was among the core members in its revolving line-up; in addition to serving as their trumpet player, he directed them on many occasions and they can be heard on a large number of his scores from the 1970s.

Held in high regard in avant-garde music circles, they are considered to be the first experimental composers collective, their only peers being the British improvisation collective AMM. Their influence can be heard in free improvising ensembles from the European movements including Evan Parker Electro-Acoustic Ensemble, the Swiss electronic free improvisation group Voice Crack, John Zorn[41] and in the techniques of modern classical music and avant-garde jazz groups. The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his '60s and '70s Italian soundtracks, including _A Quiet Place in the Country_ (1969) and _Cold Eyes of Fear_ (1971).[42]

Film music genres

Comedy

His earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where Morricone learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the sixties and seventies he composed the scores for comedies such as _Diciottenni al sole_ (1962), _Il Successo_ (1963), Lina Wertmüller's _I basilischi_ (1963),[43] _Slalom_ (1965), _Menage all'italiana_ (1965), _How I Learned to Love Women_ (1966), _L'harem_ (1967), _A Fine Pair_ (1968), _L'Alibi_ (1969), _Questa specie d'amore_ (1972), _Forza "G"_ (1972) and _Fiorina la vacca_ (1972).

His best-known scores for comedies includes _La Cage aux Folles_ (1978) and _La Cage aux Folles II_ (1980), both directed by Édouard Molinaro, _Il ladrone_ (1980), Georges Lautner's _La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding_ (1985), Pedro Almodóvar's _Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!_ (1990) and Warren Beatty's _Bulworth_ (1998). Morricone has never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy _Tutte le Donne della mia Vita_ by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series _Il Papa Buono_.[44]

Westerns

Though his first films were undistinguished, Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone had already composed some music for less-known western movies such as _Duello nel Texas_ (aka _Gunfight at Red Sands_) (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger Peter Tevis, who is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as "A Gringo Like Me" (from _Gunfight at Red Sands_) and "Lonesome Billy" (from _Bullets Don't Argue_).[45]

Association with Sergio Leone

The turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, _A Fistful of Dollars_ (1964).

THE _DOLLARS_ TRILOGY

Because budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, jew's harp, trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards à la John Ford. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action—cluing in the audience to the taciturn man's ironic stance. Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was viscerally true to Leone's vision.

As memorable as Leone's close-ups, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Morricone was initially billed on the film as Dan Savio. _A Fistful of Dollars_ came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularizing the so-called Spaghetti Western genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.[46] The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed for the year.[47] It eventually grossed $14.5 million in its American release,[48] against its budget of 200–250,000.[49][50]

With the score of _A Fistful of Dollars_, Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend Alessandro Alessandroni and his Cantori Moderni.[51] Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo soprano of the group, Edda Dell'Orso, at the height of her powers "an extraordinary voice at my disposal".

The composer subsequently scored Leone's other two _Dollars Trilogy_ (or _Man With No Name Trilogy_) spaghetti westerns: _For a Few Dollars More_ (1965) and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as _The Man With No Name_ and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.

Despite the small film budgets, the _Dollars Trilogy_ was a box-office success. The available budget for _The Good, the Bad and The Ugly_ was about 1.2 million, but it became the most successful film of the _Dollars Trilogy_, grossing 25.1 million in the United States and over 2,3 billion lire (1,2 million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide, earning him over 200 million dollars. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the RIAA with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States only.[52]

The main theme of _For a Few Dollars More_ ("Per Qualche Dollaro in Più") was covered by Hugo Montenegro ("For a Few Dollars More"),[53] Babe Ruth ("Theme From a Few Dollars More"),[54] Golden Palominos ("For A Few Dollars More"),[55] Material ("For a Few Dollars More"),[56] and Matti Heinivaho ("Arosusi").[57] More recently, a Techno-Industrial cover was done by Komor Kommando ("Hasta Luego"). A remix was done by Terranova, "For a Few Dollars More (Terranova Remix)".[58]

Hugo Montenegro's version of the main theme of _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ sold over one million copies worldwide. Montenegro's album with the same name included a selection of Morricone's compositions from the _Dollars Trilogy_.[59] In the United States, the album was certified gold by the RIAA on 9 September 1969.[60] The main theme was later sampled by artists such as Cameo ("Word Up!"), Bomb the Bass and LL Cool J.[61]

"The Ecstasy of Gold" became one of Morricone's best-known compositions. The opening scene of Jeff Tremaine's _Jackass Number Two_ (2006), in which the cast is chased through a suburban neighborhood by bulls, is accompanied by this piece. While punk rock band the Ramones used "The Ecstasy of Gold" as closing theme during their live performances, Metallica uses "The Ecstasy of Gold" as the introductory music for its concerts since 1983[62][63] This composition is also included on Metallica's live symphonic album _S&M_ as well as the live album _Live Shit: Binge & Purge_. An instrumental metal cover by Metallica (with minimal vocals by lead singer James Hetfield) appeared on the 2007 Morricone tribute album _We All Love Ennio Morricone_. This metal version was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2009, the Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Coolio extensively sampled the theme for his song "Change".[64]

Once Upon a Time in the West and others

Subsequent to the success of the _Dollars trilogy_, Morricone composed also the scores for _Once Upon a Time in the West_ (1968) and Leone's last credited western film _A Fistful of Dynamite_ (1971), as well as the scores for _My Name Is Nobody_ (1973) and _A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe_ (1975), produced by Sergio Leone.

Morricone's score for _Once Upon a Time in the West_ is one of the best-selling original instrumental scores in the world today, with up to 10 million copies sold, including one million copies[65][66] in France and over 800,000 copies[67] in the Netherlands.[68][69] One of the main themes from the score, "A Man with Harmonica" (L'uomo Dell'armonica), became worldwide known and sold over 1,260,000 copies in France alone.[70] This theme was later sampled in popular songs such as Beats International's "Dub Be Good to Me"[71] (1990) and The Orb's ambient single "Little Fluffy Clouds" (1990).[72] Film composer Hans Zimmer sampled "A Man with Harmonica" in 2007 as part of his composition "Parlay" (from the soundtrack _Pirates of the Caribbean – at World's End_).[73]

The collaboration with Leone is considered one of the exemplary collaborations between a director and a composer. Morricone's last score for Leone was for his last film, the gangster drama _Once Upon a Time in America_ (1984). Leone died on 30 April 1989 of a heart attack at the age of 60. Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the Siege of Leningrad, set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire 100 million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film. In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called _Leningrad_.[74] The film has yet to go into production and Morricone has been cagey thus far as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature.[75] , no further details about this film have been released.

Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima

Two years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, Sergio Corbucci. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's _Navajo Joe_ (1966), _The Hellbenders_ (1967), _The Mercenary/The Professional Gun_ (1968), _The Great Silence_ (1968), _Compañeros_ (1970), _Sonny and Jed_ (1972) and _What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?_ (1972).

In addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by Sergio Sollima, _The Big Gundown_ (with Lee Van Cleef, 1966), _Face to Face_ (1967) and _Run, Man, Run_ (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller _Violent City_ (with Charles Bronson) and the poliziottesco film _Revolver_ (1973).

Other westerns

Other relevant scores for less popular Spaghetti Westerns include _Duello nel Texas_ (1963), __ (1964), _A Pistol for Ringo_ (1965), _The Return of Ringo_ (1965), _Seven Guns for the MacGregors_ (1966), _The Hills Run Red_ (1966), Giulio Petroni's _Death Rides a Horse_ (1967) and _Tepepa_ (1968), _A Bullet for the General_ (1967), _Guns for San Sebastian_ (with Charles Bronson and Anthony Quinn, 1968), _A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof_ (1968), _The Five Man Army_ (1969), Don Siegel's _Two Mules for Sister Sara_ (1970), _Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?_ (1972) and _Buddy Goes West_ (1981).

Dramas & political movies

With Leone's films, Ennio Morricone's name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for _Il Malamondo_ (1964), _Slalom_ (1965) and _Listen, Let's Make Love_ (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for Mario Bava's superhero romp _Danger: Diabolik_ (1968).

Morricone in 2007 His talent and creativity were such that many other directors were soon keen to collaborate with him, and in the next few years Morricone scored a lot of films by politically committed directors: collaborating with Marco Bellocchio (_Fists in the Pocket_, 1965), Gillo Pontecorvo (_The Battle of Algiers_ (1966) and _Queimada!_ (1969) with Marlon Brando), Roberto Faenza (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (_Sacco e Vanzetti_, 1971), Giuseppe Patroni Griffi (_'Tis Pity She's a Whore_, 1971), Mauro Bolognini (_Drama of the Rich_, 1974), Umberto Lenzi (_Almost Human_, 1974), Pier Paolo Pasolini (_Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom_, 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (_Novecento_, 1976) and Tinto Brass (_The Key_, 1983).

In 1970, Morricone wrote the score for _Violent City_. That same year, he received his first Nastro d'Argento for the music in _Metti, una sera a cena_ (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, 1969) and his second only a year later for _Sacco e Vanzetti_ (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he had made a memorable collaboration with the legendary American folk singer and activist Joan Baez. His soundtrack for _Sacco e Vanzetti_ contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song "Here's to You", sung by Joan Baez. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: _"Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime"_. The song became a hit in several countries, selling over 790,000 copies in France only.[76] The song was later included in movies such as _The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou_[77] and in the video game _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ as the closing theme as well as Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes.

In the same year, Morricone composed the score for the less-known drama _Maddalena_ (1971) by the Polish film director Jerzy Kawalerowicz which included its composition 'Chi Mai'. The theme appeared on the million-selling score for Georges Lautner's _Le Professionnel_ (1981),[78] as well as the TV series, _An Englishman's Castle_ (1978) and _The Life and Times of David Lloyd George_ (1981).[79] Because of its appearance on the latter, "Chi Mai" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1981.[80] The single was certified by the BPI with a golden record on 1 May 1981[81] and sold over 900,000 copies in France alone.[82] "Chi Mai" is also the name of the online community about Morricone, which offers a repository of information and a free online magazine called "Maestro", containing reviews, articles, discoveries and free comments.[83]

In the beginning of the 1970s, Morricone achieved success with other singles, including _A Fistful of Dynamite_ (1971) and _God With Us_ (1974), having sold respectively 477,000 and 378,000 copies in France only.[84][85]

Between 1967 and 1993 the composer had a long-term collaboration with director Mauro Bolognini. Morricone wrote more than 15 film scores for Bolognini, including _Le streghe_ (1966), _L'assoluto naturale_ (1969), _Un bellissimo novembre_ (1969), _Metello_ (1970), _Chronicle of a Homicide_ (1972), _Libera, My Love_ (1973), _Per le antiche scale_ (1975), _La Dame aux camelias_ (1980), _Mosca addio_ (1987), _Gli indifferenti_ (1988) and _Husband and Lovers_ (1992).

Horror & giallo

Ennio Morricone's eclecticism and knack for creating highly poignant, melodic and emotional music found great scope also in horror movies, such as the baroque thrillers of Dario Argento, from _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_ (1969), _The Cat o' Nine Tails_ (1970) and _Four Flies on Grey Velvet_ (1971) to _The Stendhal Syndrome_ (1996) and _The Phantom of the Opera_ (1998). His other horror scores include _Nightmare Castle_ (1965), _A Quiet Place in the Country_ (1968), _The Antichrist_ (1974), _Autopsy_ (1975) and _Night Train Murders_ (1975).

In addition, Morricone's music has also been featured in many popular and cult Italian giallo films, such as _Senza sapere niente di lei_ (1969), _Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion_ (1970), _A Lizard in a Woman's Skin_ (1971), _Cold Eyes of Fear_ (1971), _The Fifth Cord_ (1971), _Short Night of Glass Dolls_ (1971), _My Dear Killer_ (1972), _What Have You Done to Solange?_ (1972), _Black Belly of the Tarantula_ (1972), _Who Saw Her Die?_ (1972) and _Spasmo_ (1974).

In 1977 Morricone scored Alberto De Martino's apocalyptic horror film _Holocaust 2000_, starring Kirk Douglas. In 1982 he composed the score for John Carpenter's science fiction horror movie _The Thing_.[86] Morricone's main theme for the film was reflected in Marco Beltrami's film's score of prequel of the 1982 film, which was released in 2011.

Hollywood career

The _Dollars Trilogy_ was not released in the United States until 1967 when United Artists, who had already enjoyed success distributing the British-produced James Bond films in the United States, decided to release Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.[87]

One of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film _The Bible: In the Beginning..._ by John Huston. According to Sergio Miceli's book _Morricone, la musica, il cinema_, Morricone wrote about 15 or 16 minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by Franco Ferrara. At first Morricone's teacher Goffredo Petrassi had been engaged to write the score for the great big budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. RCA Records then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer Dino De Laurentiis and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have the exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get the ok by RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for _The Bible: In the Beginning_ in such films as _The Return of Ringo_ (1965) by Duccio Tessari and Alberto Negrin's _The Secret of the Sahara_ (1987).

Morricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.[88]

1970–1985: from _Two Mules_ to _Red Sonja_

In 1970, Morricone composed the music for Don Siegel's _Two Mules for Sister Sara_, an American-Mexican western film starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood. The same year the composer also delivered the title theme _The Men from Shiloh_ for the American Western television series The Virginian[89] and the score for Phil Karlson's war film _Hornets' Nest_, starring Rock Hudson, and scored _Bluebeard_, starring Richard Burton, two years later.

In 1974 Morricone wrote music for some unknown episodes of the science-fiction television series _Space: 1999_, directed by Lee H. Katzin, and the following year he scored the George Kennedy revenge thriller _The "Human" Factor (1975 film)_, which was the final film of director Edward Dmytryk. Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to William Friedkin's 1973 film _The Exorcist_, directed by John Boorman: _Exorcist II: The Heretic_. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed 30,749,142 in the United States,[90] turning a profit but still disappointing in comparison to the original film's gross. The same year he scored the Dino De Laurentiis produced adventure film _Orca_, starring Richard Harris, which was also only a minor hit but later developed a cult following.

In 1978, the composer worked with Terrence Malick for _Days of Heaven_, starring Richard Gere. During the lengthy editing process of the romantic drama, which won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography with an additional three nominations for the score, Terrence Malick and Billy Weber made use of a temporary score dominated by Morricone's music for the Bernardo Bertolucci film _Novecento_. Malick also chose the ethereal Aquarium music from Camille Saint-Saëns ("The Carnival of the Animals") to frame the film. When Malick decided he wanted Morricone to score his movie, the director sent a version of it to Italy with the Novecento temp track in place. Morricone agreed to the assignment and Malick flew to Italy because the composer did not fly, so would not travel to the United States. Malick took the movie over to Morricone in Italy and Morricone was writing for _Days of Heaven_ the whole time. Afterwards they scored the music in Italy. In _Days of Heaven_, Morricone's elegiac music coexists with pre-existing selections.

Despite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and '70s, _Days of Heaven_ earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, with his score up against Jerry Goldsmith's _The Boys from Brazil_, Dave Grusin's _Heaven Can Wait_, Giorgio Moroder's _Midnight Express_ (the eventual winner) and John Williams's _Superman: The Movie_ at the Oscar ceremonies in 1979.[91]

In 1979, Morricone provided the music for the thriller _Bloodline_, directed by Terence Young, best known for directing the James Bond films _Dr. No_ (1962), _From Russia with Love_ (1963), and _Thunderball_ (1965). Subsequently, the composer was asked to score Michael Ritchie's _The Island_ (1980, starring Michael Caine), Gordon Willis's thriller _Windows_ (1980), Andrew Bergman's comedy _So Fine_ (1981) starring Ryan O'Neal, Matt Cimber's film _Butterfly_ (1982), starring Pia Zadora, Samuel Fuller's controversial drama film _White Dog_ (1982) and _Thieves After Dark_ (1984), Jerry London's critically acclaimed TV movie _The Scarlet and the Black_ (1983), starring Gregory Peck, and Richard Fleischers box office bomb _Red Sonja_ (1985), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brigitte Nielsen.

1986 onwards: from _The Mission_ to _The Hateful Eight_

Morricone's most fruitful and often long-term collaborations in English language cinema been with directors such as Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Warren Beatty, Oliver Stone and especially Roland Joffé, for whom Morricone wrote one of his best-known scores, the highly evocative soundtrack for _The Mission_ (1986).

ASSOCIATION WITH ROLAND JOFFÉ

_The Mission_, directed by Joffé, was about a piece of history considerably more distant, as Spanish Jesuit missionaries see their work undone as a tribe of Paraguayan natives fall within a territorial dispute between the Spanish and Portuguese. At one point the score was one of the world's best-selling film scores, selling over 3 million copies worldwide.[92][93]

Morricone finally received a second Oscar nomination for _The Mission_.[94] Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's _Round Midnight_. It was considered as a surprising win and a controversial one, given that much of the music in the film was pre-existing.[95] Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with _The Guardian_: "I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission. Especially when you consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft!"[96] His score for _The Mission_ was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell.[97] The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI's list of 25 greatest film scores of all time.[98]

The composer wrote also the music for three other movies by Joffé: _Fat Man and Little Boy_ (1989, starring Paul Newman), _City of Joy_ (1992, starring Patrick Swayze) and the opening film for the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, _Vatel_, starring Gérard Depardieu, Uma Thurman and Tim Roth.

Association with De Palma and Levinson

On three occasions, Brian De Palma worked with Morricone: _The Untouchables_ (1987), the 1989 war drama _Casualties of War_ and the science fiction film _Mission to Mars_ (2000).[99] De Palma's _The Untouchables_, starring rising star Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, Robert De Niro as Al Capone and the Oscar-winning Sean Connery, was released in 1987. Morricone's score for _The Untouchables_ resulted in his third nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Score.

In a 2001 interview with _The Guardian_, Morricone stated that he had good experiences with De Palma: "De Palma is delicious! He respects music, he respects composers. For The Untouchables, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, and of course we didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie."[100]

Another American director, Barry Levinson, commissioned the composer on two occasions. First, for the crime-drama _Bugsy_, starring Warren Beatty, which received ten Oscar nominations,[101] winning two for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Dennis Gassner, Nancy Haigh) and Best Costume Design.[102]

The highest-grossing American movie for which the composer wrote a complete score was for Levinson's _Disclosure_ in 1994, starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore.

"He doesn't have a piano in his studio, I always thought that with composers, you sit at the piano, and you try to find the melody. There's no such thing with Morricone. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the orchestration completely done", said Barry Levinson in an interview.[103]

Other notable Hollywood scores

During his career in Hollywood, Morricone was approached for numerous other projects, including the Gregory Nava drama _A Time of Destiny_ (1988), _Frantic_ by Polish-French director Roman Polanski (1988, starring Harrison Ford), Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 drama film _Hamlet_ (starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close), the neo-noir[104] crime film _State of Grace_ by Phil Joanou (1990, starring Sean Penn and Ed Harris), _Rampage_ (1992) by William Friedkin, and the romantic drama _Love Affair_ (1994) by Warren Beatty.

None of the aforementioned films were box office successes, but fortunately Morricone was also commissioned for more successful motion pictures such as _In the Line of Fire_ (1993) by Wolfgang Petersen, starring Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich, the horror film _Wolf_ (1994, Mike Nichols), which featured Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead roles, and _Bulworth_ by Warren Beatty.

In 1997, Morricone composed the music for _Lolita_ (by Adrian Lyne) and Oliver Stone's _U Turn_, starring Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. A year later, Ennio Morricone wrote a complete score for the 1998 drama _What Dreams May Come_, but Vincent Ward found the music too emotional and replaced Morricone with Michael Kamen.[105]

One of his last complete scores for an American-related project includes the 2002 thriller _Ripley's Game_, starring John Malkovich, by Liliana Cavani. Noted background music from the shooting scene "target practice" in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained was also featured in Kung Fu theaters movies.

Extensive reuse of his music

Besides the 500 original film scores that have been composed by Morricone for movies and television series in a career of over six decades, his music is in addition frequently reused in more than 150 other film projects. Morricone's compositions appeared in the German TV series _Derrick_ (1989), the live-action comedy film _Inspector Gadget_, _Ally McBeal_ (2001), _The Simpsons_ (2002), _The Sopranos_ (2001–2002) and more recently in _Dancing with the Stars_ (2010).

Quentin Tarantino borrowed Morricone's music for several of his films. The Main Title of _Death Rides a Horse_ (1967) can be heard in _Kill Bill: Volume 1_, while _Kill Bill: Volume 2_ contains music originally from _For a Few Dollars More_, _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_, _The Mercenary_ and _Navajo Joe_. The themes "Paranoia Prima" and "Unexpected Violence" ("Violenza inattesa"), originally from respectively _The Cat o' Nine Tails_ and _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_, were used in _Death Proof_ (2007) by Tarantino.

In 2009, Tarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the film score for _Inglourious Basterds_.[106][107] Morricone was unable to, because the film's sped-up production schedule conflicted with his scoring of Giuseppe Tornatore's _Baarìa_.[108] However, Tarantino did use eight tracks composed by Morricone in the film, with four of them included on the soundtrack. The tracks came originally from Morricone's scores for _The Big Gundown_ (1966), _Revolver_ (1973) and _Allonsanfàn_ (1974).[109][110]

In 2012, Morricone composed the song "Ancora Qui" with lyrics by Italian singer Elisa for Tarantino's _Django Unchained_, a track that appeared together with three existing music tracks composed by Morricone on the soundtrack. "Ancora Qui" was one of the contenders for an Academy Award nomination in the Best Original Song category, but eventually the song was not nominated.[111] On 4 January 2013 Morricone presented Tarantino with a Life Achievement Award at a special ceremony being cast as a continuation of the International Rome Film Festival.[112] In 2014, Morricone claimed that he would "never work" with Tarantino again,[113] but later agreed to write an original film score for Tarantino's _The Hateful Eight_, which won an Academy Award in 2016 in the Best Original Score category. His nomination for this film marked him at that time as the second oldest nominee in Academy history, behind Gloria Stuart. Morricone's win marked his first competitive Oscar, and at the age of 87 he became the oldest person at the time to win a competitive Oscar.

In 2014, Morricone's song "Giù La Testa" was featured in Florian Habicht's feature film _Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets_, an unconventional rockumentary about British group Pulp which premiered at SXSW that year.

Composer for Giuseppe Tornatore

In 1988 Morricone started an ongoing and very successful collaboration with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. His first score for Tornatore was for the drama film _Cinema Paradiso_. The international version of the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival[114] and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. Morricone received a BAFTA award with his son Andrea, and a David di Donatello for his score. In 2002, the director's cut 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as _Cinema Paradiso: The New Version_).

After the success of _Cinema Paradiso_, the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film _Everybody's Fine_ (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), _A Pure Formality_ (1994) starring Gérard Depardieu and Roman Polanski, _The Star Maker_ (1995), _The Legend of 1900_ (1998) starring Tim Roth, the 2000 romantic drama _Malèna_ (which featured Monica Bellucci) and the psychological thriller mystery film _La sconosciuta_ (2006).

More recently, Morricone composed the scores for _Baarìa_ (2009), _The Best Offer_ (2013) starring Geoffrey Rush, Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland and the romantic drama _The Correspondence_ (2015) starring Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko.

The composer won several music awards for his scores to Tornatore's movies. So, Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for _Malèna_. For _Legend of 1900_, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

Television series and recent works

Morricone has worked for television, from a single title piece to variety shows and documentaries to TV series, including _Moses the Lawgiver_ (1974), _The Life and Times of David Lloyd George_ (1981), _Marco Polo_ (1982) (which won two Primetime Emmys), _The Secret of the Sahara_ (1987), I Promessi Sposi and _Nostromo_ (1996).

He wrote the score for the Mafia television series _La piovra_ seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes "Droga e sangue" ("Drugs and Blood"), "La Morale", and "L'Immorale". Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project _La bibbia_ ("The Bible").

In the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the _Ultimo_ crime dramas, resulting in _Ultimo_ (1998), _Ultimo 2 – La sfida_ (1999), _Ultimo 3 – L'infiltrato_ (2004) and _Ultimo 4 – L'occhio del falco_ (2013).

In the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as _Il Cuore nel Pozzo_ (2005), _Karol: A Man Who Became Pope_ (2005), _La provinciale_ (2006), _Giovanni Falcone_ (2007), _Pane e libertà_ (2009) and _Come Un Delfino 1–2_ (2011–2013).

With an estimated 13 million viewers, _Karol: A Man Who Became Pope_ became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, _Karol: The Pope, The Man_ (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double disc album with both scores is released.

In 2003, Morricone scored another epic, for Japanese television, called _Musashi_ and was the Taiga drama about Miyamoto Musashi, Japan's legendary warrior. A part of his "applied music" is now applied to Italian television films.

Morricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's "Dear God Please Help Me" from the album _Ringleader of the Tormentors_ in 2006.[115]

Since 2004, Morricone wrote music for almost exclusively Italian television movies and mini-series, especially for directors such as Giuseppe Tornatore, Alberto Negrin, Giuliano Montaldo, and Franza Di Rosa.

In 2008, the composer recorded music for a Lancia commercial, featuring Richard Gere and directed by Harald Zwart (known for directing _The Pink Panther 2_).[116]

Tarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the soundtrack for his film, _Inglourious Basterds_. However, Morricone refused because of the sped-up production schedule of the film.[117][118] Tarantino did use several Morricone tracks from previous films in the soundtrack. Morricone instead wrote the music for _Baarìa_ by Tornatore. It was the second time Morricone's turned down the director, he also turned down an offer to write some music for _Pulp Fiction_ in 1994.[119]

In spring and summer 2010, Morricone worked with Hayley Westenra for a collaboration on her album _Paradiso_.[120] The album features new songs written by Morricone, as well as some of his best-known film compositions of the last 50 years.[121][122] Hayley recorded the album with Morricone's orchestra in Rome during the summer of 2010.[123][124][125]

Since 1995, he composed the music for several advertising campaigns of Dolce & Gabbana. The commercials were directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.[126]

In 2013, Morricone collaborated with Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini on a new version of her hit single "La solitudine" for her 20 years anniversary greatest hits album _20 – The Greatest Hits_.

Morricone composed the music for _The Best Offer_ (2013) by Giuseppe Tornatore.[127]

In 2014, Ennio Morricone became an honorary chairman of the First International Open Competition in author's music video "Mediamusic." The final of the competition was scheduled on 1 March 2015 in Moscow.

He wrote the score for Christian Carion's _En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait_ (2015) and the most recent movie by Tornatore: _The Correspondence_ (2016), featuring Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko.[128]

In July 2015, Quentin Tarantino announced after the screening of footage of his movie _The Hateful Eight_ at the San Diego Comic-Con International that Morricone would score the film, the first Western that Morricone has scored since 1981.[129] The score was critically acclaimed and won several awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score.[130][131]


Live performances

WP2015_EnnioMorricone_FFM.jpg]] Before receiving his diplomas in trumpet, composition and instrumentation from the conservatory, Morricone was already active as a trumpet player, often performing in an orchestra that specialized in music written for films. After completing his education at Saint Cecilia, the composer honed his orchestration skills as an arranger for Italian radio and television. In order to support himself, he moved to RCA in the early sixties and entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry.[132] Since 1964, Morricone was also a founding member of the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.

To ready his music for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music together into longer suites. Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favorites. In concert, Morricone normally has 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and ethnic instruments share the stage.[133]

On 20 September 1984 Morricone conducted the Orchestre national des Pays de la Loire at _Cinésymphonie '84_ ("Première nuit de la musique de film/First night of film music") in the French concert hall Salle Pleyel in Paris. He performed some of his best-known compositions such as _Metti, una sera a cena_, _Novecento_ and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_.[134] Michel Legrand and Georges Delerue performed on the same evening.[135]

On 15 October 1987 Morricone gave a concert in front of 12,000 people in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium, with the Dutch Metropole Orchestra and the Italian operatic soprano Alide Maria Salvetta.[136][137] A live-album with a recording of this concert was released in the same year.[138][139]

On 9 June 2000 Morricone went to the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent to conduct his music together with the National Orchestra of Belgium.[140][141] During the concert's first part, the screening of _The Life and Death of King Richard III_ (1912) was accompanied with live music by Morricone. It was the very first time that the score was performed live in Europe. The second part of the evening consisted of an anthology of the composer's work. The event took place on the eve of Euro 2000, the European Football Championship in Belgium and the Netherlands.[142]

Morricone performed over 250 concerts as of 2001.[143] Since 2001, the composer has been on a world tour, the latter part sponsored by Giorgio Armani, with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta, touring London (Barbican 2001; 75th birthday _Concerto_, Royal Albert Hall 2003), Paris, Verona, and Tokyo. Morricone performed his classic film scores at the Munich Philharmonie in 2005 and Hammersmith Apollo Theatre in London, UK, on 1 & 2 December 2006. Morricone_at_United_Nations_HQ.jpg]]

He made his North American concert debut on 3 February 2007 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The previous evening, Morricone had already presented at the United Nations a concert comprising some of his film themes, as well as the cantata _Voci dal silenzio_ to welcome the new Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. A _Los Angeles Times_ review bemoaned the poor acoustics and opined of Morricone: "His stick technique is adequate, but his charisma as a conductor is zero." Morricone, though, has said: "Conducting has never been important to me. If the audience comes for my gestures, they had better stay outside."

On 12 December 2007 Morricone conducted the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta at the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna, presenting a selection of his own works. Together with the Roma Sinfonietta and the Belfast Philharmonic Choir, Morricone performed at the Opening Concerts of the Belfast Festival at Queen's, in the Waterfront Hall on 17 and 18 October 2008. Morricone and Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta also held a concert at the Belgrade Arena (Belgrade, Serbia) on 14 February 2009.

On 10 April 2010 Morricone conducted a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta and (as in all of his previous London concerts) the Crouch End Festival Chorus. On 11 September he conducted a concert in Verona.

On 26 February 2012 Morricone made his Australian debut when he conducted the Western Australian Youth Orchestra together with a 100 voice chorus (made up primarily of WASO chorus members) at the Burswood Theatre (part of Crown Perth (formerly known as Burswood Entertainment Complex)) in Perth. On 2 March 2012 he conducted the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra at Elder Park, Adelaide as part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.

On 22 December 2012 Morricone conducted the 85-piece Belgian orchestra "Orkest der Lage Landen" and a 100-piece choir during a two-hour concert in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp.[144]

In November 2013 Morricone began a world tour to coincide with the 50th anniversary of his film music career and performed in locations such as the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Santiago, Chile, Berlin, Germany (O2 World), Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna (Stadhalle). Back in June 2014, Morricone had to cancel a U.S tour in New York (Barclays Center) and Los Angeles (Nokia Theatre LA Live) due to a back procedure on 20 February. Morricone postponed the rest of his world tour.

In November 2014 Morricone stated that he will resume his European tour starting from February 2015.[145]


Forum Music Village

In the late 1960s, Morricone and three other Italian composers (Piero Piccioni, Armando Trovajoli and Luis Bacalov) founded Forum Music Village (Rome), previously called Ortophonic recording studio. The recording studio has some peculiarities, one of them is the ability to record a church organ directly to the studio.[146]

Morricone has been using the studio to create his scores for the past 40 years. The studio has hosted many directors who have worked alongside him, including Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone and Barry Levinson.

The Academy Award-winning scores of _Il Postino: The Postman_ by Luis Bacalov and _Life Is Beautiful_ by Nicola Piovani were recorded in Studio A of Forum Music Village.

Notable artists who have recorded at Forum Music Village are Quincy Jones, Jon and Vangelis, Plácido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Will.i.am, Yo-Yo Ma, Morrissey, Bruno Nicolai, Alessandro Alessandroni, Goblin, Pino Donaggio, Nicola Piovani, Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi and Cher.[147]


Personal life

On 13 October 1956 he married Maria Travia, whom he had met in 1950. Travia has written lyrics to complement her husband's pieces. Her works include the Latin texts for _The Mission_. They have three sons and a daughter, in order of birth: Marco (1957), Alessandra (1961), the conductor and film composer Andrea (1964), and Giovanni Morricone (1966), a filmmaker, who lives in New York City.

Morricone has lived in Italy his entire life and has never desired to live in Hollywood. Morricone is also not fluent in English and will give interviews only in Italian, his native language.[148][149]

On 25 June 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Ennio Morricone among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[150]


Influence

Ennio Morricone has influenced many artists from other styles and genres, including Danger Mouse,[151] Dire Straits,[152] Muse,[153] Metallica,[154] Radiohead[155] and Hans Zimmer.[156]

-   Morricone's influence extends into the realm of pop music. Hugo Montenegro had a hit with a version of the main theme from _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This was followed by his album of Morricone's music in 1968.[157]
-   Aside from his music having been sampled by everyone from rappers (Jay-Z),[158] to electronic outfits (the Orb),[159] Morricone wrote "Se Telefonando", which became Italy's fifth biggest-selling record of 1966 and has since been re-recorded by Françoise Hardy, among many others, and scored the strings for "Dear God, Please Help Me" on Morrissey's 2006 _Ringleader of the Tormentors_ album.
-   Morricone's film music was also recorded by many artists. John Zorn recorded an album of Morricone's music, _The Big Gundown_, with Keith Rosenberg in the mid-1980s. Lyricists and poets have helped convert some of his melodies into a songbook.
-   Morricone collaborated with world music artists, like Portuguese fado singer Dulce Pontes (in 2003 with _Focus_, an album praised by Paulo Coelho and where his songbook can be sampled) and virtuoso cellist Yo-Yo Ma (in 2004), who both recorded albums of Morricone classics with the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra and Morricone himself conducting. The album _Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone_ sold over 130,000 copies in 2004.[160]
-   In 1990 the American singer Amii Stewart, best known for the 1979 disco hit "Knock on Wood", recorded a tribute album entitled _Pearls – Amii Stewart Sings Ennio Morricone_ for the RCA label, including a selection of the composer's best-known songs. Since the mid-1980s Stewart resides in Italy, the _Pearls_ album features Rome's Philharmonic Orchestra and was co-produced by Morricone himself.[161]
-   Metallica, uses Morricone's _The Ecstasy of Gold_ as an intro at their concerts (shock jocks _Opie and Anthony_ also used the song at the start of their XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio shows.) The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra also played it on Metallica's album _S&M_ (album).[162] The theme from _A Fistful of Dollars_ is also used as a concert intro by The Mars Volta.[163]
-   Gnarls Barkley's hit single _Crazy_ (2006) was musically inspired by Morricone[164]
-   The Spaghetti Western Orchestra, Morricone's tribute band started in Australia. Anna Calvi has admitted Morricone's influence.[165]

-   Alex Turner (musician), has noted Morricone's influence on his writing, in particular on The Last Shadow Puppets album _The Age of the Understatement_.[166]
-   In 2007, the tribute album _We All Love Ennio Morricone_ was released, featuring performances by various artists, including Sarah Brightman, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica
-   Morricone inspired the namesake of Morricone Youth, a New York band dedicated to playing music from film and television, founded by musician and radio host Devon E. Levins. In addition to composers like Lalo Schifrin and Jerry Goldsmith, the band has performed music from a large spectrum of Morricone's film career, ranging from his work in the spaghetti westerns to The Exorcist II, as well as original Morricone-inspired pieces.[167]
-   On their 2008 album _Red of Tooth and Claw_, the independent rock band Murder by Death composed and included a song as a theme/tribute to Morricone entitled "Theme (for Ennio Morricone)".[168]
-   Radiohead, drew inspiration from the recording style of Morricone for their album _OK Computer_.[169] Muse cites Morricone as an influence for the songs "City of Delusion", "Hoodoo", and "Knights of Cydonia" on their album _Black Holes and Revelations_. The band has recently started playing the song "Man with a Harmonica" live played by Chris Wolstenholme, as an intro to "Knights of Cydonia".[170] "The Globalist" from their 2015 album _Drones_ features a Morricone-influenced introduction.
-   The score for _The Thing_ 2011 prequel film, composed by Marco Beltrami was inspired and uses several elements from Morricone's original soundtrack from The Thing (1982 film), directed by John Carpenter, the 1982 film of the same name.[171]
-   His composition "Alla luce del giorno", being used for a 30-second YouTube advertisement for Grubhub in September–October 2017
-   "Lovers on the Sun", a song released in 2014 by French music producer David Guetta, is influenced by Morricone's western scores.[172]

Prizes and awards

Academy Awards

Ennio Morricone received his first Academy Award nomination in 1979 for the score to _Days of Heaven_ (Terrence Malick, 1978).[189]

In 1984, the U.S. distributor of Sergio Leone's _Once Upon a Time in America_ reportedly failed to file the proper paperwork so that Morricone's score, regarded as one of his best, would be eligible for consideration for an Academy Award.

Two years later, Morricone received his second Oscar nomination for _The Mission_.[190] He also received Oscar nominations for his scores to _The Untouchables_ (1987), _Bugsy_ (1991), _Malèna_ (2000), and _The Hateful Eight_ (2016).[191] On 28 February 2016, Morricone won his first competitive Academy Award for his score to _The Hateful Eight._[192]

Morricone and Alex North are the only composers to receive the Academy Honorary Award since the award's introduction in 1928.[193] Ennio Morricone received the Academy Honorary Award on 25 February 2007, presented by Clint Eastwood, "for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music." With the statuette came a standing ovation.[194] In conjunction with the honor, Morricone released a tribute album, _We All Love Ennio Morricone_, that featured as its centerpiece Celine Dion's rendition of "I Knew I Loved You" (based on "Deborah's Theme" from _Once Upon a Time in America_), which she performed at the ceremony. Behind-the-scenes studio production and recording footage of "I Knew I Loved You" can be viewed in the debut episode of the QuincyJones.com Podcast.[195] The lyric, as with Morricone's _Love Affair_, had been written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Morricone's acceptance speech was in his native Italian tongue and was interpreted by Clint Eastwood, who stood to his left. Eastwood and Morricone had in fact met two days earlier for the first time in 40 years at a reception.

AFI

In 2005 four film scores by Ennio Morricone were nominated by the American Film Institute for an honoured place in the AFI's Top 25 of Best American Film Scores of All Time.[196] His score for _The Mission_ was ranked 23rd in the Top 25 list.[197]
