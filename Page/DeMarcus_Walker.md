Professional career

Walker received an invitation to the NFL Combine, but chose to only perform the bench and produced 18 reps.[8] He participated at Florida State's Pro Day and completed all the combine drills.

Walker was ranked the 10th best defensive end by NFLDraftScout.com, the 15th best defensive end by _Sports Illustrated_, and ranked the 11th best defensive end in the draft by ESPN.[10][11]

The Denver Broncos selected Walker in the second round (51st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.[12] On May 15, 2017, the Broncos signed Walker to a four-year, $5.07 million contract with $2.52 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.83 million.[13]
