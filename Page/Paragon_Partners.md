History

Edin Hadzic and Krischan von Moeller founded Paragon Partners in 2004 and invested in the first two holdings. The first institutional fund (_Paragon Secondary Partners_) was launched in 2005. In 2008, the second fund (_Paragon Fund I_) followed.

In 2011 and 2012, there were some critical media reports in which Paragon was referred to as a _locust_.[1]

In 2014 Paragon wanted to take over the insolvent Weltbild Publishing Group. The takeover failed.[2] In the same year the third fund (_Paragon Fund II_) was launched. At the end of 2014, Paragon Partners had a total of approximately â‚¬634 million in assets under management.[3]
