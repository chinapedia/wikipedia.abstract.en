GIUSEPPE PEREGO (1 June 1915 â€“ 6 December 1996) was an Italian comic artist, active between the early 1930s and the early 1980s.


Life and career

Born in Arcore, Perego started his career at very young age at Million Film, where he collaborated as animator with the brothers Carlo and Vittorio Cossio. His early works as cartoonist were several strips published in _Corriere dei Piccoli_ and in _Modellina_ (the comic supplement of the newspaper _Il Mattino_), and some stories of the series _Scimmiottino_.[1][2]

After the World War II, Perego created _Buffalo Brill_ and drew other series for Edizioni Alpe, illustrated several _Gim Toro_ and _Dixy Scott_ comic books, and collaborated with the publisher Dardo and with the magazines _Il Vittorioso_ and _Il Monello_. In 1952 he started a thirty years-long collaboration with Disney, first as cover illustrator of _Topolino_ and later drawing hundreds of stories and illustrations for many Disney publications. During this time he also collaborated with other publishers, co-creating with Andrea Lavezzolo the series _Poldo e Poldino_ for _Il Giorno dei Ragazzi_ and drawing several episodes of _Fix and Foxi_.[3][4]
