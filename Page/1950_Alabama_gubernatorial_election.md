The 1950 ALABAMA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 7, 1950, to elect the Governor of Alabama. Incumbent Democrat Jim Folsom was term-limited, and could not seek a second consecutive term.


Democratic primary

At the time this election took place, Alabama, as with most other southern states, was solidly Democratic, and the Republican Party had such diminished influence that the Democratic primary was the _de facto_ contest for state offices.
