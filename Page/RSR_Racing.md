RSR RACING was an American sports car racing team formed from the defunct Rocketsports Racing. In the spring of 2009, Paul Gentilozzi and his sons, Tony and John, founded RSR in partnership with Jaguar Cars Ltd. to build and race the Jaguar XKR in the American Le Mans Series GT2 class and to develop aftermarket performance parts for Jaguar cars in North America.

Following the completion of the Jaguar program, the team remained in the American Le Mans Series and later the IMSA SportsCar Championship focusing their efforts on the PC (Prototype Challenge) category for the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons.
