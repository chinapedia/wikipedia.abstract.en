  Tsarist Russia   During the times of Slavery in Russia, the health conditions of the population range starting from a calamitous level. Generally, lack of preventive measures against diseases results in a very high mortality rate among both adults and children. Severe sanitary neglect, filth and unhygienic living conditions prevail. Six epidemis of Asiatic cholera strike Russia and claim over 2 million human lives in the country.[1]
  1922–1991        Soviet Russia builds a totally socialist health care model (Semashko system) with a centralized, integrated, hierarchically organized with the government providing state-funded health care to all citizens. All health personnel are state employees. Control of communicable diseases have priority over non-communicable ones. On the whole, the system tends to primary care, and places much emphasis on specialist and hospital care. Universal healthcare is established in 1930s and 1940s as part of rapid modernization and industrialization.[2]
  1991–2000        Period following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia’s statist political economy implodes, and its healthcare system is thrown into crisis. Public expenditures on health decline dramatically, following a decade-long decline in the economy. Health indicators plummet. Male life expectancy decline to below 60 years. Infectious diseases re-emerge and spread, and even childhood immunization programs collapse temporarily in parts of the country.[3]
  2000–2010        The Russian healthcare system recovers substantially in terms of financing, performance, organizational coherence and health outcomes. Rapid growth the economy from 2000 to 2007 allows growth in spending for public healthcare[4][5] and by 2006 the figure exceeds the pre-1991 level in real terms.[6] Also there's an increase in life expectancy from 1991-93 levels, and a decrease in infant mortality from 18.1 in 1995 to 8.4 in 2008.[7] By 2010, the worst effects on health indicators reverse.[8] However, health in Russia remains well below the levels of developed countries.
  2010–present     Today, Russia's healthare system has recovered substantially from the crisis conditions of the 1990s. However, it is still characterized by its low efficiency, with outcomes similar to those of countries far less developed. As of 2016, life expectancy in Russia is lower that those of countries like Belize, Nepal and Bangladesh.[9][10]
