INCARVILLATEINE is a complex monoterpene alkaloid that is a derivative of Î±-truxillic acid. It can be isolated from the plant genus _Incarvillea._


Biological activity

Opioidergic

Incarvillateine isolated from _Incarvillea sinensis_ has demonstrated significant analgesic activity when compared to the opiate alkaloid morphine.[1]

Incarvillateine's pain-killing effect was partially blocked by administration of naloxone,[2] norbinaltorphimine and beta-funaltrexamine,[3] which are receptor antagonists with varying selectivity for mu and kappa opioid receptors. Naltrindole, a delta opioid receptor antagonist, did not counteract the analgesic activity of incarvillateine.[4]

These findings indicate that incarvillateine may possess opioidergic receptor activity, but it is worthy to note that some studies indicate that naloxone was ineffective at countering incarvillateine's analgesic activity.[5]

Adenosinergic

Incarvillateine's antinociceptive effect was blocked by the administration of adenosine receptor antagonists such as theophylline. This suggests that incarvillateine's main mechanism of action is mediated through the adenosine receptor.[6]
