_RUGOLO PLAYS KENTON_ (subtitled _THE PETE RUGOLO ORCHESTRA PLAYS COMPOSITIONS INTRODUCED BY STAN KENTON_) is an album by composer, arranger and conductor Pete Rugolo featuring performances of tunes associated with Stan Kenton recorded in 1958 and first released on the Mercury label.[1][2][3][4]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow noted: "Since Pete Rugolo came to fame for his many arrangements for the Stan Kenton Orchestra and this was one of his last important jazz albums before he became largely a full-time writer for the studios, it seems only proper that the date finds Rugolo paying tribute to his former boss. ... Rugolo does not merely re-create the past but instead comes up with fresh variations".[5]
