_THE FIRST FILM_ is a 2015 British documentary film about cinema pioneer Louis Le Prince, made by David Nicholas Wilkinson.[1][2] It argues the case that Le Prince, rather than the Lumiere brothers, was the true inventor of moving pictures, making _Roundhay Garden Scene_ in Leeds in 1888. Le Prince mysterious disappeared in 1890.[3][4]

Mark Kermode, film critic of _The Guardian_, described the film as "a flickering story that blends intrigue, industrial espionage, and possibly even murder".[5]

The film's world premiere was at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival.[6] It went on general release in the United States in September 2016.[7]
