A Call to Penitence (2:1-3)

Following a tradition of Amos (), a call of penitence is given after the threats of total disaster.


Oracles against the Nations (2:4‚Äì15)

The nations spoken here represent Israel's enemies at 'the four points of the compass', so the oracles may function to establish Yahweh as 'the Lord of the Four Quarters of the Earth' or 'the Lord of the whole world'.

Verse 4

    _For Gaza shall be forsaken,_

        _And Ashkelon desolate;_

    _They shall drive out Ashdod at noonday,_

        _And Ekron shall be uprooted._[8]

-   "Gaza", "Ashkelon", "Ashdod", "Ekron" - Four of the usual five leading cities of the Philistines are mentioned. Gath is omitted, being at this time under the dominion of Israel/Judah. King David had subjugated it (). Under Joram the Philistines almost regained it (), but Uzziah () and Hezekiah () conquered them, so it remained under the Judah. ; ; , similarly mention only four cities of the Philistines.[9]

Verse 5

    _Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast,_

        _The nation of the Cherethites!_

    _The word of the Lord is against you,_

        _O Canaan, land of the Philistines:_

    _"I will destroy you;_

        _So there shall be no inhabitant."_[10]

-   "Cherethites" refers to the Cretans, a name applied to the Philistines as sprung from Crete (; ; ). Philistine means "an emigrant."[11]
