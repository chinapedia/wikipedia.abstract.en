Oralu kallu

Description

Oralu kallu or rubbo kallu is a household stone implement used for wet grinding. It consists of two separate parts. A grinding stone called gundukallu (ಗುಂಡುಕಲ್ಲು)/gootada kallu (ಗೂಟದಕಲ್ಲು) is a stout cylindrical stone of rounded ends with or without a wooden handle, and a base stone which actually is called oralu kallu has a central well with a diameter slightly larger than the gundukallu.

Wet grinding

Gundukallu is placed in the well of a base stone and rotated, usually with the left hand while the right hand is used to regularly push ingredients towards the well to grind them. The role of the hands keep interchanging with fatigue, duration and quantity of grinding.

Uses

-   To wet grind dosa/idli batters, various chutneys, masalas etc.
-   It is a preferred tool to grind uddina vada batter in hotels and restaurants.
-   For making chigali
-   It plays an important role in Arishina Kuttuva Shastra[1][2][3] (details under Miscellaneous section below), a wedding ritual in southern India.

Current scenario

Oralu kallu used to be a standard fixture of every household in the past. They were laid in flush with the kitchen floor or inlaid into counters or as separate stone unit within or outside homes. With availability and utility of mixer grinders, food processors, and commercial wet grinders, the oralu kallu has almost disappeared from urban areas and is on the decline in rural areas. Some believe that foods prepared using an oralu kallu taste better than foods processed in mixer grinders.


Beeso kallu

Description

Beeso kallu is a household stone implement for dry grinding millet. It is made of two thick circular flat stones on top of each other. The upper stone has a central hole which accommodates a small conical (metal/stone) projection from stone below about which it can rotate. Also, on the upper stone is another hole, peripheral in location, which houses a wooden handle for rotating it. It is also called as chakki (stone mill) in northern India

Dry grinding

Ingredients to be ground are poured through the central hole of the upper stone which then slides along the sides of metal/stone projecting from below into a gap between the upper and lower stone. There it gets ground to flour upon rotating the upper stone. Jato_An_ancient_tool_used_to_grind_food_item_in_Nepal.ogv

Uses

-   For making flour from millet like rice, ragi, wheat, jowar etc.
-   Sometimes powders like chili powder, sambar powder and other masala powders are also ground in it.

Miscellaneous

Arishina Kuttuva Shastra

Arishina Kuttuva Shastra (ಅರಿಶಿನ ಕುಟ್ಟುವ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ) is an important wedding ritual in Southern India. [4] Arishina is a Kannada word for turmeric. In the ritual, whole turmeric (dried whole unbroken tuber) is placed in the oralu kallu. Women use the onake (description below) to pound it to a powder. Powdered turmeric is made into a paste with water. Turmeric paste is then applied on the bride and groom. In northern India, the Haldi function is similar.[5]

In another wedding ritual, instead of turmeric, various other grains like rice and jowar are symbolically pounded by the bride.

Onake

Onake is a wooden pole/stick, about the length of an average person, used in the past to pound millets into flour. millet to be pounded is placed in the oralukallu and pounded with onake to flour. Currently its usage is mostly limited to the Arishina Kuttuva ritual in South Indian weddings. The onake is sometimes called a pestle in English.

A historical, brave woman, Obavva killed enemy soldiers with an onake in a battle at Chitradurga fort. She is revered as Onake Obavva. She is exemplified for the bravery and courage of women of Karnataka alongside another historical ruler, Kittur Chennamma.[6]

Murders

Gundukallu, the grinding stone of oralu kallu, has been used as a weapon in numerous murders.[7][8][9][10] Rarely, in domestic quarrels or family feuds or fights with neighbours or in village fights, a threat made by one individual to another can be heard said as "gundukallu yattak bidtini" (ಗುಂಡುಕಲ್ಲು ಯತ್ತಾಕ್ಬಿಡ್ತೀನಿ), which can be translated roughly as "will lift up the grinding stone and throw it on you".
