Production

In February 2010, _Variety_ reported that Walt Disney Pictures planned to film a sequel to _Enchanted_ with Barry Josephson and Barry Sonnenfeld producing again. Jessie Nelson was attached to write the screenplay and Anne Fletcher to direct. Disney hoped the cast members from the first film would return and for a release as early as 2011.[2]

On January 12, 2011, composer Alan Menken was asked about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, "I’ve heard things but there's nothing yet. I don’t know much about what’s happening with that. Honestly, I don’t know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I’m not frustrated that it isn’t one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate."[3]

On March 28, 2011, James Marsden, who played Prince Edward in _Enchanted_, was asked about the sequel.[4]

As of July 2014, Disney had hired screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss to write a script for a sequel and also hired Anne Fletcher to direct the film.[5] In October 2016, _The Hollywood Reporter_ announced that Adam Shankman entered negotiations to direct the sequel, titled _Disenchanted_, and that Amy Adams would reprise her role from the first film with filming scheduled to begin in summer 2017.[6] In January 2018, Shankman stated that the sequel's script would be finished within a couple of weeks and the next step would be to get the music written.[7] He also went on to say that the film would feature more songs than the original but the same amount of animation.[8]
