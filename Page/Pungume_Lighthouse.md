The PUNGUME LIGHTHOUSE is located on Pungume Island at the south western tip of the Zanzibar Archipelago, in Tanzania.[1][2] The Lighthouse is a squared stone tower recently painted with black and white stripes.[3] The lighthouse is an important one as it shines into the channel where ships enter the Stone Town harbor. The lighthouse is managed and operated by the Zanzibar Ports Corporation.[4]
