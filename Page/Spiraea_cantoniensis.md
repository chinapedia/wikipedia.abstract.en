_SPIRAEA CANTONIENSIS_, also known as, REEVE'S SPIRAEA,[1] BRIDALWREATH SPIREA, DOUBLE WHITE MAY, CAPE MAY or MAY BUSH,[2] is a species of plant native to China, belonging to the family Rosaceae. An ornamental plant featured in gardens, it is a shrub growing up to tall with frothy, pompom-like clusters of snow-white flowers borne along arching branches that bloom in May in its native country, hence its common name.[3]


Etymology

_Spiraea_ is a generic name derives from the word Greek _speiraira_, "a plant used for wreaths or garlands" of Speira, "spiral or twisted".[4]


Description

It is a deciduous or semi-evergreen shrub that reaches a size of 1–2 m height, very branched, with thin branches, arched, flexible and glabrous. The leaves are alternate, simple, little petiolate, with 2–6 cm long green lanceolate, elliptical-rhomboidal or slightly obovate lamina, with 3 nerves parallel from its base, irregularly crenate-dentate in its distal half. The leaves would turn a yellowish red colour in autumn. Blooming in spring and snow white in colour, its flowers are hermaphroditic, actinomorphic, of ± 1 cm diameter, arranged in axillary corimbos, each with 5 free sepals, 5 white petals, numerous stamens shorter than the petals. The fruit is a poly-follicle, with 3-5 plurisemined carpidia (follicles).[5]


Cultivation

It is used as a screening or bordering plant alongside a fence line or as a conspicuous feature plant. May Bushes prefer a full sun to partly shaded position with well drained soil, forgiving both light frost, wind, heat, poor soils and drought. It generally is best grown in cooler climates and protection from the hot afternoon sun as that can cause leaf burn. Further, the plant should be mulched and well-watered. Trimming and fertilisation may be need after flowering to keep a wedged growth habit and boost productive flowering in the next season.[6]
