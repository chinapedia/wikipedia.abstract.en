The PETROLEUM MUSEUM () is a museum in Canada Hill, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia.


History

The area where the museum is located was the first oil exploration in Miri which used the Grand Oil Lady drilling rig. It produced oil starting from 22 December 1910 to 1972.[1] One year after retirement on 1 October 1973, the Sarawak Shell Bhd handed over the property to Sarawak State Government in a simple ceremony. Four months after the handover ceremony, a bush fire occurred on the rig but was later extinguished quickly.[2]

Now the area no longer produces oil and has been declared as a protected historical site by Sarawak State Government.[3] The museum was officially opened to the public on 20 May 2005 after it was financed by Shell Malaysia and Petronas.[4][5]
