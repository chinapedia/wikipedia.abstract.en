SARS EFILING is the official online tax returns submission portal for the South African Revenue Service launched originally in 2001[1] via third-party companies, then expanded and taken in-house by SARS in 2006. In the 2015/2016 tax year SARS eFiling processed 36.80 million electronic submissions and payments which equates to 98.7% of all submissions and payments to SARS in South Africa.[2]

SARS eFiling provides free services to individual taxpayers, trusts, companies and tax practitioners to submit tax returns, submit declarations and make relevant payments in an online environment.[3]

The eFiling service is of an international standard and is comparable to online tax submission services offered in the United States, Australia, Singapore, Ireland, Chile and France.
