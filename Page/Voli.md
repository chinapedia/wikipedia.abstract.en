Africa_proconsularis_SPQR.png VOLITANUS also known as VOLI and BOLITANA[1] was a Roman era civitas (town)[2] of Africa Proconsularis,[3] a suffragan metropolis of Carthage in Roman North Africa.[4]


Location

The town of Voli is now in modern Tunisia, though the exact location of Voli is not known for certain[5] The village of Sidi Medien Zaghouan province (latitude 36°20'3.57", longitude 10°5'22.15") has been suggested due to similarity of names. The issue with Sidi Medien is that here the Roman Era town appears to have been a colonia, by the name of Vallitanus[6] (Vallis) while the name of Voli was probably Bolitana.
