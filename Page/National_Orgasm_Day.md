The NATIONAL ORGASM DAY is celebrated on July 31.[1][2][3][4] The original day was started in Brazil, with a law passed by a local councilman, Arimateio Dantas, to celebrate it. It is celebrated there on August 8,[5] but celebrated in other countries like the UK, Australia and the US on May 18th.[6]
