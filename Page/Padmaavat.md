_PADMAAVAT_ is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language epic period drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Loosely based on the epic poem _Padmavat_ by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, it stars Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen known for her beauty, wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh, played by Shahid Kapoor.

Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Raza Murad, and Anupriya Goenka featured in supporting roles.[1][2]

With a production budget of , _Padmaavat_ is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.[3][4][5] Initially scheduled for release on 1 December 2017, _Padmaavat_ faced numerous controversies. Amid violent protests, its release was indefinitely delayed. In December, the Central Board of Film Certification approved the film with few changes, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and a change in title.[6][7] _Padmaavat_ was rescheduled for release on 25 January 2018 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D formats, making it the first Indian film to be released in IMAX 3D.[8]

_Padmaavat_ received mixed reviews. Critics praised the visuals, the cinematography and Singh's portrayal of Khilji, but criticised its storyline, execution, length and adherence to regressive patriarchal mores.[9] Critics also disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Despite not being released in some states of India, it grossed over at the box office, becoming a commercial success and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.[17][18] At 64th Filmfare Awards, _Padmaavat_ received a leading 18 nominations, and won four awards, including Best Actor (Critics) for Singh.[19]


Plot

In 13th-century Afghan, Jalal-ud-din Khalji of the Khilji dynasty plans to take over the throne of Delhi. His nephew Alauddin Khilji at the same time brings him a whole ostrich though he was asked only to bring ostrich feather.[20] In return, he asks for Jalaluddin's daughter Mehrunisa's hand in marriage. Their wedding is organised, but on the night of the event, Alauddin engages in adultery with another woman. A courtier witnesses the act and is killed by Alauddin. Mehrunisa is informed of this during the wedding, leaving her horrified.

Meanwhile, the Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka) princess Padmavati mistaking the Rajput ruler Maharawal Ratan Singh for a deer, accidentally wounds him while hunting in a forest. She takes him along with her and treats him, upon which he divulges his identity, who has traveled to Sinhala to acquire rare pearls for his first wife Nagmati. Over a course of events, the two fall in love. Ratan Singh asks for Padmavati's hand in marriage, she agrees and with permission from her father, they get married.

Jalaluddin takes over the throne of Delhi and sends Alauddin to repel a Mongol invasion. Alauddin is successful in doing so, but undertakes an unsanctioned raid on Devagiri. He captures the princess there after successfully assassinating her husband and makes her his concubine. Jalaluddin's wife and nephew warns him against Alauddin's ambition to take over the throne. He journeys to Kara to meet Alauddin and gifts him the slave Malik Kafur. Alauddin has Jalaluddin and his ministers assassinated and declares himself the new Sultan.

Padmavati journeys to Mewar with Ratan Singh and is blessed by his royal priest, Raghav Chetan. Chetan is caught watching Ratan Singh and Padmavati sharing an intimate moment and is banished from the kingdom. He travels to Delhi and informs Alauddin of Padmavati's beauty. Alauddin, who is fixated with having anything that is exceptional, invites the Rajputs to Delhi. His invitation is rejected. Enraged, he lays siege to Ratan Singh's capital Chittor. After waiting for six months and yet unsuccessful in his attempts to conquer the kingdom, Alauddin feigns peace on account of Holi and is allowed to enter Chittor where he meets Ratan Singh. He asks to see Padmavati. The Rajputs, knowing his intentions, threaten him. Ratan Singh grants Alauddin's request to see Padmavati, but does so only for a moment while preventing Alauddin from seeing her face.

Ratan Singh is taken prisoner by Alauddin, who demands to see Padmavati. Upon being insisted by Queen Nagmati, Padmavati agrees. She however puts forth some conditions including that she will first meet her husband when she arrives as well as the death of Chetan, to which Alauddin agrees. She then travels to Delhi to meet Khilji. Meanwhile, Alaluddin's nephew attempts to assassinate him. Alauddin is wounded but survives and later kills him.

While on the Sultanante's frontiers, the Rajputs plan to ambush the Khilji soldiers in the morning which is the time for _namāz_ (Islamic prayer). Padmavati, along with Chittor's generals, Gora and Badal, free Ratan Singh, and escapes with Mehrunisa's help. Ratan confronts Alauddin who warns him to kill him now or he will regret it, but Ratan denies stating Rajputs don't attack the wounded. The Khilji soldiers are alerted, but are ambushed by the Rajputs disguised as women. The Rajput attack is repulsed, with the ambushing Rajputs killed. In Chittor, Padmavati receives praise for saving Ratan Singh.

Alauddin imprisons Mehrunisa for helping the Rajputs and marches to Chittor. He and Ratan Singh engage in a single duel; Alauddin is nearly defeated by Ratan Singh, but Singh is shot by Kafur from behind with arrows, and berates Alauddin for fighting dishonourably before dying. The Khilji army succeeds in defeating the Rajputs and capturing Chittor, but are unable to capture the Rajput women who perform _jauhar_ (mass suicide) with Padmavati.

Production

Development

An adaptation of Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic _Padmavat_ (1540),[35] Sanjay Leela Bhansali had been planning a film adaptation for a decade.[36] He first worked on a television adaptation as an assistant editor for Shyam Benegal's television series _Bharat Ek Khoj_ (1988), based on Jawaharlal Nehru's _The Discovery of India_ (1946), featuring an episode about _Padmavat_ starring Om Puri as Alauddin Khilji.[37] In 2008, Bhansali produced an opera version in Paris, inspiring him to begin work on a film version.[38] _Padmaavat_ also took inspiration from other earlier adaptations of the epic, including Bengali literary adaptations from Kshirode Prasad Vidyavinode in 1906 and Abanindranath Tagore in 1909,[39] the Tamil film _Chittoor Rani Padmini_ (1963),[40][41] and the Hindi film _Maharani Padmini_ (1964).[42]

Pre-production on the film began in July 2016. That same month, playback singer Shreya Ghoshal tweeted about performing a song composed by Bhansali for the film.[43] Many media outlets speculated that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, who played the leads in Bhansali's _Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela_ (2013) and _Bajirao Mastani_ (2015), were finalised to play Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati in the film. In October 2016, it was announced that Bhansali would team up with Viacom 18 Motion Pictures to produce the film with Singh and Padukone along with Shahid Kapoor as Rawal Ratan Singh, playing the lead roles.[44]

Casting

_Padmaavat_ is the third collaboration between Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The trio had worked before in _Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela_ (2013) and _Bajirao Mastani_ (2015), while it is Kapoor's first film with the three.[45] Their co-star from the previous films, Priyanka Chopra was also in consideration to play the title role.[46]

Shahrukh Khan was offered the part but felt it was not "meaty" enough and declined; failure to agree on his fee may have been a factor.[47] Shahid Kapoor was finally cast to play Ratan Singh with an assurance of a good enough part and a hefty fee.[48] For his role, Kapoor undertook rigorous training under trainer Samir Jaura and followed a strict diet for 40 days. He also learnt sword fighting and the basics of Mardani khel, a weapon-based martial art, and admitted that it had been one of the most physically and emotionally challenging roles of his career.[49]

Ranveer Singh portrays the antagonist of the film, Alauddin Khilji, the first negative role of his career.[50] Director Bhansali had given him books to read delving into the psyche of dark rulers of history such as Adolf Hitler, asserting that he had to completely forget who he was before he could play Khilji.[51] Singh trained under Mustafa Ahmed to get into proper shape for the role. The actor worked out twice a day for six days a week.[52] Playing Khilji so affected Singh's personality and behaviour that he had to see a psychiatrist to return to normal.[53]

Jaya Bachchan recommended Aditi Rao Hydari's name to Bhansali for the role of Khilji's first wife, Mehrunisa.[54][55][56] Bhansali cast Hydari over four other choices.[57] She is the only member of the star cast who actually belongs to a royal lineage.[58]

Veteran actor Raza Murad portrays Alauddin's paternal uncle and Khilji dynasty founder, Sultan Jalaluddin Khilji. Murad has earlier collaborated with Bhansali in _Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela_ and _Bajirao Mastani_.[59] Jim Sarbh portrays Malik Kafur, a prominent eunuch slave-general of Alauddin Khilji.[60] Sarbh learned horse-riding for the role.[61]

On 25 October 2017, a video of the first song from the film, titled _Ghoomar_, was released, in which a woman dressed like a queen appeared briefly. It was later revealed in a Twitter fanpage of Sanjay Leela Bhansali Productions, that the woman is Maharawal Ratan Singh's first wife, Rani Nagmati, who is portrayed by Anupriya Goenka.[62]

Budget

Due to the costs mounted on the film by delay in the release, Box Office India declared the film's budget to be , which makes it the most expensive Hindi film and one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.[63][64]

Costumes

Delhi-based Rimple and Harpreet Narula designed Rani Padmavati's costume using traditional Gota embroidery work of Rajasthan. The border derives from the architectural details of Rajasthani palace windows and jharokhas and the odhnis have been styled in conventional ways which are still prevalent in the Mewar belt of Rajasthan.[65] The designer duo elaborated that the costume worn by Padukone in the final scene of the film features the tree-of-life motif and twisted gota embroidery and has a Kota dupatta with block printing. Padukone's dresses were made with Sinhalese influences, as the character of Padmavati hailed from Sri Lanka.[66]

The costumes for Shahid Kapoor were made from mulmul and cotton, with special attention given to the turbans, one of which, featuring a 28-dye lehariya, was inspired by a turban to be found at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.[67] The clothes for Ranveer Singh were based on travellers' accounts of the Turko-Persian influence on Indian clothing[68] (Khilji was of Turko-Afghan heritage).[69] The costumes for Aditi Rao Hydari, who plays Khilji's first wife Mehrunisa, incorporated Turkish, Afghan, Mongol and Ottoman elements to showcase Mehrunisa's Turkic origins.[70] For both Ranveer Singh and Hydari's costumes, extensive research was done on the clothing and textiles of the Turkish belt, from Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Kazakhstan and to the Central Asian belt around Turkey.[71][72]

Padukone's look for the "Ghoomar" song features intricate jewellery weighing up to 3 kg designed by Tanishq featuring a triple Borla, Mathapatti and Bajuband which are traditional ornaments worn by the Rajasthani women.[73]

Vipul Amar and Harsheen Arora of Delhi-based design house 'The V Renaissance' designed costumes for Rawal Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khilji, employing historical techniques to create the armour such as cuirboilli, sculpting, chiselling, and inlaying.[74] The armour took a team of forty workers eight months to prepare.[75]


Soundtrack

The film score is composed by Sanchit Balhara while the songs are composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. A. M. Turaz and Siddharth-Garima wrote the lyrics to the songs. The first song "Ghoomar", to which Padukone performs the traditional Rajasthani folk dance on a set that replicates the interior of Chittorgarh Fort,[76][77] was released on 25 October 2017.[78] The second song from the film "Ek Dil, Ek Jaan", a love ballad featuring Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, was released on 11 November 2017.[79] The complete soundtrack was released by the record label T-Series[80] on 21 January 2018.[81]


Controversy

Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali2.jpg The film became controversial during production. Several Rajput caste organisations including Shri Rajput Karni Sena and its members had protested and later vandalised the film sets claiming that the film portrays the Padmavati, a Rajput queen, in bad light. They had also assaulted Bhansali on a film set.[82][83] The Sena had made further threats of violence.[84] While filming a scene in Masai Plateau, Kolhapur at night in October 2017, some people attacked and set the set ablaze, injuring animals and destroying several costumes.[85] Several Muslim leaders protested against the alleged misrepresentation of Ala-ud-din Khilji and called for ban.[86][87] In the days leading up to the film's release, there were violent protests and riots in several parts of India.[88][89] In Haryana, the protestors had attacked several vehicles including a school bus.[90][91]

Bhansali and Deepika Padukone had received threats of violence.[92][93][94][95] The film makers received support from the film community and industry associations including the Indian Film & Television Directors' Association, Cine & TV Artists Association, Western India Cinematographers' Association, Association of Cine & Television Art Directors & Costume Designers.[96][97][98]

The major political parties across India took conflicting stands. Several members and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a ban on the film. The Rajasthan State unit of the Indian National Congress (INC) had also called for ban.[99][100]

The controversies surrounding the film re-opened the question of film censorship in India and the country's freedom of expression.[101][102] The Supreme Court dismissed a petition calling to stop the film's release citing the freedom of speech and expression.[103][104]

The movie is banned in Malaysia by the Home Ministry due to its negative portrayal of a Muslim ruler.[105]


Release

The digital streaming rights of _Padmaavat_ were sold to Amazon Prime Video for 200–250 million in August 2017.[106] Theatrical distribution rights in overseas territories were acquired by Paramount Pictures from Viacom 18 in October.[107] Prime Focus Limited rendered the film in 3D.[108] The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 1 December 2017 in India, but was delayed due to protests.[109]

_Padmavati_ was initially slated for release in the United Arab Emirates on 30 November 2017 and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2017 but the makers stated that the film would not be released in foreign territories before receiving a certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).[110][111][112] In the end of December, CBFC approved the film for theatrical exhibition and suggested 5 modifications to the film, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and amending its title to _Padmaavat_.[113][114] The change in the title was intended to be a disclaimer that the film is not a historical drama, but a cinematic adaptation of Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic poem _Padmavat_.[115]

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) passed the film with a (12A) rating and zero cuts.[116]

Post the CBFC approval with U/A certification, the film got banned by the Chief Ministers of four states Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana in order to maintain 'law and order' and avert protests in their states.[117][118] The Supreme Court of India over-ruled the ban, stating that freedom of speech is to be maintained and that the states have to ensure the screening of the film without any issues.[119][120][121] On 30 January 2018, Malaysia banned the film.[122]

Padmaavat premiered on television on 30 September 2018 on Hindi general entertainment channels (GEC) Colors, Colors HD, Hindi movie channel Rishtey Cineplex.[123]


Reception

Critical reception

India

_Padmaavat_ opened to mixed critical reviews upon release.[124][125][126] Critics praised the visuals, and the performance of Singh, but criticised its storyline, execution, running time and the "unwanted" 3D conversion.[127]

Following its controversies, the makers held a pre-screening of _Padmaavat_ in November 2017 for some journalists, including Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, who praised the film and described it as "the greatest tribute to Rajput pride."[128][129] Rajat Sharma particularly praised Singh's performance as Khilji.[130]

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 stars and said, "On the whole, _Padmaavat_ is a remarkable motion picture experience that's backed by proficient direction, spellbinding screenwriting and superlative acting. For Bhansali, it's the best title on an impressive filmography."[131] Neil Soans of _The Times of India_ gave 4 stars and said, "The director's expertise in heightening opulence and grandeur is well-known, further distinguishable in 3D. Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee compliments him by beautifully capturing some jaw-dropping scenery."[132] Rachit Gupta of _Filmfare_ gave 3.5 stars and said, "the real wonder of Padmaavat comes from its production and presentation. This film has phenomenal production design, costumes and camera work. The technical finesse on display is just mind boggling."[133] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave 3.5 stars, praising Singh's performance.[134]

Kunal Guha of _Mumbai Mirror_ gave 3.5 stars but criticised Padukone's and Kapoor 's performances.[135] Giving 3.5 stars, Sushant Mehta of _India Today_ panned Padukone's and Kapoor's performances calling them "mediocre" while terming Singh's "unconvincing".[136]

Shubhra Gupta of _The Indian Express_ gave 2.5 stars and said, "_Padmaavat_ is spectacular [to look]: no one can do spectacle like Bhansali. You can easily delight in it while the going is good. But nearly three hours of it, and looping rhetoric around what constitutes Rajput valour can and does become tiresome."[137] Mayur Sanap of _Deccan Chronicle_ criticised the execution and the length and gave 2.5 stars.[138] Suparna Sharma, also of _Deccan Chronicle_ gave 2.5 stars and said, "Padmaavat is offensively chauvinistic, blatantly right-wing, and quite unabashedly anti-Muslim".[139]

Raja Sen of NDTV India gave 1.5 stars and said, "Bhansali takes an unbearable length of time to spark the flame. Things go on and on and on, with characters it is impossible to care about. They may appear attractive from time to time, certainly, but these protagonists are inconsistent, infuriating and test the patience."[140]

Rediff.com also gave 1.5 stars calling it "superficial" and wrote "Deepika Padukone gets an absolute raw deal as the Queen; her performance is submissively overwrought, blandly weighted, and her speeches combined with the leisureliness of the narrative's pacing, can put you in a stupor. Worst of all, you will be driven by the suspicion if Padukone even does enough to deserve the movie's title.[141] Namrata Joshi of _The Hindu_ gave a negative review noting the film is "a yawn fest" and "an interminable expanse of unadulterated dullness." She also criticised the 3D conversion writing "The opulence doesn't seem as awe-inspiring, the special effects, especially in some of the battle scenes, are plain tacky and the actors seem like cardboard dolls of themselves in the long shots, acquiring a human visage only in extreme".[142] Anna M. M. Vetticad of _Firstpost_ criticised the film giving 1 star out of 5 writing "Padmaavat is a perfect example of a Hindi film couching its extreme prejudices in grandiloquence and tacky clichés, with those clichés embedded in resplendent frames."[143]

Overseas

Mike McCahill of _The Guardian_ gave 4 stars and said, "It's not just the extravagance that catches the eye, but the precision with which it's applied. Every twirl of every sari and every arrow in every battle appears to have been guided by the hands of angels. Such excess could have proved deadening, but dynamic deployment of old-school star power keeps almost all its scenes alive with internal tensions."[144] Shilpa Jamkhandikar published a mixed review in Reuters, who noted, "But unlike Bhansali's earlier films, where he was able to find emotional depth even in opulent historical romances, this one falls short". But she praised Ranveer Singh's performance as Khilji.[145] Manjusha Radhakrishnan of _Gulf News_ opined that the quality of the work was lower than that in other Bhansali films.[146] Sadaf Haider of _DAWN Images_ said that the film is "a flawed history lesson", however, she praised the film visual, music and most of the act.[147] Rahul Aijaz of _The Express Tribune_ rated 4.5 out of 5 stars; he too praised the film and said that it "doesn't set up false expectations and then disappoint" due to "perfect storytelling", and "memorable performances".[148] A Pakistani critic, Haroon Khalid, had disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king.[149]

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 70% based on 20 reviews, with a rating average of 6.5/10, as of 21 March 2018.[150]

Box office

Due to the numerous controversies associated with _Padmaavat_ before its release which resulted in banning the film in certain states, the film's commercial performance was highly unpredictable.[151] The film was released in only 70% of places in India.[152] However, despite limited screenings, the film earned an estimated in Wednesday paid previews.[153] The following day, the film opened nationwide across 4,800 screens of which over 500 screens were shown in Tamil and Telugu.[154][155] It earned an estimated nett on its opening day in India, excluding previews, which was considered impressive despite its ban in numerous big states and marked a career best opening for Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Shahid Kapoor and fourth biggest for Padukone (behind _Happy New Year_, _Chennai Express_ and _Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani_).[156][157][158][159] On Friday, the film added another , owing to national holiday on Republic Day.[160] This was followed by a gradual fall on Saturday taking in another .[161][162] Through Sunday, the film delivered an opening weekend of and became the fourteenth film to enter the 100 crore club in just under 4 days.[163][164] Furthermore, it broke the record for the biggest IMAX opening in India with US$461,000 from 12 screens.[165] However, due to its limited screenings, the film nevertheless lost over in box office receipts during its opening weekend.[166]

Outside India, the film broke all-time opening day records in Australia (A$367,984), surpassing the likes of _Dangal_ and the dubbed-Hindi version of _Baahubali: The Conclusion_.[167][168] One of the reason behind the film's successful run in the country was because Paramount (the overseas distributing company) was able to secure release in all three major theatre chains (Hoyts, Event Cinemas and Village Cinemas) unlike other Bollywood films which have to choose between the two latter.[169] In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $1.13 million on its opening day. This was followed by the biggest ever single-day for a Hindi film with $1.8 million on Saturday, breaking the previous record held by _PK_ ($1.41 million).[170][171] Although _Baahubali: The Conclusion_ still holds the record for all Indian films, that is inclusive of three different languages.[172] It went on to set a new opening weekend record for a Hindi film with $4.2 million, and witnessed the second best per-theatre-average inside the top 10 with $13,188 from 324 theatres.[173][174] As of 6 February 2018, the film has crossed worldwide, making it one of the top 10 highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time.[175] Its domestic net income was in the fourth weekend of its run.[176] The film has grossed worldwide.[177]


Awards and nominations


Historical inaccuracies

Differences from _Padmavat_

The film is an adaptation[178] of the epic poem _Padmavat_ written by Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi in 1540.[179] The poem is a fictionalised account of Alauddin Khilji's 1303 siege of Chittorgarh in Rajputana (present-day Rajasthan).[180] According to _Padmavat_, Alauddin Khilji, the Sultan of Delhi, laid siege to Chittor Fort motivated by his desire to capture Queen Padmini (called Padmavati in the film), the beautiful wife of King Ratan Sen (called Ratan Singh in the film), the Rajput ruler of Mewar. After Khilji successfully besieged Ratan Singh's capital Chittor, Padmavati committed _jauhar_ (the Rajput custom of self-immolation) to protect her honour from the Muslim ruler.[181]

-   The film shows Padmavati as the daughter of the king of Singal. According to _Padmavat_, Padmavati was the sister of the king and Ratan Singh married her after defeating the king in a game of chess.[182]
-   In the film, the Brahmin Raghav Chetan is exiled as per Padmavati's wishes.[183] In _Padmavat_, he left Mewar on his own accord, fearing Ratan Singh's rage.[184]
-   In the film, Padmavati travels to Delhi in order to rescue Ratan Singh.[185] In _Padmavat_, it is only Ratan Singh's faithful servants, Gora and Badal who travel to Delhi along with their followers to save Ratan Singh.[186]
-   The climax of the film shows Ratan Singh being killed by Alauddin Khilji's forces while he is engaged in battle with Khilji and is about to defeat him. According to _Padmavat_, Ratan Singh never fought Khilji and died in a battle against King Devpal of Kumbalner before Khilji attacked Chittor.[187]

Portrayal of Alauddin Khilji

Alauddin Khilji's portrayal in the film has been criticised by historians and critics for its historical and geographical inaccuracies and staying not faithful to the epic _Padmavat_.[188][189][190][191][192][193] Before their ascension to the throne, Jalaluddin and Alauddin Khilji were known as Malik Feroze and Ali Gurshasp, respectively.[194][195] Jalaluddin Khilji is portrayed as an arrogant, cunning and cruel man. He was actually popular for being a mild-mannered, humble and pious ruler.[196][197] Jalaluddin ascended the throne of Delhi in 1290 only to end the chaos that ensued after the death of Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban.[198] He was not ambitious by nature and did not lead an attack on the Delhi Sultanate from Ghazni, Afghanistan.[199] In the film, the Delhi Sultanate's flag is shown in green colour with a white crescent moon. The Sultanate actually had a green flag with a black band running vertically on the left.[200] The film shows an unsuccessful assassination plot by Alauddin's nephew, one which seriously injures the Sultan, but none of this actually happened.[201] Historian Rana Safvi wrote that Khilji was sophisticated, not barbarian as portrayed in the film.[202][203] Historian Mohammed Safiullah also criticised Khilji's portrayal and the implicit depiction of a homosexual relationship between Khilji and his slave-general Malik Kafur.[204] Historian Archana Ojha of Delhi University criticised Alauddin Khilji's look and clothing in the film.[205]
