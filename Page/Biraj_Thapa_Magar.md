KAJI BIRAJ THAPA MAGAR or BIRAJ BAKHETI MAGAR was the first Gorkhali Army Commander of King Prithvi Narayan Shah in the campaign of Unification of Nepal. In the very first attack against Nuwakot, Kaji Biraj Thapa Magar was the commander of Gorkhali troops. After encamping near Khinchet, when he was waiting for an opportune moment to cross the overflowing Trisuli River, King Prithvi Narayan Shah sent another troops under the command of Maheswar Panta and Bali Pandey to attack Nuwakot. Eventually, the Gorkhali troops were defeated because they lacked proper preparation, planning, unity of command, geographical knowledge, intelligence and arms and ammunition.[1] Biraj Thapa as a commander definitely knew that military offensives were not supposed to be in hasty preparation. World renowned military strategist Sun Tzu has correctly said to know your enemy, know the terrain and know the weather. This first failure in capturing Nuwakot was a big lesson for King Prithvi Narayan Shah.
