Commercial performance

During its a week release, "Love Thy Neighbor" was premiered at churches in the top 25 children's video markets. To boost its promotion, the Toonacious held a contest with the prize being a trip for a Disney vacation in addition to retail material.[2] From a number of Christian Retail stores, the two films were released on VHS and DVD.
