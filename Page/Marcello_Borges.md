MARCELLO BORGES (born September 13, 1997) is an American soccer player who was drafted by the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft and is currently unsigned.


Career

Youth, College and Amateur

Borges spent his entire youth career with the New York Red Bulls Academy. On February 4, 2015, it was announced that Borges signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at the University of Michigan.[1][2] A month later, he signed an academy level contract with USL club New York Red Bulls II, which allowed him to play for the club without forfeiting his college eligibility.[3] He made his debut a day later in a goalless draw against Rochester Rhinos.[4]

In his freshman year with the Wolverines, Borges made only 11 appearances, starting in five of them. He missed a portion of the season due to the fact he was on U.S. U-20 national team duty.[5]

He also played in the Premier Development League for New York Red Bulls U-23.[6]

International

Borges has represented the United States in the under-18 and under-20 level.[7]
