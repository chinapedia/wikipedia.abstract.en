An ASTRONAUT or COSMONAUT is a person trained by a human spaceflight
program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft.
Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms
are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including
scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.[1][2]

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by
governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With
the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a
new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

The criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary. The Fédération
Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) Sporting Code for astronautics
recognizes only flights that exceed an [[Kármán_line|altitude of

Food and drink

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about 0.83
kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per
meal each day. (The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms
– 0.27 pounds) Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal
to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are
selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician.
Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity
environment. Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy
expenditure (BEE) formula. On Earth, the average American uses about 35
gallons (132 liters) of water every day. On board the ISS astronauts
limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.[3]

Insignia

In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian
Federation upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the
award of Hero of the Russian Federation. This follows the practice
established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title
Hero of the Soviet Union.

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a
silver lapel pin. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold
pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a
special qualification badge, known as the Astronaut Badge, after
participation on a spaceflight. The United States Air Force also
presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed in altitude.

Deaths

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives
during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American
(including one born in India), four were Russian (Soviet Union), and one
was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight:
eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of
training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and
four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The Space Mirror Memorial, which stands on the grounds of the John F.
Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men
and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the
space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career
astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a U.S. Air Force X-15
test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a
then-classified military space program, and a civilian spaceflight
participant.
