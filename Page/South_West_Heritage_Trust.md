The SOUTH WEST HERITAGE TRUST is a charity which was formed in 2014. It is involved in the preservation and management of the heritage of Somerset and Devon.[1]

In 2014 the trust took over the management of local archives for the Devon Record Offices and Somerset Archives and Local Studies.[2][3][4][5]

The trust is also responsible for three local museums: The Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury,[6] the Museum of Somerset in Taunton[7] and The Brick and Tile Museum in Bridgwater.[8] Workshops and resources are also available to local schools.[9]

Courses are provided which include those on searching family history and reading old handwriting.[10] Archaeological advice on planning applications are provided for local county and district councils.[11]
