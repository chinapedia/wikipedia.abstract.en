EDWARD LANCASTER FAWCETT SQUIRE (25 September 1837 – 7 October 1893) was Deputy Postmaster General and Superintendent of Telegraphs, in the colony of South Australia.


History

Squire was born the youngest son of Lieut William Squire RN (c. 1790 – 20 July 1864), an English ship's captain, on board his ship, in Montreal harbor. He was educated at Christ's Hospital (the original Bluecoat School), and the family moved to Victoria around 1850. In 1859 he moved to South Australia, joined the Telegraph Department, and was posted at Robe. In 1866 he was transferred to Wentworth, New South Wales. In February 1871 he was transferred to Gawler, South Australia. In 1875, he was promoted to the General Post Office as Deputy Postmaster-General and Secretary. On 25 August 1875 he was appointed to the dual position of Deputy Postmaster-General and Superintendent of Telegraphs under the Postmaster General, Charles Todd, whose position he temporarily filled on occasion.

He was killed when the trap he was driving down the Old Belair Road capsized after its brakes failed and the horses bolted, and its occupants thrown on the road. His son Tristram and daughters Emily and Fanny and a female relative escaped serious injury, and their maid servant, Miss Chew, sustained a broken arm.[1]
