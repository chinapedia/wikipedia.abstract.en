An ANSIBLE is a category of fictional device or technology capable of near-instantaneous or superluminal communication. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay, even between star systems. As a name for such a device, the word "ansible" first appeared in a 1966 novel by Ursula K. Le Guin. Since that time, the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors, across a variety of settings and continuities.[1]


Coinage by Ursula Le Guin

Ursula K. Le Guin coined the word "ansible" in her 1966 novel _Rocannon's World_.[2][3] The word was a contraction of "answerable", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over interstellar distances.[4]

Although Le Guin invented the name "ansible" for this type of device, fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works, the broader concept of instantaneous or faster-than-light communication had previously existed in science fiction. For example, similar communication functions were included in a device called an interocitor in the 1952 novel _This Island Earth_ by Raymond F. Jones, and the 1955 film based on that novel, and in the "Dirac Communicator", which first appeared in James Blish's short story "Beep" (1954), which was later expanded into the novel _The Quincunx of Time_ (1973).[5]


In Le Guin's works

In her subsequent works, Le Guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible:

-   _The Dispossessed_, Le Guin's award-winning 1974 novel in the Hainish Cycle, tells of the invention of the ansible.[6]

-   In _The Word for World Is Forest_, Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one "must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos."

-   In _The Left Hand of Darkness_, it is stated that the ansible "doesn't involve radio waves, or any form of energy. The principle it works on, the constant of simultaneity, is analogous in some ways to gravityÂ ... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable."

Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited bandwidth which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.


Use by later authors

Since Le Guin's conception of the ansible, the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors. While Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate "instantaneously",[7] the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light.

Orson Scott Card's works

Orson Scott Card, in his 1977 novelette and 1985 novel _Ender's Game_ and its sequels, used the term "ansible" for his own fictitious communication device.[8] In _Ender's Game_, a character stated that "somebody dredged the name _ansible_ out of an old book somewhere."[9]

In the universe of the _Ender's Game_ series, the ansible's functions involved a fictional subatomic particle, the philote.[10] The two quarks inside a pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance, while remaining connected by "philotic rays".[11] This concept is similar to quantum teleportation due to entanglement; however, in reality, quark confinement prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.

Card's version of the ansible was also featured in the video game _Advent Rising_, for which Card helped write the story, and in the movie _Ender's Game_, which was based on the book.[12]

Other writers

Numerous other writers have included ansibles in their fictional works, using that word to refer to a faster-than-light communication device. Notable examples include:

-   Vernor Vinge, in the 1988 short story "The Blabber"[13]
-   Elizabeth Moon, in the 1995 novel _Winning Colors_[14]
-   Philip Pullman, in the 2000 novel _The Amber Spyglass_, part of the _His Dark Materials_ trilogy.
-   Jason Jones, in the 1995 computer game _Marathon 2: Durandal_[15]
-   L.A. Graf, in the 1996 _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ novel _Time's Enemy_[16]
-   Neal Asher, in his Polity series of novels including _Gridlinked_ (2001), in which the runcible, named in homage to the ansible, is an interstellar wormhole generator/teleporter
-   Dan Simmons, in the 2003 novel _Ilium_[17]
-   Kim Stanley Robinson, in the 2012 novel _2312_[18]
-   Becky Chambers, in the 2014 novel _The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet_
-   Joe M. McDermott, in the 2017 novel _The Fortress at the End of Time_[19]
