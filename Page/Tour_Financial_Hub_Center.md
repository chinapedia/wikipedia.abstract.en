TOUR FINANCIAL HUB CENTER () is a proposed skyscraper in Seoul, South Korea. It was planned by Jung-gu, Seoul in 2006, with the height of 960m (higher than Burj Khalifa).[1] The completion was planned in 2013.

However, due to the height restrictions in Seoul, construction wasn't allowed and it seems unsure in 2016.
