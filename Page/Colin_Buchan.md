COLIN LINWOOD BUCHAN (1890 – 16 April 1947) was a Scottish professional football outside left who played in the Scottish League for Queen's Park.[1][2][3]


Biography

Buchan was born in Bradford, Yorkshire,[4] to Scottish parents James Buchan of Hawick, Roxburghshire and Mary Jane Buchan of Peebles, Scottish Borders. His father was a woolsorter, but they moved back to Peebles shortly after Colin's birth.[5]

On 25 August 1914, just over three weeks after Britain's entry into the First World War, Buchan enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery.[6] He became a Battery Quartermaster Sergeant and was wounded late in the war,[7] but recovered and returned to football.

Buchan played in England, Scotland,[8] and Northern Ireland, signed to play for Linfield F.C. in 1920.[9] He returned to his hometown and played for the Peebles Rovers F.C. in 1923.[10]

In 1933, when Billy McCandless returned to manage Dundee, he recalled of Buchan, "The last year I was with Linfield I had as a colleague one of the most gentlemanly footballers who ever kicked a ball in Ireland, Colin Buchan, who came from Dundee."[11]

He died in 1947 and is buried at Peebles St Andrews Cemetery.
