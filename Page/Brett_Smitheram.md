BRETT SMITHERAM was the 2016 World Scrabble Champion,[1] and has been ranked as a Scrabble Grand Master for nearly 20 years.

Smitheram won the UK National Scrabble Championship in 2000, the ABSP Masters invitational event in 2005 and the British Matchplay Scrabble Championship in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010.[2] Smitheram has won the award for UK highest rated player four times and has consistently ranked in the world's top 5 players for over a decade.

In 2016 he defeated Mark Nyman at the MSI World Scrabble Championship 2016 3 games to 0 to become the World Scrabble Champion for the first time, in the process playing the word BRACONID for 176 (+5 for a failed challenge) which was reported on widely by global media. Following his World Championship win, Smitheram has continued to compete locally and globally, winning multiple tournaments, and narrowly missing out on his second World Championship Final in 2018, losing to Nigel Richards, the eventual winner, in the semi final. He remains an active contributor and spokesperson to the global media on Scrabble and gaming topics.
