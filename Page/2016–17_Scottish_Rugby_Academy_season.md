The Scottish Rugby Academy provides Scotland's up and coming rugby stars a dedicated focused routeway for development into the professional game. Entry is restricted to Scottish qualified students and both male and female entrants are accepted into 4 regional academies. The 2016-17 season sees the second year of the academy.


Season overview

This was the second year of the Scottish Rugby Academy


Regional Academies

The Scottish Rugby Academy runs four regional academies in Scotland:- Glasgow and the West, Borders and East Lothian, Edinburgh and Caledonia. These roughly correspond to the traditional districts of Glasgow District, South, Edinburgh District and North and Midlands.[1]


Players and Stages

Players are selected in three stages:- Stage 1 - Regionally selected and regionally supported players; Stage 2 - Nationally selected and regionally supported players; and Stage 3 - Nationally selected and regionally supported players assigned to a professional team.

Stage 3 players

Stage 3 players are assigned to a professional team. Nominally, for the men, Glasgow Warriors receive the Stage 3 players of Glasgow and the West and Caledonia regions, while Edinburgh Rugby receive the Stage 3 players of the Edinburgh and Borders and East Lothian regions. The women are integrated into the Scotland women's national rugby sevens team and the Scotland women's national rugby union team.

This season some of the Stage 3 players were additionally loaned out to London Scottish for their development.

London Scottish is a SRU member and a professional club playing in the 2016–17 RFU Championship. The SRU has a partnership agreement with London Scottish for a player development pathway.[4] Although these Stage 3 players are nominally assigned to Glasgow Warriors or Edinburgh Rugby these academy players have then been loaned out to the Exiles side for development.[5]
