TRENBOLONE HEXAHYDROBENZYLCARBONATE, or TRENBOLONE CYCLOHEXYLMETHYLCARBONATE, sold under the brand names PARABOLAN and HEXABOLAN, is a synthetic, injected anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) of the nandrolone group and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (cyclohexylmethylcarbonate) ester of trenbolone – which was marketed in France for medical use in humans but has since been discontinued.[1]

It was introduced in France in 1980 and was voluntarily discontinued by its manufacturer in 1997.[2][3] Trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate half-life is approximately 14 days[4]. The drug acts as a long-lacting prodrug of trenbolone when administered via intramuscular injection.[5]
