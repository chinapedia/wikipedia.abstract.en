_NEPENTHES MINIMA_ is a tropical pitcher plant native to Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.[1] It grows in seasonally dry grasslands at elevations of 1000–1700 m above sea level, and has a number of adaptations to survive wildfires. It is the only pyrophytic _Nepenthes_ species known from outside Indochina and the Philippines.[2]

The specific epithet _minima_, Latin for "smallest", was chosen as an antonym to that of the closely allied _N. maxima_, with which this species was long conflated and from which it differs in being smaller in all respects.[3] In 2009 this species was described as a cultivar from the area around Lake Poso in Central Sulawesi: _Nepenthes maxima_ 'Lake Poso'.[4][5]
