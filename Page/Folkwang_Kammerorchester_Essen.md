The FOLKWANG KAMMERORCHESTER ESSEN is a chamber orchestra historically formed mostly by students of the Folkwang University in Essen, Germany, and other _Musikhochschulen_ in Northrhine-Westphalia, to prepare them for a future position in an orchestra; however, it currently employs a core of permanent members from all over Germany and the world. Members are auditioned and trialed as in a professional orchestra, and, if successful, are offered a permanent contract up to the age of 35. It was founded in 1958 by the director of the _Folkwangschule_ . More than 500 musicians were since employed in opera- and symphony orchestras in Germany and abroad.[1]

The orchestra is the only one to perform regularly in the historic Villa Hügel.[2] Young Soloists have been chosen to also enjoy a stage for their performances. Artists such as Christoph Eschenbach, Maria Kliegel, Nils Mönkemeyer, Sabine Meyer, Vadim Repin and Christian Tetzlaff appeared with the orchestra early in their career.[3] The orchestra has played also in Germany and Europe, including Austria, Italy, Lithuania, Switzerland. A 2010 tour led to Algeria. They have performed at festivals such as Rheingau Musik Festival, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival and Schwetzinger Mozartfest.[4] The orchestra is a regular partner of the and has accompanied other choirs such as the Rheingauer Kantorei. Guest conductors have included Marc Piollet, Peter Schneider and Lothar Zagrosek.[5] In 2015, the orchestra played a charity concert at the Aachen Cathedral.[6] In the 2016/17 season, the orchestra scheduled concerts also in the Zeche Zollverein.[7]

Dressel was the first chief conductor, succeeded by Heribert Beissel, Alexander Schwinck, Karl-Heinz Bloemeke, Stefan Fraas and Achim Fiedler (from 2006). The current chief conductor, Johannes Klumpp, has held the position from 2013.[8]
