Sulu Sultan MOHAMMED ESMAIL KIRAM I (1950–1974) was a Sultan of Sulu.


Personal life

He was the eldest son of Raja Muda Muwallil Wasit II. He became the legally recognized successor of the Sultan of Sulu.


History

The Sultan granted authority to the Philippine government under the administrations of President Diosdado Macapagal on September 12, 1962, and to President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972. The Philippine government officially recognized the continued existence of the Sulu Sultanate and the office of Sultan of Sulu. His eldest son, Mohammed Mahakuttah Abdullah Kiram, became his Raja Muda (Crown Prince).

In 1974, Mohammed Esmail died and was duly succeeded by Mohammad. The accession of the new Sultan was recognized by the Filipino President, under whose act Manila acknowledged the personal status of the Sultan-King and the formation of the government of Sulu. Makuta's son and heir - H.R.H. Datu Muedzul Lail became the Raja Muda.

Sultan Mahakutta died in 1986 when the political situation in the Philippines had changed. Power passed from Ferdinand Marcos to a new leader, Corazón Aquino, the perspectives were uncertain, and the political instability in the Moreland was growing dramatically. Manila declined to support the new Head of the Royal House. Young Raja Muda Muedzul Lail was advised neither to arrange a coronation without recognition from Manila nor to throw the Crown into the struggle between the secessionists and Republic loyalists. Therefore, Muedzul Lail remained a Raja Muda and H.R.H. instead of assuming the title and style of the Sultan-King.
