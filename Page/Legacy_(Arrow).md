Critical reviews

Caroline Preece of Den of Geek wrote "The Arrow season 5 premiere is action-packed and feels like a return to the heights of season one in all the best ways..." she also praised villain Tobias Church by stating "The villain – Tobias Church - also ties into this nicely. He has a presence and a physicality that we haven't really seen since Slade, and that’s really evident in his showdown with Oliver in the episode. He's all knuckle-dusters and confidence, rather than vague magic or rituals. He’s also a black man, which does and doesn't matter at the same time."[12]

Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, he said "I want to feel more optimistic than I do by the end of “Legacy,” but damn it, Arrow, we’ve been down this road before. There are about three fundamental problems Arrow needs to reckon with coming out of its fourth season, and only one of them—the tediousness of the flashbacks—looks like something the show is actively course-correcting."[13]

Ed Gross for Empire gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He commented, "“Legacy” works on a number of levels. In terms of action, a hand-held and more urgent editing approach makes the fight sequences visceral, serving as an effective contrast to obviously choreographed fights of the past couple of years. Additionally, across the board the performances are strong, showing characters painfully grappling with their pasts while trying to chart new paths as they go forward. Inevitably, though, they find themselves drawn back into the world that they know best. What works particularly well is a tribute to Laurel Lance/Black Canary with the unveiling of a statue constructed in her memory. Her legacy, and what she sacrificed her life for, is extremely impactful on the characters, reminding them why they fight and what they aspire towards."[14]

Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10 with his verdict stating "Arrow faces a long, uphill battle this year as it tries to move forward from the incredibly disappointing Season 4 finale. With that in mind, it's disappointing that Season 5 couldn't open on a more exciting note. There was certainly plenty to enjoy this week, from the stylish fight scenes to the dramatic performances from Stephen Amell and Paul Blackthorne. But this wasn't the fast-paced, exciting kickoff the season needed, and too much remains unclear about the show's ongoing direction right now."[15]
