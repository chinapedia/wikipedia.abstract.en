}} is a 1997 Japanese animated epic historical fantasy war film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Dentsu, and distributed by Toho. The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori and Hisaya Morishige.

_Princess Mononoke_ is set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements. The story follows the young Emishi prince Ashitaka's involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term or is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster: supernatural, shape-shifting beings.

The film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's _Spirited Away_, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English and distributed in North America by Miramax, and despite a poor box office performance there, it sold well on DVD and video, greatly increasing Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.


Plot

In Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his right arm. The curse gives him superhuman strength, but will eventually spread through his body and kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from, but he cannot return to his homeland. Before Ashitaka leaves, his younger sister Kaya gives him her crystal dagger so that he would not forget her.

Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo ("Jiko-bō" in the original Japanese version), an opportunist Buddhist monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant "nightwalker" by night. Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown ("Tataraba" in Japanese), led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men and carries them through the forest, where he encounters many kodama and glimpses the Forest Spirit. In Irontown, Ashitaka learns that Eboshi built the town by clearcutting forests to claim ironsand and produce iron, leading to conflicts with the forest gods and Asano, a local daimyō. Irontown is a refuge for social outcasts, including lepers employed to manufacture firearms; it was one of these guns that had wounded Nago. Eboshi also explains that San was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.

San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves, he is unintentionally shot by a villager, but the curse gives him the strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life. A boar clan, led by the blind boar god Okkoto, plans to attack Irontown to save the forest. Eboshi prepares for battle and sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo, who is working for the government; she intends to give the god's head to the Emperor in return for protection from Lord Asano. According to legend, the Forest Spirit's head grants immortality.

Ashitaka recovers from his wound but remains cursed; he returns to Irontown to find it besieged by samurai, and heads out to warn Eboshi. The boar clan is annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is corrupted by his wounds. Jigo's men disguise themselves in boar skins and trick the rampaging Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto, but is swept up in his demonic corruption. Moro intervenes and Ashitaka dives into the corruption, saving San. The Forest Spirit euthanizes Okkoto and Moro. As it transforms into the nightwalker, Eboshi decapitates it. It bleeds ooze which spreads over the land, killing anything it touches as the nightwalker searches for its head, which Jigo steals. The forest and kodama begin to die; Moro's head comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives.

After the samurai flee and Irontown is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies as the sun rises, but its form washes over the land and heals it, and Ashitaka's curse is lifted. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Irontown, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi reunites with the townspeople and vows to build a better town. The forest begins to regrow, and a kodama emerges from the undergrowth.


Cast

-   Yōji Matsuda voices , the last prince of the Emishi tribe whose traveling companion is , a , more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki did not want Ashitaka to be a typical hero, saying that he is a "melancholic boy who has a fate" and also stated that Ashitaka's curse "is similar to the lives of people [at the time]".[3] Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as "an unexpected hero. He’s not your usual wild, brave guy. He’s really just a young, earnest man who’s trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village."[4]

Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film. Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams.[6] Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi.[7] Eboshi's English voice actress Minnie Driver stated that she was interested in "the challenge of playing [a] woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed."[8] Driver viewed Eboshi as "a warrior, an innovator and a protector."[9]
-   Kaoru Kobayashi provides the voice of , a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a ninja, a member of a religious group or "a very good guy."

Production

In the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast. Miyazaki began writing the film's plotline and drew the initial storyboards for the film in August 1994.[11] He had difficulties adapting his early ideas and visualisations, because elements had already been used in _My Neighbor Totoro_ and because of societal changes since the creation of the original sketches and image boards. This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the _On Your Mark_ promotional music video for the Chage and Aska song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of _Princess Mononoke_. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazaki's storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki drew the initial storyboards. That same month, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of Yakushima, of Kyushu, an inspiration for the landscape of _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_, and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi in northern Honshu for location scouting along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.[12] Animation production commenced in July 1995. Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film,[13] and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them.[14][15] The final storyboards of the film's ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.[16]

Inspired by John Ford, an Irish-American director best known for his Westerns, Miyazaki created Irontown as a "tight-knit frontier town" and populated it with "characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films." He made the characters "yearning, ambitious and tough."[17] Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to "portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization."[18] The landscapes appearing in the film were inspired by Yakushima.[19] Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of _Princess Mononoke_ depicts a "symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi)."

_Princess Mononoke_ was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).[20][21][22] It was mostly hand-drawn, but incorporates some use of computer animation during five minutes of footage throughout the film.[23] The computer animated parts are designed to blend in and support the traditional cel animation, and are mainly used in images consisting of a mixture of computer generated graphics and traditional drawing. A further 10 minutes uses inked-and-painted, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films. Most of the film is colored with traditional paint, based on the color schemes designed by Miyazaki and Michiyo Yasuda. However, producers agreed on the installation of computers to successfully complete the film prior to the Japanese premiere date.[24] TMS Kyokuichi Corporation helped animate the film. DR Movie helped with the painting process.

Two titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as _Princess Mononoke_. The other title can be translated into English as either _The Story of Ashitaka_ or _The Legend of Ashitaka_. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Hayao Miyazaki had preferred _The Legend of Ashitaka_ as the title while Suzuki himself favoured _Princess Mononoke_. Suzuki also mentioned that Miyazaki had created a new kanji to write his preferred title.[25][26] The English dub contains minor additional voice overs to explain nuances of Japanese culture to western audiences.[27]


Themes

A central theme of _Princess Mononoke_ is the environment.[28] The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi. Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film "makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the "supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources". They also characterized Eboshi as a business-woman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshi's intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain "embodies environmentalist evil".

Two other themes found in the plot of _Princess Mononoke_ are sexuality and disability. Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, "said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo.[29] Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to "cure [her] poor lepers".[30] Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Wyoming, and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that "embraces modern social systems, such as industrialization, gendered division of labor, institutionalization of people with diseases, and militarization of men and women." They likened Lady Eboshi to a monarch. Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards prostitutes and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints. Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and prostitutes into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Iron Town still support the stigmatization of lepers and prostitutes.

An additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the _Chicago Sun-Times_'s Roger Ebert, "It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order."[31] Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said "The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted." Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: "It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all."[32] Anime historian Susan Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in Princess Mononoke, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple point of views the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.[33]

Dan Jolin of _Empire_ said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, _Porco Rosso_, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as _Kiki's Delivery Service_, where he has been quoted as saying "It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?"[34][35]

Duality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at Brigham Young University, said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm does to the spirits when she. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for prostitutes and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.[36]

Another theme in this film is between individualism and societal conformity. According to University of Bristol professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Iron Town by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Iron Town have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Iron Town at the cost of the environment’s destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because “even though there is an envisioned culture at which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature”.[37] The different viewpoints of San and Lady Eboshi eventually leads to a physical altercation where they both aim to kill one another. This dynamic between them represents the struggle to find a balance between the needs of individualism and those of conformity.


Release

_Princess Mononoke_ was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997. The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries. In 1998, the Walt Disney Company acquired the North American film rights to _Princess Mononoke_. Disney was to release it through its independent subsidiary Miramax Films. According to rumor, when Miyazaki met with Harvey Weinstein, the chairman of Miramax Films, Weinstein demanded that edits should be made to _Princess Mononoke_ in order to make it more marketable for American release.[38] In response, Miyazaki sent Weinstein a katana with a message stating "No cuts."[39]

The English dub of _Princess Mononoke_ is a translation with some adaptation by fantasy author Neil Gaiman, author of _The Sandman_. The main changes from the Japanese version are to provide a cultural context for phrases and actions which those outside of Asia may not be familiar with. Such alterations include references to mythology and specific names for groups, such as Jibashiri and Shishigami, that appear in the Japanese version, which are changed to more general terms, such as Mercenary and Forest Spirit, in the English version. The rationale for such changes is that the majority of non-Japanese viewers would not understand the mythological references and that the English language simply has no words for the Jibashiri, Shishigami and other terms.

Miramax chose to put a large sum of money into creating the English dub of _Princess Mononoke_ with famous actors and actresses, yet when they released it in theatres there was little or no advertising and it was given a very limited run, showing in only a few theatres and for a very short time. Disney later complained about the fact that the movie did not do well at the box office. In September 2000, the film was announced for release on DVD in North America exclusively with the English dub. In response to fans' requests to add the Japanese track as well as threats of poor sales, Miramax hired translators for subtitles for the Japanese version. This plan delayed the DVD release back by almost three months, but it sold well when it was finally released.

On April 29, 2000, the English-dub version of _Princess Mononoke_ was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary _Mononoke hime in U.S.A._. The documentary was directed by Toshikazu Sato and featured Miyazaki visiting the Walt Disney Studios and various film festivals. The film had a limited theatrical re-release in the United States during July 2018.[40]

Box office

_Princess Mononoke_ was the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1997, earning ¥11.3 billion in distribution receipts.[41] It became the highest-grossing film in Japan until it was surpassed by _Titanic_ several months later.[42] The film earned a domestic total of {{¥|19.3 billion}}.[43]

It was the top-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but despite this the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in December 1997. It grossed $2,298,191 for the first eight weeks.[44][45] It showed more strength internationally, where it earned a total of $11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to $159,375,308 at the time.[46] The film's limited US re-release in 2018 grossed $1,423,877 over five days, bringing its US total to $3,799,185 and worldwide total to $160,799,185.[47]

In July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29.[52] Initially, the DVD version of _Princess Mononoke_ did not include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vista's Japan division, citing concerns that "a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the [film]".[53] The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track,[54] while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track.[55] The DVD release of _Princess Mononoke_ was delayed as a result.[56] Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the DVD in July 2000 with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors.[57] The film was released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on December 4, 2013.[58]

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released _Princess Mononoke_ on Blu-ray Disc on November 18, 2014.[59] In its first week, it sold 21,860 units and grossed $502,332 in the United States, by November 23, 2014.[60] It was later included in the Blu-ray Miyazaki Collection, released on November 17, 2015.[61] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray & DVD on October 17, 2017.[62] In total, _Mononoke_{{'}}s video releases in Japan and the United States sold approximately million|long=no}}.

Critical response

As of March 2018, on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, _Princess Mononoke_ had a 93% approval rating based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads: "With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, _Princess Mononoke_ is a landmark in the world of animation."[63] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[64]

_The Daily Yomiuri_{{'}}s Aaron Gerow called the film a "powerful compilation of [Hayao] Miyazaki's world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns."[65] Leonard Klady of _Variety_ said that _Princess Mononoke_ "is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script" and the film "has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases".[66] Roger Ebert of the _Chicago Sun-Times_ called _Princess Mononoke_ "a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year. […] You won’t find many Hollywood love stories (animated or otherwise) so philosophical."[67] Ty Burr of _Entertainment Weekly_ called the film "a windswept pinnacle of its art" and that it "has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story".[68] However, Stephen Hunter of _The Washington Post_ stated that the film "is as spectacular as it is dense and as dense as it is colorful and as colorful as it is meaningless and as meaningless as it is long. And it's very long."[69] Kenneth Turan of the _Los Angeles Times_ said that the film "brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes."[70] In his review, Dave Smith from _Gamers' Republic_ called it "one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999."[71]

Roger Ebert placed _Princess Mononoke_ sixth on his top ten movies of 1999.[72] It ranked 488th on _Empire_{{'}}s list of the 500 greatest films.[73] Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films.[74] It also ranked 26 on _Total Film_'s list of 50 greatest animated films.[75]

James Cameron cited _Princess Mononoke_ as an influence on his 2009 film _Avatar_. He acknowledged that it shares themes with _Princess Mononoke_, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited _Princess Mononoke_ as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[76]

Accolades

_Princess Mononoke_ is the first animated feature film to win Best Picture in the Japan Academy Prize.[77] For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, _Princess Mononoke_ was the Japanese submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not successfully nominated.[78] Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.[79]

Soundtrack

The film score of _Princess Mononoke_ was composed and performed by Joe Hisaishi, the soundtrack composer for nearly all of Miyazaki's productions, and Miyazaki wrote the lyrics of the two vocal tracks, "The Tatara Women Work Song" and its title song. The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by Milan Records on October 12, 1999.

The titular theme song was performed by counter-tenor Yoshikazu Mera. For the English adaptation, Sasha Lazard sang the song.

As with other Studio Ghibli films, additional albums featuring soundtrack themes in alternative versions have been released. The image album features early versions of the themes, recorded at the beginning of the film production process, and used as source of inspiration for the various artists involved. The symphonic suite features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens.


Stage adaptation

In 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theatre company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing _Princess Mononoke_ to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work.[86] The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki.[87] The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.[88]

The first performances were scheduled for London's New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance.[89][90] In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours.[91][92] The play received positive reviews and was one of Lyn Gardner's theatre picks in _The Guardian_.[93][94][95][96][97] On April 27, 2013, the play was presented at Nico Nico Douga's Cho Party and was streamed online in Japan.[98][99]
