In linguistics, a COPULA (plural: COPULAS or COPULAE; abbreviated ) is a term for a word that links the subject of a sentence to a subject complement, such as the word _is_ in the sentence "The sky IS blue." The word _copula_ derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that connects two different things.[1]

A copula is often a verb or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case.[2] A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a COPULATIVE or COPULAR VERB. In English primary education grammar courses, a copula is often called a linking verb. In other languages, copulas show more resemblances to pronouns, as in Classical Chinese and Guarani, or may take the form of suffixes attached to a noun, as in Korean, Beja, and Inuit languages.

Most languages have one main copula, although some (like Spanish, Portuguese and Thai) have more than one, and some have none. In the case of English, this is the verb _to be_. While the term _copula_ is generally used to refer to such principal forms, it may also be used to refer to some other verbs with similar functions, like _become_, _get_, _feel_ and _seem_ in English (these may also be called "semi-copulas" or "pseudo-copulas").


Grammatical function

The principal use of a copula is to link the subject of a clause to a subject complement. A copular verb is often considered to be part of the predicate, the remainder being called a predicative expression. A simple clause containing a copula is illustrated below:



        The book IS on the table.

In that sentence, the noun phrase _the book_ is the subject, the verb _is_ serves as the copula, and the prepositional phrase _on the table_ is the predicative expression. The whole expression _is on the table_ may (in some theories of grammar) be called a predicate or a verb phrase.

The predicative expression accompanying the copula, also known as the complement of the copula, may take any of several possible forms: it may be a noun or noun phrase, an adjective or adjective phrase, a prepositional phrase (as above) or another adverb or adverbial phrase expressing time or location. Examples are given below (with the copula in bold and the predicative expression in italics):



        Mary and John ARE _my friends_.
        The sky WAS _blue_.
        I AM _taller than most people_.
        The birds and the beasts WERE _there_.

The three components (subject, copula and predicative expression) do not necessarily appear in that order: their positioning depends on the rules for word order applicable to the language in question. In English (an SVO language) the ordering given is the normal one, but here too, certain variation is possible:

-   In many questions and other clauses with subject–auxiliary inversion, the copula moves in front of the subject: _ARE YOU happy?_
-   In inverse copular constructions (see below) the predicative expression precedes the copula, but the subject follows it: _In the room were three men._

It is also possible, in certain circumstances, for one (or even two) of the three components to be absent:

-   In null-subject (pro-drop) languages, the subject may be omitted, as it may from other types of sentence. In Italian, _sono stanco_ means "I am tired", literally "am tired".
-   In non-finite clauses in languages like English, the subject is often absent, as in the participial phrase _being tired_ or the infinitive phrase _to be tired_. The same applies to most imperative sentences like _Be good!_
-   For cases in which no copula appears, see below.
-   Any of the three components may be omitted as a result of various general types of ellipsis. In particular, in English, the predicative expression may be elided in a construction similar to verb phrase ellipsis, as in short sentences like _I am_; _Are they?_ (where the predicative expression is understood from the previous context).

Inverse copular constructions, in which the positions of the predicative expression and the subject are reversed, are found in various languages.[3] They have been the subject of much theoretical analysis, particularly in regard to the difficulty of maintaining, in the case of such sentences, the usual division into a subject noun phrase and a predicate verb phrase.

Another issue is verb agreement when both subject and predicative expression are noun phrases (and differ in number or person): in English, the copula normally agrees with the preceding phrase even if it is not logically the subject, as in _the cause of the riot IS_ (not _are_) _these pictures of the wall_. Compare Italian _la causa della rivolta SONO_ ("are", not _è_ "is") _queste foto del muro_.

The precise definition and scope of the concept of a copula is not necessarily precise in any language. For example, in English though the concept of the copula is most strongly associated with the verb _be_, there are many other verbs that can be used in a copular sense as well. For example,[4][5]

-   The boy BECAME a man.
-   The girl GOT excited by her new toy.
-   The dog GREW tired from the activity.

And even more tenuously[6][7]

-   The milk TURNED sour.
-   The food SMELLS good.
-   You SEEM upset.


Meanings

Predicates formed using a copula may express identity: that the two noun phrases (subject and complement) have the same referent or express an identical concept:



        I want only _to be_ myself.
        The Morning Star _is_ the Evening Star.

They may also express membership of a class or a subset relationship:



        She _was_ a nurse.
        Dogs _are_ carnivorous mammals.

Similarly they may express some property, relation or position, permanent or temporary:



        The trees _are_ green.
        I _am_ your boss.
        The hen _is_ next to the cockerel.
        The children _are_ confused.

Other special uses of copular verbs are described in some of the following sections.

Essence vs. state

Some languages use different copulas, or different syntax, when denoting a permanent, essential characteristic of something and when denoting a temporary state. For examples, see the sections on the Romance languages, Slavic languages and Irish.


Forms

In many languages the principal copula is a verb, like English _(to) be_, German _sein_, Mixtec _kuu_,[8] Touareg _emous_,[9] etc. It may inflect for grammatical categories like tense, aspect and mood, like other verbs in the language. Being a very commonly used verb, it is likely that the copula has irregular inflected forms; in English, the verb _be_ has a number of highly irregular (suppletive) forms and has more different inflected forms than any other English verb (_am_, _is_, _are_, _was_, _were_, etc.; see English verbs for details).

Other copulas show more resemblances to pronouns. That is the case for Classical Chinese and Guarani, for instance. In highly synthetic languages, copulas are often suffixes, attached to a noun, but they may still behave otherwise like ordinary verbs: _-u-_ in Inuit languages.

In some other languages, like Beja and Ket, the copula takes the form of suffixes that attach to a noun but are distinct from the person agreement markers used on predicative verbs.[10] This phenomenon is known as _nonverbal person agreement_ (or _nonverbal subject agreement_), and the relevant markers are always established as deriving from cliticized independent pronouns.

For cases in which the copula is omitted or takes zero form, see below.


Additional uses of copular verbs

A copular verb may also have other uses supplementary to or distinct from its uses as a copula.

As auxiliary verbs

The English copular verb _be_ can be used as an auxiliary verb, expressing passive voice (together with the past participle) or expressing progressive aspect (together with the present participle):



        The man WAS killed. (passive)
        It IS raining. (progressive)

Other languages' copulas have additional uses as auxiliaries. For example, French _être_ can be used to express passive voice similarly to English _be_, and both French _être_ and German _sein_ are used to express the perfect forms of certain verbs:



        _Je SUIS arrivé._ French for "I have arrived," literally "I am arrived."

The last usage was formerly prevalent in English also. The auxiliary functions of these verbs derive from their copular function, and can be interpreted as a special case of the copular function (the verbal form that follows it being considered adjectival).

Another auxiliary-type usage of the copula in English is together with the _to_-infinitive to denote an obligatory action or expected occurrence: "I am to serve you;" "The manager is to resign." It can be put also into past tense: "We were to leave at 9." For forms like "if I was/were to come," see English conditional sentences. (Note that by certain criteria, the English copula _be_ may always be considered an auxiliary verb; see Diagnostics for identifying auxiliary verbs in English.)

Existential usage

The English _to be_, and its equivalents in certain other languages, also have a non-copular use as an existential verb, meaning "to exist." This use is illustrated in the following sentences: _I want only TO BE, and that is enough_; _I think therefore I AM_; _TO BE or not TO BE, that is the question._ In these cases, the verb itself expresses a predicate (that of existence), rather than linking to a predicative expression as it does when used as a copula. In ontology it is sometimes suggested that the "is" of existence is reducible to the "is" of property attribution or class membership; to be, Aristotle held, is to be _something_. However, Abelard in his _Dialectica_ made a _reductio ad absurdum_ argument against the idea that the copula can express existence.[11]

Similar examples can be found in many other languages; for example, the French and Latin equivalents of _I think therefore I am_ are _Je pense, donc je SUIS_ and _Cogito ergo SUM_, where _suis_ and _sum_ are the equivalents of English "am," normally used as copulas. However, other languages prefer a different verb for existential use, as in the Spanish version _Pienso, luego EXISTO_ (where the verb _existir_ "to exist" is used rather than the copula _ser_ or _estar_ "to be").

Another type of existential usage is in clauses of the _there is..._ or _there are..._ type. Languages differ in the way they express such meanings; some of them use the copular verb, possibly with an expletive pronoun like the English _there_, while other languages use different verbs and constructions, like the French _il y a_ (which uses parts of the verb _avoir_ "to have," not the copula _être_) or the Swedish _finns_ (the passive voice of the verb for "to find"). For details, see existential clause.

Relying on a unified theory of copular sentences, it has been proposed that the English _there_-sentences are subtypes of inverse copular constructions.[12]


Zero copula

In some languages, copula omission occurs within a particular grammatical context. For example, speakers of Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Hungarian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Quechuan languages consistently drop the copula in present tense: Russian: я человек, _ya chelovek_ "I (am a) person;" Indonesian: _saya seorang manusia_ "I (am) a human;" Turkish: _o insan_ "s/he (is a) human;" Hungarian: _ő ember_ "s/he (is) a human;" Arabic: أنا إنسان, _ʔanā ʔinsān_ "I (am a) human;" Hebrew: אני אדם, _ʔani ʔadam_ "I (am a) human;" Southern Quechua: _payqa runam_ "s/he (is) a human." The usage is known generically as the zero copula. Note that in other tenses (sometimes in forms other than third person singular), the copula usually reappears.

Some languages drop the copula in poetic or aphorismic contexts. Examples in English include

-   _The more, the better._
-   _Out of many, one._
-   _True that._

Such poetic copula dropping is more pronounced in some languages other than English, like the Romance languages.

In informal speech of English, the copula may also be dropped in general sentences, as in "She a nurse." It is a feature of African-American Vernacular English, but is also used by a variety of other English speakers in informal contexts. An example is the sentence "I saw twelve men, each a soldier."[13]

Examples in specific languages

In Ancient Greek, when an adjective precedes a noun with an article, the copula is understood: ὁ οἴκος ἐστὶ μακρός, "the house is large," can be written μακρός ὁ οἴκος, "large the house (is)."

In Quechua (Southern Quechua used for the examples), zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular (_kan_): _Payqa runam_  — "(s)he is a human;" but: _(paykuna) runakunam kanku_ "(they) are human."ap

In Māori, the zero copula can be used in predicative expressions and with continuous verbs (many of which take a copulative verb in many Indo-European languages) — _He nui te whare_, literally "a big the house," "the house (is) big;" _I te tēpu te pukapuka_, literally "at (past locative particle) the table the book," "the book (was) on the table;" _Nō Ingarangi ia_, literally "from England (s)he," "(s)he (is) from England," _Kei te kai au_, literally "at the (act of) eating I," "I (am) eating."[14][15]

Alternatively, in many cases, the particle _ko_ can be used as a copulative (though not all instances of _ko_ are used as thus, like all other Maori particles, _ko_ has multiple purposes): _Ko nui te whare_ "The house is big;" _Ko te pukapuka kei te tēpu_ "It is the book (that is) on the table;" _Ko au kei te kai_ "It is me eating."

However, when expressing identity or class membership, _ko_ must be used: _Ko tēnei tāku pukapuka_ "This is my book;" _Ko Ōtautahi he tāone i Te Waipounamu_ "Christchurch is a city in the South Island (of New Zealand);" _Ko koe tōku hoa_ "You are my friend."

Note that when expressing identity, _ko_ can be placed on either object in the clause without changing the meaning (_ko tēnei tāku pukapuka_ is the same as _ko tāku pukapuka tēnei_) but not on both (_ko tēnei ko tāku pukapuka_ would be equivalent to saying "it is this, it is my book" in English). [16]

In Hungarian, zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular and plural: _Ő ember_/_Ők emberek_ — "s/he is a human"/"they are humans;" but: _(én) ember vagyok_ "I am a human," _(te) ember vagy_ "you are a human," _mi emberek vagyunk_ "we are humans," _(ti) emberek vagytok_ "you (all) are humans." The copula also reappears for stating locations: _az emberek a házban vannak_, "the people are in the house," and for stating time: _hat óra van_, "it is six o'clock." However, the copula may be omitted in colloquial language: _hat óra (van)_, "it is six o'clock."

Hungarian uses copula _lenni_ for expressing location: _Itt van Róbert_ "Bob is here," but it is omitted in the third person present tense for attribution or identity statements: _Róbert öreg_ "Bob is old;" _ők éhesek_ "They are hungry;" _Kati nyelvtudós_ "Cathy is a linguist" (but _Róbert öreg volt_ "Bob was old," _éhesek voltak_ "They were hungry," _Kati nyelvtudós volt_ "Cathy was a linguist).

In Turkish, both the third person singular and the third person plural copulas are omittable. _Ali burada_ and _Ali buradaDIR_ both mean "Ali is here," and _Onlar aç_ and _Onlar açLAR_ both mean "They are hungry." Both of the sentences are acceptable and grammatically correct, but sentences with the copula are more formal.

The Turkish first person singular copula suffix is omitted when introducing oneself. _Bora ben_ (I am Bora) is grammatically correct, but "Bora benIM" (same sentence with the copula) is not for an introduction (but is grammatically correct in other cases).

Further restrictions may apply before omission is permitted. For example, in the Irish language, _is_, the present tense of the copula, may be omitted when the predicate is a noun. _Ba_, the past/conditional, cannot be deleted. If the present copula is omitted, the pronoun (e.g., _é, í, iad_) preceding the noun is omitted as well.


Additional copulas

Sometimes, the term _copula_ is taken to include not only a language's equivalent(s) to the verb _be_ but also other verbs or forms that serve to link a subject to a predicative expression (while adding semantic content of their own). For example, English verbs like _become_, _get_, _feel_, _look_, _taste_, _smell_, and _seem_ can have this function, as in the following sentences (the predicative expression, the complement of the verb, is in italics):



        She became _a student_.
        They look _tired_.
        The milk tastes _bad_.
        That bread smells _good_.
        I feel _bad_ that she can't come with us.
        London _stands_ (is) on the river Thames.
        How is Mary? ; She _seems_ (is) well (fine).

(This usage should be distinguished from the use of some of these verbs as "action" verbs, as in _They look at the wall_, in which _look_ denotes an action and cannot be replaced by the basic copula _are_.)

Some verbs have rarer, secondary uses as copular verbs, like the verb _fall_ in sentences like _The zebra fell victim to the lion._

These extra copulas are sometimes called "semi-copulas" or "pseudo-copulas."[17] For a list of common verbs of this type in English, see List of English copulae.


In particular languages

Indo-European

In Indo-European languages, the words meaning _to be_ are sometimes similar to each other. Due to the high frequency of their use, their inflection retains a considerable degree of similarity in some cases. Thus, for example, the English form _is_ is a cognate of German _ist_, Latin _est_, Persian _ast_ and Russian _jest'_, even though the Germanic, Italic, Iranian and Slavic language groups split at least 3000 years ago. The origins of the copulas of most Indo-European languages can be traced back to four Proto-Indo-European stems: _*es-_ (_*h₁es-_), _*sta-_ (_*steh₂-_), _*wes-_ and _*bhu-_ (_*bʰuH-_).

English

IS}} To Be}} The English copular verb _be_ has eight forms (more than any other English verb): _be_, _am_, _is_, _are_, _being_, _was_, _were_, _been_. Additional archaic forms include _art_, _wast_, _wert_, and occasionally _beest_ (as a subjunctive). For more details see English verbs. For the etymology of the various forms, see Indo-European copula.

The main uses of the copula in English are described in the above sections. The possibility of copula omission is mentioned under .

A particular construction found in English (particularly in speech) is the use of two successive copulas when only one appears necessary, as in _My point is, is that..._.[18] The acceptability of this construction is a disputed matter in English prescriptive grammar.

The simple English copula "be" may on occasion be substituted by other verbs with near identical meanings.

Persian

In Persian the verb to be can either take the form of _ast_ in the form of English _is_ or _budan_ in the form of _to be_.

|}

Romance

Copulas in the Romance languages usually consist of two different verbs that can be translated as "to be," the main one from the Latin _esse_ (via Vulgar Latin _essere_; _esse_ deriving from _*es-_), often referenced as _sum_ (another of the Latin verb's principal parts) and a secondary one from _stare_ (from _*sta-_), often referenced as _sto_. The resulting distinction in the modern forms is found in all the Iberian Romance languages, and to a lesser extent Italian, but not in French or Romanian. The difference is that the first usually refers to essential characteristics, while the second refers to states and situations, e.g., "Bob is old" versus "Bob is well." A similar division is found in the non-Romance Basque language (viz. _egon_ and _izan_). (Note that the English words just used, "essential" and "state," are also cognate with the Latin infinitives _esse_ and _stare_. The word "stay" also comes from Latin stare, through Middle French _estai_, stem of Old French _ester_.) In Spanish and Portuguese, the high degree of verbal inflection, plus the existence of two copulas (_ser_ and _estar_), means that there are 105 (Spanish) and 110 (Portuguese)[19] separate forms to express the copula, compared to eight in English and one in Chinese.

  Copula          Language
  --------------- --------------------
  Italian         Spanish
  _Sum_-derived   _Bob_ è _vecchio_.
  _Sto_-derived   _Bob_ sta _bene_.

In some cases, the verb itself changes the meaning of the adjective/sentence. The following examples are from Portuguese:

  Copula          Example 1                   Example 2
  --------------- --------------------------- -----------------------
  Portuguese      Spanish                     English
  _Sum_-derived   _O Bob_ é _esquisito_.      _Bob_ es _extraño_.
  _Sto_-derived   _O Bob_ está _esquisito_.   _Bob_ está _extraño_.

Slavic

Some Slavic languages make a distinction between essence and state (similar to that discussed in the above section on the Romance languages), by putting a predicative expression denoting a state into the instrumental case, and essential characteristics are in the nominative. This can apply with other copula verbs as well: the verbs for "become" are normally used with the instrumental case.

As noted above under , Russian and other East Slavic languages generally omit the copula in the present tense.

Irish

In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there are two copulas, and the syntax is also changed when one is distinguishing between states or situations and essential characteristics.

Describing the subject's state or situation typically uses the normal VSO ordering with the verb _bí_. The copula _is_ is used to state essential characteristics or equivalences.

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" valign="top"

| align=left valign=top| || align=right valign=top | || align=left valign=top | |- |Is _fear é Liam_.|| "Liam is a man." ||(Lit., "Is man Liam.") |- |Is _leabhar é sin_.|| "That is a book." ||(Lit., "Is book it that.") |}

The word _is_ is the copula (rhymes with the English word "miss").

The pronoun used with the copula is different from the normal pronoun. For a masculine singular noun, _é_ is used (for "he" or "it"), as opposed to the normal pronoun _sé_; for a feminine singular noun, _í_ is used (for "she" or "it"), as opposed to normal pronoun _sí_; for plural nouns, _iad_ is used (for "they" or "those"), as opposed to the normal pronoun _siad_.[20]

To describe being in a state, condition, place, or act, the verb "to be" is used: _Tá mé ag rith._ "I am running."[21]

Bantu languages

Chichewa

In Chichewa, a Bantu language spoken mainly in Malawi, a very similar distinction exists between permanent and temporary states as in Spanish and Portuguese, but only in the present tense. For a permanent state, in the 3rd person, the copula used in the present tense is _ndi_ (negative _sí_):[22][23]

    _iyé NDI mphunzitsi_ "he is a teacher"
    _iyé SÍ mphunzitsi_ "he is not a teacher"

For the 1st and 2nd persons the particle _ndi_ is combined with pronouns, e.g. _ine_ "I":

    _ine NDINE mphunzitsi_ "I am a teacher"
    _iwe NDIWE mphunzitsi_ "you (sg.) are a teacher"
    _ine SÍNDINE mphunzitsi_ "I am not a teacher"

For temporary states and location, the copula is the appropriate form of the defective verb _-li_:

    _iyé ALI bwino_ "he is well"
    _iyé SÁLI bwino_ "he is not well"
    _iyé ALI ku nyumbá_ "he is in the house"

For the 1st and 2nd persons the person is shown, as normally with Chichewa verbs, by the appropriate pronominal prefix:

    _ine NDILI bwino_ "I am well"
    _iwe ULI bwino_ "you (sg.) are well"
    _kunyumbá KULI bwino_ "at home (everything) is fine"

In the past tenses, _-li_ is used for both types of copula:

    _iyé ANALÍ bwino_ "he was well (this morning)"
    _iyé ÁNAALÍ mphunzitsi_ "he was a teacher (at that time)"

In the future, subjunctive, or conditional tenses, a form of the verb _khala_ ("sit/dwell") is used as a copula:

    _máwa ÁKHALA bwino_ "he'll be fine tomorrow"

Muylaq' Aymaran

Uniquely, the existence of the copulative verbalizer suffix in the Southern Peruvian Aymaran language variety, Muylaq' Aymara, is evident only in the surfacing of a vowel that would otherwise have been deleted because of the presence of a following suffix, lexically prespecified to suppress it. As the copulative verbalizer has no independent phonetic structure, it is represented by the Greek letter ʋ in the examples used in this entry.

Accordingly, unlike in most other Aymaran variants, whose copulative verbalizer is expressed with a vowel-lengthening component, -_:_, the presence of the copulative verbalizer in Muylaq' Aymara is often not apparent on the surface at all and is analyzed as existing only meta-linguistically. However, it is also relevant to note that in a verb phrase like "It is old," the noun _thantha_ meaning "old" does not require the copulative verbalizer, _thantha-wa_ "It is old."

It is now pertinent to make some observations about the distribution of the copulative verbalizer. The best place to start is with words in which its presence or absence is obvious. When the vowel-suppressing first person simple tense suffix attaches to a verb, the vowel of the immediately preceding suffix is suppressed (in the examples in this subsection, the subscript "c" appears prior to vowel-suppressing suffixes in the interlinear gloss to better distinguish instances of deletion that arise from the presence of a lexically pre-specified suffix from those that arise from other (e.g. phonotactic) motivations). Consider the verb _sara_- which is inflected for the first person simple tense and so, predictably, loses its final root vowel: _sar(a)-_(c)t-wa_ "I go."

However, prior to the suffixation of the first person simple suffix -__(c)t_ to the same root nominalized with the agentive nominalizer -_iri_, the word must be verbalized. The fact that the final vowel of -_iri_ below is not suppressed indicates the presence of an intervening segment, the copulative verbalizer: _sar(a)-iri-ʋ-t-wa_ "I usually go."

It is worthwhile to compare of the copulative verbalizer in Muylaq' Aymara as compared to La Paz Aymara, a variant which represents this suffix with vowel lengthening. Consider the near-identical sentences below, both translations of "I have a small house" in which the nominal root _uta-ni_ "house-attributive" is verbalized with the copulative verbalizer, but note that the correspondence between the copulative verbalizer in these two variants is not always a strict one-to-one relation.[24]

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | La Paz Aymara: |_ma: jisk'a uta-ni-:-_(c)t(a)-wa_ |- | Muylaq' Aymara: |_ma isk'a uta-ni-ʋ-_(c)t-wa_ |}

Georgian

As in English, the verb "to be" (_qopna_) is irregular in Georgian (a Kartvelian language); different verb roots are employed in different tenses. The roots -_ar_-, -_kn_-, -_qav_-, and -_qop_- (past participle) are used in the present tense, future tense, past tense and the perfective tenses respectively. Examples:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Masc'avlebeli v_ar. | "I _am_ a teacher." |- | _Masc'avlebeli vi_kn_ebi_. | "I _will be_ a teacher." |- | _Masc'avlebeli vi_qav_i_. | "I _was_ a teacher." |- | _Masc'avlebeli v_qop_ilv_ar. | "I _have been_ a teacher." |- | _Masc'avlebeli v_qop_ili_qav_i_. | "I _had been_ a teacher." |}

Note that, in the last two examples (perfective and pluperfect), two roots are used in one verb compound. In the perfective tense, the root _qop_ (which is the expected root for the perfective tense) is followed by the root _ar_, which is the root for the present tense. In the pluperfective tense, again, the root _qop_ is followed by the past tense root _qav_. This formation is very similar to German (an Indo-European language), where the perfect and the pluperfect are expressed in the following way:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Ich_ bin _Lehrer_ gewesen. | "I have been a teacher," literally "I _am_ teacher _been_." |- | _Ich_ war _Lehrer_ gewesen. | "I had been a teacher," literally "I _was_ teacher _been_." |}

Here, _gewesen_ is the past participle of _sein_ ("to be") in German. In both examples, as in Georgian, this participle is used together with the present and the past forms of the verb in order to conjugate for the perfect and the pluperfect aspects.

Haitian Creole

Haitian Creole, a French-based creole language, has three forms of the copula: _se_, _ye_, and the zero copula, no word at all (the position of which will be indicated with _Ø_, just for purposes of illustration).

Although no textual record exists of Haitian-Creole at its earliest stages of development from French, _se_ is derived from French (written _c'est_), which is the normal French contraction of (that, written _ce_) and the copula (is, written _est_) (a form of the verb _être_).

The derivation of _ye_ is less obvious; but we can assume that the French source was ("he/it is," written _il est_), which, in rapidly spoken French, is very commonly pronounced as (typically written _y est_).

The use of a zero copula is unknown in French, and it is thought to be an innovation from the early days when Haitian-Creole was first developing as a Romance-based pidgin. Latin also sometimes used a zero copula.

Which of _se_ / _ye_ / _Ø_ is used in any given copula clause depends on complex syntactic factors that we can superficially summarize in the following four rules:

1. Use _Ø_ (i.e., no word at all) in declarative sentences where the complement is an adjective phrase, prepositional phrase, or adverb phrase:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Li te Ø an Ayiti._ | "She was in Haiti." || (Lit., "She _past-tense_ in Haiti.") |- | _Liv-la Ø jon._ | "The book is yellow." || (Lit., "Book-the yellow.") |- | _Timoun-yo Ø lakay._ | "The kids are [at] home." || (Lit., "Kids-the home.") |}

2. Use _se_ when the complement is a noun phrase. But note that, whereas other verbs come _after_ any tense/mood/aspect particles (like _pa_ to mark negation, or _te_ to explicitly mark past tense, or _ap_ to mark progressive aspect), _se_ comes _before_ any such particles:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Chal se ekriven._ | "Charles is writer." |- | _Chal, ki se ekriven, pa vini._ | "Charles, who is writer, not come." |}

3. Use _se_ where French and English have a dummy "it" subject:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Se mwen!_ | "It's me!" French _C'est moi!_ |- | _Se pa fasil._ | "It's not easy," colloquial French _C'est pas facile._ |}

4. Finally, use the other copula form _ye_ in situations where the sentence's syntax leaves the copula at the end of a phrase:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | _Kijan ou ye?_ | "How you are?" |- | _Pou kimoun liv-la te ye?_ | "Whose book was it?" || (Lit., "Of who book-the _past-tense_ is?) |- | _M pa konnen kimoun li ye._ | "I don't know who he is." || (Lit., "I not know who he is.") |- | _Se yon ekriven Chal ye._ | "Charles is a _writer_!" || (Lit., "It's a writer Charles is;" cf. French _C'est un écrivain qu'il est._) |}

The above is, however, only a simplified analysis.[25][26]

Japanese

Ja_da_ya.png Japanese has copulae that are most often translated as the "to be" verb of English.

The JAPANESE COPULA has many forms. The words _da_ and _desu_ are used to predicate sentences, while _na_ and _de_ are particles used within sentences to modify or connect.

Japanese sentences with copulas most often equate one thing with another, that is, they are of the form "A is B." Examples:

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | 私は学生だ。 | _Watashi wa gakusei da._ || "I'm a student." || (lit., I TOPIC student COPULA) |- | これはペンです。 | _Kore wa pen desu._ || "This is a pen." || (lit., this TOPIC pen COPULA-POLITE) |}

The difference between _da_ and _desu_ appears simple. For instance, _desu_ is more formal and polite than _da_. Thus, many sentences like the ones below are almost identical in meaning and differ in the speaker's politeness to the addressee and in nuance of how assured the person is of their statement. However, _desu_ may never come before the end of a sentence, and _da_ is used exclusively to delineate subordinate clauses.

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | あれはホテルだ。 | _Are wa hoteru da_. || "That's a hotel." || (lit., that TOPIC hotel COPULA) |- | あれはホテルです。 | _Are wa hoteru desu_. || "That is a hotel." || (lit., that TOPIC hotel COPULA-POLITE) |}

Japanese sentences may be predicated with copulas or with verbs. However, _desu_ may not always be a predicate. In some cases, its only function is to make a sentence predicated with a stative verb more polite. However, _da_ always functions as a predicate, so it cannot be combined with a stative verb, because sentences need only one predicate. See the examples below.

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | このビールはおいしい。 | _Kono bīru wa oishii._ || "This beer is delicious." || (lit., this beer TOPIC be-tasty) |- | このビールはおいしいです。 | _Kono bīru wa oishii desu._ || "This beer is delicious." || (lit., this beer TOPIC be-tasty POLITE) |- | ^(*)このビールはおいしいだ。 | ^(*)_Kono bīru wa oishii da._ || colspan=2 | This is unacceptable because _da_ may only serve as a predicate. |}

There are several theories as to the origin of _desu_; one is that it is a shortened form of であります _de arimasu_, which is a polite form of である _de aru_. In general, both forms are used in only writing and more formal situations. Another form, でございます _de gozaimasu_, which is the more formal version of _de arimasu_, in the etymological sense a conjugation of でござる _de gozaru_ and an honorific suffix -ます _-masu_, is also used in some situations and is very polite. Note that _de aru_ and _de gozaru_ are considered to be compounds of a particle で _de_, and existential verbs _aru_ and _gozaru_. です _desu_ may be pronounced っす _ssu_ in colloquial speech. The copula is subject to dialectal variation throughout Japan, resulting in forms like や _ya_ in Kansai and じゃ _ja_ in Hiroshima (see map above).

Japanese also has two verbs corresponding to English "to be": _aru_ and _iru_. They are not copulas but existential verbs. _Aru_ is used for inanimate objects, including plants, whereas _iru_ is used for animate things like people, animals, and robots, though there are exceptions to this generalization.

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | 本はテーブルにある。 | _Hon wa tēburu ni aru_. || "The book is on a table." |- | 小林さんはここにいる。 | _Kobayashi-san wa koko ni iru_. || "Kobayashi is here." |}

Japanese speakers, when learning English, often drop the auxiliary verbs "be" and "do," incorrectly believing that "be" is a semantically empty copula equivalent to "desu" and "da."[27]

Korean

For sentences with PREDICATE NOMINATIVES, the copula "이" (i-) is added to the predicate nominative (with no space in between).

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | 바나나는 과일이다. | _Ba-na-na-neun gwa-il-i-da_. || "Bananas are a fruit." |}

Some adjectives (usually colour adjectives) are nominalized and used with the copula "이"(i-).

1. Without the copula "이"(i-):

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | 장미는 빨개요. | _Jang-mi-neun ppal-gae-yo_. || "Roses are red." |}

2. With the copula "이"(i-):

    {| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"

| align=left | || align=right | || align=left | |- | 장미는 빨간색이다. | _Jang-mi-neun ppal-gan-saek-i-da_. || "Roses are red-coloured." |}

Some Korean adjectives are derived using the copula. Separating these articles and nominalizing the former part will often result in a sentence with a related, but different meaning. Using the separated sentence in a situation where the un-separated sentence is appropriate is usually acceptable as the listener can decide what the speaker is trying to say using the context.

Chinese

N.B. The characters used are simplified ones, and the transcriptions given in italics reflect Standard Chinese pronunciation, using the pinyin system.

In Chinese, both states and qualities are, in general, expressed with stative verbs (SV) with no need for a copula, e.g., in Chinese, "to be tired" (累 _lèi_), "to be hungry" (饿 _è_), "to be located at" (在 _zài_), "to be stupid" (笨 _bèn_) and so forth. A sentence can consist simply of a pronoun and such a verb: for example, 我饿 _wǒ è_ ("I am hungry"). Usually, however, verbs expressing qualities are qualified by an adverb (meaning "very," "not," "quite," etc.); when not otherwise qualified, they are often preceded by 很 _hěn_, which in other contexts means "very," but in this use often has no particular meaning.

Only sentences with a noun as the complement (e.g., "This is my sister") use the copular verb "to be": . This is used frequently; for example, instead of having a verb meaning "to be Chinese," the usual expression is "to be a Chinese person" (; "I am a Chinese person;" "I am Chinese"). This is sometimes called an equative verb. Another possibility is for the complement to be just a noun modifier (ending in ), the noun being omitted:

Before the Han Dynasty, the character 是 served as a demonstrative pronoun meaning "this." (This usage survives in some idioms and proverbs.) Some linguists believe that 是 developed into a copula because it often appeared, as a repetitive subject, after the subject of a sentence (in classical Chinese we can say, for example: "George W. Bush, _this_ president of the United States" meaning "George W. Bush _is_ the president of the United States).[28] The character 是 appears to be formed as a compound of characters with the meanings of "early" and "straight."

Another use of 是 in modern Chinese is in combination with the modifier 的 _de_ to mean "yes" or to show agreement. For example:

  Question: 你的汽车是不是红色的？ _nǐ de qìchē shì bú shì hóngsè de?_ "Is your car red or not?"

  Response: 是的 _shì de_ "Is," meaning "Yes," or 不是 _bú shì_ "Not is," meaning "No."

(A more common way of showing that the person asking the question is correct is by simply saying "right" or "correct," 对 _duì_; the corresponding negative answer is 不对 _bú duì_, "not right.")

Yet another use of 是 is in the _shì...(de)_ construction, which is used to emphasize a particular element of the sentence; see .

In Hokkien 是 _sī_ acts as the copula, and 是 is the equivalent in Wu Chinese. Cantonese uses 係 () instead of 是; similarly, Hakka uses 係 _he⁵⁵_.

Siouan languages

In Siouan languages like Lakota, in principle almost all words—according to their structure—are verbs. So not only (transitive, intransitive and so-called "stative") verbs but even nouns often behave like verbs and do not need to have copulas.

For example, the word _wičháša_ refers to a man, and the verb "to-be-a-man" is expressed as _wimáčhaša/winíčhaša/wičháša_ (I am/you are/he is a man). Yet there also is a copula _héčha_ (to be a ...) that in most cases is used: _wičháša hemáčha/heníčha/héčha_ (I am/you are/he is a man).

In order to express the statement "I am a doctor of profession," one has to say _pezuta wičháša hemáčha_. But, in order to express that that person is THE doctor (say, that had been phoned to help), one must use another copula _iyé_ (to be the one): _pežúta wičháša (kiŋ) miyé yeló_ (medicine-man DEF ART I-am-the-one MALE ASSERT).

In order to refer to space (e.g., Robert is in the house), various verbs are used, e.g., _yaŋkÁ_ (lit., to sit) for humans, or _háŋ/hé_ (to stand upright) for inanimate objects of a certain shape. "Robert is in the house" could be translated as _Robert thimáhel yaŋké (yeló)_, whereas "There's one restaurant next to the gas station" translates as _Owótethipi wígli-oínažiŋ kiŋ hél isákhib waŋ hé_.

Constructed languages

The constructed language Lojban has two words that act similar to a copula in natural languages. The clause _me ... me'u_ turns whatever follows it into a predicate that means to be (among) what it follows. For example, _me la .bob. (me'u)_ means "to be Bob," and _me le ci mensi (me'u)_ means "to be one of the three sisters." Another one is _du_, which is itself a predicate that means all its arguments are the same thing (equal).[29] One word which is often confused for a copula in Lojban, but isn't one, is _cu_. It merely indicates that the word which follows is the main predicate of the sentence. For example, _lo pendo be mi cu zgipre_ means "my friend is a musician," but the word _cu_ does not correspond to English _is_; instead, the word _zgipre_, which is a predicate, corresponds to the entire phrase "is a musician". The word _cu_ is used to prevent _lo pendo be mi zgipre_, which would mean "the friend-of-me type of musician".[30]

The E-Prime language, based on English, simply avoids the issue by not having a generic copula. It requires instead a specific form like "remains," "becomes," "lies," or "equals."

Esperanto uses the copula much as English. The infinitive is _esti_, and the whole conjugation is regular (like all other Esperanto verbs). In addition, adjectival roots can be turned into stative verbs: _La ĉielo bluas._ "The sky is blue."

Likewise, Ido has a copula that works as English "to be." Its infinitive is _esar_, and, as in Esperanto, all of its forms are regular like all other verbs. The simple present is _esas_ for all persons; the simple past is _esis_, the simple future is _esos_, and the imperative is _esez_, among a few more forms.

However, Ido also has an alternative irregular form for the simple present (_es_), which some Idists frown upon. The possibility to turn adjectives and even nouns into verbs also exists, although this is mostly done by means of an affix, on top of the verbal endings. The affix is _-es-_. So, "The sky is blue." can be said as _La cielo bluesas._ As can be seen, the suffix _-es-_ plus the verbal desinence _-as_ are simply the verb "to be" annexed to the adjectival or nominal root.

Interlingua speakers use copulas with the same freedom as speakers of Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages. In addition to combinations with _esser_ ("to be"), expressions like _cader prede_ ("to fall prey") are common. _Esser_ is stated, rather than omitted as in Russian.
