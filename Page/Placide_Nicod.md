In 1912 he opened a private clinic for orthopedic physical therapy in Lausanne, and during the following year, obtained his habilitation for orthopedics. Later on in his career, he was an associate professor of orthopedics (1931–47) and physiotherapy (1935–47) at the University of Lausanne. In 1942–44 he served as dean to the faculty of medicine.[3][4]
