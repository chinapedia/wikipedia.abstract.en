History

The public library service in this area began in 1823. At the time, it was called the Albemarle Library Society. The Albemarle Library remained open until 1834. Paul Goodloe McIntire donated the resources for a new library in 1919. The first public municipal library opened in 1921. The Colored Branch at Jefferson School, the library's first branch library was open in 1934. A few years later, the libraries were integrated in 1948.

The library system formed in 1972 after the Virginia General Assembly started the regional public library systems. The system includes the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle, Greene, Louisa, and Nelson counties.
