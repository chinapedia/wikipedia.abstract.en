Early life

Jonathan Gregg was born and raised in New York City, where he lived until the age of 14, when his family moved upstate to Poughkeepsie, NY He attended Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and in 1977 graduated from Brown University with a degree in French. He returned to New York in 1981.


Career

1979–1985

Gregg led two bands in college, the Lonesome Debonaires and Guns Galore, the latter of which included saxophonist Ken Field[2]. In 1979, he joined the New Wave band the Mundanes, led by bandleader/guitarist/songwriter John Andrews (who went on to work in animation, notably as an executive producer of Beavis & Butt-Head).[3]). The Mundanes also included keyboardist John Linnell, who went on to form They Might Be Giants with John Flansburgh. The band won the first WBRU Rock Hunt in 1980[4] and released an indie single that charted on WBCN.[5] They played throughout New England, opening for artists including the Ramones, Talking Heads, Joe Jackson and the B-52's, and appeared on Boston's WGBH-TV.[6]

In 1981, the Mundanes moved to New York, at which point Linnell and drummer Kevin Tooley left the band,[7] and Gregg began to take on a more prominent songwriting role. The band recorded a demo produced by Mick Ronson (David Bowie, Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople) in 1982.[8]

Gregg then played guitar with various groups, including The Egyptians, who were managed by CBGB owner Hilly Kristal and opened for Spinal Tap; Lonesome Val, winner of the _Musician_ best song contest in 1985; and Life in a Blender, whose first album was produced by Chris Butler of The Waitresses.[9]

1985–2000

In 1985 Gregg formed a new version of Jonathan Gregg & the Lonesome Debonaires that included John Linnell on accordion[10] before settling on a permanent lineup of Michael McMahon (guitar), Chris Smylie (bass) and Ken Meyer (drums, later succeeded by Stan Mitchell and Nat Seeley).[11]

Jonathan Gregg & the Lonesome Debonaires released their first album, _Blue on Blonde,_ in 1992, on the JAGDISC label. Described as "clever and intellectual,"[12] the album was a critical success.[13][14] _Rolling Stone_ compared Gregg to Dave Edmunds and Albert Lee and called him a "triple threat" based on his guitar playing, singing and songwriting.[15] _Stereo Review Magazine_ compared the band to Dire Straits, and Gregg to John Hiatt and Tom Verlaine of Television.[16] Allmusic compared Gregg to Richard Thompson of Fairport Convention and Elvis Costello.[17] The band toured with They Might Be Giants and appeared on Vin Scelsa’s radio show, _Idiot's Delight._[18]

Two other well-received releases ensued, _Unconditional_ in 1994[19][20][21] and _The Hardest Goodbye_ in 1998,[22] but Chris Smylie was offered the bass chair for the Broadway musical _The Full Monty_ (with songs by Gregg and Smylie's Brown classmate David Yazbek)[23] and it was decided that the band had run its course. They played their last show in March 2000.

2000–present

In 2000 Gregg decided to focus full-time on pedal steel guitar. He made a pilgrimage to Nashville to study with the late Jeff Newman,[24] and has since played frequently as a session musician and sideman, most notably as a longtime member of The Doc Marshalls (now Runner of the Woods).[25] Gregg filmed a series of pedal steel instructional videos for Howcast, leading to over 100,000 hits worldwide through Howcast site and its distributed videos on YouTube.[26]. He currently gives lessons from his New York apartment. He has also performed onstage and/or recorded with Eric Lindell, Bob Woodruff (singer), Eric Brace and Last Train Home, Jesse Malin, Jim Petrie, Emily Duff and Cliff Westfall.

In 2011 he formed an instrumental group, The Combine, with veteran New York musicians Josh Kaufman (producer and guitarist on Bob Weir’s 2016 comeback album Blue Mountain, guitarist for Josh Ritter), drummer Brian Kantor (Nina Persson, Fruit Bats[27]) and bassist Terence Murren (Bobby Previte). He also started playing dobro with bluegrass ensemble The Crusty Gentlemen.

In 2013, Gregg teamed up with Kevin Royal Johnson to form a new version of The Linemen, with D.C. veterans Antoine Sanfuentes, Scott McKnight and Bill Williams. Johnson and Gregg knew each other since the '90s, when their bands shared bills.[28] Their first album, titled _Close the Place Down,_ featured songs written by Johnson and Gregg, invidually and together, with both as featured vocalists. The record was released in 2016 and rose to Number 50 on the Americana (music) charts. It was recorded at Brooklyn Recording Studios by Andy Taub (Keith Richards, Calexico, Yo La Tengo) and mixed by producer/engineer John Alagia (John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Liz Phair.[29] Johnson and Gregg were featured in a 2016 interview by No Depression regarding the making of the record.[30]

In 2016 Gregg joined Bob Holmes, Pat Irwin, Gary Leib and William Garrett in an ambient country project called SUSS. Their first album, "Ghost Box," was released in January 2018.
