The ASSOCIATION DES INDUSTRIES D'HAÏTI (ADIH), founded in 1980, is an association of around 100 manufacturers in Haiti.[1][2] It is currently headed by president George B. Sassine. It is best known internationally for its work promoting assembly plants in Haiti.[3]


Chronology

In early 1986, during a period of social upheaval, the ADIH called on the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier to exercise "tolerance and moderation".[4] In 1989, it began lobbying efforts on the issue of textile quotas for Haiti.[5][6] After the 1991 coup d'état which brought general Raoul Cédras to power, the association managed escrow accounts for tax collection from foreign corporate entities in Haiti until 1994.[7] In 2004, the association stated that they viewed the second overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as a positive development.[8] In coordination with Bill Clinton,[9] they successfully lobbied the US government from 2003 to 2006 to ensure that textiles coming from Haiti would no longer be subject to import tariffs. (Cf. HOPE & HELP)[10][11] In 2009, they opposed the parliamentary vote to raise the minimum wage in Haiti to 200 gourdes an hour.[12] In 2013 the association again lobbied against a minimum wage increase,[13] and argued that strikes would damage the Haitian garment industry.[14] They likewise argued against a minimum wage increase in 2016.[15]

More recently, the ADIH met with Jocelerme Privert to discuss the consequences of smuggling.[16]
