PETER ROBINSON (born 1966 in Ashburton) is a New Zealand artist of Māori (Kai Tahu) descent.[1] He is also an Associate Professor at the Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland.[2]

Robinson studied sculpture at the Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury between 1985 and 1989.[3] He quickly established an exhibiting career after graduating from art school, and was included in a number of international exhibitions including the Asia Pacific Triennial and the São Paulo Art Biennial (1996), the Biennale of Sydney (1998), the Lyon Biennale (2000), and the Baltic Triennale (2002).[4]

In 2001 Robinson and Jacqueline Fraser were New Zealand's co-representatives at the Venice Biennale, the first time New Zealand participated with a national pavilion at the event. Robinson's biennale work, _Divine Comedy_, was originally developed while he was artist in residence at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth.[5] In 2012 Robinson was selected for the Biennale of Sydney, where he filled a massive warehouse space on Cockatoo Island with a huge installation titled _Gravitas Lite_, crafted from carved polystyrene.[6]

In 2008 Robinson was awarded the Walters Prize for his 2006 exhibition _Ack_ at Artspace NZ, Auckland.[7] In 2016 he was recognised with a Laureate award by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand.[8]
