OMAR JOHNSON is an American marketing executive who has worked with Kraft Foods, Campbell Soup, Coca-Cola and Beats by Dre.[1]

Johnson joined Beats by Dre in 2010 as Vice President of Marketing after being Nike's advertising lead for six years.[2] Through his brand marketing efforts, Johnson helped grow the business from $180 million to a 1.1 billion category leader.[3] He left the company in 2016, two years after it had been purchased by Apple.[4][5]

He was named a "Brand Genius" by _Adweek_ in 2013[6] and made the list of the Top 50 Most Innovative CMOs by _Business Insider_ in 2016 for his social media branding campaigns such as the “Straight Outta Somewhere” campaign.[7] The social media campaign went viral[8] reaching 1.2 billion people worldwide, with 9 million memes created and shared, 27 million video views, and 13 million microsite visitors.[9]

The social media campaign also won industry awards for Best Use of a Meme and Best Use of Instagram at the 8th Shorty Awards, which honors the best in social media.

Johnson uses a tactic he refers to as "ambush marketing", which involves controversial marketing stunts, such as when Beats gave Olympic athletes free headphones in private company parties during the 2012 Olympics in London. The stunt raised concerns that the company would be penalized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), though no complaints were formally raised.[10]

Johnson is an investor in the Wifi company Luma, as well as keynote speaker and marketing coach.[11]
