BRUSHY CREEK is a stream in northwest Henry County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Big Creek.

The headwaters arise about two miles northeast of Creighton (at [2]) and the stream flows to the east-northeast about three miles. The confluence with Big Creek is about 1.5 miles south of Blairstown (at [3]).[4]

Brushy Creek was so named on account of brush lining its course.[5]
