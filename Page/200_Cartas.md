Struggling nuyorican comic book artist Raúl (Lin-Manuel Miranda) meets a woman named María Sánchez (Mayra Matos Pérez), who's visiting from Puerto Rico, at a bar in New York City and immediately falls in love with her. After the two part their ways and María returns to Puerto Rico, Raúl seeks his friend and coworker Juan (Jaime Camil) to help him find her. They both travel to Puerto Rico to search for María Sánchez, only to find that there are two hundred women with that same name in the phone book. During their search, Yolanda (Dayanara Torres) meets Raúl and Juan and offers to help them find Raúl's love of his life.
