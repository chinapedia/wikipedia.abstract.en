_HACKMUD_ is a massively multiplayer online video game and/or MUD that simulates 1990s hacker subculture through text-based adventure. Players use social engineering, scripting, and cracks in a text-based terminal to influence and control other players in the simulation.[1] Reviewers wrote that the game's "campy hacking" mimics that of films like _WarGames_ (1983) and _Jurassic Park_ (1993).[2][3]
