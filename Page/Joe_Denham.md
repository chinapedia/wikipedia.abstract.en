JOE DENHAM is a Canadian poet and fiction writer.[1] He is most noted for his 2016 collection _Regeneration Machine_, which won the Canadian Authors Association Award for Poetry[2] and was shortlisted for the Governor General's Award for English-language poetry at the 2016 Governor General's Awards.[3]

He published his first poetry chapbook, _Night Haul, Morning Set_, in 2002.[4] The collection was then included in his first commercially published book, _Flux_, the following year.[5] He has since published the poetry collections _Windstorm_[6] and _Regeneration Machine_, and the novel _The Year of Broken Glass_.[7] Some sources have also incorrectly credited him with the novel _Sins of the Fishermen_, which was in fact written by an unrelated American lawyer.

Denham resides in Halfmoon Bay, British Columbia,[8] where he has worked as a commercial fisherman.[9] He studied creative writing at the University of Victoria.[10]
