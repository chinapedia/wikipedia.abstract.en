_EUCALYPTUS CORRUGATA_, also known as ROUGH FRUITED MALLEE[1] or RIB-FRUITED MALLEE,[2] is a species of tree or mallee that is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough scaly or fibrous bark on the lower part of its trunk, smooth bark above, glossy, lance-shaped adult leaves, prominently corrugated flower buds arranged in groups of three in leaf axils and ribbed, conical to cup-shaped fruit.Eucalyptus_corrugata_-_Flickr_-_Kevin_Thiele_(1).jpgEucalyptus_corrugata_-_Flickr_-_Kevin_Thiele.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus corrugata_ is typically a tree that grows to a height of , sometimes a mallee, and forms a lignotuber. The bark on up to of the lower part of the trunk is rough, fibrous or flaky, dark brown to greyish. The bark on the upper part of the trunk and on the branches is smooth and grey over salmon pink. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are glaucous, long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same glossy green on both sides and lance-shaped to curved. They are long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to more or less spherical, long and wide with prominent corrugations along the side. The operculum is rounded or flattened, long. Flowering occurs between October and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with ribs along the sides and valves that extend well beyond the rim of the fruit.[3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus corrugata_ was first formally described by the botanist Johann George Luehmann in 1897 in the _The Victorian Naturalist_, from a specimen collected from the Golden Valley near Bullfinch.[6][7] The specific epithet (_corrugata_) is a Latin word meaning “wrinkled” or "ridged",[8] referring to the ribbed operculum of the buds.[9]


Distribution and habitat

The rough-fruited mallee is distributed through the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions of Western Australia, especially between Westonia, Mount Jackson, Kalgoorlie and Marvel Loch. It grows in open woodland and shrubland in rocky clay loam soils.[10][11][12]


Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[13]
