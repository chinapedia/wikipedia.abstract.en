_N_-HYDROXYPHTHALIMIDE is the _N_-hydroxy derivative of phthalimide. The compound is used, _inter alia_, as catalyst for oxidation reactions, in particular for the selective oxidation (e. g. alkanes to alcohols) with molecular oxygen under mild conditions.[1][2]


Occurrence and production

The synthesis of _N_-hydroxyphthalimide from phthaloyl chloride and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium carbonate in aqueous solution was first reported by Lassar Cohn in 1880 (referred to as "Phthalylhydroxylamin").[3]

The product forms as a red sodium salt under basic conditions, while white _N_-hydroxyphthalimide precipitates in 55% yield as the solution is acidified. _N_-hydroxyphthalimide is also produced by reacting hydroxylamine hydrochloride with diethyl phthalate in the presence of sodium acetate,[4] or with phthalic anhydride in the presence of sodium carbonate with heating. In the last case, an overall yield of 76% is produced following purification by recrystallization.[5]

Microwave irradiation of phthalic anhydride and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine produces _N_-hydroxyphthalimide in 81% yield.[6] Even in the absenceof a base, phthalic anhydride and hydroxylamine phosphate react to produce _N_-hydroxyphthalimide in 86% yield when heated to 130 °C.[7]

Properties

_N_-Hydroxyphthalimide is a colorless to yellow, odorless crystalline powder which is soluble in water and organic solvents such as acetic acid, ethyl acetate and acetonitrile.[8] The compound exists in two different-colored monoclinic crystal forms. In case of the colorless white form, the _N_-OH group is rotated about 1.19° from the plane of the molecule, while in the yellow form it is much closer to planarity (0.06° rotation).[9]

The color of the synthesized _N_-hydroxyphthalimide depends on the type of solvent used; the color transition from white to yellow is irreversible.[10] _N_-hydroxyphthalimide forms strongly colored, mostly yellow or red salts with alkali and heavy metals, ammonia and amines.[11] Hydrolysis of _N_-hydroxyphthalimide by the addition of strong bases produces phthalic acid monohydroxamic acid by adding water across one of the carbon–nitrogen bonds.[12] _N_-hydroxyphthalimide ethers, on the other hand, are colorless and provide _O_-alkylhydroxylamines by alkaline hydrolysis or cleavage through hydrazine hydrate.

The "phthalylhydroxylamine" reported by Cohn was known to have a molecular formula of but the exact structure was not known.[13] Three possibilities were discussed and are shown in the Figure below: a mono-oxime of phthalic anhydride ("phthaloxime", I), an expanded ring with two heteroatoms, (2,3-benzoxazine-1,4-dione, II), and _N_-hydroxyphthalimide (III).[14][15] It was not until the 1950s that Cohn's product was definitely shown to be (III), _N_-hydroxyphthalimide.[16]

Applications and reactions

Nefkens and Tesser developed a technique for generating active esters from _N_-hydroxyphthalimide[17] for use in peptide synthesis,[18] an approach later extended to using _N_-hydroxysuccinimide.[19] The ester linkage is formed between the _N_-hydroxyphthalimide and a carboxylic acid by elimination of water, the coupling achieved with _N_,_N'_-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). For peptide synthesis, the _N_-terminus of the growing peptide is protected with _tert_-butyloxycarbonyl while its _C_-terminus (Z-NH-CH(R)-COOH) is coupled to _N_-hydroxyphthalimide. An ester of the next amino acid in the desired peptide sequence is shaken with activated ester, adding to the chain and displacing the _N_-hydroxyphthalimide. This reaction is quantitative and nearly instantaneous at 0 °C.[20][21] The resulting ester needs to be hydrolysed before the cycle can be repeated.

The _N_-hydroxyphthalimide can be removed by shaking with sodium bicarbonate,[22] but the _N_-hydroxysuccinimide approach shows greater reactivity and convenience, and is generally preferred.[23][24]

Esters of _N_-hydroxyphthalimide and activated sulfonic acids such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride are used as so-called photoacids, which split off protons during UV irradiation.

The protons generated serve for the targeted local degradation of acid-sensitive photoresists.[25]

_N_-hydroxyphthalimide can be converted with vinyl acetate in the presence of palladium(II)acetate to the _N_-vinyloxyphthalimide, which is quantitatively hydrogenated to _N_-ethoxyphthalimide and after purified by cleavage, yielding _O_-ethylhydroxylamine.[26]

A variety of different functional groups can be oxidized with the aminoxyl radical (phthalimide-_N_-oxyl, PINO)[27] formed by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from _N_-hydroxyphthalimide under gentle conditions (similar to the piperidine derivative 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO)):[28]

Using molecular oxygen alkanes can be oxidized to form alcohols, secondary alcohols to ketones, acetals to esters and alkenes to epoxides.[29][30][31] Amides can be converted into carbonyl compounds with _N_-hydroxyphthalimide and cobalt(II)salts under mild conditions.[32]

Efficient oxidation reactions of precursors of important basic chemicals are of particular technical interest. For example, ε-caprolactam can be prepared using NHPI from the so-called KA oil ("ketone-alcohol" oil, a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) which is obtained during the oxidation of cyclohexane. The reaction proceeds via cyclohexanol hydroperoxide which reacts with ammonia to give peroxydicyclohexylamine followed by a rearrangement in the presence of catalytic amounts of lithium chloride.[33][34]

The use of _N_-hydroxyphthalimide as a catalyst in the oxidation of KA oil avoids the formation of the undesirable by-product ammonium sulfate which is produced by the conventional ε-caprolactam synthesis (Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime with sulfuric acid).

Alkanes are converted into nitroalkanes in the presence of nitrogen dioxide.[35]

Cyclohexane is converted at 70 °C with nitrogen dioxide/air into a mixture of nitrocyclohexane (70%), cyclohexyl nitrate (7%) and cyclohexanol (5%).

Furthermore, applications of _N_-hydroxyphthalimide as oxidizing agents in photographic developers[36] and as charge control agents in toners[37] have been described in the patent literature.

Phthalimido-N-oxyl (PINO)

The radical derived by removal of an H-atom from _N_-hydroxyphthalimide is called N-phthalimido-N-oxyl, acronym being PINO. It is a powerful H-atom abstracting agent.[38]
