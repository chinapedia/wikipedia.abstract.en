AUSTRIAN GERMAN[1] (), AUSTRIAN STANDARD GERMAN,[2][3] STANDARD AUSTRIAN GERMAN[4] (), or AUSTRIAN HIGH GERMAN[5][6] (), is the variety of Standard German written and spoken in Austria. It has the highest sociolinguistic prestige locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations. In less formal situations, Austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the Bavarian and Alemannic dialects, traditionally spoken – but rarely written – in Austria.


History

Austrian German has its beginning in the mid-18th century, when empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II introduced compulsory schooling (in 1774) and several reforms of administration in their multilingual Habsburg empire. At the time, the written standard was _Oberdeutsche Schreibsprache_, which was highly influenced by the Bavarian and Alemannic dialects of Austria. Another option was to create a new standard based on the Southern German dialects, as proposed by the linguist Johann Siegmund Popowitsch. Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized Chancellery language of Saxony (_Sächsische Kanzleisprache_ or _Meißner Kanzleideutsch_), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of Meißen and Dresden. Thus Standard Austrian German has the same geographic origin as the Standard German of Germany (_Bundesdeutsches Hochdeutsch_, also _Deutschländisches Deutsch_) and Swiss High German (_Schweizer Hochdeutsch_, not to be confused with the Alemannic Swiss German dialects).

The process of introducing the new written standard was led by Joseph von Sonnenfels. Since 1951 the standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools has been defined by the _Austrian Dictionary_ (__), published under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture.


General situation of German

As German is a pluricentric language, Austrian German is one among several varieties of Standard German. Much like the relationship between British English and American English, the German varieties differ in minor respects (e.g., spelling, word usage and grammar) but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible.


Standard German in Austria

The official Austrian dictionary, _das Österreichische Wörterbuch_, prescribes grammatical and spelling rules defining the official language. Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996. The "sharp s" (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany.

1995_Schulschrift_2._Schraegschrift.jpg Fußgeher-Schild.JPG is traditionally wrong in both countries and has to be replaced by _SS_ when in all caps – as ß is a fusion of two lowercase -sz- characters)]] Because of the German language's pluricentric nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of Standard German spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of Germany or Switzerland. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in _Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie_ (Peter Lang, 2006).

Former spoken standard

The former standard, used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the __, a sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg family and the nobility of Austria-Hungary. It differed from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation; it appears to have been spoken with a slight degree of nasality. This was not a standard in a modern technical sense, as it was just the social standard of upper-class speech.Here are some examples of __:

-   Otto von Habsburg (2004), former crown prince: Otto von Habsburg – Quo vadis Integration – Festvortrag Eggenberg
-   Emperor Charles I of Austria (1916–1918): Recording (1.5 min)
-   Emperor Franz Joseph (1848–1916): Recording of a speech for a military fund (30 sec)

Special written forms

For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents. This form is known as __, or "Austrian chancellery language". It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents. For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations, because this special written form has mainly been used by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna.

__ is now used less and less, thanks to various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants (__). As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

European Union

When Austria became a member of the European Union, 23 food-related terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in Germany.[7] Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognized under international law or EU primary law.[8]

Grammar

Verbs

In Austria, as in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and in southern Germany, verbs that express a state tend to use __ as the auxiliary verb in the perfect, as well as verbs of movement. Verbs which fall into this category include _sitzen_ (to sit), _liegen_ (to lie) and, in parts of Carinthia, _schlafen_ (to sleep). Therefore, the perfect of these verbs would be _ich bin gesessen_, _ich bin gelegen_ and _ich bin geschlafen_ respectively (note: _ich bin geschlafen_ is a rarely used form, more commonly _ich habe geschlafen_ is used).

In Germany, the words _stehen_ (to stand) and _gestehen_ (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: _habe gestanden_. The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity (_bin gestanden_ from _stehen_, "to stand"; and _habe gestanden_ from _gestehen_, "to confess", e.g. _"der Verbrecher ist vor dem Richter gestanden und hat gestanden"_).

In addition, the preterite (simple past) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the spoken language, with the exception of some modal verbs (i.e. _ich sollte_, _ich wollte_).

Vocabulary

There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of Germany. Words primarily used in Austria are _Jänner_ (January) rather than _Januar_, _Feber_ (February) rather than _Februar_, _heuer_ (this year) rather than _dieses Jahr_, _Stiege_ (stairs) instead of _Treppe_, _Rauchfang_ (chimney) instead of _Schornstein_, many administrative, legal and political terms, and many food terms, including the following:[9]

  Austrian                         Standard German   English
  -------------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------------------
  _Erdäpfel_                       _Kartoffeln_      Potatoes
  _Schlagobers_                    _Schlagsahne_     Whipped cream
  _Faschiertes_                    _Hackfleisch_     Ground beef
  _Fisolen_                        _Gartenbohnen_    Green beans
  _Karfiol_                        _Blumenkohl_      Cauliflower
  _Kohlsprossen_                   _Rosenkohl_       Brussels sprouts
  _Marillen_                       _Aprikosen_       Apricots
  _Paradeiser_ (_Paradiesapfel_)   _Tomaten_         Tomatoes
  _Palatschinken_                  _Pfannkuchen_     Pancakes
  _Topfen_                         _Quark_           Quark, a semi-sweet cottage cheese
  _Kren_                           _Meerrettich_     Horseradish

There are, however, some false friends between the two regional varieties:

-   _Kasten_ (wardrobe) instead of _Schrank_, as opposed to _Kiste_ (box) instead of _Kasten_. _Kiste_ in Germany means both "box" and "chest".
-   _Sessel_ (chair) instead of _Stuhl_. _Sessel_ means "easy chair" in Germany and _Stuhl_ means "stool (faeces)" in both varieties.
-   _Vorzimmer_ (hall[way]) instead of _Diele_. _Vorzimmer_ means "antechamber" in Germany
-   _Ofen_ (oven) instead of _Kamin_. _Kamin_ is _Schornstein_ (chimney) in Germany
-   _Polster_ (pillow) instead of _Kissen_.
-   _Topfen_ (quark) instead of _Quark_.


Dialects

Classification

-   Dialects of the Austro-Bavarian group, which also comprises the dialects of German Bavaria
    -   Central Austro-Bavarian (along the main rivers Isar and Danube, spoken in the northern parts of the State of Salzburg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and northern Burgenland)
        -   Viennese German
    -   Southern Austro-Bavarian (in Tyrol, South Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria, and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland)
-   Vorarlbergerisch, spoken in Vorarlberg, is a High Alemannic dialect.

Regional accents

In addition to the standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of Upper German dialects.

While strong forms of the various dialects are not fully mutually intelligible to northern Germans, communication is much easier in Bavaria, especially rural areas, where the Bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue. The Central Austro-Bavarian dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the Southern Austro-Bavarian dialects of Tyrol.

Viennese, the Austro-Bavarian dialect of Vienna, is seen for many in Germany as quintessentially Austrian. The people of Graz, the capital of Styria, speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western Styria.

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words, it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which dialect is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the Tirol, other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different states of Austria can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of Carinthia, Styria, Vienna, Upper Austria, and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking Standard German, can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener.

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with Slovene, and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the Austro-Hungarian period, particularly from what is today the Czech Republic. The German dialects of South Tyrol have been influenced by local Romance languages, particularly noticeable with the many loanwords from Italian and Ladin.

The geographic borderlines between the different accents (isoglosses) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with Bavaria, with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the linguistic similarities.
