The FRENCH SOUTHERN AND ANTARCTIC LANDS[1] (, TAAF) is an overseas territory ( or ) of France. It consists of:

1.  Kerguelen Islands (), a group of volcanic islands in the southern Indian Ocean, southeast of Africa, approximately equidistant between Africa, Antarctica and Australia;
2.  St. Paul and Amsterdam islands (), a group to the north of Kerguelen;
3.  Crozet Islands (), a group in the southern Indian Ocean, south of Madagascar;
4.  Adélie Land (), the French claim on the continent of Antarctica;
5.  the Scattered Islands (), a dispersed group of islands around the coast of Madagascar.

The territory is sometimes referred to as the FRENCH SOUTHERN LANDS () or FRENCH SOUTHERN TERRITORIES, usually to emphasize non-recognition of French sovereignty over Adélie Land as part of the Antarctic Treaty system.

Approximately 150 (in the winter) to 310 (in the summer) persons live in the French Southern and Antarctic Lands but they are only military personnels, officials, scientific researchers and support staff. The territory has legally no permanent civilian population.[2]

On July 5, 2019, the French Austral Lands and Seas were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3]


Administration

The French Southern and Antarctic Lands have formed a (an overseas territory) of France since 1955. Formerly, they were administered from Paris by an assisted by a secretary-general; since December 2004, however, their administrator has been a _préfet_, currently Cécile Pozzo di Borgo, with headquarters in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.

The territory is divided into five districts:

  District                       Capital                    Population   Area   EEZ
  ------------------------------ -------------------------- ------------ ------ ---------

  Archipel Crozet                Alfred Faure               25           45     352
  Archipel des Kerguelen         Port-aux-Français          70           110    7,215
  Terre Adélie                   Dumont d'Urville Station   30           110    432,000
  Îles Éparses^(a)               Saint-Pierre^(b)           56           56     38.6
  TAAF                           Saint-Pierre^(c)           150          310    439,781

 ^(a) According to new law 2007-224 of February 21, 2007, the Scattered Islands constitute the TAAF's fifth district.[4] The TAAF website does not mention their population. The data are not included in the totals.
^(b) The _Îles Éparses_ principal station is on Tromelin Island. The headquarters of the district chief lies beyond the TAAF, in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.
^(c) The Territory's principal station is Martin-de-Viviès on Île Amsterdam. The capital and headquarters of the Territorial administrator lies beyond the TAAF, in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.

Each district is headed by a district chief, who has powers similar to those of a French mayor (including recording births and deaths and being an officer of judicial police).

Because there is no permanent population, there is no elected assembly, nor does the territory send representatives to the national parliament.


Geography

The territory includes Amsterdam Island, Saint-Paul Island, Crozet Islands, and the Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean near 43°S, 67°E, along with Adélie Land, the sector of Antarctica claimed by France, named by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville after his wife.

Adélie Land (about ) and the islands, totaling , have no indigenous inhabitants, though in 1997 there were about 100 researchers whose numbers varied from winter (July) to summer (January).

Amsterdam Island and Saint-Paul Island are extinct volcanoes and have been delineated as the Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands ecoregion. The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at . There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.

The islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship _Marion Dufresne_ sailing out of Le Port in Réunion Island. Terre Adélie is supplied by _Astrolabe_ sailing out of Hobart in Tasmania.

However, the territory has a merchant marine fleet totaling (in 1999) 2,892,911 GRT/, including seven bulk carriers, five cargo ships, ten chemical tankers, nine container ships, six liquefied gas carriers, 24 petroleum tankers, one refrigerated cargo ship, and ten roll-on-roll-off (RORO) carriers. This fleet is maintained as a subset of the French register that allows French-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main French register. This register, however, is to vanish, replaced by the International French Register (_Registre International Français_, RIF).


Flora and fauna


Economy

The territory's natural resources are limited to fish and crustaceans. Economic activity is limited to servicing meteorological and geophysical research stations and French and other fishing fleets.

The main fish resources are Patagonian toothfish and spiny lobster. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the French Navy, and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.

France previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from Réunion Island.

The territory takes in revenues of about €16 million a year.


Codes

The French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Adélie Land) have been given the following country codes: FS (FIPS) and TF (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).
