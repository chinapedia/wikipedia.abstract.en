_DIOGMITES_ is a genus of mainly neotropical flies in the family Asilidae or robber flies.


Description

Medium to large-sized robber flies (17–48 mm) with mostly minute body hair, thoracal bristles are mostly confined to a row on the mesonotum and two bristles on the scutellum. The mystax is of relatively modest size and is made up of comparatively few bristles, which do not or barely overlap the beak in side view. The antennae have a relatively slender third article that forms over half of the antennal length and carries a single, minute apical hair. Face narrower than the width of one eye. Abdomen slender and sometimes slightly constricted, its posterior end reaches the wing tips or extends past these. Wings are usually clear or only slightly tinted. Body coloration often predominantly straw-yellowish to orange-reddish, in some species darker brown to black. Eye coloration of live animals often includes iridescent green.

Legs comparatively long with prominent bristles, the length of the hind legs often roughly equals the length of the entire body. Forelegs about two-thirds as long as hind legs, with a short but distinctive curved spine at the anterior edge of each tibia. The claws of the hind legs are less than twice as long as the pulvilli. As is typical for Dasypogoninae, the harder cuticle of the prosternum is separated from the neck by an area of flexible cuticle that presumably allows for greater freedom of movement of the forelegs. It should be noted however that this feature also occurs in some members of other asilid subfamilies.[1]

As with most asilids, known pupae of _Diogmites_ species have prominent tooth- or hook-like anterior protrusions of the cuticle, which are technically referred to as antennal processes. In this genus there is one undivided pair of anterior antennal processes without any basal bristles, plus three posterior antennal processes[2][3]

Biology

Adults of _Diogmites_ species hunt as ambush predators, taking off from a resting position on the ground or on branches to intercept other flying insects, or to pounce on perching/crawling prey. After prey capture, these flies will feed in a characteristic posture that has earned this genus the common name of HANGING THIEVES: they will hang from plant stems or leaves suspended by one or both front legs, with the other legs holding and manipulating the prey while feeding. Presumably the relatively long legs and reduced prosternum of the genus are part of adaptations to facilitate feeding during this suspended posture.

Hanging thieves should not to be confused with predatory scorpionflies of the family Bittacidae which are commonly called HANGINGFLIES and which actually capture flying prey in a suspended posture.

Many observations of the suspended feeding posture of _Diogmites_ were caught on camera, for example Herschel Raney's webpage for Dasypogoninae includes images of _D. angustipennis_, _D. platypterus_ and _D. missouriensis_ feeding on a variety of insects.[4] Chris Thawley has an interesting video of a feeding adult manipulating a large prey wasp while in hanging posture.[5] Observations of the moment of prey capture are unfortunately not recorded yet in any literature or web resources. Some species can assume an unusual flight posture, with the first and last leg pairs raised high while the middle legs are extended downwards (personal observation of low-flying _D. angustipennis_ males and females in central New Mexico). This might represent a peculiar type of hunting-related behavior more commonly referred to as orientation flights, or perhaps might serve purposes unrelated to hunting, such as a defensive posture to reduce odds of capture by dragonflies or other robberflies, or behavior intended to facilitate latching onto plant stems and leaves for landing.

Robert Lavigne's Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidae[6] has 443 records of observations for at least 20 species of _Diogmites_ feeding on a wide range of prey, including other asilids as well as dragonflies. Particular species can be selective in prey choice however, for example _D. crudelis_ was observed to feed on Diptera or Hymenoptera in 89 of 93 cases.[7] Very little is known about larval biology, but _D. misellus_ and _D. neoternatus_ larvae were respectively observed and surmised to feed on scarabaeid grubs.[8] Larvae appear to live and pupate in soil, adults emerge after the pupae break through the soil surface to expose the anterior body. Whitney Cranshaw has captured emergence of an adult _D. angustipennis_ in a series of remarkable photographs available at Zipcodezoo.[9] Norman Lavers' Illustrated Field Guide to The Robber Flies of Crowley's Ridge, Arkansas details egg-laying behavior of _D. platypterus_ and includes a more detailed photo of a protruding pupal cuticle.[10]

Phylogeny

Although _Diogmites_ is usually considered a member of the subfamily Dasypogoninae, combined analysis of morphological and molecular characters places _Diogmites tristis_ in a clade corresponding to the subfamily Stenopogoninae instead, without however providing direct support for monophyly of this subfamily.[22]
