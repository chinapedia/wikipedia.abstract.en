MARY CHUBB (22 March 1903 â€“ 22 January 2003) was a British author and archaeologist. She has been described as "the first professional excavation administrator".[1][2]


Career

Archaeology

Chubb has been described as an "accidental archaeologist".[3] She took as job at the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) to fund her study of sculpture at the Central School of Art in London, and not because she had an interest in archaeology or Egyptology.[4][5] After a year as the under-secretary at the EES's London base, doing odd jobs as the secretary refused to pass any real work onto her, she felt like quitting.[6] Having been sent into the basement to look for a drawing that was to be included in one of the Society's publications, she found an object that would trigger her interest in archaeology, something that the previous twelve months of work had not.[7] She described this moment in her book _Nefertiti Lived Here_:[8]

Chubb left her under-secretary job at the Egypt Exploration Society and volunteered herself as a "secretarial dogsbody" to their excavation of Tell el-Amarna in Egypt.[9] She slowly developed skills and became an important member of the team. Her administrative work "helped to set new standards in archaeological publication".[10] After the end of the dig at Amarna, she joined the excavations in Iraq, at Ur and Eshnunna, run by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago;[11] she held the tile "Field Secretary to the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute".[12] She then spent 1938 at the University of Chicago writing up their recent excavations.[13]

Author

After returning to England during World War II, Chubb was involved in an accident that would end her archaeological career. She was hit by a military lorry while riding a bicycle and was seriously injured; she survived the crash but lost her leg and lived the rest of her life physically disabled.[14] In 1942, while recuperating from her injury, she realised it would stop her from attending any more archaeological excavation, and so she turned her talent to writing.[15]

Chubb wrote a number of books on archaeology for the general public and also wrote a number of children's books on people of the ancient world. She also branched out into journalism, writing for magazines such _Punch_ and for the BBC.[16] Her children's book were in the form of alphabet books in which each letter was a word linked to the book's topic and a paragraph followed that explained the word; e.g., in her _An Alphabet of Ancient Egypt_, the letter C was for Cartouches and this was followed by a basic explanation of how to read hieroglyphics.[17] Her two main books were published in the 1950s; _Nefertiti Lived Here_ (1954) and _City in the Sand_ (1957). These books are about her involvement in the 1930s excavations of Tell el-Amarna in Egypt, and of Ur and Eshnunna in Iraq.[18][19] They were republished in the 1990s with new introductions and added epilogues.
