The fingerprint sensor uses a 4-level security system for speed and accuracy.[5][6]

The Mate 9 has an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, which features an ARM Cortex-A73/A53 Octa-core CPU and Mali G71 Octa-core GPU, which reduces power consumption by 15 percent. According to Huawei, the chipset is "the fastest [it has] built."[7][8] It includes 4,000 mAh high-density battery with Huawei's SuperCharge technology, which allows 58 percent charge in half-an-hour and a full charge in 90 minutes. The battery provides the Mate 9 with over two days of battery life.[9][10]

The dual camera module is powered by Leica. The rear (main) camera is compounded with f/2.2 12-megapixel color camera and one f/2.2 20-megapixel monochrome camera, which lets users take two images together to produce an image with more detail. The monochrome lens can be used separately. It also includes “lossless zoom” and “4-in-1 hybrid focus”, which allows users to zoom in on a subject without worrying about degrading the quality of the photo, and a combination of laser, phase detection, depth, and contrast focus. The Mate 9 also features 4K video, and a front-facing 8MP camera.[15][16]

Reception

The Mate 9 has received generally positive reviews. In _Tom's Guide_, Sam Rutherford said "Huawei's Mate 9 is the kitchen sink of phones. You get a boatload of features, such as an IR blaster, clever stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor, and a big, bright, 5.9-inch screen...it would still be the fastest Android phone on the market."[29] while _TechAdvisor_ said, "Huawei’s Mate 9 has the potential to be the best in the Huawei line-up, boasting an impressively large battery alongside powerful internals, an improved dual-camera setup and a sleek, gorgeous design."[30] Shaan Haider on Geeky Stuffs said, " Huawei Mate 9 is a great phone and score brilliantly in every aspect. It comes with a big and beautiful screen, great camera with additional features like dedicated monochrome sensor, top quality fingerprint sensor, feature-rich and productive EMUI along with a moderate battery life."[31]
