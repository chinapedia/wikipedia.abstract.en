_UFC FIGHT NIGHT: RODRÍGUEZ VS. PENN_ (also known as _UFC FIGHT NIGHT 103_) was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship held on January 15, 2017, at Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix, Arizona[1][2]


Background

This was the second event the organization hosted in Phoenix.[3][4]

A featherweight bout between The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America featherweight winner Yair Rodríguez and former UFC Lightweight and Welterweight Champion B.J. Penn served as the event headliner.[5] This was Penn's first fight in the organization in over two-and-a-half years.

Erik Koch was expected to face Tony Martin at the event. However, Koch pulled out of the fight on December 12 citing injury and was replaced by Alex White.[6]

Damian Grabowski was expected to face Viktor Pešta at the event. However, Grabowski was removed from the bout on December 21 for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Oleksiy Oliynyk.[7]

On December 29, two bouts suffered alterations: Jussier Formiga pulled out from his bout against Sergio Pettis and Jordan Rinaldi from his bout against Devin Powell. They were replaced by former UFC Flyweight Championship challenger John Moraga and promotional newcomer Drakkar Klose, respectively.[8]

Bryan Caraway was expected to face Jimmie Rivera at the event. However, Caraway pulled out of the bout on January 4 citing an undisclosed injury.[9] He was replaced by Marlon Vera.[10] Eventually, Rivera pulled from the fight as he felt going from a top-5 ranked fighter to an unranked one wouldn't make sense at that moment.[11][12]
