A GENUS–DIFFERENTIA DEFINITION is a type of intensional definition, and it is composed of two parts:

1.  A GENUS (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
2.  THE DIFFERENTIA: The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.

For example, consider these two definitions:

-   _a triangle_: A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
-   _a quadrilateral_: A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.

Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two _differentiae_:

1.  _one genus_:
    -   _the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral_: "A plane figure"
2.  _two differentiae_:
    -   _the differentia for a triangle_: "that has 3 straight bounding sides."
    -   _the differentia for a quadrilateral_: "that has 4 straight bounding sides."

The use of genus and differentia in constructing definitions goes back at least as far as Aristotle (384–322 BCE).[1]


Differentiation and Abstraction

The process of producing new definitions by _extending_ existing definitions is commonly known as DIFFERENTIATION (and also as DERIVATION). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called ABSTRACTION; the new definition is called _an abstraction_ and it is said to have been _abstracted away from_ the existing definition.

For instance, consider the following:

-   _a square_: a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):

-   _a square_: (a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:

-   _a rectangle_: a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.

Then, the definition of _a square_ may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:

-   _a square_: a rectangle that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Similarly, the definition of _a square_ may be rearranged and another portion singled out:

-   _a square_: (a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.

leading to the following abstraction:

-   _a rhombus_: a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Then, the definition of _a square_ may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:

-   _a square_: a rhombus that has interior angles which are all right angles.

In fact, the definition of _a square_ may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:

-   _a square_: a rectangle that is a rhombus.
-   _a square_: a rhombus that is a rectangle.

Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.


Multiplicity

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, _a square_ is a member of both the genus _[a] rectangle_ and the genus _[a] rhombus_. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):

-   _a square_: a rectangle and a rhombus.

or completely equivalently:

-   _a square_: a rhombus and a rectangle.

More generally, a collection of n > 1 equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with n genera. Thus, the following:

-   _a Definition_: a Genus₁ that is a Genus₂ and that is a Genus₃ and that is a… and that is a Genus_(n-1) and that is a Genus_(n), which has some non-genus Differentia.
-   _a Definition_: a Genus₂ that is a Genus₁ and that is a Genus₃ and that is a… and that is a Genus_(n-1) and that is a Genus_(n), which has some non-genus Differentia.
-   _a Definition_: a Genus₃ that is a Genus₁ and that is a Genus₂ and that is a… and that is a Genus_(n-1) and that is a Genus_(n), which has some non-genus Differentia.
-   …
-   _a Definition_: a Genus_(n-1) that is a Genus₁ and that is a Genus₂ and that is a Genus₃ and that is a… and that is a Genus_(n), which has some non-genus Differentia.
-   _a Definition_: a Genus_(n) that is a Genus₁ and that is a Genus₂ and that is a Genus₃ and that is a… and that is a Genus_(n-1), which has some non-genus Differentia.

could be recast as:

-   _a Definition_: a Genus₁ and a Genus₂ and a Genus₃ and a… and a Genus_(n-1) and a Genus_(n), which has some non-genus Differentia.


Structure

A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an _is-a relationship_:

-   A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…
-   A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…
-   A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…
-   A square is a plane figure, which is a…
-   A square is a…

The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a _has-a relationship_:

-   A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.
-   A square has a straight bounding side.
-   A square has a…

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a hierarchy or—more generally—a directed acyclic graph; a node that has no predecessor is _a most general definition_; each node along a directed path is _more DIFFERENTIATED_ (or _more DERIVED_) than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no successor is _a most differentiated_ (or _a most derived_) definition.

When a definition, _S_, is the tail of each of its successors (that is, _S_ has at least one successor and each direct successor of _S_ is a most differentiated definition), then _S_ is often called _the SPECIES_ of each of its successors, and each direct successor of _S_ is often called _an INDIVIDUAL_ (or _an ENTITY_) of the species _S_; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called _the species_ of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called _the identity_ of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:

-   _[the] John Smith_: a human that has the name 'John Smith'.

In this case:

-   The whole definition is _an individual_; that is, _[the] John Smith_ is an individual.
-   The genus of _[the] John Smith_ (which is "a human") may be called synonymously _the species_ of _[the] John Smith_; that is, _[the] John Smith_ is an individual of the species _[a] human_.
-   The differentia of _[the] John Smith_ (which is "that has the name 'John Smith'") may be called synonymously _the identity_ of _[the] John Smith_; that is, _[the] John Smith_ is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that _[the] John Smith_ is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".

As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in linguistics as a _pars pro toto synecdoche_.
