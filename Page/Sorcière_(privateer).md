_SORCIÈRE_ (French for witch, that is, a practitioner of witchcraft) was the name of several PRIVATEERS that sailed during the Napoleonic Wars. Three were French vessels, but one was British, though the British _Sorciere_ was probably the _Sorcière_ launched in 1803 at Saint-Malo that the British Royal Navy captured in April 1806.


_Sorcière_ (French privateers)

-   _Sorcière_ was a felucca-rigged French privateer that encountered on 6 December 1803 in the Strait of Gibraltar and pursued until _Sorcière_ ran aground and was wrecked near Cabrita Point, nine miles south-west of Marbella. _Sorcière_ had been armed with two 12-pounder and two 6-pounder guns, and had had a crew of 70 men.[1]
-   _Sorcière_ was a French privateer lugger of 45 tons (French; "of load") operating out of Saint-Malo. She reportedly looked much like a fishing boat. She was originally armed with ten 4-pounder guns and carried a crew of 42 men. She was commissioned in September 1803.[2] captured _Sorcière_ on 26 April 1806. _Rebuff_ encountered _Sorcière_ about seven leagues from Guernsey and gave chase. _Mayflower_, a British privateer, joined the chase and after a total of nine hours of pursuit, _Sorcière_ surrendered to her. _Sorcière_ was four days out of Saint-Malo and had made no captures. She was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 46 men. At the time of her capture Admiral James Saumarez remarked "[She] has...done immense Injury to our Trade, particularly off the Coast of Ireland, and in the Bristol Channel." [3] Between September 1803 and her capture she had the same owners, La Même and Gaultier, served under three successive captains, and had captured numerous British merchant vessels.
    -   September 1803 to November 1803: Captain Jacques Laurent.[4]
    -   November 1803 to November 1804: Captain Pierre Dupont.[5] In December _Sorcière_ captured _Cleopatra_, of Guernsey, which carrying a cargo of codfish, and took her into Saint-Malo.[6]
    -   November 1804 to April 1806: Captain Jacques DeBon.[7] On 10 December 1804 _Sorcière_ sent into _Le Conquet_ an English ship of 150 tons carrying butter and provisions.[8] By mid-February 1805 _Sorcière_ and _General Perignon_ had made a number of captures: _Rover_, of Jersey; _Nancy_ (8 guns), from Lisbon; _Victor_, of Poole, from Newfoundland; _Ark_, of Poole, from Newfoundland; and _Peggy_, of 150 tons, carrying iron for London. They also burned three vessels: brig _Temple_, from Swansea; _Hebe_, from Guernsey, from Dublin; and _Nancy_, of Irvine.[9] _Sorcière_ captured the Spanish ship _Carina_, from Montevideo, which a British frigate had captured, and sent her into Minden, where she arrived on 21 February.[10] Around 21 November _Sorcière_ captured two vessels, one of them the brig _Assistance_, which had been carrying sugar and coffee, and sent them into Saint-Malo.[11] _Assistance_ was also carrying rum, elephant teeth, cheese, butter, etc. The other vessel was carrying coals and 200 bales of wool.[12] On 6 November _Sorcière_ captured _Devonshire_, Pike, master, which had been sailing from Liverpoole to Teignmouth.[13]
-   _Sorcière_ was a French privateer lugger of 14 guns (10 thrown overboard during the chase), and 60 men, under the command of Guillaume Françoise Neele (or Néel), operating out of Saint-Malo, that captured on 28 January 1806. She and her consort _Voltiguer_ had been out two days but had taken nothing before _Attack_ and captured them.[14] _Sorcière_ had been launched in 1805 and commissioned in December.[15]


_Sorciere_ (British privateer)

-   _Sorciere_ was a lugger of 57 tons (bm) and four guns (of varying sizes). She was probably the _Sorcière_ that the Royal Navy captured in April 1806.
    -   1st Letter of Marque. Thomas John Brehaut? received the first letter of marque for _Sorciere_ on 28 April 1807. She was armed with four 6&12-pounder guns and had a crew of 25 men.
    -   2nd Letter of Marque. Thomas Gilbert received the second letter of marque on 12 May 1809. At that time she was armed with four 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 30 men. and _Sorciere_ recaptured _Wanstead_ on 3 April 1810.[16] _Sorciere_ sued for a share of the salvage money. The evidence was fragmentary, but Judge Sir William Scott ruled that as _Amelia_ acknowledged that _Sorciere_ had joined the chase, _Sorciere_ was entitled to one-sixth of the salvage money.[17] After her recapture, _Wanstead_ was taken into Plymouth.[18]
    -   3rd Letter of Marque. On 20 May 1812 a letter of marque was issued to Peter (or Pierre) Touzeau, apparently a Guernseyman. _Sorciere_ was armed with four 2-pounder guns and had a crew of 15 men.[19]
