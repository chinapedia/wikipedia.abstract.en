The TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CREATIVE INDUSTRIES COMPANY LIMITED (CREATIVETT), established by The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago through the Ministry of Trade and Industry in 2013, is a wholly owned State enterprise with the mandate ‘to stimulate and facilitate the business development and export activities of the creative industries in Trinidad and Tobago to generate national wealth.’ CreativeTT is therefore responsible for the strategic and business development of the three (3) niche areas and subsectors under its purview- film, fashion and music. As a result, CreativeTT is known as the parent company of three subsidiary companies for the three subsectors. They are Trinidad and Tobago Music Company Limited (MusicTT), Trinidad and Tobago Film Company Limited (FilmTT) and Trinidad and Tobago Fashion Company Limited (FashionTT).[1]


CreativeTT and the Diversification Thrust

Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources. Recently, the country’s economy has become susceptible to fluctuating oil and gas prices and in an effort to undergo economic transformation through diversification, the government has identified the creative industries, particularly the music, film and fashion sectors, as pivotal to long-term economic sustainability.[2]


Projects

Making the Music Video Workshop

CreativeTT’s Making the Music Video Workshop was hosted in collaboration with Tempo Networks on 2 – 4 October 2015. The workshop was facilitated by two international award-winning producers from TEMPO Networks, Ron Elliott and Russell Santos as well as TEMPO Trinidad & Tobago Country Manager and Director of Talent & Artist Relations, Arita Edmund. These industry experts addressed all aspects of creating and publishing music videos including the creative treatment and collaboration with artists and other creative stakeholders, the writing process, budgeting and the establishment of deals with artists, labels and production companies.[3]

Stakeholder Outreach Initiative

The two-day initiative targeted passengers on flights from Canada, United States, UK and Europe with a key focus on members of Trinidad and Tobago’s diaspora visiting for Carnival. The joint agency team interacted with incoming and departing passengers in a drive to establish a point of contact with persons interested in investment opportunities and developments in the local creative industries. Chairman of CreativeTT, Ms. Neysha Soodeen, stated, "Over 170 persons expressed interest in T&T’s music, film and fashion industries. Our objective now is to use these contacts to promote our local talent and creative products in the USA, Canada, UK and throughout Europe."[4]
