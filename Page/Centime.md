10_French_centimes_1963_(1).jpg 10_French_centimes_1963_(2).jpg CENTIME (from ) is French for "cent", and is used in English as the name of the fraction currency in several Francophone countries (including Switzerland, Algeria, Belgium, Morocco and France).

In France the usage of _centime_ goes back to the introduction of the decimal monetary system under Napoleon. This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins. A five-centime coin was known as a _sou_, i.e. a solidus or shilling.

In Francophone Canada of a Canadian dollar is officially known as a _cent_ (pronounced /sɛnt/) in both English and French. However, in practice, the form of _cenne_ (pronounced /sɛn/) has completely replaced the official _cent_. Spoken and written use of the official form _cent_ in Francophone Canada is exceptionally uncommon. In the Canadian French vernacular _sou_, _sou noir_ (_noir_ means "black" in French), _cenne_, and _cenne noire_ are all widely known, used, and accepted monikers when referring to either of a Canadian dollar or the 1¢ coin (colloquially known as a "penny" in North American English).


Subdivision of euro: cent or centime?

In the European community _cent_ is the official name for one hundredth of a euro. However, in French-speaking countries the word ''centime '' is the preferred term. Indeed, the Superior Council of the French language of Belgium recommended in 2001 the use of _centime_, since _cent_ is also the French word for "hundred". An analogous decision was published in the _Journal officiel_ in France (2 December 1997).

In Morocco, dirhams are divided into 100 _centime_s and one may find prices in the country quoted in _centime_s rather than in dirhams. Sometimes _centime_s are known as francs or in former Spanish areas, pesetas.
