ISHAQ HUSSAINI is an Indian film actor who has worked in Tamil language films.


Career

The brother of popular karate expert Shihan Hussaini, Ishaq Hussaini also has a third degree black belt in karate. In an interview to The Hindu, Ishaaq revealed that he had gained a doctorate in literature from the City University, Los Angeles and that his Ph.D thesis was a comparative study of French and English literature in the Romantic age. Ishaq Hussaini appeared in a series of films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, often scripting and producing his own films. After getting an average response to _Jayam_ (1999) where he portrayed a supporting role with Mansoor Ali Khan, he reunited with the same director duo, Ravi Raja, to make the family drama film, _Kanmani Unakkaga_ (1999) starring opposite actress Suvalakshmi.[1][2] After appearing with actress Abitha in the romantic drama _Poove Pen Poove_ (2001), he collaborated again with Ravi-Raja for the film _Idhayamae_, which released in 2003, and a further time for _Iyappa Saamy_ co-starring Pandiarajan.

A film titled _Nenjirukkumvarai Ninaivirukkum_ featuring Hussaini alongside Livingston and Shilpa Sivakumar was shot during 2003 and censored in 2008 but failed to have a theatrical release, before being later released straight to video.[3] In the mid 2000s, he also worked on a film titled _Boogambam_, but the film did not materialise.[4] A bilingual film titled _Lemon_ began work in 2005 and was scheduled to have a release in 2012 after several delays.

Alongside his career in films, he was based out of Poland and set up the International American School of Warsaw.[5] He is married to Yola and has a daughter, Greta, who is a doctor in Rhode Island, USA.
