_LANDSCAPES OF ENGLAND: AN EXPLORATION WITH W.G. HOSKINS_ is a BBC television documentary series broadcast on BBC Two in 1976 and 1978. Written and presented by Professor W.G. Hoskins, the series was a televisual accompaniment to his seminal text _The Making of the English Landscape_ (1955), examining how human influence has greatly shaped the landscape of distinct regions in England.

Hoskins's book _The Making of the English Landscape_ had formed the basis of a 50-minute _Horizon_ episode broadcast in 1972 presented by Hoskins and produced by Peter Jones.[1] Many of the same crew returned for _Landscapes of England_, which focussed on individual landscapes within England.

Two series of six episodes were produced. Professor Hoskins also wrote two accompanying books; _English Landscapes_ () and a series of essays _One Man's England_ () derived from the twelve programmes. The series has not been released on any home media format.
