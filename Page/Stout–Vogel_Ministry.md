The STOUT–VOGEL MINISTRY was the second responsible government to be formed in New Zealand. It formed in August 1884 and governed until October 1887. From the outset, Robert Stout served as Prime Minister as well as Attorney-General whilst Julius Vogel held the post of Minister of Finance. Initially, the ministry lasted only two weeks, with Harry Atkinson managing to pass a vote of no confidence against Stout. However, Atkinson failed to establish his own government, and was unable to supplant Stout and Vogel who remained in power for the next three years.


Background

Vogel had the larger following in the coalition, but his poor health caused him to yield the premiership to Stout. Regardless, many observers still saw Vogel as the more dominant partner in the alliance. Both men were highly active in building consensus between the growing labour movement and middle-class liberalism. Both leaders were likeminded on social policy, however frequently clashed over financial policy.[1]

At the time the ministry was formed, New Zealand was in a prolonged economic recession. As Treasurer, Vogel did what he could to promote recovery, including borrowing, though with little success. The initially hopeful populace lost faith that the government could restore economic prosperity, viewing that retrenchment was the only solution, not expansionism. Atkinson passed another motion of no confidence against the government on 28 May 1887. Stout was granted a dissolution, but the subsequent election went against the Ministry and Stout himself suffered the indignity of losing his own seat.[2]
