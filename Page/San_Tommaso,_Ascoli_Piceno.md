SAN TOMMASO APOSTOLO is a Romanesque and Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church located in the town of Ascoli Piceno in the region of Marche, Italy.


History

Construction of the church was spurred circa 1064 by Bishop Bernardo II. The simple fa√ßade built with travertine blocks has three naves, with a tympanum with a rose window. To the right, rises a bell-tower (1283) with a square base. The church has a basilica layout with the naves and aisles separated by sturdy pilasters, and includes spolia from the former Roman amphitheater of the first century BC, which had been located in the piazza in front of the church.

Many of the nave pilasters are frescoed. Frescoes depict a _Madonna del Latte_ (14th century) by the Maestro di Offida and an _Enthroned Madonna and Child_ (1298). A number of the lateral altars were erected in the 18th century using travertine marble. The main altar has a gilded wood tabernacle from the 16th century shaped like an octagonal ciborium. The church houses a marble sculptural group (17th-century) depicting a _Madonna and Child with St Thomas the Apostle and St John the Evangelist_ sculpted by Lazzaro and Giuseppe Giosafatti.[1]
