KAWLATA is a traditional Maltese vegetable soup. It is typically made with cabbage and pork,[1][2] and consumed during the winter months.[3]

The first Maltese newspaper was called _Il-kawlata maltija_ ("Maltese Medley").[4] During World War II, Kawlata was a food staple prepared by the Communal Feeding Kitchens.[5]
