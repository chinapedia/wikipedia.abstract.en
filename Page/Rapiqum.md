RAPIQUM was a city of Ancient Mesopotamia during the second millennium BC. The city was located in the north of Babylon, probably on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, somewhere in the vicinity of today's Ramadi in Iraq; the exact location remains unknown.[1]


History

The city is mentioned in several transaction records of the time,[2] the records of king Sin-Iddinam of Larsa,[3] and of the Mari kingdom.[4]

The city had been independent but was taken by Hammurapi in his 10th or 11th year of rule (around 1782 BC).[5][6][7] It thereafter remained in Babylonia. It was also taken at various times by Adad-nirari I, of Assyria[8] and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna.[9]


Location

thumb The exact location of the city remains unknown but it appears to have been a border town of the Babylonian kingdom,[10] on the Euphrates River, situated between Suhûm and Babylonia,[11] somewhere near the Mari kingdom in Old Babylonia, and north of Babylon.

Its exact location was previously thought to be near Ramadi but recent excavations suggest Tell Anbar, near Fallujah.[12] Excavations in the area of Fallujah have revealed textual evidence of the city of Rapiqum.
