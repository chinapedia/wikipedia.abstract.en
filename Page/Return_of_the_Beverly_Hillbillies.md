_RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES_ (also known as _BEVERLY HILLBILLIES SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS_) is a 1981 American made-for-television comedy film based on the 1962â€“1971 sitcom _The Beverly Hillbillies_ which reunited original cast members Buddy Ebsen, Donna Douglas and Nancy Kulp reprising their characters of Jed Clampett, Elly May Clampett and Jane Hathaway, along with newcomers Werner Klemperer as C.D. Medford, Ray Young as Jethro Bodine and Imogene Coca as Granny's 100-year-old mother; noticeably absent are cast members Irene Ryan (Granny) and Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale), who had died in 1973 and 1980 respectively, and Max Baer Jr. (the original Jethro) who declined to participate.

The film was produced and written by original series creator Paul Henning and was intended as a pilot for a proposed revival of the series, but this never materialized. _Return of the Beverly Hillbillies_ premiered as _The CBS Tuesday Night Movie_ on October 6, 1981.[1]


Synopsis

Following the death of Granny, Jed Clampett returned to his roots to live in a backwoods cabin in the town of Bug Tussle rather than living alone at his Beverly Hills mansion after having voluntarily divided his massive fortune between daughter Elly May and nephew Jethro Bodine, both of whom have remained on the West Coast (Jethro is now a successful Hollywood producer running his own movie studio and Elly May has opened a zoo for her beloved critters). Jane Hathaway, once the personal secretary of banker Mr. Milburn Drysdale of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills, is now a Washington bureaucrat working for the Department of Energy.

It is 1981 and the Reagan administration is desperate to solve the energy crisis: they dispatch Jane and her obnoxious and stuffy boss C.D. Medford to search for the secret formula of Granny's powerful home-brewed "white lightning" which they are convinced could be the miracle cure for America's gas crisis. Since Granny died some time ago, Jane and C.D. arrive at Jed's old cabin, hoping to score just a few drops of Granny's medicine. Unfortunately, what little survives is ruined by C.D., and so Jed suggests that they contact either one of the "youngins" in California to see if they have any of Granny's medicine left because someone who sure isn't going to tell them is Granny's 100-year-old "Maw", who now runs an "old ladies" home in Bug Tussle and still holds the moonshine recipe.
