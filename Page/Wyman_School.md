WYMAN SCHOOL, also known as EXCELSIOR SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL (and later WYMAN PUBLIC/ELEMENTARY SCHOOL until the mid-1990s), is a historic school building located at Excelsior Springs, Clay County, Missouri. It was built in 1912, and is a three-story, rectangular brick building with Classical Revival design elements. It has a flat roof and sits in a limestone foundation. Also on the property is the contributing power plant (1913) and a classroom annex (a non-historic prefabricated trailer that sits east of the power plant).[1]

After classes ended, the building was used as a community theatre before becoming vacant. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[2]
