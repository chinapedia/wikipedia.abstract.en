He does have some ethics, but a sudden accident causes him to suffer a brain injury which results alien hand syndrome (AHS). Smoothu's left hand stops obeying his command and gets a mind of its own. It becomes his moral self, stopping him from doing wrong things. He needs 3 Lakh rupees to cure his condition, so he takes up an assignment from a team of gangsters to steal a politician's phone.

Release

The film was released on 15 June 2017 across Tamil Nadu and earned a positive review from the critic at The Hindu.[3] A critic from Times of India noted _Peechaankai_ is driven by its high-concept premise — what if our hand starts to have a mind of its own! Director Ashok sets his film based on this idea against a background that involves criminals and politicians, and gives us a black comedy that is certainly novel, mostly funny and somewhat overlong".[4] A reviewer from Behindwoods.com gave the film a positive review, stating "the writing has been a big strength for the film and debutant Ashok has also cleverly worked on the screenplay at most parts", while "the film works well in most parts, as the audience connect well with the characters, thanks to the humour and again, the writing". The critic added "however, the slow pace of the movie, especially in the second half, is worrying and it takes some time to keep you engaged".[5]


Soundtrack

The soundtrack was composed by first-timer Balamurali Balu.
