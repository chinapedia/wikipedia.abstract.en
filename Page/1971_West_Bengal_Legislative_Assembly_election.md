LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS were held in the Indian state of West Bengal in 1971.


Parties

Ahead of the 1971 election the map of party coalitions was redrawn. The United Front had split into two after the resignation of its Chief Minister. The United Left Front, also known as the Six-Party Coalition, was led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and included the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Sudhindranath Kumar group), the Biplobi Bangla Congress, the Bolshevik Party of India (Nepal Bhattacharya group), the Workers Party of India and the Marxist Forward Bloc.[1]

The United Left Democratic Front, also known as the Eight-Party Coalition, was led by the Communist Party of India and included the All India Forward Bloc, the Socialist Unity Centre of India, the All India Gorkha League, the Bolshevik Party of India (Barada Mukutmoni group), the RCPI (Anadi Das group) and the Praja Socialist Party (Rebel).[2][3][4] The ULDF failed to reach a seat-sharing agreement with the Bangla Congress, but managed to agree to some seat-sharings with the Congress(R).[5]

The Bangla Congress courted the Congress(R) for a seat-sharing alliance, but the Congress(R) rejected the offer.[6] For Congress(R) the Bangla Congress was considered too close to Congress(O).[7]
