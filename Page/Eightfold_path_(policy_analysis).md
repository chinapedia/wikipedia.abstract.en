The EIGHTFOLD PATH is a method of policy analysis assembled by Eugene Bardach, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.[1] It is outlined in his book _A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving_, which is now in its fourth edition.[2] The book is commonly referenced in public policy and public administration scholarship.[3]

Bardach's procedure is as follows:

1.  Define the problem
2.  Assemble the evidence
3.  Construct the alternatives
4.  Select the criteria
5.  Project the outcomes
6.  Confront the trade-offs
7.  Decide
8.  Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be "repeat steps 1 - 8 as necessary."


The New York taxi driver test

The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.[4][5]
