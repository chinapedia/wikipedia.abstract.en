_PHYLLIDIELLA ROSANS_ is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Phyllidiidae.[1]


Distribution

This species was collected in Tahiti by Andrew Garrett and sent to both William Harper Pease and Rudolph Bergh. Pease described it in 1868 as _Phyllidia nigra_ but this name was preoccupied by _Phyllidia nigra_ van Hasselt, 1824. Bergh described it as _Phyllidia rosans_ in 1873. It has been reported from Hawaii and Fiji. Reports of this species from the Maldives, Tanzania and other Indian Ocean localities may be a distinct species.[2][3]


Description

This nudibranch has a black dorsum with longitudinal pink ridges. The rhinophores are black.[4]


Diet

This species feeds on a yellow sponge.[5][6]
