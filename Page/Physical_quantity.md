A PHYSICAL QUANTITY is a property of a material that can be quantified by measurement. A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of unit by a number. where the number is the magnitude . For example, 1 kg where 1 is magnitude and kg is unit.


Symbols, nomenclature

Symbols for quantities should be chosen according to the international recommendations of ISO/IEC 80000, the IUPAP red book and the IUPAC green book. For example, the recommended symbol for the physical quantity _mass_ is _m_, and the recommended symbol for the quantity _charge_ is _Q_.

Subscripts and indices

Subscripts are used for two reasons, to simply attach a name to the quantity or associate it with another quantity, or represent a specific vector, matrix, or tensor component.

-   Name reference: The quantity has a subscripted or superscripted single letter, a number of letters, or an entire word, to specify what concept or entity they refer to, and tend to be written in upright roman typeface rather than italic while the quantity is in italic. For instance _E__(k) or _E__(kinetic) is usually used to denote kinetic energy and _E__(p) or _E__(potential) is usually used to denote potential energy.
-   Quantity reference: The quantity has a subscripted or superscripted single letter, a number of letters, or an entire word, to specify what measurement/s they refer to, and tend to be written in italic rather than upright roman typeface while the quantity is also in italic. For example _c_(p)_ or _c_(isobaric)_ is heat capacity at constant pressure.

The type of subscripts is expressed by their style, e.g. by italic style: 'k' and 'p' are abbreviations of the words _kinetic_ and _potential_, whereas _p_ (italic) is the symbol for the physical quantity _pressure_ rather than an abbreviation of the word.

-   Indices: The use of indices is for mathematical formalism using Index notation.

Scalars

A scalar is a physical quantity that has magnitude but no direction. Symbols for physical quantities are usually chosen to be a single letter of the Latin or Greek alphabet, and are printed in italic type.

Vectors

Vectors are physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction. Symbols for physical quantities that are vectors are in bold type, underlined or with an arrow above. If, e.g., _u_ is the speed of a particle, then the straightforward notation for its velocity is U, u, or u⃗ ​.

Numbers and elementary functions

Numerical quantities, even those denoted by letters, are usually printed in roman (upright) type, though sometimes can be italic. Symbols for elementary functions (circular trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic etc.), changes in a quantity like Δ in Δ_y_ or operators like d in d_x_, are also recommended to be printed in roman type.

Examples:

    real numbers are as usual, such as 1 or ,
    e for the base of natural logarithm,
    i for the imaginary unit,
    π for 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...
    δ_x_, Δ_y_, d_z_,
    sin _α_, sinh _γ_, log _x_


Units and dimensions

Units

choice of unit, though SI units are usually preferred and assumed today due to their ease of use and all-round applicability. For example, a quantity of mass might be represented by the symbol _m_, and could be expressed in the units kilograms (kg), pounds (lb), or daltons (Da).is￼

Dimensions

The notion of _physical dimension_ of a physical quantity was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822.[1] By convention, physical quantities are organized in a dimensional system built upon base quantities, each of which is regarded as having its own dimension.


Base quantities

Base quantities are those quantities which are distinct in nature and cannot be defined by other quantities. Base quantities are those quantities on the basis of which other quantities can be expressed. The seven base quantities of the International System of Quantities (ISQ) and their corresponding SI units and dimensions are listed in the following table. Other conventions may have a different number of base units (e.g. the CGS and MKS systems of units).

The last two angular units, plane angle and solid angle, are subsidiary units used in the SI, but are treated as dimensionless. The subsidiary units are used for convenience to differentiate between a _truly dimensionless_ quantity (pure number) and an _angle_, which are different measurements.


General derived quantities

Derived quantities are those whose definitions are based on other physical quantities (base quantities).

Space

Important applied base units for space and time are below. Area and volume are thus of course derived from length, but included for completeness as they occur frequently in many derived quantities, in particular densities.

Densities, flows, gradients, and moments

Important and convenient derived quantities such as densities, fluxes, flows, currents are associated with many quantities. Sometimes different terms such as _current density_ and _flux density_, _rate_, _frequency_ and _current_, are used interchangeably in the same context, sometimes they are used uniqueley.

To clarify these effective template derived quantities, we let _q_ be _any_ quantity within some scope of context (not necessarily base quantities) and present in the table below some of the most commonly used symbols where applicable, their definitions, usage, SI units and SI dimensions – where [q] is the dimension of _q_.

For time derivatives, specific, molar, and flux densities of quantities there is no one symbol, nomenclature depends on subject, though time derivatives can be generally written using overdot notation. For generality we use _q_(m)_, _q_(n)_, and F respectively. No symbol is necessarily required for the gradient of a scalar field, since only the nabla/del operator ∇ or grad needs to be written. For spatial density, current, current density and flux, the notations are common from one context to another, differing only by a change in subscripts.

For current density, T̂ is a unit vector in the direction of flow, i.e. tangent to a flowline. Notice the dot product with the unit normal for a surface, since the amount of current passing through the surface is reduced when the current is not normal to the area. Only the current passing perpendicular to the surface contributes to the current passing _through_ the surface, no current passes _in_ the (tangential) plane of the surface.

The calculus notations below can be used synonymously.

If _X_ is a _n_-variable function X ≡ X(x₁,x₂⋯x_(n)), then:

    _DIFFERENTIAL_ The differential _n_-space volume element is d^(n)x ≡ dV_(n) ≡ dx₁dx₂⋯dx_(n),

    _INTEGRAL_: The _multiple_ integral of _X_ over the _n_-space volume is ∫Xd^(n)x ≡ ∫XdV_(n) ≡ ∫⋯∫∫Xdx₁dx₂⋯dx_(n) ​.

The meaning of the term physical _quantity_ is generally well understood (everyone understands what is meant by _the frequency of a periodic phenomenon_, or _the resistance of an electric wire_). The term _physical quantity_ does not imply a physically _invariant quantity_. _Length_ for example is a _physical quantity_, yet it is variant under coordinate change in special and general relativity. The notion of physical quantities is so basic and intuitive in the realm of science, that it does not need to be explicitly _spelled out_ or even _mentioned_. It is universally understood that scientists will (more often than not) deal with quantitative data, as opposed to qualitative data. Explicit mention and discussion of _physical quantities_ is not part of any standard science program, and is more suited for a _philosophy of science_ or _philosophy_ program.

The notion of _physical quantities_ is seldom used in physics, nor is it part of the standard physics vernacular. The idea is often misleading, as its name implies "a quantity that can be physically measured", yet is often incorrectly used to mean a physical invariant. Due to the rich complexity of physics, many different fields possess different physical invariants. There is no known physical invariant sacred in all possible fields of physics. Energy, space, momentum, torque, position, and length (just to name a few) are all found to be experimentally variant in some particular scale and system. Additionally, the notion that it is possible to measure "physical quantities" comes into question, particular in quantum field theory and normalization techniques. As infinities are produced by the theory, the actual “measurements” made are not really those of the physical universe (as we cannot measure infinities), they are those of the renormalization scheme which is expressly dependent on our measurement scheme, coordinate system and metric system.
