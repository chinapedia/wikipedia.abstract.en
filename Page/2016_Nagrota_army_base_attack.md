The Indian Army base in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir was attacked on 29 November 2016 by a group of militants. During the ensuing gun battle, seven Indian soldiers, including two officers and all three militants were killed.[1][2][3][4]


Background

Since the killing of Burhan Wani, Kashmir has seen an increase in violence and civic disobedience. This also increased tensions since the 2016 Uri attack.


Attack

On the morning of 29 November at around 5:30 IST,[5][6] three militants dressed in Indian police uniforms attacked the Indian Army's 166 Field Regiment unit in the town of Nagrota, near the Jammu city in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.[7][8][9][10] Four Indian Army soldiers, including an officer were killed in the initial gun battle.[11][12][13][14]

The militants then divided themselves into two groups, entered the living quarters of the base and opened fire with AK-47s and grenades. They took into hostage at least two infants, two women and over a dozen soldiers. A stand-off then ensued with the security forces.[15][16][17][18] According to a statement from the Defence public relations office, "there was [a] hostage-like situation which was successfully neutralised."[19] In the resultant gun battle, all three militants were killed and the hostages were freed by the Indian Army. Three more Indian soldiers, including an officer, were killed in the rescue operation.[20][21][22][23][24]
