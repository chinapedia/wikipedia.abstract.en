Early life

Career

Pre-debut

Hirai decided to become a singer because of Namie Amuro and got into K-Pop after watching Rain and Lee Hyori. She was scouted by JYP Entertainment after they saw an online video of her and her sister dancing. She was told to audition with her sister on April 13, 2012, though she was the only one who made it in.[7] She was signed on as a JYP trainee with fellow Japanese member, Sana Minatozaki, who also went on to become a member of Twice. She is the only eliminated member of the survival show _Sixteen_ to be brought back to debut as a member of Twice.[8][9]
