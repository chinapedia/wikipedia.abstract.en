(1967).]] A "REDSHIRT" is a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced. The term originates from the original _Star Trek_ (NBC, 1966â€“69) television series in which the red-shirted security personnel frequently die during episodes.[1] Redshirt deaths are often used to dramatize the potential peril that the main characters face.


Origin

In _Star Trek_, red-uniformed security officers and engineers who accompany the main characters on landing parties often suffer quick deaths.[2]

The first instance of what now is an established trope can be seen in the episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (1966).[3] Of the 59 crew members killed in the series, 43 (73%) were wearing red shirts.[4] The _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ book _Legends of the Ferengi_ says Starfleet security personnel "rarely survive beyond the second act break".[5] An episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ titled "Valiant" (1998) also references red as a sort of bad luck omen, in which the plot centers around a group of cadets calling themselves "Red Squad", almost all of whom die in the episode.[6] The cinematic reboot of the franchise features a character named Olson (portrayed by Greg Ellis) who dies early on during a mission; he wears a red uniform in homage to the trope from the original series.[7]


Usage

In other media, the term "redshirt" and images of characters wearing red shirts has come to represent disposable characters destined for suffering or death.[8][9]

_Galaxy Quest_ (1999), a comedy about actors from a defunct science-fiction television series serving on a real starship, includes an actor who is terrified that he's going to die on an away mission because his only appearance in the show was as an unnamed character who was killed early in the episode.[10] _Redshirts_ is a novel by John Scalzi that satirizes the trope, as is the PC game Redshirt.[11]
