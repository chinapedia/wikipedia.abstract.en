_RATHA PAASAM_ () is a 1954 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by R. S. Mani, written by C. V. Sridhar and produced by T. K. Muthusamy. The film stars T. K. Shanmugam, T. K. Bhagavathi, Anjali Devi, M. S. Draupadhai and T. S. Balaiah. It is based on Sridhar's play of the same name. The film was a commercial success, and was later remade in Hindi as _Bhai-Bhai_ (1956).


Plot

Raja (T. K. Shanmugam) is a petty thief living around the streets of Bombay, indulging in pickpocketing. In the same city lives Rani (Anjali Devi), who makes a living through dancing. The two meet and fall in love.

Raghu (T. K. Bhagavathi), the owner of a cycle company, lives luxuriously with his wife Sarala (M. S. Draupadi) and children in Madras. Madhu (T. S. Balaiah), his manager, has been misappropriating the company funds with the help of his lover Manorama (N. R. Vidyavathi) who Raghu is later attracted to. The company is soon closed due to losses, putting Sarala and her children in poverty.

Raghu leaves for Bombay to seek new avenues, leaving his family behind. Sarala goes in search of him. One day, Raja picks Raghu's pocket and finds photographs in his purse which reveal that Raghu is his brother. He goes in search of his long-lost brother who does not bother to recognise him because of his snobbery. Sarala faces many problems and after several incidents, the problems are solved and the family is reunited.[1]


Production

_Ratha Paasam_ was a play written by C. V. Sridhar when he was 18 years of age and staged by T. K. Shanmugam's drama troupe, T.K.S. Brothers.[2] Sridhar initially approached AVM Productions to adapt the play as a film, but they rejected the offer.[3] Therefore, it was picked up and produced by Shanmugam's brother T. K. Muthusamy under the banner "Auvai Productions", and directed by R. S. Mani. The screenplay was written by Sridhar.[4][5] Cinematography was handled by Nemai Ghosh, and the editing by K. Govindasamy.[6] Shanmugam and his other brother Bhagavathi, who acted in the play, reprised their roles in the film adaptation, also titled _Ratha Paasam_.[7] Shooting took place at Neptune Studios, later known as Dr. MGR-Janaki College of Arts and Science for Women.[8]


Soundtrack

Music was composed by M. K. Athmanathan and A. V. Natarajan while the lyrics were penned by M. K. Athmanathan and Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam. Playback singers are P. Leela, M. L. Vasanthakumari, Jikki, K. Rani, Kantha, (Radha) Jayalakshmi, Thiruchi Loganathan, A. M. Rajah and S. C. Krishnan.[9] The song "Dullu… Dullu… Very Dullu…" is a satire on the economic situation and hypocrisy of Madras in the 1950s and of how people then lived their lives.[10]
