Culinary

Today, the fruit is used mainly for tea, _dangyuja-cha_ (dangyuja tea), whose preparation is very similar to that of yuja tea. In the past, dangyuja was often used in home remedies to prevent and treat the common cold. A soup called _daengyuji-kkul-tang_ (literally "dangyuja honey soup"), was made of the crushed flesh of dangyuja, honey, and ginger. Cooked in the ashes of a fire, the mixture attains a thin syrup-like consistency. People used the cooled soup to treat cold.[6]

Medicinal

In traditional Korean medicine, the fruit is used to treat various gastrointestinal ailments. _Dongui Bogam_, an encyclopaedic medical book published in 1613, writes that dangyujas can help detoxify and purify the stomach, treat alcohol intoxication, and stimulate a poor appetite.
