Music

The libretto stays close to Shakespeare's play, and is "skilfully abbreviated and adapted", according to one reviewer, but because "neither [Boesmans nor Bondy] could bear to cut Shakespeare's original", they wrote the Sicilian scenes mostly in German, a language in which both librettist and composer were fluent.[12] The scenes on the seacoast of Bohemia, in the third act, are mostly in English, accompanied by jazz-rock music.[13] In the premiere and the first recording this was performed by the Belgian group Aka Moon.[14] They invented the role of Green, who personifies Time and is a Shakespearean jester holding the scenes together.[15]

The music at times alludes to Mozart, Richard Strauss, and Alban Berg.[16] Claudio Monteverdi is quoted literally.[17] Boesmans writes lyrical and singable parts,[18] and finely detailed orchestration.[19] He uses music described as expressionist to characterize Leontes who is insane with jealousy, causing pain and guilt. The music for Hermione, his wife, is full of passion and warmth.[20] A reviewer summarizes that "the sometimes eclectic melodic and harmonic characteristics of his music [are] accessible yet challenging".[21]
