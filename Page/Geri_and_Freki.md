In Norse mythology, GERI and FREKI (Old Norse, both meaning "the ravenous" or "greedy one") are two wolves which are said to accompany the god Odin. They are attested in the _Poetic Edda_, a collection of epic poetry compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, in the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds. The pair has been compared to similar figures found in Greek, Roman and Vedic mythology, and may also be connected to beliefs surrounding the Germanic "wolf-warrior bands", the Úlfhéðnar.


Etymology

The names _Geri_ and _Freki_ have been interpreted as meaning either "the greedy one" or "the ravenous one".[1] The name _Geri_ can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic adjective , attested in Burgundian _girs_, Old Norse and Old High German or , all of which mean "greedy".[2]

The name _Freki_ can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic adjective , attested in Gothic () "covetous, avaricious", Old Norse "greedy", Old English "desirous, greedy, gluttonous, audacious" and Old High German "greedy".[3] John Lindow interprets both Old Norse names as nominalized adjectives.[4] Bruce Lincoln further traces _Geri_ back to a Proto-Indo-European stem *__, which is the same as that found in , a name referring to the hound closely associated with the events of .[5]


Attestations

In the _Poetic Edda_ poem _Grímnismál_, the god Odin (disguised as _Grímnir_) provides the young Agnarr with information about Odin's companions. Agnarr is told that Odin feeds Geri and Freki while the god himself consumes only wine:

  |     Geri and Freki the war-wont sates,  |     Freki and Geri does Heerfather feed,          |  |
  |     the triumphant sire of hosts;       |     The far-famed fighter of old:                 |  |
  |     but on wine only the famed in arms, |     But on wine alone does the weapon-decked god, |  |
  |     Odin, ever lives.[6]                |     Othin, forever live.[7]                       |  |
  +-----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+--+

The pair is also alluded to via the kenning "Viðrir's (Odin's) hounds" in _Helgakviða Hundingsbana I_, verse 13, where it is related that they roam the field "greedy for the corpses of those who have fallen in battle".[8]

  |     The warriors went to the trysting place of swords,       |     The warriors forth to the battle went,               |  |
  |     which they had appointed at Logafiöll.                   |     The field they chose at Logafjoll;                   |  |
  |     Broken was Frodi's peace between the foes:               |     Frothi's peace midst foes they broke,                |  |
  |     Vidrir’s hounds went about the isle slaughter-greedy.[9] |     Through the isle went hungrily Vithrir's hounds.[10] |  |

In the _Prose Edda_ book _Gylfaginning_ (chapter 38), the enthroned figure of High explains that Odin gives all of the food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, for wine is to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem _Grímnismál_ in support.[11] In chapter 75 of the _Prose Edda_ book _Skáldskaparmál_ a list of names for wargs and wolves is provided that includes both Geri and Freki.[12]

In skaldic poetry _Geri_ and _Freki_ are used as common nouns for "wolf" in chapter 58 of _Skáldskaparmál_ (quoted in works by the skalds Þjóðólfr of Hvinir and Egill Skallagrímsson) and _Geri_ is again used as a common noun for "wolf" in chapter 64 of the _Prose Edda_ book _Háttatal_.[13] Geri is referenced in kennings for "blood" in chapter 58 of _Skáldskaparmál_ ("Geri's ales" in a work by the skald Þórðr Sjáreksson) and in for "carrion" in chapter 60 ("Geri's morsel" in a work by the skald Einarr Skúlason).[14] _Freki_ is also used in a kenning for "carrion" ("Freki's meal") in a work by Þórðr Sjáreksson in chapter 58 of _Skáldskaparmál_.[15]


Archaeological record

If the rider on horseback on the image on the Böksta Runestone has been correctly identified as Odin, then Geri and Freki are shown taking part in hunting an elk or moose.[16]


Theories

Bronsplåt_pressbleck_Öland_vendeltid.jpg bronze plate found on Öland, Sweden depicting a wolf-pelt warrior drawing a sword beside a dancing figure.]] _Freki_ is also a name applied to the monstrous wolf Fenrir in the _Poetic Edda_ poem _Völuspá_. Folklorist John Lindow sees irony in the fact that Odin feeds one Freki at his dinner table and another—Fenrir—with his flesh during the events of Ragnarök.[17]

Historian Michael Spiedel connects Geri and Freki with archaeological finds depicting figures wearing wolf-pelts and frequently found wolf-related names among the Germanic peoples, including Wulfhroc ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf-Hide"), Isangrim ("Grey-Mask"), Scrutolf ("Garb-Wolf") and Wolfgang ("Wolf-Gait"), Wolfdregil ("Wolf-Runner"), and Vulfolaic ("Wolf-Dancer") and myths regarding wolf warriors from Norse mythology (such as the Úlfhéðnar). Michael Speidel believes this to point to the pan-Germanic wolf-warrior band cult centered on Odin that waned away after Christianization.[18]

Scholars have also noted Indo-European parallels to the wolves Geri and Freki as companions of a divinity. 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm observed a connection between this aspect of Odin's character and the Greek Apollo, to whom both the wolf and the raven are sacred.[19] Philologist Maurice Bloomfield further connected the pair with the two dogs of Yama in Vedic mythology, and saw them as a Germanic counterpart to a more general and widespread Indo-European "Cerberus"-theme.[20] Speidel finds similar parallels in the Vedic Rudra and the Roman Mars. Elaborating on the connection between wolves and figures of great power, he writes: "This is why Geri and Freki, the wolves at Woden's side, also glowered on the throne of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Wolf-warriors, like Geri and Freki, were not mere animals but mythical beings: as Woden's followers they bodied forth his might, and so did wolf-warriors."[21]

Bernd Heinrich theorizes that Geri and Freki, along with Odin and his ravens Huginn and Muninn, reflect a symbiosis observed in the natural world among ravens, wolves, and humans on the hunt:

      In a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As in such a symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) who were part of him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered to the ends of the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.[22]
