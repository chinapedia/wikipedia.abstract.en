Career

Garrison got his start in Hollywood working as a production assistant on the set of the Fox television show "The OC".[6]" He then went on to work on other hit shows "Mad Men" and "Entourage" as a technical consultant. He has produced two seasons of the Emmy-nominated reality show "Whale Wars",[7] and he set up and runs the Hollywood-based commercial production company, Red Apple Production.[8][9]

In 2015, he shot the first-ever recorded aerial footage of a Blue whale and her calf nursing near the coast of Antarctica.[10] The footage went on to spark a conversation about the role of drones[11] in modern conservation efforts[12][13] and has become a topic in the world of unmanned aircraft.[14] A new term for the movement was coined in a November 2015 interview with Garrison as "Conservation 2.0.[15]". Garrison now speaks on the topic worldwide.[16] He produced six episodes of "Whale Wars," which includes four major specials[17] and four documentary films.[18]

Gavin Garrison has written over a dozen articles on the use of unmanned aircraft for filmmaking[19] and conservation,[20] and has become a special contributor to drone publications like RotorDrone magazine.[21]
