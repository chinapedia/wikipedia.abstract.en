In ordered to stay focused on their mission, CRF follows these four core values: Caring for Children, Committed to Christ, Working through Churches, and Operating with Authenticity.[2]


History

Baxter Loe, a businessman and preacher from Amarillo, TX,[3] went on a mission trip to India in 1970. While there, he met a man named John Abraham. John explained his country and people were suffering from poverty, and his own family was starving. Upon hearing John's situation, Baxter promised to provide help, but after returning to the United States, he was swept back into his daily routine. Some time later, Baxter remembered his promise to John and called for information on how to send him money. The only response he received was: 'John Abraham is dead'. After receiving this news, Baxter began supporting John Abraham's children, but he felt like this was not enough, so he found support for more children in India, Central American, Africa, and other countries all over the world. In 1971, Baxter founded Christian Relief Fund. Now, thousands of children across 30 different countries are supported by CRF sponsors.[4]

In 2004, Jones was visiting with some children in the Nyalenda slum in Kisumu, Kenya, where they asked him if he would wear orange everyday, and he agreed. When he was promoted to CEO, he reinvented the organization by making orange their signature color.[5] The organization uses this color to speak to renewed hope that will never be taken away.[6]

Programs

Child Sponsorship

Through sponsoring, Christian Relief Fund is able to provide children with food, clothing, medicalcare, education, and Bible teaching. It cost $35 a month, and a sponsor receives a packet which includes their child's photo and story.[7] Sponsors also have the opportunity to write their child letters.[8]

Medical Care

Through various medical clinics worldwide, CRF provides healthcare, and in many of these areas, the CRF clinics are the only healthcare available.[9][10]

Clean Water

A child in a family of 4 living in Sub-Saharan carries an average of 128 pounds of water daily,[11] and 1 in 10 of these people do not have access to clean water.[12] Due to the need of retrieving water, children have little time to go to school.[13] Through the use of CRF's water and sanitation programs, they provide clean water each year to tens of thousands of people.[14]

Disaster Relief

Christian Relief Fund assist victims of famine and disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, wars, etc., throughout the United States and others worldwide. They give funds for food, blankets, shelter, medical assistance, and means to rebuild homes. Their disaster relief also includes shipments of sea containers that contain medical supplies for hospitals and orphanages in impoverished countries.[15]

Education

CRF is trying to help children break the cycle of poverty by funding schools around the world. Without these schools, many of the students would not have the opportunity for an education.[16] Their funding covers the cost of construction of the school buildings, the children's tuition, and the teachers' salaries.[17]
