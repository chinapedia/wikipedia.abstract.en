Kushner has written a number of other popular theological books, such as _How Good Do We Have to Be?_ (Dedicated to his grandson, Carl), _To Life!_ and many others. In collaboration with the late Chaim Potok, Kushner co-edited _Etz Hayim: A Torah Commentary_, the new official Torah commentary of the Conservative movement, which was jointly published in 2001 by the Rabbinical Assembly and the Jewish Publication Society. His _Living a Life That Matters_ became a best seller in the fall of 2001. Kushner's book, _The Lord Is My Shepherd_, was a meditation on the Twenty-Third Psalm released in 2003.
