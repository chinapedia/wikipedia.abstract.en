AABBASSIYEH () is a village in the Tyre District in South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, the name Aabbassiyeh came from the proper name ‘Abbâs, the uncle of the prophet.[1]


History

In 1875, Victor Guérin estimated the population to be 600 Metawileh.[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as: "A stone-built village, containing 400 Metawileh, built on a ridge ; the ground around it is cultivated for barley, etc., and there are groves of figs and olives. The water supply is derived from a large pool to the north, and a good spring built up with masonry, also to the north of the village ; there are no antiquities, and only a few cisterns."[3]
