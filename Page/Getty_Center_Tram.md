The GETTY CENTER TRAM is a people mover system that serves the Getty Center in Los Angeles. It runs two cable-driven hovertrains each consisting of three Otis Hovair vehicles.[1]


History

The tram line, already planned in 1988,[2] was opened at the end of 1997, following the inauguration of the Getty Center.


Route

The line, located north of Brentwood, in the Westside Region of Los Angeles, links a freeway-level parking garage to the Getty Center, which includes the J. Paul Getty Museum. The duration of a ride is about 3 to 4 minutes.[3]

The lower station (), at the bottom of the hill, lies beside Sepulveda Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway and features a refuge siding. The upper station (), at the top of the hill, is located in the arrival plaza of the Getty Center and is part of the structure.[4] The line follows Getty Center Drive and has a passing loop in the middle, although the two trains can operate independently.[5]
