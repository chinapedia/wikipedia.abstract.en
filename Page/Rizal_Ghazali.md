MOHD RIZAL BIN MOHD GHAZALI (born 1 October 1992) simply known as JAI is a Malaysian football player who plays for the Malaysia Super League club Kedah and Malaysia national team as a right back but can also play as a wing back.[1]


Club career

Perlis FA

Rizal began his career with the Perlis youth team, Perlis President Cup. Later, he was promoted to the Perlis senior team in 2011 wearing number 15 jersey.[2] Rizal spent 3 seasons with Perlis senior team before signed with Kedah for the 2014 season.[3]

Kedah FA

On 17 October 2013, Rizal signed a contract with Kedah to play in 2014 season. He was registered with the number 34 jersey, before switching to jersey number 15 afterwards.[4] At the beginning of his appearances with Kedah, Rizal played as a winger. Somewhere in 2015, Kedah's temporary coach, Ramon Marcote, has placed him as a right-back as Ramon feels that Rizal is better at that position. Therefore he continues to serve as Kedah's main right-back since then.[5]

Rizal scored a goal in the 2016 Malaysia Cup final which both team ended tied 1–1 after extra time. Kedah won 6–5 in the shootout and clinched the Malaysia Cup for the 2016.[6]
