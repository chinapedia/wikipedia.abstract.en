_OCTOBERON_ is the seventh album by Barclay James Harvest, released in 1976. In 2003 a remastered CD was issued with five bonus tracks. In 2017 a 3-disc CD/DVD special edition was released. This features new stereo and surround mixes in addition to the remastered originals, plus the 2003 bonus tracks, one new bonus track, and two videos.


Critical reception

In the UK music magazine _Sounds_, Tim Lott expressed his frustration with the album, saying, "Unfortunately, _Octoberon_ is no major departure from [their] disappointing formula. But despite that, there are some fine, imaginative moments which point once again to the never-fulfilled potential."[1] A review of the album, appearing in a January 1977 issue of _Billboard_ magazine, said that _Octoberon_ "has delivered an extremely accessible spacey-but-lyrical LP in the most popular style of Pink Floyd or Yes. There is nothing harsh or cultish about this music."[2] In another mixed review, AllMusic's Paul Collins wrote that _Octoberon_ lacks the harmonies evident in the band's earlier records, and that the album is "not up to the level of their best work, but worth a listen for fans."[3]
