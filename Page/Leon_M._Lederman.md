LEON MAX LEDERMAN (July 15, 1922 – October 3, 2018) was an American experimental physicist who received the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1982, along with Martin Lewis Perl, for their research on quarks and leptons, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, for their research on neutrinos. Lederman was Director Emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. He founded the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, in Aurora, Illinois in 1986, and was Resident Scholar Emeritus there from 2012 until his death in 2018.[1][2]

An accomplished scientific writer, he became known for his 1993 book _The God Particle_ establishing the importance of the Higgs boson.


Early life

Lederman was born in New York City, New York, to Morris and Minna (Rosenberg) Lederman.[3] His parents were Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants from Kiev and Odessa.[4] Lederman graduated from James Monroe High School in the South Bronx,[5] and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1943.[6]

He next enlisted in the United States Army[7] during World War II, intending to become a physicist after his service.[8] Following his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at Columbia University's graduate school, receiving his Ph.D. in 1951.[9]


Academic career

Lederman became a faculty member at Columbia University, and he was promoted to full professor in 1958 as Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics.[10] In 1960, on leave from Columbia, he spent time at CERN in Geneva as a Ford Foundation Fellow.[11] He took an extended leave of absence from Columbia in 1979 to become director of Fermilab.[12] Resigning from Columbia (and retiring from Fermilab) in 1989, he then taught briefly at the University of Chicago.[13] He then moved to the physics department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he served as the Pritzker Professor of Science.[14] In 1992, Lederman served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[15][16]

Lederman served as President of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and at the time of his death was Chair Emeritus.[17] He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1989 to 1992, and was a member of the JASON defense advisory group.[18] Lederman was also one of the main proponents of the "Physics First" movement.[19] Also known as "Right-side Up Science" and "Biology Last," this movement seeks to rearrange the current high school science curriculum so that physics precedes chemistry and biology.[20]

Lederman was an early supporter of Science Debate 2008, an initiative to get the then-candidates for president, Barack Obama and John McCain, to debate the nation's top science policy challenges.[21] In October 2010, Lederman participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engaged in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.[22] Lederman was also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.[23]


Academic work

In 1956, Lederman worked on parity violation in weak interactions. R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment, and they immediately verified the parity violation.[24] They delayed publication of their results until after Wu's group was ready, and the two papers appeared back to back in the same physics journal. Among his achievements are the discovery of the muon neutrino in 1962 and the bottom quark in 1977.[25] These helped establish his reputation as among the top particle physicists.[26]

In 1977, a group of physicists, the E288 experiment team, led by Lederman announced that a particle with a mass of about 6.0 GeV was being produced by the Fermilab particle accelerator.[27] After taking further data, the group discovered that this particle did not actually exist, and the "discovery" was named "Oops-Leon" as a pun on the original name and Lederman's first name.[28]

As the director of Fermilab, Lederman was a prominent supporter[29][30] of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime.[31][32] Lederman later wrote his 1993 popular science book _The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?_ – which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project – in the context of the project's last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s.[33] The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditures.[34] In _The God Particle_ he wrote, "The history of atomism is one of reductionism – the effort to reduce all the operations of nature to a small number of laws governing a small number of primordial objects" while stressing the importance of the Higgs boson.[35][36]

In 1988, Lederman received the Nobel Prize for Physics along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger "for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino".[37] Lederman also received the National Medal of Science (1965), the Elliott Cresson Medal for Physics (1976), the Wolf Prize for Physics (1982) and the Enrico Fermi Award (1992).[38] In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum "Making History Award" for Distinction in Science Medicine and Technology.[39]


Personal life

Lederman's best friend during his college years, Martin J. Klein, convinced him of "the splendors of physics during a long evening over many beers".[40] He was known for his sense of humor in the physics community.[41] On August 26, 2008 Lederman was video-recorded by a science focused organization called ScienCentral, on the street in a major U.S. city, answering questions from passersby.[42] He answered questions such as "What is the strong force?" and "What happened before the Big Bang?".[43]

Despite his Jewish background, Lederman was an atheist.[44][45] He had three children with his first wife, Florence Gordon, and toward the end of his life lived with his second wife, Ellen (Carr), in Driggs, Idaho.[46][47]

Lederman began to suffer from memory loss in 2011 and, after struggling with medical bills, he had to sell his Nobel medal for $765,000 to cover the costs in 2015.[48] He died of complications from dementia on October 3, 2018, at a care facility in Rexburg, Idaho at the age of 96.[49][50]
