Episodes


Production

The series received a second season renewal in November 2016, with its debut occurring in 2018.[36]

Casting began in 2017, with a bulk of the first season's core cast confirmed to return for the new season throughout the year. Talulah Riley and Louis Herthum, who appeared as Angela and Peter Abernathy, respectively, were upgraded to main cast status in March.[37][38] In July 2017, Katja Herbers, Neil Jackson and Jonathan Tucker were among the new cast members to be announced.[39][40] Gustaf Skarsgård, Fares Fares, and Betty Gabriel joined in August.[41] It was announced in September that Hiroyuki Sanada was cast in a major recurring role.[42] Zahn McClarnon was announced as being cast in November, along with the news he had been injured in an off-set incident, causing a brief pause in the season's filming.[43] An alternate version of the show's Super Bowl LII trailer revealed Peter Mullan had been cast, playing James Delos.[44] An additional trailer in March revealed Rinko Kikuchi was cast as well.[45] The cast was rounded out a few weeks prior to the season's April 22 premiere with Tao Okamoto, Kiki Sukezane and Julia Jones.[46]

Filming began in the summer of 2017. Harris stated in an interview that, to ensure the production remain on schedule, scenes for episodes later in the season would be filmed simultaneously with earlier episodes.[47] Actor Jeffrey Wright noted that many of Bernard's scenes with Anthony Hopkins' character, Dr. Ford, for late-season episodes were filmed first; in contrast to the first season where Wright had some idea of Bernard's arc, he had to make guesses as what the writers had planned out for Bernard in this season, and adjust his acting accordingly.[48] As a result of the December 2017 Southern California wildfires, production was halted once again.[49]


Release

Broadcast

The season premiere debuted on April 16 at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, on April 18 at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival and had many early screenings around the world prior to its April 22 airing.[50][51] Showrunners Nolan and Joy revealed that certain episodes will be "super sized", running longer than the regular 60 minutes per episode from the previous season.[52]

Marketing

During the 2017 San Diego Comic Con, an immersive experience was set up for attendees in addition to a panel held by the producers and cast of the series. The first trailer for the season was aired as well.[53][54] A second, full-length trailer was aired during Super Bowl LII.[55]


Reception

Critical response

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating for the second season, based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 7.98/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "_Westworld_ builds on its experimental first season, diving deeper into the human side of AI without losing any of its stylish, bloody glory." The average rating for individual episodes is 90%.[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[57]

Critics received the first five episodes of this season as screeners before the first episode premiered.[58][59] In a positive review for _San Francisco Chronicle_, David Wiegand wrote, "there is plenty of action and violence in the first half of the season, but what will empower the show's longevity is its metaphysical theme, the exploration of the meaning and definition of human existence."[60] Rob Owen of the _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_ also praised the series, saying, "It takes a bit for _Westworld_ to get back up to full steam, but by episode three (five hours were made available to TV critics), this futuristic, violent drama returns to fine form, introducing new parts of the park (Shogun World!), new characters and apparently new technology goals on the part of Delos, the corporation that owns Westworld."[61] Journalist Lorraine Ali of the _Los Angeles Times_ said, "It's poised to be a intellectually stimulating and emotionally bumpy ride, where the very concept of your existence becomes the stuff of high-brow entertainment and low-bar thrills."[62]

_The New York Times_ TV critic James Poniewozik quipped, "don't expect too much improvement too fast from _Westworld_ 2.0. It's still overly focused on balletic blood baths and narrative fake-outs, and much of the dialogue still sounds as if it were written as a tagline for a subway poster, like Dolores's 'I have one last role to play: myself.' But _Westworld_ remains a glorious production to look at, and there are stretches where it feels invigorated by its new, expanded world—freer to breathe, relax, invent."[63] Ben Travers of _IndieWire_ wrote, "all around, the actors remain strong, including a number of new cast members. Where season 2 stumbles is its structure and pacing. Episodes don't carve equal time for everyone; they focus on the two most connected stories and sometimes break for an entire hour without getting back to a series regular."[64] After the release of the third episode, _Forbes_ criticized the season for departing too far from the show's roots and instead trying to be an "action blockbuster", arguing in part that the violence was overdone in comparison to the first season.[65]

Accolades

_Westworld_ received six nominations and one win at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, nominations included Outstanding Drama Series, Ed Harris and Jeffrey Wright for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, Evan Rachel Wood for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and Jimmi Simpson for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.[66] Thandie Newton won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.[67] For the 76th Golden Globe Awards, Newton was nominated for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[68]
