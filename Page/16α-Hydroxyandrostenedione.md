16Α-HYDROXYANDROSTENEDIONE (16Α-OH-A4), also known as 16Α-HYDROXYANDROST-4-ENE-3,17-DIONE, is an endogenous and naturally occurring steroid and metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of estriol during pregnancy.[1][2][3] It is produced from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is converted into 16α-hydroxy-DHEA sulfate, then desulfated and aromatized into 16α-hydroxyestrone, and finally converted into estriol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.[4][5]
