PARTISAN SORTING or GEOGRAPHIC SORTING is an effect in politics in which voters with specific viewpoints migrate to specific areas, becoming much more concentrated in them than in the wider electorate.[1][2][3] This effect may create or contribute to an effect of polarization, in which separate areas become dominated by political movements much more extreme than might be expected given the "average" political views of voters.

In 2008, _The Economist_ commented that in American politics sorting was making "the culture war more bitter and politics harder."[4]

A 2016 study finds no evidence that partisans move to more politically compatible communities.[5]
