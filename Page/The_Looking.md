_' The Looking_' is the current musical project of American singer, songwriter and producer Todd Carter. Carter has described the band’s music as “indie pop meets Americana”[1] with influences ranging through “opera, punk rock, traditional folk, and psychedelic soul.”

The Looking has recorded three full length records and one EP, beginning with _Tin Can Head_ in 2005 and _Cabinet of Curiosities_ in 2009.[2] Those were followed by 2013’s acclaimed _Songs for a Traveler_, a compendium of Carter’s takes on classic American folk songs and spirituals.[3] The Looking’s latest album (2016’s _Lead me to the Water_) features Andy Hess (formerly of Gov’t Mule and Black Crowes) on bass, Diego Voglino (Marshall Crenshaw) on drums, Steve Elliott (Shooter Jennings) on guitar, Bill Finizio on piano/guitar and Sasha Dobson (Norah Jones) with background vocals.[4] The album is released by Astraea Records.
