The _SIN AFTER SIN TOUR_ was a 1977 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest which was in support of their album _Sin After Sin_. It ran from 22 April until 24 July 1977 venturing through England with a date in Wales plus making their first time visit in the United States.

Fancy drummer Les Binks, an acquaintance of Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, was hired as the band's new member after session drummer Simon Phillips declined to join the band full-time as he had commitments to another band. Binks was able to play double bass and was one of the few drummers who could replicate Phillips' sound live.
