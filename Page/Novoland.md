Geography

Northern Continent

Shang Province (殇州)

The Shang Province is located in the West of the Northern Continent, and the land is mostly occupied by Titans. Shang is bounded on two sides by sea (Huan Sea & _), and to the North is the vast snow-capped mountains of an ice cold continent; on the eastern border is the Han province and the Fire and Thunder Plains. It has an area of 25000km². Shang can be split into three main terrains: Shang Plains in the North, Mangu mountain ranges in the East, and Tianchi mountain ranges in the West. The Mangu mountain ranges are the tallest in the Northern Continent, with an average altitude of over 10000 chi (1 chi = 1/3 metre).

The Central and Eastern areas of Shang are mostly flat, and long periods of erosion have formed many vast and smoothly rolling plains with some small hills scattered throughout. The Western area is a volcanic belt, collectively named the Ice and Fire Earthsea, and has tens of large active volcanoes and many more smaller or dormant volcanoes. Even further West are volcanic island groups located in the Boundless Ocean.

This is a land of ice and fire, and the corresponding climates are changeable too. The Shang Plains have a cold climate, with low temperatures in summer and lots of rain. No matter if it is winter or summer, it can still rain or snow. The plains are not suitable for trees to grow, so shrubs and tundra and plants are the most common vegetation. The South-Western areas have plenty of geothermal energy, visible woody plants make up small forests, and weed meadows grow near hot springs and places protected form the wind. The climate of plains in the Central-Eastern area of Shang is slightly more complicated than the Han province, with mostly coniferous forests and little broadleaf trees. Forest steppes and grasslands are distributed along the Han border.

The Shang Prefecture is ruled by the Giants, long time enemies of the humans.

Han Province (瀚州)

Han is frequently translated as sorrow, spite, rancor, regret, resentment or grief, among many other attempts to explain a concept that has no English equivalent. The Han Province reflects this by being a barren and desolate land with only a small fertile area in the middle. The entrance / exit between the Han Province and Tianqi City of the Zhong Prefecture is protected by a fortress at the Shangyang Pass.

Ning Province (宁州)
