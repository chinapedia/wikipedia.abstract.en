MULTITRACKSTUDIO is a digital audio workstation application for macOS (OS X), Windows and iPad platforms.

It is developed and maintained by a small company (Bremmers Audio Design, The Netherlands) led by Giel Bremmers.

This software can be used for any musical genre and its main key aspect is the simple and original user interface, while enabling powerful and flexible features often not found even in more popular and expensive products.


Features

In spite of its moderate pricing, MultitrackStudio has most of the features of a standard full DAW: audio/MIDI recording, MIDI sequencing, mixing, audio effects, variable time signatures, multi MIDI editing, MIDI streams, automation, control surfaces, remote control, etc. Stock instruments have limited quality, but they can be easily replaced with free or commercial VST and AU plugins. The Mac version also integrates a Soundfont Player.


Versions

The desktop version is available under three options:

-   _Lite_ (free of charge, limited to 3 tracks)
-   _Standard_ (paid, almost all features and no track limit)
-   _Pro_ (paid, with additional advanced features)
