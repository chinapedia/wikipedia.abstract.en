At least six vessels, including two belonging to the British Royal Navy, have borne the name _LITTLE BELT_, a translation from the Danish of _Lillebælt_, the name of the strait that separates Funen from the Danish mainland and that links the Kattegat to the Baltic Sea. The merchant vessels and the second Royal Navy vessel were named to commemorate , which was one of the protagonists in the Little Belt Affair, or perhaps the affair itself.

-   _Little Belt_ was a brig of 173 tons (bm) built in Canada in 1811 that the French frigate _Aréthuse_ captured in January 1813.[1][2]
-   _Little Belt_ was a snow of 133 tons (bm) built at Sunderland in 1813,[3] and wrecked on 28 February 1820 near Cape Palos as she was sailing from Palermo to London.[4]
-   _Little Belt_ was a schooner of six tons (bm), one gun, and a crew of 20 men under the command of Captain David L. Sheffield. She was an American privateer during the War of 1812, commissioned on 10 September 1812 at New York, but seems to have little further trace of her herself or her activities.[5]
-   _Little Belt_ was an American sloop of 18 tons (bm) and 3 men, sailing from New York to Charleston, that destroyed on 26 September 1813 off "the Capes" after taking of her cargo.[6]
