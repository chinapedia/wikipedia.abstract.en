The 2017 WASHINGTON REDSKINS SEASON was the franchise's 86th season in the National Football League and the fourth under head coach Jay Gruden. The Redskins ended the season losing seven of the final 11 games after a 3-2 start, failing to improve on their 8–7–1 record from the previous season, and were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs after losing to the Chargers. This was likely due to the abundance of injuries at key positions and one of the league's toughest schedules.

In Week 2, the Redskins played the Rams in Los Angeles for the first time in 23 years. It was also their first game in the L.A. Coliseum in 28 years. Washington got their first win in the Coliseum in 43 years.

In addition, this was the last of six seasons that quarterback Kirk Cousins was on the roster, as he would join the Minnesota Vikings in the following offseason.
