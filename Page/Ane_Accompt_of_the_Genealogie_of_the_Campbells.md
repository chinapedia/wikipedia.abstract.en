_ANE ACCOMPT OF THE GENEALOGIE OF THE CAMPBELLS_ is a seventeenth-century source documenting the history of Clan Campbell.


Description

The history is preserved in manuscript form in NLS Advocates' MS 32.6.13, 34.5.22.[1] The work appears to date to c. 1670×1676.[2] A transcription of the text was published in 1916.[3]

The history is the work of Raibeart Duncansone, minister of Campbeltown.[4] Raibeart is stated to have been assisted by several sennachies, which could be evidence that members of the MacLachlan learned kindred contributed to the history.[5]

The history seems to have been based upon the now-lost _Colvin's Genealogy of the Campbells_, composed by Alexander Colville in 1650×1660.[6] _Ane Accompt_ was in turn a source for other important Campbell histories, such as the _Craignish History_ (also derived from Colville's now-lost work) and the _Auchinbreck History_.[7]
