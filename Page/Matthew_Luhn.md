MATTHEW LUHN is an American writer, story consultant, animator, creative writing instructor and keynote speaker known for creating stories and characters, most notably at Pixar and The Simpsons.[1]


Career

Luhn attended the character animation program at the California Institute of the Arts, and after his first-year student film, he was offered his first animation job. Dropping out of CalArts, Luhn's career began at 19 years old, as the youngest animator to work on The Simpsons TV series. His work includes Kamp Krusty (1992), Lisa's Pony (1992), Homer Alone (1992), Colonel Homer (1992), Homer Defined (1992), and Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk (1992).[2] Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of CalArts—again—to join Pixar, becoming one of the first 12 animators on the studio's feature, Toy Story.

Alongside his story work in Hollywood, Luhn is also a keynote speaker who trains chief executive officers, marketing teams, directors and other professionals how to craft and tell stories for Fortune 500 companies, Academy Award-winning movies and corporate brands.[3][4][5][6] Matthew also gave a TEDx Talk at the University of California, Santa Barbara.[7][8]

Luhn's "Story Seminars" and "Story for Business Workshops" run in New York City, Los Angeles, London, and other major cities worldwide.[9] [10]

Collaborating with The General Pencil Company, the first pencil factory in the USA, Luhn has created how to draw book and art programs for kids of all ages.[11]
