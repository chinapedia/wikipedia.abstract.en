Reception

Scott Yanow concluded that "_San Francisco_ is a program of subtle music that is quietly infectious."[5] The _JazzTimes_ reviewer commented that "the results are nothing short of splendiferous".[6] Downbeat Magazine's Fred Bouchard wrote in their May 2008 issue: "Brazilian chic has nudged its way for two generations into pop and jazz, but few insinuate as distinctively candid and original an interpretation as does vocalist Fleurine on this samba set. Her tender, personal, smile-through-the-tears lyrics- some in Portuguese, some her translations from Portuguese or original English lyric- come through on this set of pretty, haunting tunes. The Dutch born, Portugal-reared polyglot sounds as fresh and guileless as she did on her slightly more mainstream 1995 debut. Lilting tunes fly feather-light in fittingly bare-bones combos, with fleet cameos by husband Brad Mehldau."
