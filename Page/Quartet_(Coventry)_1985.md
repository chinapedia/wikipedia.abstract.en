_QUARTET (COVENTRY) 1985_ is a live album by composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton recorded in England in 1985, first released in heavily edited and unauthorized form on the West Wind label and later reissued in full and authorized form on the Leo label as a double CD in 1993.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Stewart Mason stated "What makes this two-disc set stand out above the others in the series of live reissues from this tour is that each disc includes a half-hour interview between Braxton and Graham Lock (who also wrote the album's liner notes), an enlightening, free-ranging discussion that covers Braxton's influences, concepts, and techniques".[4]
