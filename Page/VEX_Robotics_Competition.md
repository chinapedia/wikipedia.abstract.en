The VEX ROBOTICS COMPETITION is a robotics competition for elementary through university students. It is a subset of VEX Robotics, which is in turn a subset of Innovation First International. The VEX Robotics World Championship, run by the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation[1] in April 2018 was named the largest robotics competition in the world by Guinness World Records.[2]

There are three divisions of this robotics competition meant for different age groups and skill levels: VEX EDR, VEX U, and VEX IQ. VEX EDR is for middle and high school students, VEX U is for university students, and VEX IQ is for elementary and middle school students only. In the competition, students are given a yearly challenge, and must design, build, program, and drive a robot to complete the challenge as best as they can.

The description and rules for the following season's competition are released during the world championship of the previous year. Since 2015, the VEX robotics World Championship has been held in Louisville, Kentucky each year in mid April.[3]


VEX Robotics Competition (EDR)

VEX EDR is a robotics competition for middle school and high school students with two different divisions: middle school and high school. In this division, aluminum and steel parts are used, and the robots are built using the VEX EDR Design System. Students from Grades 6-12 may participate. Additionally, while the visual code editor is still available, most students take advantage of VEX's RobotC for their programming. At tournaments, teams participate in qualifying matches where two teams vs two teams participate. In the Elimination Rounds, alliances of two teams are selected by the top-seeded teams, and the alliance who wins the finals is the winner of the tournament.[4]

The current challenge is VEX Robotics Competition: Tower Takeover

Rules

Middle and high school students have the same game and rules. The most general and basic rules for VEX EDR are as follows, but each year may have exceptions.[5]

-   Each robot is paired up with one other, and they compete against two other robots. Team colors are red and blue.
-   No robot may exceed the dimensions of an 18" cube until the match has begun.
-   At the start of the match is a 15-second autonomous period, where all four robots navigate the field entirely by themselves.
-   After the autonomous period is the driver control period, which is 1:45 seconds of manual control of the robot through a handheld controller.

Current game: Tower Takeover

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by stacking cubes in goals, and by placing cubes in towers. There are five (5) neutral towers, two (2) alliance towers, twenty two (22) green cubes, twenty two (22) purple cubes, twenty two (22) orange cubes, and four (4) goals.

Cubes can be stacked in goals of your Alliance color, and can also be placed into towers which adds value to the colour of the cube placed. The added value applies for both Alliances. Cubes placed into the towers have no value.

  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  Each Green Cube Scored in a goal    1 point + 1 point for every Green Cube Placed in Towers
  Each Orange Cube Scored in a goal   1 point + 1 point for every Orange Cube Placed in Towers
  Each Purple Cube Scored in a goal   1 point + 1 point for every Purple Cube Placed in Towers
  Autonomous Bonus                    6 points

VEX U

The VEX U level competition is for college and university students. The rules are nearly identical for this division as for the EDR division, but VEX U teams are allowed to take advantage of more customization and greater flexibility than other levels. Also, their robot creation is limited by the need to find effective costs and a restricted development environment in order to model a real-world situation. In addition, in past competitions, Vex U teams needed to create two different complementary robots, one big and one small, and program them to work together to defeat opponent teams.[8]

In the VEX U competition although very similar to VRC EDR competition, has some distinguishable rules to its division. Rather than being limited to an 18" cube, in VEX U you have the availability to go up to a 24" cube. The autonomous period is also extended in competitions to last 45 seconds, where all interaction with robots is strictly prohibited. As a result, the driver control period is shortened to a period of 75 seconds, immediately after the autonomous period.

Starting in the 2016-2017 game Starstruck, rather than having the usual 2-robot vs 2-robot format, VEX U matches would be 1-team vs 1-team. However, this was replaced after the 2017-2018 season In the Zone, and the games since have reverted to the 2-robot vs 2-robot format.[9]


VEX IQ challenge

The VEX IQ Challenge, presented by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, provides elementary and middle school students with exciting, open-ended robotics and research project challenges that enhance their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills through hands-on, student-centered learning. A VEX IQ Robotics set is used, with plastic pieces that snap together using pegs, and it is extremely easy to construct a robot. The students use a graphical software to program the robot. There are two parts to the contests: Robot Skills, which is a single robot trying to score as many points as possible, and the Teamwork Challenge, where two robots attempt to work together to complete the same task.[10]

Current game

THE VEX IQ CHALLENGE - SQUARED AWAY

VEX IQ Challenge Squared Away is played on a 4’x8’ rectangular field.

2012-2013: Rings-N-Things[11]

THE GAME:

VEX Rings-n-Things is played on a 4 ft x 8 ft field, surrounded by a 3 1/2 inch tall perimeter. There are four goals and eight rings into which teams can score thirty-six balls. The field is divided by the ramp.

THE DETAILS:

While participating in the VEX Pilot Program – Rings-n-Things, teams will develop many new skills in response to the challenges and obstacles that stand before them. Some problems will be solved by individuals, while others will be handled through interaction with their student teammates and adult members. Teams will work together to build a VEX robot to compete in the World Championship of VEX Robotics. Students come away not only with the accomplishments of building their own competition robot, but also with an appreciation of science and technology and how they might use it to positively impact the world around them. In addition, they cultivate life skills such as planning, brainstorming, collaboration, teamwork, and leadership as well as research and technical skills.

The VEX Robotics World Championship brings together qualifying teams from the three VEX Robotics programs; the VEX IQ Challenge (elementary and middle school), VEX Robotics Competition (middle school and high school), and VEX U (college), for a celebration of the robotics community and to crown World Champions. The event has been held in Louisville Kentucky since April 2014.

A one-hour special version of the 2016 VEX Robotics World Championship aired on ESPN2 in June 2016.[12] CBS aired a one-hour special version of the 2017 VEX Robotics World Championship on June 11.[13]

During the VEX Robotics World Championship, a "Parade of Nations" is held in Freedom Hall that includes hundreds of students from more than 30 countries. The students wear costumes from such as Star Wars characters, Iron Man, starfish, etc.[14]


Role in pedagogy

VEX Robotics Competitions have been of interest to educators as a way of stimulating students' interest in hands-on learning. The Department of Engineering and Technology Education at Utah State University has created a Design Academy with a curriculum for teaching skills through participation in a VEX Robotics Competition.[15]
