Education and career

He was born in the district Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan and studied Archeology at University of Peshawar,and then obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge.[5] Dr. Ihsan worked for the University of Peshawar in various positions from 1981 to 2002[6] where he was primarily a Professor in the Archaeology Department. Ali has delivered lectures in various universities of the world including New York, Pennsylvania, Harvard, Boston, Ohio and California State University in the United States, Cambridge, Leicester, Southampton, Sheffield and Glasgow Universities in the UK, and ULM University in Germany. He has published more than 63 research papers and edited 17 different volumes of journals in archaeology, for the University of Peshawar, Peshawar Museum and Hazara University.[7] After being the Chair of Archaeology, University of Peshawar, for three years (1997–2000), he was appointed as Director Archaeology & Museums, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2002, and during his tenure, he established six museums and started a new Journal, _Frontier Archaeology_.[8] In 2008, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assigned him the task of establishing Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, with nine campuses, three of which have now attained the status of independent universities (Bacha Khan University Charsadda, University of Swabi[9] and University of Buner).


Legal charges

In October 2016, Ali was indicted by a court over alleged illegal appointments at AWKUM. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) claims that Ali was involved in the illegal appointment of 652 staff to the university. It was also reported that the NAB had investigated Ali and others for issuing illegal scholarships and misusing university funds. In July 2016, the Peshawar High Court had directed Ali to co-operate with the investigation, rather than allow the NAB to arrest him. The NAB executive board sanctioned an inquiry into Ali and several other AWKUM officials in May 2015. He was arrested on 15 September 2015 and granted bail on 23 September. Ali denied the charges against him.[10][11] In January 2018, he was indicted by an accountability court along with five other AWKUM officials, for the alleged illegal appointment of 652 staff members.[12]
