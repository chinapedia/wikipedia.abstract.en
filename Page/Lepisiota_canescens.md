_LEPISIOTA CANESCENS_ is a species of ant in the subfamily Formicinae. Supercolonies spanning as much as 38 kilometres have been found. Scientists believe that this ant species has the potential of spreading all over the world and posing threats to other ants.[1]

_Lepisiota canescens_, from the genus _Lepisiota_, is a species of ant native to southern Ethiopia. The supercolonies were first discovered by a team of myrmecologists from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. D Magdalena Sorger, a member of the team, has stated that the discovery of these species is significant for two (and now various) reasons. First, cases of finding super colonies are extremely rare, with only around 20 worldwide species having the ability to do so. And second, other species in the genus _Lepisiota_ have recently made worrisome headlines all around the world. What is even more frightening about this fact, is that _L. canescens_ is now far more invasive and destructive than its southern and western African counterparts _L capensis_ and _L. angolensis_. The species can now be found in 25 different countries apart from Ethiopia. _L. canescens_ has even been able to grab a ride on a cargo ship, and are now found evenly invasively distributed throughout Madagascar.


Impact

The species has mainly been spread by humans. In its introduced range, _L. canescens_ will most probably displace at least one other ant species native to the region. In Ethiopia alone, several species of _Pheidole_ have been adversely affected by the invasive appearances of _L. canescens_.
