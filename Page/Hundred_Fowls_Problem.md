The HUNDRED FOWLS PROBLEM is a problem first discussed in the fifth century CE Chinese mathematics text _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ (The Mathematical Classic of Zhang Qiujian), a book of mathematical problems written by Zhang Qiujian. It is one of the best known examples of indeterminate problems in the early history of mathematics.[1] The problem appears as the final problem in _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ (Problem 38 in Chapter 3). However, the problem and its variants have appeared in the medieval mathematical literature of India, Europe and the Arab world.[2]

The name "Hundred Fowls Problem" is due to the Belgian historian Louis van Hee.[3]


Problem statement

The Hundred Fowls Problem as presented in _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ can be translated as follows:[4]

    "Now one cock is worth 5 qian, one hen 3 qian and 3 chicks 1 qian. It is required to buy 100 fowls with 100 qian. In each case, find the number of cocks, hens and chicks bought."


Mathematical formulation

Let _x_ be the number of cocks, _y_ be the number of hens, and _z_ be the number of chicks, then the problem is to find _x_, _y_ and _z_ satisfying the following equations:

    _x_ + _y_ +_z_ = 100
    5_x_ + 3_y_ + _z_/3 = 100

Obviously, only non-negative integer values are acceptable. Expressing _y_ and _z_ in terms of _x_ we get

    _y_ = 25 − (7/4)_x_
    _z_ = 75 + (3/4)_x_

Since _x_, _y_ and _z_ all must be integers, the expression for _y_ suggests that _x_ must be a multiple of 4. Hence the general solution of the system of equations can be expressed using an integer parameter _t_ as follows:[5]

    _x_ = 4_t_
    _y_ = 25 − 7_t_
    _z_ = 75 + 3_t_

Since _y_ should be a non-negative integer, the only possible values of _t_ are 0, 1, 2 and 3. So the complete set of solutions is given by

    (_x_,_y_,_z_) = (0,25,75), (4,18,78), (8,11,81), (12,4,84).

of which the last three have been given in _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_.[6] However, no general method for solving such problems has been indicated, leading to a suspicion of whether the solutions have been obtained by trial and error.[7]

The Hundred Fowls Problem found in _Zhang Qiujian suanjing_ is a special case of the general problem of finding integer solutions of the following system of equations:

    _x_ + _y_ + _z_ = _d_
    _ax_ + _by_ + _cz_ = _d_

Any problem of this type is sometime referred to as "Hundred Fowls problem".[8]


Variations

Some variants of the Hundred Fowls Problem have appeared in the mathematical literature of several cultures.[9][10] In the following we present a few sample problems discussed in these cultures.

Indian mathematics

Mahavira's _Ganita-sara-sangraha_ contains the following problem:

    Pigeons are sold at the rate of 5 for 3, sarasa-birds at the rate of 7 for 5, swans at the rate of 9 for 7, and peacocks at the rate of 3 for 9 (_pana_s). A certain man was told to bring 100 birds for 100 _pana_s. What does he give for each of the various kinds of birds he buys?

The Bakshali manuscript gives the problem of solving the following equations:

    _x_ + _y_ + _z_ = 20
    3_x_ + (3/2)_y_ + (1/2)_z_ = 20

Medieval Europe

The English mathematician Alcuin of York (6th century) has stated seven problems similar to the Hundred Fowls Problem in his _Propositiones ad acuendos iuvenes_. Here is a typical problem:

    If 100 bushels of corn be distributed among 100 people such that each man gets 3 bushels, each woman 2 bushels and each child half a bushel, then how many men, women and children were there?

Arabian mathematics

Abu Kamil (850 - 930 CE) considered non-negative integer solutions of the following equations:

    _x_ + _y_ + _z_ = 100
    3_x_ + (/20)_y_+ (1/3)_z_ = 100.
