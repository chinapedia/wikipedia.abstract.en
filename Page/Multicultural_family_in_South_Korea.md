A MULTICULTURAL FAMILY IN SOUTH KOREA is a family that made up of people without a background in Korean culture. As the number of multicultural families increased in Korean society, the number of children in multicultural families also increased. New policies have been created to respond to the problems faced by children of multicultural families.


Definition

Policies designed ot support multicultural families in South Korea are aimed at families with people who have acquired South Korean nationality. It can be defined as a family type where two cultures coexist in one family through international marriage, but also includes the families of foreign workers, North Korean refugee families, and ethnic Korean families moving to Korea.

The first category, international marriage families, refers to a family consisting of a married Korean citizen and a foreign spouse. The second category, the families of foreign workers, includes those that foreign workers bring with them to Korea or new families formed by foreign workers in Korea. Most of those families include children. The third category, North Korean refugee families, is composed of residents from North Korea with the official registration. These people have left North Korean society with various motives. In some cases, refugees escape North Korea with their family members, but policies are also designed for those who start a new family in South Korea. The final category includes ethnic-Korean families who were born and raised in China or Russia with a unique Korean culture, and settled in South Korea for the purpose of immigration, employment while their ancestors left Korea with various background.[1]

Children of multicultural families are defined as children born between spouses of Koreans and foreign residents with different cultural background. At first, children of multicultural families were called _Kosian_ or mixed-blood. Later, people started to use value-neutral term 'international marriage children' or 'children of international marriage immigrants'. More recently, people began to use the term 'children of multicultural families'.[2]

Classification of children

Children of international marriage immigrants

First, there are children of international marriage immigrants. Those are a children who one of their parents have Korean nationality and another parent have foreign nationality. Second, there are children of foreign worker's families. Immigrant worker bring their children over Korea or birth their children in Korea. Most of them have their own country's nationality, live in Korea as foreign. They cannot receive support based on Multicultural families supporting policy. It is a service for multicultural family to adapt to Korea and to support economical self-reliance. But the number of them has been increased and some of them acquired Korea nationality. Third, children of North Korean refugee family called 'saeteomin' as a defector. They acquire Korea nationality through naturalization. They have cultural problem because South Korea and North Korea have been formed different culture after the division of Korea into north and south.[3] _What kind of cultural problems? Examples please._

Immigrant Youth

Immigrant Youth is an adolescents who come to Korea after growing in their own country because of their parent's remarriage with Korean or a children of International marriage families who come to Korea after growing in one of their parents country in adolescence. In other words, Immigrant youth is school age teenagers who have foreign nationality, and children who settle down to Korea in the middle of growing in their mother country. They are different with children of multicultural family who have Korean nationality, and who learn and use Korean language since birth in aspects of nationality. In perspective of law of multicultural family, immigrant youth is just ‘foreigner’, so that immigrant youth cannot be subject to the law about multicultural family.[4]

Bi-racial children in Korea

To be a bi-racial child in Korea means life begins as a minority. Traditionally South Korea is regarded as a country with a single ethnicity so mixing races is not something that traditionally has been supported.  However, there has been an increasing number of children of mixed race due to the number of marriages between women from other countries and Korean men. Research using data from stories of 56 youth between the ages of 9 and 17, has shown that children born of mixed race are not seen as ‘pure’ and not accepted as Koreans but they are classed an ‘in-between Korean and foreigner.’Lee, C. S. (n.d.). Narratives of ‘mixed race’ youth in South Korea: racial order and in-betweenness. Asian Ethnicity, 18(4), 522–542. https://doi-rg.ezproxy.umuc.edu/10.1080/

Skin color seems to play a large part in the discussion and there is a ‘color-coding hierarchy’ that has a lot to do with how Koreans view race and color. Koreans who have whiter skin are given a higher value than those with yellow skin and those with dark brown and black skin tones are placed lower in value. This is directly linked to the Korean War where some African-American soldiers abandoned babies born to Korean women who were prostitutes or came from poor backgrounds. The children ended up being called names such as ‘darky’ or ‘blacky’ and have a hard time being accepted. There is also an, ‘origin-coding hierarchy’ and the origin and economic position of the parent becomes a factor. Korean society discriminates against those mixed-race people who are from developing countries. Regardless of whether or not the children or the parents have lived in Korea all their lives and speak fluent Korean, their monoracial peers do not allow them to be fully integrated as ‘Korean.’ Lee, C. S. (n.d.). Narratives of ‘mixed race’ youth in South Korea: racial order and in-betweenness. Asian Ethnicity, 18(4), 522–542. https://doi-rg.ezproxy.umuc.edu/10.1080/

In Korea, one drop of ‘different’ blood does not assign them to a particular race, as it does in America, it assigns them instead as ‘foreigners’ – and this is always understood to mean not fully Korean. As a result, children find themselves having to choose between cultures while still never being accepted as fully Korean Lee, C. S. (n.d.).

Pittsburg Steelers receiver Hines Ward knows this dilemma all too well. In an article titled “The Long Way Home” he describes what it felt like to have a Korean mother and an African- American father. He describes feeling like an outcast in both black and Asian-American communities even though not living in Korea. Mixed-race children in Korea say that classmates and even some teachers bully and harass them. Ward’s mother reveals that this was the reason she could not return to Korea with her son.[5]

Pearl S. Buck International is one organization that works on behalf of mixed-race children in Korea. In a survey, it revealed that mixed-race Korean children withdrew from elementary school at 9.4 % while Korean children had a zero % rate.Kim Jae-young.

There has been recently a push by the provincial government to better educate residents about multi-ethnic families. Local authorities are attempting to integrate foreign residents through free Korean language schools (Kim, 2006). Because of Korea’s monoethnic population, this new phenomenon of multiculturalism is a very important issue facing the society.Lee, C. S. (n.d.).
