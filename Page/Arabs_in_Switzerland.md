ARABS IN SWITZERLAND () are Swiss citizens or residents of Arab ethnic, cultural and linguistic heritage from Arab countries, particularly Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Egypt, also small groups from Palestine, Yemen, Libya, Jordan and Sudan, who emigrated from their native nations and currently reside in Switzerland.


History

In the 10th century, Arabs from their Mediterranean Fraxinet base settled in the Valais for a few decades. They occupied the Great St. Bernard Pass and even managed to reach as far as St. Gallen to the north and Raetia in the east.[1]

The influx of Arab immigrants from various Arab countries since the early years of the twentieth century, most Arabs came to study, work or residence in Switzerland.[2]


Demographics

Swiss people of Arab origin (predominantly from Maghreb but also some from Mashreq areas of the Arab world) in Switzerland. There are no official figures concerning the demographics of Swiss people of Arab descent.

Maghreb

The number of nearly 18,000 people by the end of the first decade became nationals of Arab Maghreb countries, make up 1% of the total foreign population in Switzerland. However, the presence and impact of this demographic in the public arena Swiss far greater than the actual number, according to a scientific study done by a comprehensive forum for Immigration Studies at the University of Neuchatel, commissioned by the State Secretariat for Migration, Switzerland.[3]

By the end of 2010, Switzerland was hosting on its territory, especially in the big cities and in the French-speaking cantons, nearly all 18,000 permanent resident of the three Arab Maghreb countries distributed as follows: Morocco (7469), Tunisia (6418), Algeria (3822). The following chart shows the evolution of the number of permanent residents of the Maghrebis in Switzerland, according to their countries of origin in the period between 1981 and 2010.

Maghrebis are stationed in the Romandy. 64% of Algerians, 67% of Moroccans and 56% of Tunisians living in the French-speaking cantons, more than half of Moroccans and Algerians divided between the Canton of Geneva and Canton of Vaud, but this phenomenon is less severe for Tunisians where we find about 30% of them in the German-speaking cantons, especially in major cities.[4]

The core index, which is used in Switzerland to distinguish between immigrant groups is the type of residence permit: There is a permanent residence (statement of class B and C), and temporary or seasonal residence (of class G, F, N and S). the report indicates that migrants Moroccans, Tunisians and Algerians have witnessed remarkable transformation since 1994, from temporary accommodation to permanent residency, after allowing for specific legal immigrants to apply for Swiss citizenship. For example, in 2009, 90% of Moroccans and Tunisians immigrants holders of residence permits of class B and C, while it was 70% for the Algerians in 2000.[5] The largest group of residents of North African origin are from Morocco.[6]
