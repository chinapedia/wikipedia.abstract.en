WORD ON FIRE is a Catholic media organization that uses digital and traditional media to introduce Catholicism to the broader world, founded by bishop Robert Barron.[1] Word on Fire rose to prominence through Barron's work as a priest that engages with new media, and has been noted as an effective model for sharing information about Catholicism to the public.[2]


Media formats

Initially Barron worked through radio, and television, hosting the _Word on Fire_ radio show on Relevant Radio and the _Word on Fire with Father Barron_ television show on WGN America. Barron eventually expanded to online distribution through social media, and is active with distributing videos on YouTube.[3] In addition to this, Word on Fire distributes spiritual media as DVDs and books for individual and group study.


_Catholicism_ series (2011)

In 2011, Word on Fire published _Catholicism_, a ten-part video documentary series that explores the cultural, spiritual, and historical elements of Catholicism.[4] Offered on DVD, the series was also broadcast on PBS, prompting PBS's ombudsmen to issue a statement clarifying to the public that it was not produced using PBS funding, which some viewers having expressed that as a concern.[5]
