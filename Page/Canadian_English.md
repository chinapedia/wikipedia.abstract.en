CANADIAN ENGLISH (CANE, CE, EN-CA)[1] is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%).[2] A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language.[3] 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.[4]

Canadian English contains major elements of both British English and American English, as well as many uniquely Canadian characteristics.[5] While, broadly speaking, Canadian English tends to be closest to American English in terms of linguistic distance,[6][7] the precise influence of American English, British English and other sources on Canadian English varieties has been the ongoing focus of systematic studies since the 1950s.[8]

Phonologically, Canadian and American English are classified together as North American English, emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of outsiders, even other native English speakers, cannot distinguish the typical accents of the two countries by sound alone. There are minor disagreements over the degree to which even Canadians and Americans themselves can differentiate their own two accents,[9][10] and there is even evidence that some Western American English (Pacific Northwest and California English, for example) is undergoing a vowel shift partially coinciding with the one first reported in mainland Canadian English in the early 1990s.[11]


History

The term "Canadian English" is first attested in a speech by the Reverend A. Constable Geikie in an address to the Canadian Institute in 1857 (see DCHP-1 Online, s.v "Canadian English", Avis et al. 1967[12]). Geikie, a Scottish-born Canadian, reflected the Anglocentric attitude that would be prevalent in Canada for the next hundred years when he referred to the language as "a corrupt dialect", in comparison with what he considered the proper English spoken by immigrants from Britain.[13]

Canadian English is the product of five waves of immigration and settlement over a period of more than two centuries.[14] The first large wave of permanent English-speaking settlement in Canada, and linguistically the most important, was the influx of Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution, chiefly from the Mid-Atlantic States – as such, Canadian English is believed by some scholars to have derived from northern American English.[15][16] Canadian English has been developing features of its own since the early 19th century.[17][18] The second wave from Britain and Ireland was encouraged to settle in Canada after the War of 1812 by the governors of Canada, who were worried about American dominance and influence among its citizens. Further waves of immigration from around the globe peaked in 1910, 1960 and at the present time had a lesser influence, but they did make Canada a multicultural country, ready to accept linguistic change from around the world during the current period of globalization.[19]

The languages of Aboriginal peoples in Canada started to influence European languages used in Canada even before widespread settlement took place,[20] and the French of Lower Canada provided vocabulary, with words such as _toque_ and _portage_,[21] to the English of Upper Canada.[22]

While the process of the making of Canadian English - its documentation and codification - goes back to the 1930s,[23] the 1960s were the key period.[24] Like other social developments in Canada, the general acceptance of Canadian English has taken its time. According to a recent study, a noticeable shift in public discourse can only be seen in the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when Canadian English was seen as a "given", generally accepted default variety, while before such statements were usually "balanced" by doubts.[25]


Historical linguistics

Studies on earlier forms of English in Canada are rare, yet connections with other work to historical linguistics can be forged. An overview of diachronic work on Canadian English, or diachronically-relevant work, is Dollinger (2012, updated to 2017).[26] Until the 2000s, basically all commentators on the history of CanE have argued from the "language-external" history, i.e. social and political history (e.g.,[27][28]). An exception has been in the area of lexis, where Avis et al's (1967) _Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles_, offered real-time historical data through its quotations. Recently, historical linguists have started to study earlier Canadian English on historical linguistic data. DCHP-1 is now available in open access.[29] Most notably, Dollinger (2008) pioneered the historical corpus linguistic approach for English in Canada with CONTE (Corpus of Early Ontario English, 1776–1849) and offers a developmental scenario for 18th- and 19th-century Ontario. Recently, Reuter (2015),[30] with a 19th-century newspaper corpus from Ontario, has confirmed the scenario laid out in Dollinger (2008).Removed

Historically, Canadian English included a class-based sociolect known as CANADIAN DAINTY.[31] Treated as a marker of upper-class prestige in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th, Canadian dainty was marked by the use of some features of British English pronunciation, resulting in an accent similar to the Mid-Atlantic accent known in the United States.[32] This accent faded in prominence following World War II, when it became stigmatized as pretentious, and is now almost never heard in contemporary Canadian life outside of archival recordings used in film, television or radio documentaries.[33]


Spelling tendencies

Canadian spelling of the English language combines British and American conventions, the two dominant varieties, and adds some domestic idiosyncrasies. Spelling in Canadian English co-varies with regional and social variables, somewhat more so, perhaps, than in the two dominant varieties of English, yet general trends have emerged since the 1970s.[34] International_English_Spelling.png

-   Words such as _realIZE_ and _paralYZE_ are usually spelled with _-ize_ or _-yze_ rather than _-ise_ or _-yse_. (The etymological convention that verbs derived from Greek roots are spelled with -ize and those from Latin with -ise is preserved in that practice.[35])
-   French-derived words that in American English end with _-or_ and _-er_, such as _colOR_ or _centER_, often retain British spellings (_colOUR_ and _centRE_).
-   While the United States uses the Anglo-French spelling _defenSE_ and _offenSE_ (noun), most Canadians use the British spellings _defenCE_ and _offenCE_. (But _defenSIVE_ and _offenSIVE_ are universal across all forms of English.)
-   Some nouns, as in British English, take _-ice_ while matching verbs take _-ise_ – for example, _practICE_ and _licenCE_ are nouns while _practISE_ and _licenSE_ are the respective corresponding verbs. (But _advICE_ and _advISE_ are universal.)
-   Canadian spelling sometimes retains the British practice of doubling consonants when adding suffixes to words even when the final syllable (before the suffix) is not stressed. Compare Canadian (and British) _traveLLed_, _counseLLing_, and _marveLLous_ (more often than not in Canadian while always doubled in British) to American _traveLed, counseLing,_ and _marveLous_. In American English, such consonants are only doubled when stressed; thus, for instance, _controLLable_ and _enthraLLing_ are universal. (Both Canadian and British English use _balloTed_ and _profiTing_.[36])
-   In other cases, Canadian and American usage differs from British spelling, such as in the case of nouns like _curb_, _tire_, and _aluminum_,[37] which in British English are spelled _kerb_, _tyre_, and _aluminium_

Canadian spelling conventions can be partly explained by Canada's trade history. For instance, the British spelling of the word _cheque_ probably relates to Canada's once-important ties to British financial institutions. Canada's automobile industry, on the other hand, has been dominated by American firms from its inception, explaining why Canadians use the American spelling of _tire_ (hence, "Canadian Tire") and American terminology for automobiles and their parts (for example, _truck_ instead of _lorry_, _gasoline_ instead of _petrol_, _trunk_ instead of _boot_).[38]

Canada's political history has also had an influence on Canadian spelling. Canada's first prime minister, John A. Macdonald, once advised the Governor General of Canada to issue an order-in-council directing that government papers be written in the British style.[39]

A contemporary reference for formal Canadian spelling is the spelling used for Hansard transcripts of the Parliament of Canada . Many Canadian editors, though, use the _Canadian Oxford Dictionary_, often along with the chapter on spelling in _Editing Canadian English_, and, where necessary (depending on context), one or more other references.

Throughout part of the 20th century, some Canadian newspapers adopted American spellings,[40] for example, _color_ as opposed to the British-based _colour_. Some of the most substantial historical spelling data can be found in Dollinger (2010)[41] and Grue (2013).[42] The use of such spellings was the long-standing practice of the Canadian Press perhaps since that news agency's inception, but visibly the norm prior to World War II.[43] The practice of dropping the letter _u_ in such words was also considered a labour-saving technique during the early days of printing in which movable type was set manually.[44] Canadian newspapers also received much of their international content from American press agencies, therefore it was much easier for editorial staff to leave the spellings from the wire services as provided.[45]

In the 1990s, Canadian newspapers began to adopt the British spelling variants such as _-our_ endings, notably with _The Globe and Mail_ changing its spelling policy in October 1990.[46] Other Canadian newspapers adopted similar changes later that decade, such as the Southam newspaper chain's conversion in September 1998.[47] The _Toronto Star_ adopted this new spelling policy in September 1997 after that publication's ombudsman discounted the issue earlier in 1997.[48][49] The _Star_ had always avoided using recognized Canadian spelling, citing the _Gage Canadian Dictionary_ in their defence. Controversy around this issue was frequent. When the _Gage Dictionary_ finally adopted standard Canadian spelling, the _Star_ followed suit. Some publishers, e.g. _Maclean's_, continue to prefer American spellings.


Dictionaries

The first Canadian dictionaries of Canadian English were edited by Walter Spencer Avis and published by Gage Ltd. The _Beginner's Dictionary_ (1962), the _Intermediate Dictionary_ (1964) and, finally, the _Senior Dictionary_ (1967) were milestones in Canadian English lexicography. In November 1967 A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles (DCHP) was published and completed the first edition of Gage Publishing's Dictionary of Canadian English Series. The DCHP documents the historical development of Canadian English words that can be classified as "Canadianisms". It therefore includes words such as mukluk, Canuck, and bluff, but does not list common core words such as desk, table or car. Many secondary schools in Canada use the graded dictionaries. The dictionaries have regularly been updated since: the _Senior Dictionary_ was renamed _Gage Canadian Dictionary_. Its fifth edition was printed beginning in 1997. Gage was acquired by Thomson Nelson around 2003. The latest editions were published in 2009 by HarperCollins. On 17 March 2017 a second edition of DCHP, the online Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles 2 (DCHP-2) was published. DCHP-2 incorporates the c. 10,000 lexemes from DCHP-1 and adds c. 1300 novel meanings or 1002 lexemes to the documented lexicon of Canadian English.

In 1997, the _ITP Nelson Dictionary of the Canadian English Language_ was another product, but has not been updated since.

In 1998, Oxford University Press produced a Canadian English dictionary, after five years of lexicographical research, entitled _The Oxford Canadian Dictionary_. A second edition, retitled _The Canadian Oxford Dictionary_, was published in 2004. Just as the older dictionaries it includes uniquely Canadian words and words borrowed from other languages, and surveyed spellings, such as whether _colour_ or _color_ was the more popular choice in common use. Paperback and concise versions (2005, 2006), with minor updates, are available.


Phonology and phonetics

In terms of the major sound systems (phonologies) of English around the world, Canadian English aligns most closely to American English, both being grouped together under a common North American English sound system; the mainstream Canadian accent ("Standard Canadian") is often compared to the very similar and largely overlapping "General American" accent, an accent widely spoken throughout the United States and perceived there as being relatively lacking in any noticeable regional features.

The provinces east of Ontario show the largest dialect diversity. Northern Canada is, according to William Labov, a dialect region in formation, and a homogeneous dialect has not yet formed.[50] A very homogeneous dialect exists in Western and Central Canada, a situation that is similar to that of the Western United States. Labov identifies an inland region that concentrates all of the defining features of the dialect centred on the Prairies, with periphery areas with more variable patterns including the metropolitan areas of Vancouver and Toronto.[51] This dialect forms a dialect continuum with the far Western U.S. English, however it is sharply differentiated from the Inland Northern U.S. English of the central and eastern Great Lakes region.

Canadian English raises the diphthong onsets, /ə, ʌ/ before voiceless segments; diphthongs /ai/ and /au/.[52]

Standard Canadian English

Standard Canadian English is socially defined. It is the variety spoken, in Chamber's (1998: 252) definition, by Anglophone or multilingual residents, who are second generation or later (i.e. born in Canada) and who live in urban settings.[53] Applying this definition, c. 36% of the Canadian population speak Standard Canadian English in the 2006 population, with 38% in the 2011 census.[54] Canadian Shift encompasses an area from Montreal to Vancouver and can be distinguished by the merger of /ɛ/ and /æ/ before /r/, the fronted /ɑːr/, and a nasal /æ/.[55] Canadian English has undergone grammaticalization including with general extenders (GEs) which serve to attach words to form connections between subjects.[56] Example: I washed my car _and stuff_ down the street at Ted's Car Wash.

Regional variation

The literature has for a long time conflated the notions of Standard Canadian English (StCE) and regional variation. While some regional dialects are close with the StCE, they are not identical with it. To the untrained ear, for instance, a BC middle class speaker from a rural setting may sound like a StCE speaker, while, given Chambers' definition, such person, because of the rural provenance, would not be included in the accepted definition (see the previous section). The _Atlas of North American English,_ while being the best source for US regional variation, is not a good source for Canadian regional variation, as its analysis is based on only 33[57] Canadian speakers. Boberg's (2005, 2008) studies offer the best data for the delimitation of dialect zones. The results for vocabulary (Boberg 2005[58]) and phonetics (Boberg 2008[59]) overlap to a great extent, which has allowed the proposal of dialect zones. Dollinger and Clarke (2012: 459, Table 1), which distinguishes between:

-   West (BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba; with BC a sub zone on the lexical level)
-   Ontario (with Northwestern Ontario a transition zone with the West)
-   Quebec (concerning the c. 500,000 Anglophone speakers in the province, not the francophone speakers of English)
-   Maritimes (PEI, NS, NB, with PEI a subgroup on the lexical level)
-   Newfoundland (after Dollinger and Clarke 2012: 459)[60]

British Columbia

British Columbia English shares dialect features with both Standard Canadian English and the American Pacific Northwest English. In Vancouver, speakers exhibit more vowel retraction of before nasals than people from Toronto, and this retraction may become a regional marker of West Coast English.[61] /aeg/ raising (found words such as bag, vague and bagel), a prominent feature in western American speakers, is also found in Vancouver speakers.[62] Canadian raising (found in words such as "about" and "writer") is less prominent in BC than other parts of the country and is on the decline further, with many speakers not raising before voiceless consonants. Younger speakers in the Greater Vancouver area do not even raise , causing "about" to sound somewhat like "a boat". The "o" in such words as _holy, goal, load, know,_ etc. is pronounced as a back and rounded , but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there is a strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influence.

Ontario

Canadian raising is quite strong throughout the province of Ontario, except within the Ottawa Valley. The Canadian Shift is also a common vowel shift found in Ontario. The retraction of was found to be more advanced for women in Ontario than for people from the Prairies or Atlantic Canada and men.[63]

In Southwestern Ontario (roughly in the line south from Sarnia to St. Catharines), despite the existence of the many characteristics of West/Central Canadian English, many speakers, especially those under 30 speak a dialect which is influenced by the Inland Northern American English dialect found on much of the American regions adjacent to the Great Lakes, though there are minor differences such as Canadian raising (listen to "ice" vs "my"). Additionally, there is a tendency to round the mouth after pronouncing the vowel "o" which is distinct from the General American Accent. Also, the vowel of "bag" sounds closer to "vague" or "egg"; "right" sounds like "rate"; and the "ah" vowel in "can't" is drawn out, sounding like "kee-ant".

The subregion of Midwestern Ontario consists of the Counties of Huron, Bruce, Grey, and Perth. The "Queen's Bush" as the area was called, did not experience communication with Southwestern and Central dialects until the early 20th century. Thus, a strong accent similar to Central Ontarian is heard, yet many different phrasings exist. It is typical in the area to drop phonetic sounds to make shorter contractions, such as: Prolly (Probably), Goin' (Going), and "Wuts goin' on tonight? D'ya wanna do sumthin'?" It is particularly strong in the County of Bruce, so much that it is commonly referred to as being the Bruce Cownian (Bruce Countian) accent. Also 'er' sounds are often pronounced 'air', with "were" sounding more like "wear".

Residents of the Golden Horseshoe (including the Greater Toronto Area) are known to [[intervocalic_alveolar_flapping|merge the second English|access-date=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305142751/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/proctor%7Carchive-date=5 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}

Successive years of school are usually referred to as _grade one_, _grade two_, and so on. In Quebec, the speaker (if Francophone) will often say _primary one_, _primary two_ (a direct translation from the French), and so on; while Anglophones will say _grade one_, _grade two_. (Compare American _first grade, second grade_ (sporadically found in Canada), and English/Welsh _Year 1, Year 2_, Scottish/Nth.Irish _Primary 1, Primary 2_ or _P1, P2_, and Sth.Irish _First Class, Second Class_ and so on.).[64] The year of school before grade 1 is usually called "Kindergarten", with the exception of Nova Scotia, where it is called "grade primary".

In the U.S., the four years of high school are termed the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years (terms also used for college years); in Canada, the specific levels are used instead (i.e., "grade nine").[65] As for higher education, only the term _freshman_ (often reduced to _frosh_) has some currency in Canada.[66] The American usages "sophomore", "junior" and "senior" are not used in Canadian university terminology, or in speech. The specific high-school grades and university years are therefore stated and individualized; for example, _the grade 12s failed to graduate_; _John is in his second year at McMaster_. The "first year", "third year" designation also applies to Canadian law school students, as opposed to the common American usage of "1L", "2L" and "3L".

Canadian students use the term _marks_ (more common in England) or _grades_ (more common in the US) to refer to their results; usage is very mixed.[67]

Units of measurement

Unlike in the United States, use of metric units within a majority of industries (but not all) is standard in Canada, as a result of the national adoption of the metric system during the mid-to-late 1970s; this has spawned some colloquial usages such as _klick_ for kilometre (as also heard in the U.S. military). Nonetheless, Imperial units are still used in many situations. For example, English Canadians state their weight and height in pounds and feet/inches, respectively. This is also the case for many Quebec Francophones. Distances while playing golf are always marked and discussed in yards, though official scorecards may also show metres. Temperatures for cooking are often given in Fahrenheit, while the weather is given in Celsius. Directions in the Prairie provinces are sometimes given using miles, because the country roads generally follow the mile-based grid of the Dominion Land Survey. Canadians measure property, both residential and commercial, in square feet exclusively. Fuel efficiency is less frequently discussed in miles per gallon, more often the metric L/100 km. The Letter paper size of 8.5 inches × 11 inches is used instead of the international and metric A4 size of 210 mm × 297 mm.

Transportation

-   Although Canadian lexicon features both _railway_ and _railroad_, _railway_ is the usual term in naming (witness Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway), though _railroad_ can be heard fairly frequently in some regions; most rail terminology in Canada, however, follows American usage (for example, _ties_ and _cars_ rather than _sleepers_ and _carriages_).
-   A two-way ticket can be either a _round-trip_ (American term) or a _return_ (British term).
-   The terms _highway_ (for example, Trans-Canada Highway), _expressway_ (Central Canada, as in the Gardiner Expressway) and _freeway_ (Sherwood Park Freeway, Edmonton) are often used to describe various high speed roads with varying levels of access control. Generally, but not exclusively, _highway_ refers to any provincially funded road regardless of its access control. Often such roads will be numbered. Similar to the US, the terms _expressway_ and _freeway_ are often used interchangeably to refer to controlled-access highways, that is, divided highways with access only at grade-separated interchanges (for example, a 400-Series Highway in Ontario).

However, _expressway_ may also refer to a limited-access road that has control of access but has at-grade junctions, railway crossings (for example, the Harbour Expressway in Thunder Bay.) Sometimes the term _Parkway_ is also used (for example, the Hanlon Parkway in Guelph). In Saskatchewan, the term 'grid road' is used to refer to minor highways or rural roads, usually gravel, referring to the 'grid' upon which they were originally designed. In Quebec, freeways and expressways are called autoroutes.

In Alberta, the generic _Trail_ is often used to describe a freeway, expressway or major urban street (for example, Deerfoot Trail, Macleod Trail or Crowchild Trail in Calgary, Yellowhead Trail in Edmonton). The British term _motorway_ is not used. The American terms _turnpike_ and _tollway_ for a toll road are not common. The term _throughway_ or _thruway_ was used for first tolled limited-access highways (for example, the Deas Island Throughway, now Highway 99, from Vancouver, BC, to Blaine, Washington, USA or the Saint John Throughway (Highway 1) in Saint John, NB), but this term is not common anymore. In everyday speech, when a particular roadway is not being specified, the term _highway_ is generally or exclusively used.

-   A railway at-grade junction can be called a _level crossing,_ as well as the term _grade crossing_, which is commonly used in the US.[68]
-   A railway or highway crossing overhead is an _overpass_ or _underpass_, depending on which part of the crossing is referred to (the two are used more or less interchangeably); the British term _flyover_ is sometimes used in Ontario, and in the Maritimes as well as on occasion in the prairies (such as the 4th avenue flyover in Calgary, Alberta), _subway_ is also used.
-   In Quebec, English speakers often use the word "metro" to mean subway. Non-native Anglophones of Quebec will also use the designated proper title "metro" to describe the Montreal subway system.
-   The term _Texas gate_ refers to the type of metal grid called a _cattle guard_ in American English or a _cattle grid_ in British English.
-   Depending on the region, large trucks used to transport and deliver goods are referred to as 'transport trucks' (E.g. used in Ontario and Alberta) or 'transfer trucks' (E.g. used in Prince Edward Island)

Politics

-   While in standard usage the terms prime minister and premier are interchangeable terms for the head of an elected parliamentary government, Canadian English today generally follows a usage convention of reserving the title _prime minister_ for the federal first minister and referring to provincial or territorial leaders as _premiers_. However, because Canadian French does not have separate terms for the two positions, using _premier ministre_ for both, the title _prime minister_ is sometimes seen in reference to a provincial leader when a francophone is speaking or writing English. Also, until the 1970s the leader of the Ontario provincial government was officially styled _prime minister_.
-   When a majority of the elected members of the House of Commons or a provincial legislature are not members of the same party as the government, the situation is referred to as a minority government rather than a hung Parliament.
-   To _table_ a document in Canada is to present it (as in Britain), whereas in the U.S. it means to withdraw it from consideration. (However in non-governmental meetings using Robert's Rules of Order to table a document can be to postpone consideration until a later date.)
-   Several political terms are more in use in Canada than elsewhere, including _riding_ (as a general term for a parliamentary constituency or electoral district). The term _reeve_ was at one time common for the equivalent of a mayor in some smaller municipalities in British Columbia and Ontario, but is now falling into disuse. The title is still used for the leader of a rural municipality in Saskatchewan, parts of Alberta, and Manitoba.
-   The term _Tory,_ used in Britain with a similar meaning, denotes a supporter of the federal Conservative Party of Canada, the historic federal or provincial Progressive Conservative Party. The term Red Tory is also used to denote the more socially liberal wings of the Tory parties. Blue Tory is less commonly used, and refers to more strict fiscal (rather than social) conservatism. The U.S. use of _Tory_ to mean the Loyalists in the time of the American Revolution is not used in Canada, where they are called United Empire Loyalists, or simply Loyalists.
-   Members of the Liberal Party of Canada or a provincial Liberal party are sometimes referred to as _Grits_. Historically, the term comes from the phrase _Clear Grit_, used in Victorian times in Canada to denote an object of quality or a truthful person. The term was assumed as a nickname by Liberals by the 1850s.
-   Members of the Bloc Québécois are sometimes referred to as _Bloquistes_. At the purely provincial level, members of Quebec's Parti Québécois are often referred to as _Péquistes_, and members of the Quebec provincial Action démocratique du Québec as _Adéquistes_.
-   The term "Socred" is no longer common due to its namesake party's decline, but referred to members of the Social Credit Party, and was particularly common in British Columbia . It was not used for Social Credit members from Quebec, nor generally used for the federal caucus of that party; in both cases _Créditiste_, the French term, was used in English.
-   Members of the Senate are referred to by the title "Senator" preceding their name, as in the United States. Members of the House of Commons of Canada, following British parliamentary nomenclature, are termed "Members of Parliament", and are referred to as "Jennifer Jones, MP" during their term of office only. Senators, and members of the Privy Council are styled "The Honourable" for life, and the Prime Minister of Canada is styled "The Right Honourable" for life, as is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Governor General. This honorific may also be bestowed by Parliament, as it was to retiring deputy prime minister Herb Gray in 1996. Members of provincial legislatures do not have a pre-nominal style, except in certain provinces, such as Nova Scotia where members of the Queen's Executive Council of Nova Scotia are styled "The Honourable" for life, and are entitled to the use of the post-nominal letters "ECNS".[69] The Cabinet of Ontario serves concurrently (and not for life) as the Executive Council of Ontario, while serving members are styled "The Honourable", but are not entitled to post-nominal letters.
-   Members of provincial/territorial legislative assemblies are called MLAs in all provinces and territories except: Ontario, where they have been called Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) since 1938; Quebec, where they have been called Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) since 1968; and Newfoundland and Labrador, where they are called Members of the House of Assembly (MHAs).

Law

Lawyers in all parts of Canada, except Quebec, which has its own civil law system, are called "barristers and solicitors" because any lawyer licensed in any of the common law provinces and territories must pass bar exams for, and is permitted to engage in, both types of legal practice in contrast to other common-law jurisdictions such as England, Wales and Ireland where the two are traditionally separated (i.e., Canada has a fused legal profession). The words _lawyer_ and _counsel_ (not _counsellor_) predominate in everyday contexts; the word _attorney_ refers to any personal representative. Canadian lawyers generally do not refer to themselves as "attorneys", a term that is common in the United States.

The equivalent of an American _district attorney_, meaning the barrister representing the state in criminal proceedings, is called a _crown attorney_ (in Ontario), _crown counsel_ (in British Columbia), _crown prosecutor_ or _the crown_, on account of Canada's status as a constitutional monarchy in which the Crown is the locus of state power.

The words _advocate_ and _notary_ – two distinct professions in Quebec civil law – are used to refer to that province's equivalent of barrister and solicitor, respectively. In Canada's common law provinces and territories, the word _notary_ means strictly a notary public.

Within the Canadian legal community itself, the word _solicitor_ is often used to refer to any Canadian lawyer in general (much like the way the word _attorney_ is used in the United States to refer to any American lawyer in general). Despite the conceptual distinction between _barrister_ and _solicitor_, Canadian court documents would contain a phrase such as "''John Smith, _solicitor_ for the Plaintiff_" even though "John Smith" may well himself be the barrister who argues the case in court. In a letter introducing him/herself to an opposing lawyer, a Canadian lawyer normally writes something like "_I am the _solicitor_ for Mr. Tom Jones."

The word _litigator_ is also used by lawyers to refer to a fellow lawyer who specializes in lawsuits even though the more traditional word _barrister_ is still employed to denote the same specialization.

Judges of Canada's superior courts, which exist at the provincial and territorial levels, are traditionally addressed as _"My Lord"_ or _"My Lady"_, however there are some variances across certain jurisdictions, with some superior court judges preferring the titles _"Mister Justice"_ or _"Madam Justice"_ to _"Lordship"_.

Masters are addressed as _"Mr. Master"_ or simply _"Sir."_ In British Columbia, masters are addressed as _"Your Honour."_

Judges of provincial or inferior courts are traditionally referred to in person as _"Your Honour"_. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and of the federal-level courts prefer the use of _"Mister/Madam (Chief) Justice"_. Justices of The Peace are addressed as _"Your Worship"_. _"Your Honour"_ is also the correct form of address for a Lieutenant Governor.

A serious crime is called an indictable offence, while a less-serious crime is called a summary offence. The older words felony and misdemeanour, which are still used in the United States, are not used in Canada's current _Criminal Code_ (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46) or by today's Canadian legal system. As noted throughout the _Criminal Code_, a person accused of a crime is called _the accused_ and not _the defendant_, a term used instead in civil lawsuits.

In Canada, _visible minority_ refers to a non-aboriginal person or group visibly not one of the majority race in a given population. The term comes from the Canadian Employment Equity Act, which defines such people as "persons, other than Aboriginal people, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."[70] The term is used as a demographic category by Statistics Canada. The qualifier "visible" is used to distinguish such minorities from the "invisible" minorities determined by language (English vs. French) and certain distinctions in religion (Catholics vs. Protestants).[71]

A county in British Columbia means only a regional jurisdiction of the courts and justice system and is not otherwise connected to governance as with counties in other provinces and in the United States. The rough equivalent to "county" as used elsewhere is a "Regional District".

-   _bachelor_: bachelor apartment, an apartment all in a single room, with a small bathroom attached ("They have a bachelor for rent").[72] The usual American term is _studio_. In Quebec, this is known as a _one-and-a-half_ apartment;[73] some Canadians, especially in Prince Edward Island, call it a _loft_.[74]
-   _camp_: in Northern Ontario, it refers to what is called a _cottage_ in the rest of Ontario and a _cabin_ in the West.[75] It is also used, to a lesser extent, in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, as well as in parts of New England. It generally refers to vacation houses in rural areas.
-   _fire hall_: fire station, firehouse.[76]
-   _height of land_: a drainage divide. Originally American.[77]
-   _parkade_: a parking garage, especially in the West.[78]
-   _washroom_:[79] the general term for what is normally named _public toilet_ or _lavatory_ in Britain. In the United States (where it originated) the word was mostly replaced by _restroom_ in the 20th century. Generally used only as a technical or commercial term outside of Canada. The word _bathroom_ is also used.
-   _Indian reserve_, rather than the U.S. term _federal Indian reservation_. Often shortened to _reserve_, especially when the meaning is clear from context; another slang variant of this term is the shortened _res_ or _rez_.
-   _rancherie_: the residential area of a First Nation reserve, used in BC only.
-   _quiggly hole_ and/or _quiggly_: the depression in the ground left by a _kekuli_ or pithouse. Groups of them are called "quiggly hole towns". Used in the BC Interior only.
-   _gas bar_: a filling station (gas station) with a central island, having pumps under a fixed metal or concrete awning.
-   _booze can_: an after-hours establishment where alcohol is served, often illegally.
-   _dépanneur_, or the diminutive form _dep_, is often used by English speakers in Quebec. This is because convenience stores are called _dépanneurs_ in Canadian French.
-   _snye_, a side-stream channel that rejoins a larger river, creating an island.

Daily life

Terms common in Canada, Britain and Ireland but less frequent or nonexistent in the United States are:

-   _tin_ (as in _tin of tuna_), for _can_, especially among older speakers. Among younger speakers, _can_ is more common, with _tin_ referring to a can which is wider than it is tall as in "a tin of sardines" as opposed to a "can of soup".
-   _cutlery_, for _silverware_ or _flatware_, where the material of which the utensil is made is not of consequence to the context in which it is used.
-   _serviette_, especially in Eastern Canada, for a paper table _napkin_.[80]
-   _tap_, conspicuously more common than _faucet_ in everyday usage.

The following are more or less distinctively Canadian:

-   _ABM_, _bank machine_: synonymous with ATM (which is also used).[81]
-   _BFI bin_: Dumpster, after a prominent Canadian waste management company, BFI Canada (which was eventually bought out and became Progressive Waste Solutions) in provinces where that company does business; compare to other generic trademarks such as Kleenex, Xerox, and even Dumpster itself.
-   _converter_: Remote control. Likely derived from a popular line of cable converters manufactured by Phillips Canada in the early 1980s, which were early users of IR remote controls.
-   _chesterfield_: originally British and internationally used (as in classic furnishing terminology) to refer to a sofa whose arms are the same height as the back, it is a term for _any_ couch or sofa in Canada (and, to some extent, Northern California).[82][83] Once a hallmark of CanE, _chesterfield_, as with _settee_ and _davenport_, is now largely in decline among younger generations in the western and central regions.[84] _Couch_ is now the most common term; _sofa_ is also used.
-   _dart_: cigarette, used primarily by adolescents and young adults.
-   _dressing gown_ or _housecoat_: in the United States, called a _bathrobe_.
-   _eavestrough_: rain gutter. Also used, especially in the past, in the Northern and Western United States; the first recorded usage is in Herman Melville's _Moby-Dick_: "The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs , Flask."[85]
-   _flush_: toilet, used primarily by older speakers throughout the Maritimes.
-   _garburator_: (rhymes with _carburetor_) a garbage disposal.[86]
-   _homogenized milk_ or _homo milk_: milk containing 3.25% milk fat, typically called "whole milk" in the United States.
-   _hydro_: a common synonym for electrical service, used primarily in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. Most of the power in these provinces is hydroelectricity, and suppliers' company names incorporate the term "Hydro". Usage: "I didn't pay my hydro bill so they shut off my lights." Hence _hydrofield_ or _hydro corridor_, a line of electricity transmission towers, usually in groups cutting across a city, and _hydro lines/poles_, electrical transmission lines/poles.[87] These usages of _hydro_ are also standard in the Australian state of Tasmania. Also in slang usage can refer to hydroponically grown marijuana.
-   _loonie_: the Canadian one-dollar coin; derived from the use of the common loon on the reverse. The _toonie_ (less commonly spelled _tooney_, _twooney_, _twoonie_) is the two-dollar coin. _Loonie_ is also used to refer to the Canadian currency, particularly when discussing the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar; _loonie_ and _toonie_ describe coinage specifically. (for example, "I have a dollar in pennies" versus "I have three loonies in my pocket").
-   _pencil crayon_:[88] coloured pencil.
-   _pogie_ or _pogey_: term referring to unemployment insurance, which is now officially called _Employment_ Insurance in Canada. Derived from the use of _pogey_ as a term for a poorhouse.[89] Not used for welfare, in which case the term is _"the dole"_, as in _"he's on the dole, eh?"_.
-   _parkade:_ multistory parking garage. [90]

Apparel

The following are common in Canada, but not in the United States or the United Kingdom.

-   _runners_:[91] running shoes, especially in Western Canada.[92] Also used in Australian English[93] and Irish English.[94][95][96] Atlantic Canada prefers _sneakers_ while central Canada (including Quebec and Ontario) prefers _running shoes_.[97]
-   _tuque_ (also spelled _toque_ or _touque_): a knitted winter hat. A similar hat would be called a _beanie_ in the western United States and a _watch cap_ in the eastern United States, though these forms are generally closer-fitting, and may lack a brim as well as a pompom. There seems to be no exact equivalent outside Canada, since the tuque is of French Canadian origin.
-   _bunnyhug_: a hooded sweatshirt, with or without a zipper. Used mainly in Saskatchewan.

Food and beverage

-   Most Canadians as well as Americans in the Northwest, North Central, Prairie and Inland North prefer _pop_ over _soda_ to refer to a carbonated beverage (though neither term is dominant in British English). _Soft drink_ is also extremely common throughout Canada.
-   What Americans call _Canadian bacon_ is named _back bacon_ in Canada, or, if it is coated in cornmeal or ground peas, _cornmeal bacon_ or _peameal bacon_.
-   What most Americans call a _candy bar_ is usually known as a _chocolate bar_ (as in the United Kingdom). In certain areas surrounding the Bay of Fundy, it is sometimes known as a _nut bar_; however, this use is more popular amongst older generations. Legally only bars made of solid chocolate may be labelled chocolate bars, others must be labelled as candy bars.[98]
-   Even though the terms _French fries_ and _fries_ are used by Canadians, some speakers use the word _chips_ (and its diminutive, _chippies_) (chips is always used when referring to _fish and chips_, as elsewhere).
-   whole-wheat bread is often referred to as _brown bread_, as in "Would you like white or brown bread for your toast?"
-   An _expiry date_ is the term used for the date when a perishable product will go bad (similar to the UK _Use By_ date). The term _expiration date_ is more common in the United States (where _expiry date_ is seen mostly on the packaging of Asian food products). The term _Best Before_ also sees common use, where although not spoiled, the product may not taste "as good".
-   _double-double_: a cup of coffee with two measures of cream and two of sugar,[99] most commonly associated with the Tim Hortons chain of coffee shops.[100]
-   Canadianisms relating to alcohol:
    -   _mickey_: a bottle of hard liquor (informally called a pint in the Maritimes and the United States). In Newfoundland, this is almost exclusively referred to as a "flask". In the United States, "mickey", or "Mickey Finn", refers to a drink laced with drugs.
    -   _two-six_, _twenty-sixer_, _twixer_: a bottle of hard liquor (called a quart in the Maritimes). The word _handle_ is less common. Similarly, a bottle of hard liquor is known as a _forty_ and a bottle is known as a _sixty_ or _half gallon_ in Nova Scotia.
    -   _Texas mickey_ (especially in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; more often a "Saskatchewan mickey" in western Canada): a bottle of hard liquor. (Despite the name, Texas mickeys are generally unavailable outside of Canada.)
    -   _two-four_: a case of 24 beers, also known as a _case_ in Eastern Canada, or a _flat_ in Western Canada (referencing that cans of beer are often sold in packages of six, with four packages to a flat box for shipping and stacking purposes).
    -   _six-pack_, _half-sack_, _half-case_, or _poverty-pack_: a case of six beers
-   _poutine_: a snack of french fries topped with cheese curds and hot gravy.
-   There are also genericized trademarks used in Canada:
    -   _cheezies_: cheese puffs. The name is a genericized trademark based on a brand of crunchy cheese snack sold in Canada.
    -   Kraft Dinner or "KD": for any packaged dry macaroni and cheese mix, even when it is not produced by Kraft.
-   _freezie_: A frozen flavoured sugar water snack common worldwide, but known by this name exclusively in Canada.
-   _dainty_: a fancy cookie, pastry, or square served at a social event (usually plural). Used in western Canada.
-   _Smarties_: a bean-sized, small candy-covered chocolate, similar to plain M&M's. This is also seen in British English. Smarties in the United States refer to small tart powdered disc sold in rolls; in Canada these tart candies are sold as "Rockets".

Prairies (Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta)

A strong Canadian raising exists in the prairie regions together with certain older usages such as _chesterfield_ and _front room_ also associated with the Maritimes. Aboriginal Canadians are a larger and more conspicuous population in prairie cities than elsewhere in the country and certain elements of aboriginal speech in English are sometimes to be heard. Similarly, the linguistic legacy, mostly intonation but also speech patterns and syntax, of the Scandinavian, Slavic and German settlers – who are far more numerous and historically important in the Prairies than in Ontario or the Maritimes – can be heard in the general milieu. Again, the large Métis population in Saskatchewan and Manitoba also carries with it certain linguistic traits inherited from French, Aboriginal and Celtic forebears. Some terms are derived from immigrant groups or are just local inventions:

-   bluff: small group of trees isolated by prairie
-   bunny hug: elsewhere _hoodie_ or _hooded sweat shirt_ (mainly in Saskatchewan, but also in Manitoba)
-   ginch/gonch/gitch/gotch: underwear (usually men's or boys' underwear, more specifically briefs; whereas women's underwear are _gotchies_), probably of Eastern European or Ukrainian origin. _Gitch_ and _gotch_ are primarily used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba while the variants with an _n_ are common in Alberta and British Columbia.[101]
-   jam buster: jelly-filled doughnut.
-   porch climber: moonshine or homemade alcohol. _Porch climber_ has a slightly distinguished meaning in Ontario where it refers to a beverage mixed of beer, vodka, and lemonade.
-   slough: pond – usually a pond on a farm
-   Vi-Co: occasionally used in Saskatchewan instead of _chocolate milk_. Formerly a brand of chocolate milk.

In farming communities with substantial Ukrainian, German or Mennonite populations, accents, sentence structure and vocabulary influenced by these languages is common. These communities are most common in the Saskatchewan Valley region of Saskatchewan and Red River Valley region of Manitoba.

Descendants of marriages between Hudson's Bay Company workers of mainly Scottish descent and Cree women spoke Bungi, a creole that blends Cree and English. A few Bungi speakers can still be found in Manitoba. It is marked by no masculine, feminine or third-person pronouns.[102]

British Columbia

British Columbian English has several words still in current use borrowed from the Chinook Jargon although the use of such vocabulary is observably decreasing. The most famous and widely used of these terms are _skookum_ and _saltchuck_. However, among young British Columbians, almost no one uses this vocabulary, and only a small percentage is even familiar with the meaning of such words. In the Yukon, _cheechako_ is used for newcomers or greenhorns.

Northern Ontario

Northern Ontario English has several distinct qualities stemming from its large Franco-Ontarian population. As a result several French and English words are used interchangeably. A number of phrases and expressions may also be found in Northern Ontario that are not present in the rest of the province,[103] such as the use of _camp_ for a summer home where Southern Ontario speakers would idiomatically use cottage.

Informal speech

A _rubber_ in the U.S. and Canada is slang for a condom; however, in Canada it is sometimes (rarely except for Newfoundland and South Western Ontario) another term for an eraser (as it is in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

The word _bum_ can refer either to the buttocks (as in Britain), or, derogatorily, to a homeless person (as in the U.S.). However, the "buttocks" sense does not have the indecent character it retains in British use, as it and "butt" are commonly used as a polite or childish euphemism for ruder words such as _arse_ (commonly used in Atlantic Canada and among older people in Ontario and to the west) or _ass_, or _mitiss_ (used in the Prairie Provinces, especially in northern and central Saskatchewan; probably originally a Cree loanword). Older Canadians may see "bum" as more polite than "butt", which before the 1980s was often considered rude.

Similarly the word _pissed_ can refer either to being drunk (as in Britain), or being angry (as in the U.S.), though anger is more often said as _pissed off_, while _piss drunk_ or _pissed up_ is said to describe inebriation (though _piss drunk_ is sometimes also used in the US, especially in the northern states).

One of the most distinctive Canadian phrases is the spoken interrogation or tag _eh_.[104] The only usage of _eh_ exclusive to Canada, according to the _Canadian Oxford Dictionary_, is for "ascertaining the comprehension, continued interest, agreement, etc., of the person or persons addressed" as in, "It's four kilometres away, eh, so I have to go by bike." In that case, _eh?_ is used to confirm the attention of the listener and to invite a supportive noise such as _mm_ or _oh_ or _okay_. This usage is also common in Queensland, Australia and New Zealand. Other uses of _eh_ – for instance, in place of _huh?_ or _what?_ meaning "please repeat or say again" – are also found in parts of the British Isles and Australia. It is common in Northern/Central Ontario, the Maritimes and the Prairie provinces. The word _eh_ is used quite frequently in the North Central dialect, so a Canadian accent is often perceived in people from North Dakota, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Curtiss_JN-4_CAN.jpg The term _Canuck_ simply means _Canadian_ in its demonymic form, and, as a term used even by Canadians themselves, it is not considered derogatory. In the 19th century and early 20th century it tended to refer to French-Canadians, while the only Canadian-built version of the popular World War I-era American Curtiss JN-4 _Jenny_ training biplane aircraft, the JN-4C, got the "Canuck" nickname, 1,260 of which were built. The nickname Janey Canuck was used by Anglophone women's rights writer Emily Murphy in the 1920s and the _Johnny Canuck_ comic book character of the 1940s. Throughout the 1970s, Canada's winning World Cup men's downhill ski team was called the "Crazy Canucks" for their fearlessness on the slopes.[105] It is also the name of the Vancouver Canucks, the National Hockey League team of Vancouver, British Columbia.

The term _hoser_, popularized by Bob & Doug McKenzie, typically refers to an uncouth, beer-swilling male and is a euphemism for "loser" coming from the earlier days of hockey played on an outdoor rink and the losing team would have to hose down the ice after the game so it froze smooth. Bob & Doug also popularized the use of _Beauty, eh_, another western slang term which may be used to describe something as being of interest or note or deserving approval.

A _Newf_ or _Newfie_ is someone from Newfoundland and Labrador; sometimes considered derogatory. In Newfoundland, the term _Mainlander_ refers to any Canadian (sometimes American, occasionally Labradorian) not from the island of Newfoundland. _Mainlander_ is also occasionally used derogatorily.

In the Maritimes, a _Caper_ or "Cape Bretoner" is someone from Cape Breton Island, a _Bluenoser_ is someone with a thick, usually southern Nova Scotia accent or as a general term for a Nova Scotian (Including Cape Bretoners), while an _Islander_ is someone from Prince Edward Island (the same term is used in British Columbia for people from Vancouver Island, or the numerous islands along it). A _Haligonian_ refers to someone from the city of Halifax.

Cape Bretoners and Newfies (from Newfoundland and Labrador) often have similar slang. "Barmp" is often used as the sound a car horn makes, example: "He cut me off so I Barmped the horn at him". When saying "B'y", while sounds like the traditional farewell, it is a syncopated shortening of the word "boy", referring to a person, example: "How's it goin, b'y?". Another slang that is commonly used is "doohickey" which means an object, example: "Pass me that doohickey over there". When an individual uses the word "biffed", they mean that they threw something. Example: "I got frustrated so I biffed it across the room".[106]

Other Canadianisms

-   The alphanumeric code appended to mail addresses (the equivalent of the similar British postcode and the numeric-only American ZIP code) is called a _postal code_.
-   The term _First Nations_ is often used in Canada to refer to what are called American Indians or Native Americans in the United States. This term does include the Métis and Inuit, however; the term aboriginal peoples (and sometimes spelled with a capital "A": "Aboriginal peoples") is preferred when all three groups are included. The term _Eskimo_ has been replaced by the term Inuit in the past few decades. It is now considered offensive to use the term _Eskimo_, but is still used commonly (without pejorative intent) by those born in the early-mid-20th century.
-   "Going camping" still refers to staying in a tent in a campground or wilderness area, while "going out to camp" may refer to a summer cottage or home in a rural area. "Going to camp" refers to children's summer camps. In British Columbia, "camp" was used as a reference for certain company towns (for example, Bridge River). It is used in western Canada to refer to logging and mining camps such as Juskatla Camp. It is also a synonym for a mining district; the latter occurs in names such as Camp McKinney and usages such as "Cariboo gold camp" and "Slocan mining camp" for the Cariboo goldfields and Slocan silver-galena mining district, respectively. A "cottage" in British Columbia is generally a small house, perhaps with an English design or flavour, while in southern Ontario it more likely means a second home on a lake. Similarly, "chalet" – originally a term for a small warming hut – can mean a second home of any size, but refers to one located in a ski resort. In Northern Ontario, these second homes tend to be called "camps". In Western Canada, these second homes tend to be called "cabins". A "bunkie" is a secondary building at these second homes that are small enough to require no building permits and house extra guests visiting.
-   One of the other distinctions between Canadian English and British English is the use of the phrase "try to + infinitive" versus the use of the phrase "try and + infinitive". Canadian English uses "try to" while British English uses "try and". The subordinate word, "to" or "and." Originally, the distinction did not exist, but through the evolution of the French term _trier_, meaning 'pick out', 'separate', or 'distinguish' into the English _try_, a number of meanings were adopted along the way, including 'attempt'. Canadian English speakers use "try and" 30% of the time while British English speakers use it 73% of the time. However, since the 2000s, the two terms have begun to see equally frequent usage in British English.[107]
-   A _stagette_ is a female bachelorette party (US) or hen party (UK).
-   A "shag" is thought, erroneously, to be derived from "shower" and "stag", and describes a dance where alcohol, entry tickets, raffle tickets, and so on, are sold to raise money for the engaged couple's wedding. Normally a Northwest Ontario, Northern Ontario and sometimes Manitoba term, a "stag and doe" or "buck and doe" is used elsewhere in Ontario. The more common term for this type of event in Manitoba is a "social".
-   The _humidex_ is a measurement used by meteorologists to reflect the combined effect of heat and humidity (vs. US term _heat index_ quantifying the apparent temperature).
-   _The States_: Commonly used to refer to the United States or almost as often _the U.S._, much less often _U.S.A._ or _America_ which are commonly used in other countries, the latter more often used in other English-speaking nations.
-   _Drop the gloves_: to begin a fight. A reference to a practice in hockey of removing gloves prior to fighting, and the idiom "throw down the gauntlet".
-   _Back east_ typically means 'Ontario or possibly Quebec' whereas _Down East_ instead refers to the Maritimes[108] – the latter term is used in New England, especially in areas very close to Atlantic Canada, to refer to the two eastern coastal counties of Maine.


Attitudes towards Canadian English

In 2011, just under 21.5 million Canadians, representing 65% of the population, spoke English most of the time at home, while 58% declared it their mother language.[109] English is the major language everywhere in Canada except Quebec, and most Canadians (85%) can speak English.[110] While English is not the preferred language in Quebec, 36.1% of Québécois can speak English.[111] Nationally, Francophones are five times more likely to speak English than Anglophones are to speak French – 44% and 9% respectively.[112] Only 3.2% of Canada's English-speaking population resides in Quebec—mostly in Montreal.

Attitude studies on Canadian English are somewhat rare. A perceptual study on Albertan and Ontarians exists[113] in combination with older literature from the 1970s–80s. Sporadic reports can be found in the literature, e.g. on Vancouver English,[114] in which more than 80% believe in a "Canadian way of speaking", with those with a university education reporting higher than those without.

Jaan Lilles argues in an essay for _English Today_ that there is no variety of "Canadian English". He acknowledges that no variety of English is more "real" or "natural" than any other, but that, in the words of American linguist John Algeo, "All linguistic varieties are fictions." According to Lilles, Canadian English is simply not a "useful fiction".[115] He goes on to argue that too often national identity is conflated with linguistic identity, and that in the case of "Canadian English", supposedly unique features of Canadian speakers, such as certain lexical terms such as _muskeg_ are artificially exaggerated to distinguish Canadian speech primarily from that found in the United States.[116]
