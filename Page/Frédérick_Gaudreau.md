FRÉDÉRICK "FREDDY" GAUDREAU (born May 1, 1993) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre. He is currently playing for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL).


Playing career

As a youth, Gaudreau played in the 2006 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Missiquoi, Quebec.[1]

Gaudreau played midget hockey in the QMAAA with the Magog Cantonniers before embarking on major junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with the Shawinigan Cataractes and the Drummondville Voltigeurs.[2]

Undrafted, Gaudreau signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL, on June 12, 2014.[3] In the 2014–15 season, he added to the depth of the Milwaukee attack, contributing with 11 points in 43 games. He was also loaned for 14 games to ECHL partner, the Cincinnati Cyclones, in producing 5 goals. On May 21, 2015, Gaudreau was extended by the Admirals for a further season.[4]

In the midst of a break-out 2015–16 season, having established himself in a scoring role with the Admirals, Gaudreau was signed to a two-year, entry-level contract with the NHL affiliate, the Nashville Predators on January 6, 2016.[5] He completed the season in the AHL, placing third on the Admirals in scoring with new professional highs with 15 goals and 42 points in 75 games.

After attending the Predators training camp, he was reassigned to continue with Milwaukee to begin the 2016–17 season. On October 22, 2016, Gaudreau received his first NHL recall to the Predators, after the team suffered a bout of food poisoning.[6] He immediately made his NHL debut with the Predators in a 5–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins.[7] He was returned to the Admirals following the game.

In Game 5 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals against the Anaheim Ducks, Gaudreau made his playoff debut after injuries to Ryan Johansen and Mike Fisher necessitated his presence in the line-up.[8] Gaudreau scored the winning goal in the Predators' 5–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 3 of the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals.[9] In Game 4, Gaudreau again scored the game winner as the Predators defeated the Penguins 4–1 to even the series at two games apiece. In doing so, Gaudreau became the first player since Johnny Harms of the 1944 Chicago Blackhawks to score his first three career NHL goals in a Stanley Cup Final.[10]
