_CHICAGO 'N ALL THAT JAZZ_ (subtitled _BIG BAND JAZZ OF THE BROADWAY MUSICAL_) is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz performing John Kander and Fred Ebb's songs from the Broadway musical _Chicago_ recorded in 1975 and released on the Groove Merchant label.[1][2]


Critical reception

Scott Yanow of Allmusic said " Konitz and his sidemen play with enthusiasm and melodic creativity; some of the themes are quite catchy. The playing time (around 36 minutes) is quite brief and the music is far from essential but the performances are surprisingly pleasing, making this a worthy purchase".[3]
