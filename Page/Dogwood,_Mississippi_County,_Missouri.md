DOGWOOD is an unincorporated community in Mississippi County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A variant name was "Sands".[2] A post office called Sands was established in 1902, and remained in operation until 1908.[3] Besides the post office, the community contained the Dogwood School.[4] The community derives its present name from a grove of dogwood trees which stood near the schoolhouse.[5]
