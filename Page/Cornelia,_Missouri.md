CORNELIA is an unincorporated community in Johnson County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A post office called Cornelia was established in 1855, and remained in operation until 1904.[2] The community was named after Cornelia Love, the wife of an early settler.[3] A variant name was "Shanghai".[4] The reason it was called Shanghai was that Dr. Love, who founded the community, raised Shanghai chickens.
