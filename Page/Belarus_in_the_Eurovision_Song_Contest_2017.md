BELARUS participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 with the song "Story of My Life" written by Arciom Lukjanienka. The song was performed by Naviband. The Belarusian entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine was selected through a national final organised by the Belarusian broadcaster National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus (BTRC). The national final consisted of thirteen competing acts participating in a televised production where the winner was determined by a 50/50 combination of votes from jury members made up of music professionals and a public telephone vote. "Historyja majho žyccia" performed by NAVI was selected as the winner.[1] The song's title was later translated from Belarusian to English for the Eurovision Song Contest and was titled "Story of My Life".


Background

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Belarus had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest thirteen times since its first entry in 2004.[2] The nation's best placing in the contest was sixth, which it achieved in 2007 with the song "Work Your Magic" performed by Dmitry Koldun. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the , Belarus had managed to qualify to the final four times. In 2016, Belarus failed to qualify to the final with the song "Help You Fly" performed by Alexander Ivanov.

The Belarusian national broadcaster, National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus (BTRC), broadcasts the event within Belarus and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. The broadcaster has used both internal selections and national finals to select the Belarusian entry for Eurovision in the past. Since 2012, BTRC has organised a national final in order to choose Belarus' entry, a selection procedure that continued for their 2016 entry.[3]

At Eurovision

According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[5] On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Belarus placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 11 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.[6]

Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Originally, Belarus was set to perform in position 15, following the entry from Switzerland and before the entry from Bulgaria.[7] However, following Russia's withdrawal from the contest on 13 April and subsequent removal from the running order of the second semi-final, Belarus' performing position shifted to 14.[8]
