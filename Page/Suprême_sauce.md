_SUPRÊME_ SAUCE is one of the classic "small sauces" of French cuisine, that is, one made by combining a basic or mother sauce with extra ingredients.


Recipes

Traditionally, this sauce is made from a _velouté_ sauce (a roux sauce made with a meat stock - in the case of _suprême_, a chicken stock is usually preferred), reduced with heavy cream or _crème fraîche_, and then strained through a fine sieve. This is the recipe as used in _Larousse Gastronomique_, a seminal work of French _haute cuisine_, first published in 1938.

A light squeeze of lemon juice is commonly added. In many cases, chefs also choose to add finely chopped and lightly sautéed mushrooms to the dish, although this was not specifically mentioned in _Larousse Gastronomique_ or by Auguste Escoffier, the "Emperor of the World's Kitchens", who was an arbiter of classic French cuisine.[1]

It is possible to make a similar sauce to pass for _sauce suprême_ by taking béchamel sauce (a classic mother sauce made with butter, flour and milk), with a poultry stock (effectively a shortcut to making a _velouté_ by combining the roux and stock elements) and butter.

_The Cook's Decameron_ suggests the following recipe: the sauce is made by placing three-quarters of a pint of white sauce into a saucepan, and when it is nearly boiling, adding half a cup of concentrated fowl stock. It should then be reduced until the sauce is quite thick, passed through a _chinois_ strainer into a _bain-marie_ and have added two tablespoons of cream.[2]
