In 1906 he obtained his habilitation for dermatology and syphilology, and in 1912 became an associate professor.[1]

In 1909 he was named head of the Rudolfspital in Vienna, and four years later relocated to the University of Munich. In 1915 he was appointed director of the department of syphilis and dermatology. In 1932/33 he served as university rector. In 1935 he was forced by the Nazi government to relinquish his position at the university for political reasons.[2][3]

In 1910 he described a rare form of generalized pustular psoriasis that is now referred to as Zumbusch psoriasis.[4]
