NINA CHANEL ABNEY (born 1982) is an American artist, based in New York. She was born in Chicago, Illinois.[1] She is an African American contemporary artist and painter who explores race, gender, pop culture, homophobia and politics in her work.

Her work uses symbols and bright colors to present new ways of approaching loaded topics as she invites viewers to draw their own conclusions.[2] Blending the playful and the serious, Abney has said that her work is “easy to swallow, hard to digest.”[3]

Abney does not plan ahead, rather she works intuitively and with a rhythm. Jeffery Deitch once compared her skill to Haring.[4]


Education

Abney attended Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois and received a BFA with a dual major in studio art and computer science in 2004. Abney then received an MFA at the Parsons School of Design[5] in 2007.


Career

In 2007, Abney got her first big break for her painting _Class of 2007,_ which she painted for her MFA thesis show.[6] The painting is a diptych. In one panel, she is depicted as a blonde officer carrying a gun. In the second panel, her MFA classmates, all white, are painted as black inmates in orange uniforms. The painting was purchased by the Rubell family, owners of the Rubell Family Collection in Miami, Florida.[7]

She is best known for her colorful graphic large-scale paintings, four of which are included in the _30 Americans_ exhibition organized by the Rubell Family Collection of works by African American artists of the last three decades, which has toured museums and galleries in America since 2008.[8][9] Her work has also appeared in the Whitney Museum, the Jack Shainman Gallery, as well as the Kravets Wehby Gallery[10] in Chelsea.[11][12]

_Dirty Wash_ was Abney's first show, hosted at Kravets/Wehby gallery in the spring of 2008. Attracting many major collectors, the show sold out within days.[13]

Nina Chanel Abney has been a lecturer for universities and visual arts centers across the nation. In 2013, she was a guest lecturer at the New York Academy of Art and in 2015 she presented at the Summit Series in Utah.[14]

Her first solo exhibition in a museum, _Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush,_ opened at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in February 2017.[15][16] Curated by Marshall N. Price, the exhibition included about 30 of her paintings, watercolors, and collages and spans 10 years of her work.[17] The works contain a wide range of art historical references, including medieval icons, Northern Renaissance still lifes, and artists such as Henri Matisse and John Wesley.[18] They illustrate narcissism, celebrity culture, the objectification of women, issues of race, and police brutality.

In September of 2018, Abney curated a group exhibition at the Jeffery Deitch gallery entitled _Punch_. The exhibition called upon current socio-political issues. The exhibition featured Abney herself and some of her close friends. There were paintings, photographs and sculptures included in the exhibition.[19]

Countless news sources have discussed Abney's attempts to address radical political topics by blending genders and race.[20] Some of these sources include the Huffington Post, Forbes and Elle Magazine.[21]
