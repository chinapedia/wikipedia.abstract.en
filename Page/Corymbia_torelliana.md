Fruits that form are globose to urceolate and contain regular flattened red-brown seeds.[7] It reproduces by seed, they are spread by wind, water, native bees, and in dumped garden waste.[8]


Distribution

_Corymbia torelliana_ is found in wet sclerophyll forest, on rain forest margins and as an emergent in rain forest which is advancing into eucalypt forest. It is distributed throughout north east Queensland and is distributed between Cooktown and Ingham.[9] It is also cultivated as a street and garden tree in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of Australia and has now become naturalised beyond its native range in south-eastern and central Queensland. It grows as a weed on roadsides, waterways, disturbed sites and waste areas mostly in inhabited areas.[10]
