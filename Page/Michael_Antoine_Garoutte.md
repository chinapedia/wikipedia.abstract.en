MICHAEL ANTOINE GAROUTTE (Pronounced _guh-ROOT_) (April 12, 1750 – April 29, 1829) was a member of the first nobility of Provence in the Kingdom of France. He was a Privateer in the early war for American Independence and ascended to the rank of Lieutenant in the first American Continental Navy.

He was the first owner of the LaFayette Tavern in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey, United States of America.[1][2][3]

He belonged to a very old Provençal family of the nobility. He and his sister the Lady Marie Magdeleine Garoutte and her family were Revolutionaries, they were among the first nobles to reform the French government in the French Revolution. Garoutte's favored nephew was French Revolutionary Army General Antoine Joseph Marie d'Espinassy. He was also one of the founding Catholics of Pennsylvania.[4]

The street named Garoutte in Marseille, France is named after his family.

Michel Antoine Garoutte's maternal grandfather was Baron Henri d'Lascour, who was the 1st cousin of Louis Capet the King of France.[5]


Early life

Garoutte was born April 12, 1750 in the castle Garoutte in Marseille, Kingdom of France to the Lady Marie Anne d'Lascours and the Admiral, Sir Antoine Garoutte. He was baptized the following day at the oldest Catholic Parish of Marseille, the Notre-Dame Des Accoules Church. He was brought up in training and educated as a Catholic Priest, but at the age of 15 his older brother died in battle with no heirs and Garoutte exited seminary and went to Military School, and later Officers School in Paris. He went to some of the same schools as his friend Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de LaFayette. He spent many months living in the Castle de la Jaconniere in Signes with the d'Espinassy Family after the death of his older brother.

After being pardoned in King Louis XVI court for dueling he sailed from Marseille commanding two ships to the New York Colony and fought in the War for American Independence.[6]


Military service

Garoutte was in the Battle of Chestnut Neck where the British burned down his ships in the Mullica River. His Privateer activities involved overtaking British Merchant vessels and British Navy vessels, taking the seized goods to Little Egg Harbor where the goods would be sent across the river through the Delaware and to Valley Forge to supply General George Washington's military forces. He also secured artillery for the Patriot military forces.

Garoutte later served on the brig-of-war _Enterprise_ and sloop-of-war _Racehorse_ as a naval officer in the American Continental Navy.

Shortly after the Battle of Chestnut Neck Garoutte went to retrieve his friend who was hiding in an Inn and he was ambushed by 7 Hessians, the Hessians stabbed Garoutte with a bayonet and blunted his head leaving him for dead on the dirt road. He was assisted by Quakers who were secretly aiding the American Revolutionaries, saving his life.


Return to France

Garoutte returned to the Kingdom of France arriving in 1787 where he was given gifts by the King Louis XVI and the Queen Marie Antoinette, and again in January 1793, his nephew was a member of the Council that decided Louis XVI's fate in the Trial of Louis XVI.

On his return to the Kingdom of France in 1787 his sister wrote the following letter:


LaFayette Tavern

Garoutte started a Tavern in Pleasant Mills, New Jersey and named it The LaFayette Tavern, undoubtedly after his childhood friend and school fellow the Marquis de LaFayette. Batsto-Pleasant Mills, New Jersey was a main manufacturer of guns for the military forces for American Independence.

Garoutte's Tavern saw patrons the Corsican King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte and the Marquis de LaFayette among others.[7][8][9][10] His tavern was well known in the day and was regarded as one of the best in New Jersey. Ebenezer Tucker was said to have complemented Garoutte on his _Most pleasant inn_.


Death

Garoutte died April 29, 1829 at the age of 79 on the road in Pemberton, New Jersey, United States of America determined to make his way back to France. He was buried in Pleasant Mills.

Garoutte mentioned in his journal that he was angry at John Sevier Jr for stealing his daughter Sophia Garoutte from him and he lost hope of ever seeing her again. He left the house of Governor John Sevier after Sevier took Garoutte's silver coins.

After he left he wrote the following entry in his journal:

Garoutte then decided to sail back to France but he never made it.
