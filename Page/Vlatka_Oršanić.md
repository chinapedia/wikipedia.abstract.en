She graduated in the spring of 1979 and made her debut as Sophie in _Werther_ at Ljubljana Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet. She was subsequently engaged as a soloist there and also began making guest appearances in other opera houses in what was then Yugoslavia. In that time she was celebrated as an extraordinary Lucia and Gilda. From 1985 to 1990 she lived in Vienna, where she pursued further study in solo singing techniques with Olivera Miljaković.[3][4]

She went on to sing as a guest artist at various opera houses in Europe and from 1992 to 1995 was the soloist at the Staatstheater Darmstadt.[5] Her most successful roles were Jenufa, Lady Macbeth and Katerina Ismailova. She sang at Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Oper Leipzig, Aalto-Musiktheater Essen, Teatro Comunale Florence and elsewhere.
