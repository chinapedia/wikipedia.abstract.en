_THE KLINGON WAY: A WARRIOR'S GUIDE_ (Klingon: _TLHINGAN TIGH: SUVWI' DEVMEH PAQ_) is a 1996 book by the linguist Marc Okrand that was published by Pocket Books. _The Klingon Way_ is a collection of proverbs and sayings in the constructed language of Klingon, ascribed to the Klingon race and Klingon culture in the fictional _Star Trek_ universe. Okrand first began constructing the Klingon language in the 1980s when he was hired to produce Klingon dialogue for _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_, going on to publish _The Klingon Dictionary_. _The Klingon Way_ expanded the Klingon lexicon, and was followed by _Klingon for the Galactic Traveler_.

An audiobook version of _The Klingon Way_, featuring the voices of Michael Dorn and Roxann Dawson, was produced by Simon & Schuster Audio. The Klingon Language Institute considers _The Klingon Way_ to be a canonical source of the Klingon language, and the book, along with Okrand's other work on the subject, has become highly important for a section of the _Star Trek_ fandom.


Background

Klingons were introduced as antagonists in _Star Trek: The Original Series_, though were portrayed as less villainous in subsequent _Star Trek_ television programs—including _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_—and _Star Trek_ films. The Klingon language was sometimes spoken on-screen early in the franchise's history, but became more formalised in the 1980s.[1] Marc Okrand, a professional linguist who had previously been consulted concerning the Vulcan language for _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ (1982), was hired to produce some dialogue in the Klingon language for _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_ (1984). Okrand based the language on the guttural sounds made by James Doohan that were used for the Klingon language in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (1979), as well as the requests made of him that the language have a guttural quality, that it would "sound good", and that it would have a genuine, realistic syntax, grammar and lexicon.[2]

Okrand went on to author _The Klingon Dictionary_ (1985). This book became significant to _Star Trek_ fans,[3] and a group of Klingon enthusiasts formed the Klingon Language Institute. This group began, in 1992, to publish _HolQeD_ ("Linguistics"),[4] a scholarly journal devoted to the study of the Klingon language.[5][6] Okrand also produced two audio tapes, _Conversational Klingon_ and _Power Klingon_.[7]

The existing lexicon of Klingon was expanded with the publication of Okrand's _The Klingon Way_ in 1996.[8] Okrand includes a number of linguistic jokes in his books on Klingon. For example, he has described his development of the Klingon language with reference to _Das Boot_ (1981), saying that he imagined Klingons as similar to the film's characters: "I pictured the Klingons in the same way, in tight quarters all barking at each other."[9] Consequently, the Klingon word meaning "boot" is _DaS_.[10]


Contents

Marc_Okrand.jpg _The Klingon Way_ contains an Introduction, Annotations, and 157 proverbs and locutions, with a number of additional proverbs or their modifications found in the descriptions. The book is not arranged in alphabetic order (neither in Klingon or English) and has no index or table of contents. The book presents English translations of the proverbs (called the Federation Standard versions) with their Klingon originals, along with explanation stories and footnote references to the _Star Trek_ series episodes up to _Star Trek: Voyager_ and from the films up to _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_. The book includes photos from _Star Trek_ episodes and films, but does not reference the _Star Trek_ novels.

Entry headings sometimes present more than one related proverb. The description stories explain the role of the given proverb in Klingon culture; they sometimes explain language usage of specific Klingon words or particular grammatical form, and also sometimes present additional related proverbs.

For example, the proverb _Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam_ ("It is a good day to die") is illustrated with a story explaining that "This is an extremely common Klingon locution, often uttered when the odds seem to favor an opponent. It does not, however, represent a defeatist attitude." Further, the book notes that "Kang, of course, spoke ironically when, accepting the proposition that there was a chance to defeat an adversary, he altered this expression to 'It is a good day to live'." The footnotes point out that this proverb was used in _The Next Generation_ episode "Sins of the Father" and in the _Deep Space Nine_ episode "Blood Oath". The image for this entry shows "Koloth encountering a guard for the Albino and teaching him a proverb".

Common locutions include _lumbe' tlhInganpu{{'}}_ ("Klingons do not procrastinate"), _{{'}}utbe' bel._ ("Pleasure is nonessential") and _QI'tomerDaq Heghpu' Hoch_ ("No one survived Khitomer"). Toasts and wishes include _tlhIngan maH!_ ("We are Klingons!"), _batlh ghob yIpab_ ("Adhere to virtue honorably."), and _batlh bIHeghjaj!_ ("May you die well!").

Audiobook

An audiobook version of _The Klingon Way_, with a running time of 75 minutes, was released by Simon & Schuster Audio. It featured the voices of Michael Dorn and Roxann Dawson, known for playing, respectively, the Klingon Worf in _The Next Generation_ and the half-Klingon B'Elanna Torres in _Voyager_. The actors read the book's phrases in the Klingon language and explain the significance of them.[11]


Reception and significance

Klingon culture and language has become significant for many in the _Star Trek_ fandom.]] A review of the book, concentrating on the new vocabulary and the specific grammatical features, by was published by Rich "Captain Krankor" Yampell in _HolQeD_,[12] and was later republished in his _The Grammarian's Desk: A Collection of Grammatical Opinion & Wisdom of the Warrior's Tongue_, edited by Lawrence M. Schoen.[13] Reviewing the audiobook version of _The Klingon Way_ for the _Calgary Herald_, the freelance columnist Grant McKenzie said that "If you've ever wanted to toss some conversational Klingon into a friendly chat, this audio will quickly have you up to speed and make you the hit of the next Trekker convention. Non-Trekkers, on the other hand, won't have a clue what they're listening to."[14]

Okrand went on to produce _Klingon for the Galactic Traveler_ (1997), a second major expansion of the Klingon language.[15][16] This work presents an overview of Klingon culture as depicted in the Klingon language, containing several more Klingon proverbs and locutions, and may be considered a companion book to _The Klingon Way_.[17] The Klingon Language Institute considers both to be canonical sources of the Klingon language, holding that only Okrand's work can be considered canonical.[18] Okrand's various works have become highly significant to some _Star Trek_ fans, who sometimes take them very seriously.[19][20] The novelist and researcher Michael Hemmingson, in his 2009 study of _Star Trek_, explained that "_The Klingon Dictionary_ (1992) and _The Klingon Way_ (1995) were embraced with relish by Trekkies, resulting in a curious subculture within the fandom: people speaking the language and recreating—or engaging in simulation of hyper-reality—Klingon culture and rituals, as represented in the movies and _The Next Generation_, into their everyday lives".[21]
