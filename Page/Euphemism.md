Below it are the words "family planning", "feminine hygiene", "feminine protection" and "sanitary protection"]] A EUPHEMISM is an innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant.[1] Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to mask profanity or refer to taboo topics such as disability, sex, excretion, or death in a polite way.[2]


Etymology

_Euphemism_ comes from the Greek word () which refers to the use of 'words of good omen'; it is a compound of (), meaning 'good, well', and (), meaning 'prophetic speech; rumour, talk'.[3] _Eupheme_ is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term _euphemism_ itself was used as a euphemism by the ancient Greeks; with the meaning "to keep a holy silence" (speaking well by not speaking at all).[4]


Purpose

Reasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing.

Euphemisms are also used to downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at Auschwitz, relative to their sheer number, is "directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms".[5]

Euphemisms are sometimes used to lessen the opposition to a political move. For example, according to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the neutral Hebrew lexical item פעימות _peimót_ ("beatings (of the heart)"), rather than נסיגה _nesigá_ ("withdrawal"), to refer to the stages in the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank (see Wye River Memorandum), in order to lessen the opposition of right-wing Israelis to such a move.[6] The lexical item פעימות _peimót_, which literally means "beatings (of the heart)" is thus a euphemism for "withdrawal".[7]

The act of labeling a term as a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following two examples:

-   _Affirmative action_, meaning a preference for minorities or the historically disadvantaged, usually in employment or academic admissions. This term is sometimes said to be a euphemism for reverse discrimination, or in the UK positive discrimination, which suggests an intentional bias that might be legally prohibited, or otherwise unpalatable.affirmative action as euphemism

-   _Enhanced interrogation_ is sometimes said to be a euphemism for torture. For example, columnist David Brooks called the use of this term for practices at Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo, and elsewhere an effort to "dull the moral sensibility".Enhanced interrogation as euphemism

Formation

Phonetic modification

Phonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:

-   Shortening or "clipping" the term, such as _Jeez_ (Jesus) and _what the—_ ("what the hell" or "what the fuck")
-   Mispronunciations, such as _frak_, _frig_ (both the preceding for "fuck"), _what the fudge_, _what the truck_ (both "what the fuck"), _oh my gosh_ ("oh my God"), _frickin_ ("fucking"), _darn_ ("damn"), _oh shoot_ ("oh shit"), _be-yotch_ ("bitch"), etc. This is also referred to as a minced oath.
-   Using first letters as replacements, such as _SOB_ ("son of a bitch"), _what the eff_ ("what the fuck"), _S my D_ ("suck my dick"), _POS_ ("piece of shit"), _BS_ ("bullshit"). Sometimes, the word "word" is added after it, such as _F-word_ ("fuck"), _S-word_ ("shit"), _B-word_ ("bitch"), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word _piss_ was shortened to _pee_ (pronounced as the letter _P_) in this way.

Figures of speech

-   Ambiguous statements (_it_ for excrement, _the situation_ or _a girl in trouble_ for pregnancy, _passing away_ or _passed_ or _go_ for death, _do it_ or _come together_ in reference to a sexual act, _tired and emotional_ for drunkenness)
-   Understatements (_asleep_ for dead, _drinking_ for consuming alcohol, _hurt_ for injured, etc.)
-   Metaphors (_beat the meat_ or _choke the chicken_ or _jerkin' the gherkin_ for masturbation, _take a dump_ and _take a leak_ for defecation and urination respectively)
-   Comparisons (_buns_ for buttocks, _weed_ for cannabis)
-   Metonymy (_men's room_ for "men's toilet")

Rhetoric

Euphemism may be used as a rhetorical strategy, in which case its goal is to change the valence of a description from positive to negative.

Slang

The use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, _screwed up_ is a euphemism for _fucked up_; _hook-up_ and _laid_ are euphemisms for sexual intercourse.

There is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase _visually impaired_ is labeled as a politically correct euphemism for _blind_ or a blind person. However, _visual impairment_ can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word _blind_.

Words from a foreign language

Expressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word _enceinte_ was sometimes used instead of the English word _pregnant_.[8] This practice of word substitution became so frequent that the expression "_pardon my French_" was adopted in attempts to excuse the use of profanity.

Evolution

Euphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. Periphrasis, or circumlocution, is one of the most common: to "speak around" a given word, implying it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.

To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a swear word) to form a euphemism is known as _taboo deformation_, or a minced oath. In American English, words that are unacceptable on television, such as _fuck_, may be represented by deformations such as _freak_, even in children's cartoons.[9] Feck is a minced oath popularised by the sitcom Father Ted. Some examples of rhyming slang may serve the same purpose: to call a person a _berk_ sounds less offensive than to call a person a _cunt_, though _berk_ is short for Berkeley Hunt, which rhymes with _cunt_.[10]

Bureaucracies frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as doublespeak expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term "sunshine units" for contamination by radioactive isotopes.[11] An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge often used the clause "imprisonment without right to correspondence": the person sentenced never had a chance to correspond with anyone because soon after imprisonment they would be shot.[12] As early as 1939, Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich used the term _Sonderbehandlung_ ("special treatment") to mean summary execution (most likely by hanging) of persons viewed as "disciplinary problems" by the Nazis even before commencing the systematic extermination of the Jews. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be "guided" (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps[13] after having been "evacuated" to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of _Endlösung der Judenfrage_ (the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question"), which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.[14]

A euphemism may itself devolve into a taboo word, through the linguistic process known as semantic change (specifically pejoration) described by W. V. O. Quine,[15] and more recently dubbed the "EUPHEMISM TREADMILL" by Harvard professor Steven Pinker.[16] For instance, _toilet_ is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism _house-of-office_, which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms _privy-house_ and _bog-house_.[17] In the 20th century, where the words _lavatory_ or _toilet_ were deemed inappropriate (e.g. in the United States), they were sometimes replaced with _bathroom_ or _water closet_, which in turn became _restroom_, _W.C._, or _washroom_.

The word _shit_ appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the Proto-Indo-European root *_sḱeyd-_, from which it was derived, meant "to cut off".[18]

Euphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language. An example is the "pregnant fireman" type of children's solecism, where a child might hear someone define pregnancy euphemistically as "carrying a child," then mistakenly extend that meaning and refer to a fireman literally carrying a child as pregnant.


In popular culture

Doublespeak is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a "Ministry of Peace" which wages war, and a "Ministry of Love" which imprisons and tortures. It is a portmanteau of the terms _Newspeak_ and _doublethink_, which originate from George Orwell's novel _Nineteen Eighty-Four_.

The word _euphemism_ itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special _Halloween Is Grinch Night_ (see Dr. Seuss), a child asks to go to the _euphemism_, where _euphemism_ is being used as a euphemism for _outhouse_. This euphemistic use of _euphemism_ also occurred in the play _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ where a character requests, "Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?"

In Wes Anderson's film _Fantastic Mr. Fox_, the replacement of swear words by the word _cuss_ became a humorous motif throughout the film.

In Tom Hanks's web series _Electric City_, the use of profanity has been censored by the word _expletive_. "[Expletive deleted]" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the Watergate tapes.

In Isaac Asimov's _Foundation_ series, the curses of the scientist Ebling Mis have all been replaced with the word _unprintable_. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story "Flies".

George Carlin has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.[19]

In _Battlestar Galactica_ (2004), use of the words "frak" and "fraking" was directly substituted for the English slang words "fuck" and "fucking", confounding the censors. Such usage further provided cross genre humor when American politicians and policy makers inartfully referred to the term "fracking", which is a term to describe the fracturing of subterranean rock to release interstitial fuels. Generally unaware of science fiction tropes, these politicians would inadvertently appear to be swearing "fucking" in their addressing the energy policy topics.
