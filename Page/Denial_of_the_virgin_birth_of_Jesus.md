'', held by Emperor Constantine (center) in this icon, specifically rejected that Jesus had a human father.[1]]]

DENIAL OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF JESUS is found among various groups and individuals throughout the history of Christianity. These groups and individuals often took an approach to Christology which understands Jesus to be human, the literal son of human parents.[2][3]

During the 19th century this view was sometimes called PSILANTHROPISM, a term which derives from the combination of the Greek (psilós), "plain," "mere" or "bare," and (ánthrōpos) "human." Psilanthropists then generally denied both the virgin birth of Jesus, and his divinity. Denial of the virgin birth is distinct from adoptionism, and may or may not be present in beliefs described as adoptionist.


Early Christianity

The group most closely associated with denial of the virgin birth were the Ebionites. However, Jerome does not say that all Ebionites denied the virgin birth, but only contrasts their view with the acceptance of the doctrine on the part of a related group, the Nazarenes.[4]Jostein Ådna _The Formation of the Early Church_ -3161485610

2005 - Page 269 "5.61), he makes a distinction between two kinds of Ebionites: one group denied the virgin birth, others did not. When describing the latter group, Eusebius notes that, despite the fact that they accepted the virgin birth, they were still heretics, ..."

The view was rejected by the ecumenical councils, especially in the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened to deal directly with the nature of Christ's divinity.[5]


Reformation

The turmoil of the Reformation threw up many radical groups and individuals, some of were accused of denying, or actually did deny, the virgin birth. For example during the trial of Lorenzo Tizzano before the Inquisition at Venice in 1550, it was charged that the circle of the late Juan de Valdés (died 1541) at Naples had included such individuals.[6] Early Unitarians, often called Socinians, after Laelio Sozzini who first published the first unitarian analysis of John's _Logos_ in 1550, were sometimes accused of denying the virgin birth, but mainly only denied the pre-existence of Christ in heaven. For Sozzini's better known nephew Fausto Sozzini the miraculous virgin birth was the element in their belief which removed the need for the pre-existence to which they objected.[7] The Socinians in fact excommunicated from their number the translator of the first Bible in Belarusian, Symon Budny, for his denial of the virgin birth.[8]

A large scale change among Unitarians to acceptance of a human father for Jesus took place only in the time of Joseph Priestley.[9] The young Samuel Taylor Coleridge was an example of what he called "a psilanthropist, one of those who believe our Lord to have been the real son of Joseph"[10] but later in life Coleridge decisively rejected this idea and accepted traditional Christian belief in the virgin birth.[11][12][13]


Today

Biblical scholars, churchmen and theologians who have notably rejected the virgin birth include:

-   Fritz Barth, Swiss Reformed minister, and father of Karl Barth, for whom the view cost him academic promotion.[14]
-   John Dominic Crossan, prominent member of the Jesus Seminar, author of _Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography_, who has stated, "I understand the virginal conception of Jesus to be a confessional statement about Jesus' status and not a biological statement about Mary's body. It is later faith in Jesus as an adult retrojected mythologically onto Jesus as an infant."[15]
-   Robert Funk, founder of the Jesus Seminar, and author of _Honest to Jesus_, who has asserted, "We can be certain that Mary did not conceive Jesus without the assistance of human sperm. It is unclear whether Joseph or some other unnamed male was the biological father of Jesus. It is possible that Jesus was illegitimate."Funk, Robert W. (1996). _Honest to Jesus: Jesus for a New Millennium_. HarperSanFrancisco, p. 294. ISBN

-   Jane Schaberg, feminist biblical scholar and author of ''The Illegitimacy of Jesus '', who contended that Matthew and Luke were aware that Jesus had been conceived illegitimately, probably as a result of rape, and had left hints of that knowledge, even though their main purpose was to explore the theological significance of Jesus' birth.[16]
-   Uta Ranke-Heinemann, who contends that the virgin birth of Jesus was meant—and should be understood—as an allegory of a special initiative of God, comparable to God's creation of Adam, and in line with legends and allegories of antiquity.[17]
-   David Jenkins, Bishop of Durham from 1984 until 1994, was the first senior Anglican clergyman to come to the attention of the UK media for his position that "I wouldn't put it past God to arrange a virgin birth if he wanted. But I don't think he did."[18]

Sects and denominations

The _Divine Principle_, the textbook of the Unification movement (also called the Unification Church), a new religious movement founded in South Korea, does not include the teaching that Zechariah was the father of Jesus; however some of its members hold that belief based on the work of, British liberal theologian, Leslie Weatherhead.[19][20][21][22]
