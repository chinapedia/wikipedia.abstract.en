NOCERA DEI PAGANI (also _Nocera de' Pagani_) or NUCERIA PAGANORUM is the name under which was known in the past, between the 16th century and 1806, a _civitas_ that included a large portion of the Agro Nocerino-Sarnese, composed of 5 existing municipalities: Nocera Inferiore, Nocera Superiore, Pagani, Sant'Egidio del Monte Albino and Corbara. _Ugo dei Pagani_ came from Nocera dei Pagani. Reference to Nocera as his birthplace is found at least as early as Baedeker's _Southern Italy_ (1869)[1] and is also found in the Old Catholic Encyclopedia.[2] Two more recent writers say that the theory is supported by a letter that Hugues wrote from Palestine in 1103, in which he talked of writing to "my father in Nocera" to tell him of the death of his cousin Alessandro.[3][4]
