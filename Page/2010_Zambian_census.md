The 2010 ZAMBIAN CENSUS was conducted in Zambia in 2010 under the approval of the Government of Zambia, which recorded demographic data from 13 million people and 3.2 million households. The 2010 Census of Population and Housing was conducted between 16 October and 15 November 2010, with all parts of the country covered by 30 November 2010. It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for data capture. The census was funded by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Kingdom AID (UKAID-formerly DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), who contributed close to 60 per cent of the total expenditure and rest contributed by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Zambia.

As per the census, Zambia had a total population of 13,092,666 including 6,454,647 males (49.2%) and 6,638,019 females (50.8%) with a sex-ratio of 102.84.[1] The total literacy of the population above the age of five stood at 70.2 per cent.[2] Urban population constituted 39.51 per cent and the remaining 61.49 per cent resided in rural areas. The density of population was 17.4 persons per km² and the decadal growth of population was 2.8 per cent.[3] There were 22 major languages spoken in Zambia of which 33.5 per cent of the population spoke Bemba, making it the largest spoken language. Out of the seven broad ethnic groups, Bemba was the most prevalent tribal group (21.0%), followed by Tonga (13.6%).[4] The national average of active people stood at 55.5 per cent with 50.2 in rural areas and 65.3 per cent in urban areas. Unemployment rate was 13 per cent as of 2010.[5] Agriculture was the major occupation with 66.5 per cent involved in it.[6] The proportion of people living under poverty line was 60.5 per cent, while the extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent of the total population.

A Post Enumeration Survey (PES) was carried out to find the common issues to be considered into account for future census enumeration activities. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an undercount of 7.3 per cent. The undercount was more in rural areas with an estimated 9.5 per cent of the total population and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.


Background

Zambia_Urbanization.jpg The first complete census of Africans in Zambia was carried out in Zambia during May 1963, when the country was a British colony, while the enumeration of non-African people was performed during 1961.[7] Before the 2010 census enumeration, there were four census enumeration exercises carried out in independent Zambia during 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000.[8] Around 60 per cent of the 2010 census was funded by UNFPA, UKAID (formerly DFID), USAID and AfDB, while the rest was contributed by the Zambian Ministry of Finance.[9] UKAID allocated UK£3 million to the 2010 Zambian census during 2010-13 for financial and technical support.[10]

The second Group Decision Support System (GDDS2) expert mission (a wing of the World Bank) meeting on census enumeration took place during 23 – 27 February 2009, and it published a report with recommendations for the census enumeration. The report suggested using satellite imagery software, having frequent meetings with census steering committees, utilizing time-tested Optical Mark Reading (OMR) process for transferring data from census forms to computer-readable files or newer methods like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), assuring the quality of printing of the census questionnaires, taking Post-enumeration Survey (PES) on time, providing staff training for more in-depth census analysis, changing the population growth rate reporting structure, including measures from the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), publishing the census in a medium conducive for general audience, obtaining technical assistance for post-census population projections at the national, provincial and district level, re-projecting HIV prevalence, mortality, and AIDS orphanhood, and establishing a long-term Memorandum of understanding with a technical assistance organization like the US Census Bureau.[11]


Administration

The census enumeration was carried out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albinism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010.[12] The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining regions of the country were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.[13]


Release

Population_of_Zambia_1960_-_2010.svg The census report of 2010 Zambian census was released during the first week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”.[14] United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.[15]

The Government of Zambia also initiated the Central Statistics Office to review the census of 2010 to determine the eligible voters for the proposed referendum in 2016.[16]


Reports

The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent of the total population as against 42.7 per cent in 2007.[18] Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent.[19] Albinism is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 albino people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of albino population was 66.1 per cent.[20]

Errors and criticism

A study published by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions were found in census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated that the quality of data collection was better than the previous census enumerations.[54] Another study published in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors.[55] Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.[56]


Post Enumeration Survey

A Post-Enumeration Census (PES) was carried out three months after the completion of census enumeration in 2010. It was carried out with the help of African Development Bank, US Census Bureau and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).[57] The sample data chosen for the PES from the census of 1990 was based on the guidelines of United Nations Statistics Division. It accounted socio-demographic variability based on rural and urban population and having a proportional sample size for the PES. Majority of provinces of Zambia being rural, the survey had a higher sample size in rural areas.[58] It was the first time when the PES results were fully analyzed in Zambia compared to previous years when they were only partially analyzed. The PES was aimed at finding the common issues to be considered for future census enumeration activities.[59] PES was applied in every stage of sample design, enumeration, matching, reconciliation and the application of Dual System Estimation methodology. The major recommendations from PES were to have a pilot PES, have effective sample design and data collection of PES, match data between PES and actual enumeration by having correct names of respondents, computerize matching and include cell phone and telephone number of the respondents.[60] The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The estimated under count was 9.5 per cent of the total population in rural areas and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.[61]
