The _OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY'' (_OED'') is the principal historical dictionary of the English language, published by Oxford University Press (OUP). It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.[1][2] The second edition, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, was published in 1989.

Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of _A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society_. In 1895, the title _The Oxford English Dictionary_ was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title _The Oxford English Dictionary_ fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published.[3] Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which is complete.[4]

The first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million visits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will most likely only appear in electronic form: the Chief Executive of Oxford University Press has stated that it is unlikely that it will ever be printed.[5][6][7]


Historical nature

As a historical dictionary, the _Oxford English Dictionary_ explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages.[8] Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that the sense of the word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.

The format of the _OED_'s entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the _OED_, such as the early volumes of the _Deutsches Wörterbuch_, had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the _OED_ editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.[9]


Entries and relative size

According to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to "key in" the 59 million words of the _OED_ second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 megabytes to store them electronically.[10] As of 30 November 2005, the _Oxford English Dictionary_ contained approximately 301,100 main entries. Supplementing the entry headwords, there are 157,000 bold-type combinations and derivatives;[11] 169,000 italicized-bold phrases and combinations;[12] 616,500 word-forms in total, including 137,000 pronunciations; 249,300 etymologies; 577,000 cross-references; and 2,412,400 usage quotations. The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages. The longest entry in the _OED2_ was for the verb _set_, which required 60,000 words to describe some 430 senses. As entries began to be revised for the _OED3_ in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became _make_ in 2000, then _put_ in 2007, then _run_ in 2011.[13][14][15]

Despite its considerable size, the _OED_ is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the _Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca_ is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of _Dictionnaire de l'Académie française_ dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the _Diccionario de la lengua española_ (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Española), and its first edition was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.[16]

Origins

The dictionary began as a Philological Society project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to Oxford University):[17] Richard Chenevix Trench, Herbert Coleridge, and Frederick Furnivall, who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries. The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844,[18] but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an "Unregistered Words Committee" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries. In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study _On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries_, which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:[19]

-   Incomplete coverage of obsolete words
-   Inconsistent coverage of families of related words
-   Incorrect dates for earliest use of words
-   History of obsolete senses of words often omitted
-   Inadequate distinction among synonyms
-   Insufficient use of good illustrative quotations
-   Space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content.

The Society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly _comprehensive_ dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.[20] Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips. Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title _A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles_ (_NED_).[21]

Early editors

Richard Chenevix Trench (1807–1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his appointment as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.[22]

FrederickJamesFurnivall.jpg, 1825–1910]]

On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.[23] In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.[24]

Furnivall thence became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work.[25] Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.

Furnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.[26] Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.[27]

In the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both Henry Sweet and Henry Nicol to succeed him. He then approached James Murray, who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.[28] The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived. It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.

Late in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named W. C. Minor was a criminal lunatic.[29] Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the American Civil War, and was confined to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of _The Surgeon of Crowthorne_ (US title: _The Professor and the Madman_[30]), a popular book about the creation of the _OED_.

Oxford editors

During the 1870s, the Philological Society was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.[31] They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the Philological Society president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.[32]

Murray started the project, working in a corrugated iron outbuilding called the "Scriptorium" which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips.[33] He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of quotation slips, which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for _abusion_ as for _abuse_.[34] He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report "as many quotations as you can for ordinary words" and for words that were "rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way".[35] Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.[36]

The first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884—twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages. The full title was _A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society_; the 352-page volume, words from _A_ to _Ant_, cost 12s 6d.[37] (or about $668.24 in 2013) The total sales were only 4,000 copies.[38]

The OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.[39] The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.[40]

78_Banbury_Road_Oxford_20060715.jpg, house, erstwhile residence of James Murray, Editor of the _Oxford English Dictionary_]] Murray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.[41]

Gell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns—containing costs and speeding production—to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the _Saturday Review_, and public opinion backed the editors.[42] Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.

Neither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with _A–D_, _H–K_, _O–P_, and _T_, nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed _E–G_, _L–M_, _S–Sh_, _St_, and _W–We_. By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble. William Craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for _N_, _Q–R_, _Si–Sq_, _U–V_, and _Wo–Wy._[43] The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor.[44][45] The fourth editor was Charles Talbut Onions, who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914: _Su–Sz_, _Wh–Wo_, and _X–Z_.[46]

In 1919–1920, J. R. R. Tolkien was employed by the _OED_, researching etymologies of the _Waggle_ to _Warlock_ range;[47] later he parodied the principal editors as "The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford" in the story _Farmer Giles of Ham_.[48]

By early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for _A–B_, five for _C_, and two for _E_.[49] Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break). At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d. If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together. This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff.[50] Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles.[51] Also in 1895, the title _Oxford English Dictionary_ was first used. It then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles; the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else.[52]

Completion of first edition and first supplement

The 125th and last fascicle covered words from _Wise_ to the end of _W_ and was published on 19 April 1928, and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately.[53]

William Shakespeare is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with _Hamlet_ his most-quoted work. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer. Collectively, the Bible is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is _Cursor Mundi_.[54]

By 1933 enough additional material had been compiled to publish a one-volume supplement.[55] Also in 1933 the entire dictionary was re-issued under the title "_The Oxford English Dictionary_" as a set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement,[56] this 13 volume edition was subsequently reprinted in 1961 and 1970.

Second supplement

In 1933, Oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest; all work ended, and the quotation slips went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.[57]

There were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.

Robert Burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement;[58] Onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well. The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years.[59] It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement _(OEDS)_ had grown to four volumes, starting with _A_, _H_, _O_, and _Sea_. They were published in 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986 respectively, bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes, or 17 counting the first supplement.

Burchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech. Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. Burchfield also removed, for unknown reasons, many entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement.[60] In 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's claim that he included more such words. The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English. Some of these had only a single recorded usage, but many had multiple recorded citations, and it ran against what was thought to be the established _OED_ editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to "World English".[61][62][63]

Revised American edition

This was published in 1968 at 300 dollars. There were changes in the arrangement of the volumes - for example volume 7 covered only N-Poy, the remaining "P" entries being transferred to volume 8.

Second edition

By the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would need to be computerized. Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching – as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text. Preparation for this process began in 1983, and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of Timothy J. Benbow, with John A. Simpson and Edmund S. C. Weiner as co-editors.[64] In 2016, Simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the OED. See _The Word Detective: Searching for the Meaning of It All at the Oxford English Dictionary – A Memoir._ Basic Books, New York.

OED-LEXX-Bungler.jpg] Thus began the _New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED)_ project. In the United States, more than 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now Reed Tech) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England.[65] Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by marking up the content in SGML.[66] A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the _Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary_, led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology went on to become the basis for the Open Text Corporation.[67] Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, LEXX, was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM.[68] The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database. A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in _Time_ as saying "I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline."[69]

By 1989, the _NOED_ project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary. The word "new" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the _OED,_ or the _OED2,_ was published. The first edition retronymically became the _OED1_.

The _Oxford English Dictionary 2_ was printed in 20 volumes.[70] Up to a very late stage, all the volumes of the first edition were started on letter boundaries. For the second edition, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size. The 20 volumes started with _A_, _B.B.C._, _Cham_, _Creel_, _Dvandva_, _Follow_, _Hat_, _Interval_, _Look_, _Moul_, _Ow_, _Poise_, _Quemadero_, _Rob_, _Ser_, _Soot_, _Su_, _Thru_, _Unemancipated_, and _Wave_.

The content of the _OED2_ is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter.[71] Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the _OED2_ adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet.[72][73] Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.[74]

The British quiz show _Countdown_ has awarded the leather-bound complete version to the champions of each series since its inception in 1982.[75]

When the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic. Author Anthony Burgess declared it "the greatest publishing event of the century", as quoted by the _Los Angeles Times_.[76] _Time_ dubbed the book "a scholarly Everest",[77] and Richard Boston, writing for _The Guardian_, called it "one of the wonders of the world".[78]

Additions series

The supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the _OED_ as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition. Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary. Yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories, outdated historical information, and moral values that were no longer widely accepted.[79][80] Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.[81]

Accordingly, it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems.[82] The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the _Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series,_ a new set of supplements to complement the _OED2_ with the intention of producing a third edition from them.[83] The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full A–Z range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.[84]

However, in the end only three _Additions_ volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997,[85][86][87] each containing about 3,000 new definitions.[88] The possibilities of the World Wide Web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved. New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before.[89] A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.

Third edition

Beginning with the launch of the first _OED Online_ site in 2000, the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary (_OED3_), expected to be completed in 2037[90][91] at a projected cost of about £34 million.[92][93]

Revisions were started at the letter _M_, with new material appearing every three months on the _OED Online_ website. The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the _OED1_ generally tended to be better than the earlier ones. However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating "key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them".[94] With the relaunch of the _OED Online_ website in December 2010, alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether.[95]

The revision is expected to roughly double the dictionary in size.[96][97] Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole.[98][99] While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, account books, diaries, journals, and letters.[100]

John Simpson was the first chief editor of the _OED3_. He retired in 2013 and was replaced by Michael Proffitt, who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.[101]

The production of the new edition exploits computer technology, particularly since the June 2005 inauguration of the "Perfect All-Singing All-Dancing Editorial and Notation Application", or "Pasadena". With this XML-based system, lexicographers can spend less effort on presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions. This system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.[102]

Other important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and email submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.[103]

New entries and words

_Wordhunt_ was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced antedatings for many. The results were reported in a BBC TV series, _Balderdash and Piffle_. The _OED_{{'}}s readers contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.[104]

_OED_ currently contains over 600,000 entries.[105] They update the OED on a quarterly basis to make up for its Third Edition revising their existing entries and adding new words and senses.[106]

More than 600 new words, senses, and subentries have been added to the OED in December 2018, including "to drain the swamp", "TGIF", and "burkini".[107] South African editions were added too like "eina", "dwaal", and "amakhosi".[108] The "taffety tarts" word entered the OED for the first time.[109]


Formats

Compact editions

In 1971, the 13-volume _OED1_ (1933) was reprinted as a two-volume _Compact Edition_, by photographically reducing each page to one-half its linear dimensions; each compact edition page held four _OED1_ pages in a four-up ("4-up") format. The two volume letters were _A_ and _P_; the first supplement was at the second volume's end. The _Compact Edition_ included, in a small slip-case drawer, a magnifying glass to help in reading reduced type. Many copies were inexpensively distributed through book clubs. In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the _Compact Edition_.

In 1991, for the 20-volume _OED2_ (1989), the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up ("9-up") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary. It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and _A User's Guide to the "Oxford English Dictionary"_, by Donna Lee Berg.[110] After these volumes were published, though, book club offers commonly continued to sell the two-volume 1971 _Compact Edition_.[111]

-   The _Compact Oxford English Dictionary_ (second edition, 1991, ): Includes definitions of 500,000 words, 290,000 main entries, 137,000 pronunciations, 249,300 etymologies, 577,000 cross-references, and over 2,412,000 illustrative quotations, a magnifying glass.

Electronic versions

Once the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on CD-ROM. The text of the first edition was made available in 1987.[112] Afterward, three versions of the second edition were issued. Version 1 (1992) was identical in content to the printed second edition, and the CD itself was not copy-protected. Version 2 (1999) included the _Oxford English Dictionary_ _Additions_ of 1993 and 1997.

Version 3.0 was released in 2002 with additional words from the _OED3_ and software improvements. Version 3.1.1 (2007) added support for hard disk installation, so that the user does not have to insert the CD to use the dictionary. It has been reported that this version will work on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, using emulation programs.[113][114] Version 4.0 of the CD has been available since June 2009 and works with Windows 7 and Mac OS X (10.4 or later).[115] This version uses the CD drive for installation, running only from the hard drive.

On 14 March 2000, the _Oxford English Dictionary Online_ (_OED Online_) became available to subscribers.[116] The online database contains the entire _OED2_ and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the _OED3_ (see above). The online edition is the most up-to-date version of the dictionary available. The _OED_ web site is not optimized for mobile devices, but the developers have stated that there are plans to provide an API that would enable developers to develop different interfaces for querying the _OED_.[117]

The price for an individual to use this edition is £195 or US$295 every year, even after a reduction in 2004; consequently, most subscribers are large organizations such as universities. Some public libraries and companies have subscribed, as well, including public libraries in the United Kingdom, where access is funded by the Arts Council,[118] and public libraries in New Zealand.[119][120] Individuals who belong to a library which subscribes to the service are able to use the service from their own home without charge.

Relationship to other Oxford dictionaries

The _OED_'s utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the Oxford name, though not all are directly related to the _OED_ itself.

The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,_ originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933,[122] is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus, but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the King James Bible.[123] A completely new edition was produced from the _OED2_ and published in 1993,[124] with revisions in 2002 and 2007.

The _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus. The original edition, mostly based on the _OED1_, was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.[125] Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.

_The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English_ was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise. Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.[126]

In 1998 the _New Oxford Dictionary of English_ (_NODE_) was published. While also aiming to cover current English, _NODE_ was not based on the _OED_. Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics.[127] Once _NODE_ was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ followed, this time based on an abridgement of _NODE_ rather than the _OED_; _NODE_ (under the new title of the _Oxford Dictionary of English_, or _ODE_) continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the _New Oxford American Dictionary_, with the _OED_ now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.


Spelling

The _OED_ lists British headword spellings (e.g., _labour_, _centre_) with variants following (_labor_, _center_, etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt _-ise_ in British English, OUP policy dictates a preference for the spelling _-ize_, e.g., _realize_ vs. _realise_ and _globalization_ vs. _globalisation_. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix _-ιζειν_, (_-izein_), or the Latin _-izāre_.[128] However, _-ze_ is also sometimes treated as an Americanism insofar as the _-ze_ suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with _analyse_ (British English), which is spelt _analyze_ in American English.[129][130]


Reception

British prime minister Stanley Baldwin described the _OED_ as a "national treasure".[131] Author Anu Garg, founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a "lex icon".[132] Tim Bray, co-creator of Extensible Markup Language (XML), credits the _OED_ as the developing inspiration of that markup language.[133]

However, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority,[134] the dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely _because_ of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes,[135] its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,[136] University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the _OED_ is extremely difficult because "one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution", one that "has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle". He further notes that neologisms from respected "literary" authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less "respectable" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the _OED_'s "[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as "_erroneous_" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the "social bias[es]" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of "erroneous and catachrestic" usages is being removed from third edition entries,[137] sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.[138]

Harris also faults the editors' "donnish conservatism" and their adherence to prudish Victorian morals, citing as an example the non-inclusion of "various centuries-old 'four-letter words{{'"}} until 1972. However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the _Lady Chatterley's Lover_ obscenity trial in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word _fuck_ was the _Penguin English Dictionary_ of 1965.[139] Joseph Wright's _English Dialect Dictionary_ had included _shit_ in 1905.[140]

The _OED_{{'}}s claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.[141]

Founding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word "radium" to the dictionary.[142]

[11] A bold type combination has a significantly different meaning from the sum of its parts, for instance SAUNA-LIKE is unlike an actual sauna.

[12] Italicized combinations are obvious from their parts (for example _television aerial_), unlike bold combinations.
