Alto_Adige_in_history.png ALTO ADIGE (DISTRICT) was a district in the "Department of Benaco" in the Napoleon's Cisalpine Republic (1797-1798).


History

Under the Cisalpine Republic a District of Alto Adige (called in Italian: _Distretto dell'Alto Adige_) was created as a part of the short-lived "Department of Benaco". The District of Alto Adige included some municipalities of today's province of Verona.[1][2]

In 1797 the Cisalpine Republic was created on July 27, with the capital of the unified state being Milan. Napoleon Buonaparte announced the union of Valtelline with the republic, after its secession from the Swiss Three Grey Leagues. Austria acknowledged the new entity in the Treaty of Campoformio of October 17, gaining in exchange what remained of the Venetian Republic. New departments joined the eleven original ones and Valtelline in the following months: Benaco (Desenzano) on March 1798, Mella (Brescia) and Mincio (Mantua) on May, together with five departments of Emilia.

The "Department of Benaco", which was created in 1797 and included some territories of actual Province of Trento and Province of Verona, was disbanded in 1798 and with it the District of Alto Adige after a structural reorganization of the Napoleon's first Italian republic.

The _Alto Adige_ name was used again by Napoleon in 1810, a few kilometres to the north of the disappeared Alto Adige District on the upper course of the river Adige, when was created the Department of Alto Adige with administrative capital Bolzano[3].
