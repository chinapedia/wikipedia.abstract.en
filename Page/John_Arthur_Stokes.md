JOHN ARTHUR STOKES was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement.[1] He grew up in the Jim Crow South and attended Robert Russa Moton High School, a segregated school for African Americans. Recognizing the inequalities he and his classmates faced, Stokes staged a walk out and refused to return to class until the school was rebuilt. He attended Virginia State University and became an educator in Baltimore, MD.[2]
