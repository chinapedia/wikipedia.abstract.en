LIPOIDAL ESTRADIOL (LE2) is the variety of endogenous C17β long-chain fatty acid esters of estradiol which are formed as metabolites of estradiol.[1][2] Important examples of these esters include estradiol arachidonate, estradiol lineolate, estradiol oleate, estradiol palmitate, and estradiol stearate.[3][4] LE2 are estrogens but do not bind to the estrogen receptor, instead acting as prohormones of estradiol.[5][6] Relative to estradiol, they have far longer-lasting durations of effect due to their much slower rates of metabolism and clearance.[7][8] It has been hypothesized that LE2 may serve as a store of estrogen for when estradiol levels become low.[9][10] LE2 are highly lipophilic and hydrophobic and are found in highest concentrations in adipose tissue and other estrogen-sensitive tissues and in low but detectable concentrations in circulation, with none excreted in urine.[11][12] They have been referred to as the "endogenous counterparts of the synthetic esters of estrogens" like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate.[13][14]

Two of the estradiol esters that compose LE2, estradiol palmitate and estradiol stearate, have been developed and marketed for medical use as long-acting estrogens for use via depot intramuscular injection.[15][16]

Estradiol is esterified into LE2 by lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT).[17]
