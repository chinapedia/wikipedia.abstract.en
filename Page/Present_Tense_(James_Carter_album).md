_PRESENT TENSE_ is an album by saxophonist James Carter released on the EmArcy label in 2008.[1]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek says, "_Present Tense_ showcases Carter at his most disciplined and ambitious ... This may be Carter's finest album because of its insistence on the balance between restraint and adventure".[2] In _JazzTimes_ David R. Adler called the album "an unselfconscious mix of influences, more three-dimensional than his various tribute discs and the recent organ-trio blowouts".[3] On _All About Jazz_ Greg Camphire noted, "This solid, straight-ahead outing sounds both "old-timey" (in the best sense), with deep roots in blues and swing; and exploratory, never sacrificing Carter's personal approach, while maintaining his place in the jazz tradition".[4] _The Guardian_ critic John Fordham wrote, "The whole set is a jazz history, rescued from cheesiness by Carter's mastery of every technical detail".[5]
