The meaning of the word _AMERICAN_ in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. _American_ is derived from _America_, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America.

In modern English, _American_ generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.[1] However, this usage is seen by some as a semantic "misappropriation" by those who argue that "American" should be widened in English to also include people or things from anywhere in the American continents.[2][3]

The word can be used as either an adjective or a noun (viz. a demonym). In adjectival use, it means "of or relating to the United States"; for example, "Elvis Presley was an American singer" or "the man prefers American English". In its noun form, the word generally means a resident or citizen of the US, or occasionally someone whose ethnic identity is simply "American". The noun is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the United States.[4] When used with a grammatical qualifier, the adjective _American_ can mean "of or relating to the Americas", as in Latin American or Indigenous American. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in "American Spanish dialects and pronunciation differ by country", or the name of the Organization of American States. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, for instance, "In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest".

Compound constructions such as "African Americans" likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the United States of America, as does the prefix "Americo-". For instance, the Americo-Liberians and their language Merico derive their name from the fact that they are descended from African American settlers, i.e. former slaves in the United States of America.


Other languages

French, German, Italian, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian speakers may use cognates of _American_ to refer to inhabitants of the Americas or to U.S. nationals. They generally have other terms specific to U.S. nationals, such as the German __,[5] French __,[6] Japanese ,[7] Arabic __ ( as opposed to __ ),[8] and Italian __.[9] These specific terms may be less common than the term _American_.[10]

In French, __, __ or __, from __ ("United States of America"), is a rarely used word that distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective __, which denotes persons and things from the United States, but may also refer to "the Americas".[11]

Likewise, German's use of __ and __[12] observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. Note that in normal parlance, the adjective "American" and its direct cognates are usually used if the context renders the nationality of the person clear.

This differentiation is prevalent in German-speaking countries, as indicated by the style manual of the _Neue Zürcher Zeitung_ (one of the leading German-language newspapers in Switzerland) which dismisses the term __ as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with _amerikanisch_.[13] The respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of Austria, Germany and Switzerland all prescribe _Amerikaner_ and _amerikanisch_ in reference to the United States for official usage, making no mention of __ or __.[14]

Portuguese has __, denoting both a person or thing from the Americas and a U.S. national.[15] For referring specifically to a U.S. national and things, some words used are __ (also spelled __, "United States person"), from __, and __ ("Yankee")—both usages exist in Brazil, but are uncommon in Portugal—but the term most often used, and the only one in Portugal, is __, even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc. as well.

In Spanish, __ denotes geographic and cultural origin in the New World, as well as (infrequently) a U.S. citizen;[16][17] the more common term is __ ("United States person"), which derives from __ ("United States of America"). The Spanish term __ ("North American") is frequently used to refer things and persons from the United States, but this term can also denote people and things from Canada and Mexico.[18] Among Spanish-speakers, North America generally doesn't include Central America or the Caribbean.

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion. For example, the Chinese word for "U.S. national" is __ ()[19] is derived from a word for the United States, __, where __ is an abbreviation for _Yàměilìjiā_ ("America") and __ is "country".[20][21][22] The name for the American continents is __, from __ plus __ ("continent").[23] Thus, a __ is an American in the continent sense, and a __ is an American in the U.S. sense.

Conversely, in Czech, there is no possibility for disambiguation. _Američan_ (m.) and _američanka_ (f.) can refer to persons from the United States or from the continents of the Americas, and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings. For this reason, the latter meaning is very rarely used, and word _američan(ka)_ is used almost exclusively to refer to persons from the United States. The usage is exactly parallel to the English word.

Korean and Vietnamese also use unambiguous terms, with Korean having __ () for the country versus __ () for the continents,[24] and Vietnamese having __ for the country versus __ for the continents. Japanese has such terms as well (__ [ versus __ []), but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech, where __ predominates.

In Swahili, __ means specifically the United States, and __ is a U.S. national, whereas the international form __ refers to the continents, and __ would be an inhabitants thereof.[25][26][27] Likewise, the Esperanto word __ refers to the continents. For the country there is the term __. Thus, a citizen of the United States is an __, whereas an __ is an inhabitant of the Americas.[28][29][30][31]

In Hungarian the term amerikai (American) refers to a person or a thing from the United States.


History

.[32]]] The name _America_ was coined by Martin Waldseemüller from _Americus Vespucius_, the Latinized version of the name of Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512), the Italian explorer who mapped South America's east coast and the Caribbean Sea in the early 16th century. Later, Vespucci's published letters were the basis of Waldseemüller's 1507 map, which is the first usage of _America_. The adjective _American_ subsequently denoted the New World.

16th-century European usage of _American_ denoted the native inhabitants of the New World.[33] The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in Thomas Hacket's 1568 translation of André Thévet's book _France Antarctique_; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as _Ameriques_.[34] In the following century, the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of "English-American" dates to 1648, in Thomas Gage's _The English-American his travail by sea and land: or, a new survey of the West India's_.[35]

In English, _American_ was used especially for people in the British America. Samuel Johnson, the leading English lexicographer, wrote in 1775, before the United States declared independence: "That the Americans are able to bear taxation is indubitable."[36] The Declaration of Independence of July 1776 refers to "[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the United States of America" on July 4, 1776.[37] The official name of the country was reaffirmed on November 15, 1777, when the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, the first of which says, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'". The Articles further state: Sam Haselby, a history professor in Lebanon and Egypt, claims it was British officials who first called the colonists "Americans". When the drafters of the _Declaration_—Thomas Jefferson from Virginia, for example, or John Adams from Massachusetts—talked about "my country", they meant Virginia or Massachusetts, respectively. This situation was changed by the Revolution and the impulse toward nationalism.[38] Jefferson, newly elected president in May 1801 wrote, "I am sure the measures I mean to pursue are such as would in their nature be approved by every American who can emerge from preconceived prejudices; as for those who cannot, we must take care of them as of the sick in our hospitals. The medicine of time and fact may cure some of them."[39]

In _The Federalist Papers_ (1787–88), Alexander Hamilton and James Madison used the adjective _American_ with two different meanings: one political and one geographic; "the American republic" in Federalist No. 51 and in Federalist No. 70,[40][41] and, in Federalist No. 24, Hamilton used _American_ to denote the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders.[42]

Early official U.S. documents show inconsistent usage; the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France used "the United States of North America" in the first sentence, then "the said United States" afterwards; "the United States of America" and "the United States of North America" derive from "the United Colonies of America" and "the United Colonies of North America". The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795, between the United States and the Barbary States contains the usages "the United States of North America", "citizens of the United States", and "American Citizens".[43]

'' (1796)]] U.S. President George Washington, in his 1796 _Farewell Address_, declaimed that "The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation."[44] Political scientist Virginia L. Arbery notes that, in his _Farewell Address_:

  "...Washington invites his fellow citizens to view themselves now as Americans who, out of their love for the truth of liberty, have replaced their maiden names (Virginians, South Carolinians, New Yorkers, etc.) with that of “American”. Get rid of, he urges, “any appellation derived from local discriminations.” By defining himself as an American rather than as a Virginian, Washington set the national standard for all citizens. "Over and over, Washington said that America must be something set apart. As he put it to Patrick Henry, 'In a word, I want an _American_ character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for _ourselves_ and not for _others_.'"[45]

As the historian Garry Wills has noted: "This was a theme dear to Washington. He wrote to Timothy Pickering that the nation 'must never forget that we are Americans; the remembrance of which will convince us we ought not to be French or English'."[46] Washington's countrymen subsequently embraced his exhortation with notable enthusiasm.

This semantic divergence among North American anglophones, however, remained largely unknown in the Spanish-American colonies. In 1801, the document titled _Letter to American Spaniards_—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced Venezuela's Act of Independence and its 1811 constitution.[47]

The Latter-day Saints' Articles of Faith refer to the American continents as where they are to build Zion.[48]

Common short forms and abbreviations are the _United States_, the _U.S._, the _U.S.A._, and _America_; colloquial versions include the _U.S. of A._ and _the States_. The term _Columbia_ (from the Columbus surname) was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is present today in the District of Columbia's name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.


Usage at the United Nations

Use of the term _American_ for U.S. nationals is common at the United Nations, and financial markets in the United States are referred to as "American financial markets".[49]

_American Samoa_ is a recognized territorial name at the United Nations.[50]


Cultural views

Spain and Hispanic America

The use of _American_ as a national demonym for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Hispanic Americans.[51] Spanish speakers in Spain and Latin America use the term __ to refer to people and things from the United States (from __), while __ refers to the continents as a whole.[52][53] The term __ is also accepted in many parts of Latin America to refer to a person or something from the United States,[54] however this term may be ambiguous in certain parts. Up to and including the 1992 edition, the __, published by the Real Academia Española, did not include the United States definition in the entry for __; this was added in the 2001 edition.[55][56] The Real Academia Española advised against using __ exclusively for U.S. nationals:[57][58]

Canada

Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as _Americans_, though they seldom refer to the United States as _America_; they use the terms _the United States_, _the U.S._, or (informally) _the States_ instead.[59] Canadians rarely apply the term _American_ to themselves – some Canadians resent either being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or others' inability, particularly of those overseas, to distinguish Canadian from American accents.[60] Some Canadians have protested the use of _American_ as a national demonym.[61] People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as "Other North American origins" by Statistics Canada for purposes of census counts.[62]

Portugal and Brazil

Generally, __ denotes "U.S. citizen" in Portugal.[63] Usage of __ to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, because the specific word __ (also __) clearly denotes a person from the United States. The term currently used by the Portuguese press is __.

In Brazil, the term __ is used to address both that which pertains to both American continents and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.; the particular meaning is deduced from context. Alternatively, the term __ ("North American") is also used in more informal contexts, while __ (of the U.S.) is the preferred form in academia. Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media. The term __ is used almost exclusively for the continents, and the U.S. is called __ ("United States") or __ ("United States of America"), often abbreviated __.

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use "in America" as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.[64]


In other contexts

"American" in the 1994 _Associated Press Stylebook_ was defined as, "An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America." Elsewhere, the _AP Stylebook_ indicates that "United States" must "be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective."[65]

The entry for "America" in _The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage_ from 1999 reads:

Media releases from the Pope and Holy See frequently use "America" to refer to the United States, and "American" to denote something or someone from the United States.[66]

International law

At least one international law uses _U.S. citizen_ in defining a citizen of the United States rather than _American citizen_; for example, the English version of the North American Free Trade Agreement includes:

Many international treaties use the terms _American_ and _American citizen_:

-   1796 – The treaty between the United States and the Dey of the Regency of Algiers on March 7, 1796, protected "American citizens".[67]
-   1806 – The Louisiana Purchase Treaty between France and United States referred to "American citizens".[68]
-   1825 – The treaty between the United States and the Cheyenne tribe refers to "American citizen"s.[69]
-   1848 – The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between Mexico and the U.S. uses "American Government" to refer to the United States, and "American tribunals" to refer to U.S. courts.[70]
-   1858 – The Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan protected "American citizens" and also used "American" in other contexts.[71]
-   1898 – The Treaty of Paris ending the Spanish–American War, known in Spanish as the __ ("Spain–United States War") uses "American" in reference to United States troops.[72]
-   1966 – The United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity protects "Americans" and "American corporations".[73]

U.S. commercial regulation

Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as "Made in the USA" must be, as set by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), "all or virtually all made in the U.S." The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of "American Made" to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: "The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin."[74]


Alternatives

There are a number of alternatives to the demonym _American_ as a citizen of the United States that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is _Usonian_, which usually describes a certain style of residential architecture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have fallen into disuse and obscurity. _Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage_ says: Nevertheless, no alternative to _American_ is common.[75]
