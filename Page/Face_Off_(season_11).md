The eleventh season of the Syfy reality television series _FACE OFF_ (Styled as _Face Off All Stars_) premiered on January 24, 2017. This season features returning contestants ("All-Stars") from previous seasons.[1]

Unlike previous seasons, the contestants will not compete individually, but instead, will be paired in teams of two. Each team will compete to win immunity during one week, while eliminations will take place the following week. From episode 9 forward, the competition is individual and one contestant is eliminated each week. Cig Neutron was declared the winner on the season's finale.

Prizes for this season include a Hyundai Veloster and $100,000.[2]
