OAK RIDGE (formerly called DOUGLAS) is an unincorporated community in Pemiscot County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

Oak Ridge was laid out in 1895.[2] Oak Ridge was descriptively on account of the topography of the area.[3] The name of the post office was afterward changed to Douglas in order to avoid repetition with the similarly-named town of Oak Ridge, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.[4] A post office called Douglas was established in 1904, and remained in operation until 1922.[5] The name Douglas has since faded from use.[6]
