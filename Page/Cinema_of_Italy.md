The CINEMA OF ITALY comprises the films made within Italy or by Italian directors. The first Italian director is considered to be , a collaborator of the Lumière Brothers, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896. Since its beginning, Italian cinema has influenced film movements worldwide. As of 2018, Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film (the most of any country) as well as 12 Palmes d'Or (the second-most of any country), one Academy Award for Best Picture and many Golden Lions and Golden Bears.

Italy is the birthplace of Art Cinema and the stylistic aspect of film has been the most important factor in the history of Italian movies.[1][2] In the early 1900s, artistic and epic films such as _Otello_ (1906), _The Last Days of Pompeii_ (1908), _L'Inferno_ (1911), _Quo Vadis_ (1913), and _Cabiria_ (1914), were made as adaptations of books or stage plays. Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films. One of the first cinematic avante-garde movements, Italian Futurism, took place in Italy in the late 1910s. After a period of decline in the 1920s, the Italian film industry was revitalized in the 1930s with the arrival of sound film. A popular Italian genre during this period, the _Telefoni Bianchi_, consisted of comedies with glamorous backgrounds.[3]

While Italy's Fascist government provided financial support for the nation's film industry, most notably the construction of the Cinecittà studios (the largest film studio in Europe), it also engaged in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s were propaganda films. Post-World War II Italy saw the rise of the influential Italian neorealist movement, which launched the directorial careers of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, and Vittorio De Sica. Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favor of lighter films, such as those of the _Commedia all'italiana_ genre and important directors like Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved international stardom during this period.[4]

The Spaghetti Western achieved popularity in the mid-1960s, peaking with Sergio Leone's _Dollars Trilogy_, which featured enigmatic scores by composer Ennio Morricone. Erotic Italian thrillers, or _giallos_, produced by directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror genre worldwide. During the 1980s and 1990s, directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, Gabriele Salvatores and Roberto Benigni brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema.[5]

The country is also famed for its prestigious Venice Film Festival, the oldest film festival in the world, held annually since 1932 and awarding the Golden Lion.[6] In 2008 the Venice Days ("Giornate degli Autori"), a section held in parallel to the Venice Film Festival, has produced in collaboration with Cinecittà studios and the Ministry of Cultural Heritage a list of 100 films that have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978: the "100 Italian films to be saved".


History

Early years

'' (1911) the first full-length Italian feature film ever made]]

The French Lumière brothers commenced public screenings in Italy in 1896: in March 1896, in Rome and Milan; in April in Naples, Salerno and Bari; in June in Livorno; in August in Bergamo, Bologna and Ravenna; in October in Ancona;[7] and in December in Turin, Pescara and Reggio Calabria. Lumière trainees produced short films documenting everyday life and comic strips in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Pioneering Italian cinematographer Filoteo Alberini patented his "Kinetograph" during this period.[8]

The Italian film industry took shape between 1903 and 1908, led by three major organizations: Cines, based in Rome; and the Turin-based companies Ambrosio Film and Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and Naples, and these early companies quickly attained a respectable production quality and were able to market their products both within Italy and abroad.

Early Italian films typically consisted of adaptations of books or stage plays, such as Mario Caserini's _Otello_ (1906) and Arturo Ambrosio's 1908 adaptation of the novel, _The Last Days of Pompeii_. Also popular during this period were films about historical figures, such as Caserini's _Beatrice Cenci_ (1909) and Ugo Falena's _Lucrezia Borgia_ (1910). _L'Inferno_, produced by Milano Films in 1911, was the first full-length Italian feature film ever made.[9] Popular early Italian actors included Emilio Ghione, Alberto Collo, Bartolomeo Pagano, Amleto Novelli, Lyda Borelli, Ida Carloni Talli, Lidia Quaranta and Maria Jacobini.[10]

'' (1917)]]

Enrico Guazzone's 1913 film _Quo Vadis_ was one of the earliest "blockbusters" in cinema history, utilizing thousands of extras and a lavish set design. Giovanni Pastrone's 1914 film _Cabiria_ was an even larger production, requiring two years and a record budget to produce, and it was the first epic film ever made. Nino Martoglio's _Lost in Darkness_, also produced in 1914, documented life in the slums of Naples, and is considered a precursor to the Neorealist movement of the 1940s and 1950s.[11]

Between 1911 and 1919, Italy was home to the first avant-garde movement in cinema, inspired by the country's Futurism movement. The 1916 Manifesto of Futuristic Cinematography was signed by Filippo Marinetti, Armando Ginna, Bruno Corra, Giacomo Balla and others. To the Futurists, cinema was an ideal art form, being a fresh medium, and able to be manipulated by speed, special effects and editing. Most of the futuristic-themed films of this period have been lost, but critics cite _Thaïs_ (1917) by Anton Giulio Bragaglia as one of the most influential, serving as the main inspiration for German Expressionist cinema in the following decade.

The Italian film industry struggled against rising foreign competition in the years following World War I.[12] Several major studios, among them Cines and Ambrosio, formed the Unione Cinematografica Italiana to coordinate a national strategy for film production. This effort was largely unsuccessful, however, due to a wide disconnect between production and exhibition (some movies weren't released until several years after they were produced).[13] Among the notable Italian films of the late silent era were Mario Camerini's _Rotaio_ (1929) and Alessandro Blasetti's _Sun_ (1929).[14]

Cinecittà

studios]] In 1930, Gennaro Righelli directed the first Italian talking picture, _The Song of Love_. This was followed by Blasetti's _Mother Earth_ (1930) and _Resurrection_ (1931), and Camerini's _Figaro and His Great Day_ (1931). The advent of talkies led to stricter censorship by the Fascist government.[15]

During the 1930s, light comedies known as _telefoni bianchi_ ("white telephones") were predominant in Italian cinema.[16] These films, which featured lavish set designs, promoted conservative values and respect for authority, and thus typically avoided the scrutiny of government censors. Important examples of _telefoni bianchi_ include Guido Brignone's _Paradiso_ (1932), Carlo Bragaglia's _O la borsa o la vita_ (1933), and Righelli's _Together in the Dark_ (1935). Historical films such as Blasetti's _1860_ (1934) and Carmine Gallone's _Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal_ (1937) were also popular during this period.[17]

In 1934, the Italian government created the General Directorate for Cinema (_Direzione Generale per le Cinematografia_), and appointed Luigi Freddi its director. With the approval of Benito Mussolini, this directorate called for the establishment of a town southeast of Rome devoted exclusively to cinema, dubbed the _Cinecittà_ ("Cinema City"). Completed in 1937, the Cinecittà provided everything necessary for filmmaking: theaters, technical services, and even a cinematography school, the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, for younger apprentices. The Cinecittà studios were Europe's most advanced production facilities, and greatly boosted the technical quality of Italian films.[18] Many films are still shot entirely in Cinecittà.

During this period, Mussolini's son, Vittorio, created a national production company and organized the work of noted authors, directors and actors (including even some political opponents), thereby creating an interesting communication network among them, which produced several noted friendships and stimulated cultural interaction.

Neorealism

'' (1945), by Roberto Rossellini.]] By the end of World War II, the Italian "neorealist" movement had begun to take shape. Neorealist films typically dealt with the working class (in contrast to the _Telefoni Bianchi_), and were shot on location. Many neorealist films, but not all, utilized non-professional actors. Though the term "neorealism" was used for the first time to describe Luchino Visconti’s 1943 film, _Ossessione_, there were several important precursors to the movement, most notably Camerini's _What Scoundrels Men Are!_ (1932), which was the first Italian film shot entirely on location, and Blasetti's 1942 film, _Four Steps in the Clouds_.[19]

'' (1948), by Vittorio De Sica, ranked among the best movies ever made.]]

_Ossessione_ angered Fascist officials. Upon viewing the film, Vittorio Mussolini is reported to have shouted, "This is not Italy!" before walking out of the theater.[20] The film was subsequently banned in the Fascist-controlled parts of Italy. While neorealism exploded after the war, and was incredibly influential at the international level, neorealist films made up only a small percentage of Italian films produced during this period, as postwar Italian moviegoers preferred escapist comedies starring actors such as Totò and Alberto Sordi.[21]

Neorealist works such as Roberto Rossellini's trilogy _Rome, Open City_ (1945), _Paisà_ (1946), and _Germany, Year Zero_ (1948), with professional actors such as Anna Magnani and a number of non-professional actors, attempted to describe the difficult economic and moral conditions of postwar Italy and the changes in public mentality in everyday life. Visconti's _The Earth Trembles_ (1948) was shot on location in a Sicilian fishing village, and utilized local non-professional actors. Giuseppe De Santis, on other hand, used actors such as Silvana Mangano and Vittorio Gassman in his 1949 film, _Bitter Rice_, which is set in the Po Valley during rice-harvesting season.

Poetry and cruelty of life were harmonically combined in the works that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, _Shoeshine_ (1946), _The Bicycle Thief_ (1948) and _Miracle in Milan_ (1951). The 1952 film _Umberto D._ showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece and one of the most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.

Although _Umberto D._ is considered the end of the neorealist period, later films such as Federico Fellini's _La Strada_ (1954) and De Sica's 1960 film _Two Women_ (for which Sophia Loren won the Oscar for Best Actress) are grouped with the genre. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini's first film, _Accattone_ (1961), shows a strong neorealist influence.[22] Italian neorealist cinema influenced filmmakers around the world, and helped inspire other film movements, such as the French New Wave and the Polish Film School. The Neorealist period is often simply referred to as "The Golden Age" of Italian Cinema by critics, filmmakers, and scholars.

Pink neorealism and comedy

in _8½_ (1963) by Federico Fellini, considered to be one of the greatest films of all time]] It has been said that after _Umberto D._ nothing more could be added to neorealism. Possibly because of this, neorealism effectively ended with that film; subsequent works turned toward lighter atmospheres, perhaps more coherent with the improving conditions of the country, and this genre has been called _pink neorealism_. This trend allowed better-"equipped" actresses to become real celebrities, such as Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Silvana Pampanini, Lucia Bosé, Barbara Bouchet, Eleonora Rossi Drago, Silvana Mangano, Virna Lisi, Claudia Cardinale and Stefania Sandrelli. Soon pink neorealism, such as _Pane, amore e gelosia_ (1954, released in the US as _Frisky_) with Vittorio DeSica and Gina Lollobrigida, was replaced by the _Commedia all'italiana_, a unique genre that, born on an ideally humouristic line, talked instead very seriously about important social themes.

in his first movie _Hands Off Me!_ (1937)]]

At this time, on the more commercial side of production, the phenomenon of Totò, a Neapolitan actor who is acclaimed as the major Italian comic, exploded. His films (often with Peppino De Filippo and almost always with Mario Castellani) expressed a sort of neorealistic satire, in the means of a _guitto_ (a "hammy" actor) as well as with the art of the great dramatic actor he also was. A "film-machine" who produced dozens of titles per year, his repertoire was frequently repeated. His personal story (a prince born in the poorest _rione_ (section of the city) of Naples), his unique twisted face, his special mimic expressions and his gestures created an inimitable personage and made him one of the most beloved Italians of the 1960s.

Italian Comedy is generally considered to have started with Mario Monicelli's _I soliti Ignoti_ (_Big Deal on Madonna Street_, 1958) and derives its name from the title of Pietro Germi's _Divorzio all'Italiana_ (_Divorce Italian Style_, 1961). For a long time this definition was used with a derogatory intention.

Vittorio Gassman, Marcello Mastroianni, Ugo Tognazzi, Alberto Sordi, Claudia Cardinale, Monica Vitti and Nino Manfredi were among the stars of these movies, that described the years of the economical reprise and investigated Italian customs, a sort of self-ethnological research.

In 1961 Dino Risi directed _Una vita difficile_ (_A Difficult Life_), then _Il sorpasso_ (The Easy Life), now a cult-movie, followed by: _I Mostri_ (_The Monsters_, also known as _15 From Rome_), _In nome del Popolo Italiano_ (_In the Name of the Italian People_) and _Profumo di donna_ (_Scent of a Woman_).

Monicelli's works include _La grande guerra_ (_The Great War_), _I compagni_ (_Comrades_, also known as _The Organizer_), _L'Armata Brancaleone_, _Vogliamo i colonnelli_ (_We Want the Colonels_), _Romanzo popolare_ (Popular Novel) and the _Amici miei_ series.

A series of black-and-white films based on Don Camillo character created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred Fernandel as Don Camillo and Gino Cervi as Peppone. The titles are: _The Little World of Don Camillo_, _The Return of Don Camillo_, _Don Camillo's Last Round_, _Don Camillo: Monsignor_, and _Don Camillo in Moscow_. Mario Camerini began filming the film _Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi_ but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then completed in 1972 with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (_The World of Don Camillo_) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.

Hollywood on the Tiber

'' (1959) was shot at the Cinecittà studios and on location around Rome during the "Hollywood on the Tiber" era.]] In the late 1940s, Hollywood studios began to shift production abroad to Europe. Italy was, along with Britain, one of the major destinations for American film companies. Shooting at Cinecittà, large-budget films such as _Quo Vadis_ (1951), _Roman Holiday_ (1953), _Ben-Hur_ (1959), and _Cleopatra_ (1963) were made in English with international casts and sometimes, but not always, Italian settings or themes. The heyday of what was dubbed '"Hollywood on the Tiber" was between 1950 and 1970, during which time many of the most famous names in world cinema made films in Italy.

Peplum (a.k.a. Sword and Sandal)

With the release of 1958's _Hercules_, starring American bodybuilder Steve Reeves, the Italian film industry gained entree to the American film market. These films, many with mythological or Bible themes, were low-budget costume/adventure dramas, and had immediate appeal with both European and American audiences. Besides the many films starring a variety of muscle men as Hercules, heroes such as Samson and Italian fictional hero Maciste were common. Sometimes dismissed as low-quality escapist fare, the Peplums allowed newer directors such as Sergio Leone and Mario Bava a means of breaking into the film industry. Some, such as Mario Bava's _Hercules in the Haunted World_ (Italian: Ercole Al Centro Della Terra) are considered seminal works in their own right. As the genre matured, budgets sometimes increased, as evidenced in 1962's _I sette gladiatori_ (_The Seven Gladiators_ in 1964 US release), a wide-screen epic with impressive sets and matte-painting work. Most Peplum films were in color, whereas previous Italian efforts had often been black and white.

The Spaghetti Western

is credited as the inventor of the Spaghetti Western genre.]] On the heels of the Peplum craze, a related genre, the Spaghetti Western arose and was popular both in Italy and elsewhere. These films differed from traditional westerns by being filmed in Europe on limited budgets, but featured vivid cinematography.

The most popular Spaghetti Westerns were those of Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (_A Fistful of Dollars_, _For a Few Dollars More_, and _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_), featuring Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with _Once Upon a Time in the West_.

Also considered Spaghetti Westerns is a film genre which combined traditional western ambiance with a Commedia all'italiana-type comedy; films including _They Call Me Trinity_ and _Trinity Is STILL My Name!_, which featured Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, the stage names of Carlo Pedersoli and Mario Girotti.

Giallo (Thriller/Horror)

During the 1960s and 70s, Italian filmmakers Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, Antonio Margheriti and Dario Argento developed _giallo_ horror films that become classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: _Black Sunday_, _Castle of Blood_, _Twitch of the Death Nerve_, _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage_, _Deep Red_ and _Suspiria._

Due to the success of the James Bond film series the Italian film industry made large amounts of imitations and spoofs in the Eurospy genre from 1964-1967.

Following the 1960s boom of shockumentary "Mondo films" such as Gualtiero Jacopetti's _Mondo Cane_, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Italian cinema became internationally synonymous with violent horror films. These films were primarily produced for the video market and were credited with fueling the "video nasty" era in the United Kingdom.

Directors in this genre included Lucio Fulci, Joe D'Amato, Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato. Some of their films faced legal challenges in the United Kingdom; after the Video Recordings Act of 1984, it became a legal offense to sell a copy of such films as _Cannibal Holocaust_ and _SS Experiment Camp_. Italian films of this period are usually grouped together as exploitation films.

Several countries charged Italian studios with exceeding the boundaries of acceptability with their late-1970s Nazi exploitation films, inspired by American movies such as _Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS_. The Italian works included the notorious but comparatively tame _SS Experiment Camp_ and the far more graphic _Last Orgy of the Third Reich_ (Italian: L'ultima orgia del III Reich). These films showed, in great detail, sexual crimes against prisoners at concentration camps. These films may still be banned in the United Kingdom and other countries.

Poliziotteschi

]] POLIZIOTTESCHI (; plural of _POLIZIOTTESCO_) films constitute a subgenre of crime and action film that emerged in Italy in the late 1960s and reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s. They are also known as polizieschi, Italo-crime, Euro-crime or simply Italian crime films. Most notable international actors acted in this genre of films such Alain Delon, Henry Silva, Fred Williamson, Charles Bronson, Tomas Milian and others international stars.

The 1980s crisis

Between the late 1970s and mid 1980s, Italian cinema was in crisis; "art films" became increasingly isolated, separating from the mainstream Italian cinema.

Among the major artistic films of this era were _La città delle donne_, _E la nave va_, _Ginger and Fred_ by Fellini, _L'albero degli zoccoli_ by Ermanno Olmi (winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival), _La notte di San Lorenzo_ by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Antonioni's _Identificazione di una donna_, and _Bianca_ and _La messa è finita_ by Nanni Moretti. Although not entirely Italian, Bertolucci's _The Last Emperor_, winner of 9 Oscars, and _Once Upon a Time in America_ of Sergio Leone came out of this period also.

During this time, commedia sexy all'italiana films, described as "trash films", were popular in Italy. These comedy films were of little artistic value and reached their popularity by confronting Italian social taboos, most notably in the sexual sphere. Actors such as Lino Banfi, Diego Abatantuono, Alvaro Vitali, Gloria Guida, Barbara Bouchet and Edwige Fenech owe much of their popularity to these films.

Also considered part of the trash genre are films which feature Fantozzi, a comic personage invented by Paolo Villaggio. Although Villaggio's movies tend to bridge trash comedy with a more elevated social satire; this character had a great impact on Italian society, to such a degree that the adjective _fantozziano_ entered the lexicon. Of the many films telling of Fantozzi's misadventures, the most notable were _Fantozzi_ and _Il secondo tragico Fantozzi_.

1990 to present

has composed over 500 scores for cinema and television since 1946.]] A new generation of directors has helped return Italian cinema to a healthy level since the end of the 1980s. Probably the most noted film of the period is _Nuovo Cinema Paradiso_, for which Giuseppe Tornatore won a 1989 Oscar (awarded in 1990) for Best Foreign Language Film. This award was followed when Gabriele Salvatores's _Mediterraneo_ won the same prize for 1991. _Il Postino: The Postman_ (1994), directed by and starring Massimo Troisi, received five nominations at the Academy Awards, and won for Best Original Score. Another exploit was in 1998 when Roberto Benigni won three oscars for his movie _Life Is Beautiful_ (_La vita è bella)_ (Best Actor, Best Foreign Film, Best Music). In 2001 Nanni Moretti's film _The Son's Room_ (_La stanza del figlio_) received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

Other noteworthy recent Italian films include: _Jona che visse nella balena_ directed by Roberto Faenza, _Il grande cocomero_ by Francesca Archibugi, _The Profession of Arms_ (_Il mestiere delle armi_) by Olmi, _L'ora di religione_ by Marco Bellocchio, _Il ladro di bambini_, _Lamerica_, _The Keys to the House_ (_Le chiavi di casa_) by Gianni Amelio, _I'm Not Scared_ (_Io non ho paura_) by Gabriele Salvatores, _Le fate ignoranti_, _Facing Windows_ (_La finestra di fronte_) by Ferzan Özpetek, _Good Morning, Night_ (_Buongiorno, notte_) by Marco Bellocchio, _The Best of Youth_ (_La meglio gioventù_) by Marco Tullio Giordana, _The Beast in the Heart_ (_La bestia nel cuore_) by Cristina Comencini.

and Nicoletta Braschi]]

In 2008 Paolo Sorrentino's _Il Divo_, a biographical film based on the life of Giulio Andreotti, won the Jury prize and _Gomorra_, a crime drama film, directed by Matteo Garrone won the Gran Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.

Paolo Sorrentino's _The Great Beauty_ (_La Grande Bellezza_) won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The two highest-grossing Italian films in Italy have both been directed by Gennaro Nunziante and starred Checco Zalone: _Sole a catinelle_ (2013) with €51.8 million, and _Quo Vado?_ (2016) with €65.3 million.[23][24]

_They Call Me Jeeg_, a 2016 critically acclaimed superhero film directed by Gabriele Mainetti and starring Claudio Santamaria, won many awards, such as eight David di Donatello, two Nastro d'Argento, and a Globo d'oro.

Gianfranco Rosi's documentary film _Fire at Sea_ (2016) won the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. _They Call Me Jeeg_ and _Fire at Sea_ were also selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but they were not nominated.[25]

Other successful 2010s Italian films include: _Vincere_ by Marco Bellocchio, _The First Beautiful Thing_ (_La prima cosa bella_), _Human Capital_ (_Il capitale umano_) and _Like Crazy_ (_La pazza gioia_) by Paolo Virzì, _We Have a Pope_ (_Habemus Papam_) and _Mia Madre_ by Nanni Moretti, _Caesar Must Die_ (_Cesare deve morire_) by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, _Don't Be Bad_ (_Non essere cattivo_) by Claudio Caligari, _Romanzo Criminale_ by Michele Placido (that spawned a TV series, _Romanzo criminale - La serie_), _Youth_ (_La giovinezza_) by Paolo Sorrentino, _Suburra_ by Stefano Sollima, _Perfect Strangers_ (_Perfetti sconosciuti_) by Paolo Genovese, _Italian Race_ (_Veloce come il vento_) by Matteo Rovere, _Mediterranea_ and _A Ciambra_ by Jonas Carpignano, and _Tale of Tales_ (_Il racconto dei racconti_) and _Dogman_ by Matteo Garrone.

_Call Me by Your Name_ (2017), the final installment in Luca Guadagnino's thematic _Desire_ trilogy, following _I Am Love_ (2009) and _A Bigger Splash_ (2015), received widespread acclaim and numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2018.
