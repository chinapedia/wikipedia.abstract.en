LUCINDA BASSETT (born February 28, 1956) is an American self-help author and motivational speaker.[1][2][3] Her book _From Panic to Power: Proven Techniques to Calm Your Anxieties, Conquer Your Fears, and Put You in Control of Your Life_ is an international bestseller and has been translated into several languages.[4]


Career

Bassett developed a self-help program called "Attacking Anxiety and Depression" which was the subject of a study by the _Journal of Clinical Psychology_. The study of 176 participants found that roughly 50% of participants reported positive changes in their lives as a result of the program Bassett developed, which is comparable to the improvements made in private counseling with a licensed therapist.[5]

Bassett has been a guest on talk shows such as _Oprah Winfrey Show_ and _The View_.[6] On July 17, 2016, she was featured in Prevention Magazine, alongside various celebrities such as poet Maya Angelou and Sharon Osbourne, in an article entitled "Why You Love Your Age." [7]

Bassett founded the Midwest Center for Stress and Anxiety in 1984; she sold it in 2008 to focus on personal coaching.[8][9] Her infomercial "Attacking Anxiety and Depression" is one of the longest-running infomercials in history.[10][11]

In 2001, Bassett took part in a collaborative venture alongside Roberta Flack, Diana Krall, F. Murray Abraham, and Nona Hendryx, all of whom contributed a track to the meditation album "Visionary Path." Bassett narrated a track called "Mountains." 1
