NAHUEL MARIANO YERI (born 12 September 1991) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Primera B Nacional side Aldosivi.[1][2]


Career

Yeri's senior career began in 2010 with Primera División side Banfield.[3][4] On 7 February, in the 2009–10 season, Yeri made his Banfield debut in a 2–1 defeat against Chacarita Juniors. Three months later he made his second appearance for Banfield, versus Huracán.[5] In 2010–11, the following season, he again made two appearances. For 2011–12, Yeri didn't make an appearance for Banfield as he was loaned out to Primera B Nacional club Deportivo Merlo. Twenty-seven appearances followed before he returned to Banfield, who were relegated to the division Yeri had just played in.[6]

In Argentina's second tier, Yeri made sixteen appearances and scored three goals, but it wasn't enough as Banfield missed out on promotion by eight points.[7] Yeri featured heavily in the following season, 2013–14, as he made thirty-six appearances in Banfield's promotion-winning campaign as they won the Primera B Nacional title.[8] One goal in forty-one games came in the next three seasons for Yeri in the top-flight before he left Banfield as he joined fellow Primera División team Aldosivi in 2016. His first match for the club came on 30 August versus Colón.[9][10] He played seventeen times in his debut season as Aldosivi suffered relegation.[11]
