The spouse of anthropologist Victor Witter Turner ("Vic"; 1920–1983), "Edie" Turner was accomplished in her own right. In addition to collaborating with her husband on a number of early socio-cultural research projects concerning healing, ritual and _communitas_, she continued to develop these topics following his death in 1983, especially _communitas_. Edith Turner contributed to the study of humanistic anthropology and was a dedicated social activist her entire life.[1]
