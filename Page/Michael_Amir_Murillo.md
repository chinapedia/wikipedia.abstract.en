On 10 December 2015, Murillo played the entire match for San Francisco in the first edition of the Copa Panamá, as his side won the final against Chepo 5–4 on penalties, as the match finished 0–0 after extra time, to win their first title.[2] On 26 August 2015, Murillo helped San Francisco to a famous 2–1 victory over Mexican side Querétaro FC in a 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League match.[3]
