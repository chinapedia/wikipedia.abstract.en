STEPHEN JOSHUA SONDHEIM (; born March 22, 1930) is an American composer and lyricist known for more than a half-century of contributions to musical theatre. Sondheim has received an Academy Award, eight Tony Awards (more than any other composer,[1] including a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre), eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, a Laurence Olivier Award, and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom. He has been described by Frank Rich of _The New York Times_ as "now the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater".[2] His best-known works as composer and lyricist include _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_ (1962), _Company_ (1970), _Follies_ (1971), _A Little Night Music_ (1973), _Pacific Overtures_ (1976), _Sweeney Todd_ (1979), _Merrily We Roll Along_ (1981), _Sunday in the Park with George_ (1984), _Into the Woods_ (1987), _Assassins_ (1990), and _Passion_ (1994). He also wrote the lyrics for _West Side Story_ (1957), _Gypsy_ (1959), and _Do I Hear a Waltz?_ (1965).

Sondheim has written film music, contributing "Goodbye for Now" for Warren Beatty's 1981 _Reds_. He wrote five songs for 1990's _Dick Tracy_, including "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)", sung in the film by Madonna, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Sondheim was president of the Dramatists Guild from 1973 to 1981. To celebrate his 80th birthday, the former Henry Miller's Theatre was renamed the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on September 15, 2010, and the BBC Proms held a concert in his honor. Cameron Mackintosh has called Sondheim "possibly the greatest lyricist ever".[3]


Early years

Sondheim was born into a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Etta Janet ("Foxy," née Fox; 1897–1992) and Herbert Sondheim (1895–1966).[4] His father manufactured dresses designed by his mother. The composer grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and, after his parents divorced, on a farm near Doylestown, Pennsylvania. As the only child of well-to-do parents living in the San Remo on Central Park West, he was described in Meryle Secrest's biography (_Stephen Sondheim: A Life_) as an isolated, emotionally neglected child. When he lived in New York, Sondheim attended ECFS, the Ethical Culture Fieldston School known simply as "Fieldston". He later attended the New York Military Academy and George School, a private Quaker preparatory school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where he wrote his first musical, _By George,_[5] and from which he graduated in 1946. Sondheim spent several summers at Camp Androscoggin.[6] He later matriculated to Williams College and graduated in 1950.

He traces his interest in theatre to _Very Warm for May_, a Broadway musical he saw when he was nine. "The curtain went up and revealed a piano," Sondheim recalled. "A butler took a duster and brushed it up, tinkling the keys. I thought that was thrilling."[7]

When Sondheim was ten years old, his father (already a distant figure) had left his mother for another woman (Alicia, with whom he had two sons). Herbert sought custody of Stephen but was unsuccessful. Sondheim explained to biographer Secrest that he was "what they call an institutionalized child, meaning one who has no contact with any kind of family. You're in, though it's luxurious, you're in an environment that supplies you with everything but human contact. No brothers and sisters, no parents, and yet plenty to eat, and friends to play with and a warm bed, you know?"

Sondheim detested his mother,[8] who was said to be psychologically abusive[9] and projected her anger from her failed marriage on her son:[10] "When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time."[11] She once wrote him a letter saying that the "only regret [she] ever had was giving him birth".[12] When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral. He had already been estranged from her for nearly 20 years.[13][14]


Career

Mentorship by Oscar Hammerstein II

Oscar_Hammerstein_-_portrait.jpg When Sondheim was about ten years old (around the time of his parents' divorce), he became friends with James Hammerstein, son of lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theatre. Sondheim met Hal Prince, who would direct many of his shows, at the opening of _South Pacific,_ Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers. The comic musical he wrote at George School, _By George_, was a success among his peers and buoyed the young songwriter's self-esteem. When Sondheim asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: "But if you want to know why it's terrible, I'll tell you." They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, "In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime."[15]

Hammerstein designed a course of sorts for Sondheim on constructing a musical. He had the young composer write four musicals, each with one of the following conditions:

-   Based on a play he admired (which became _All That Glitters_)
-   Based on a play he liked but thought flawed; Sondheim chose Maxwell Anderson's _High Tor_
-   Based on an existing novel or short story not previously dramatized, which became his unfinished version of _Mary Poppins_ (titled _Bad Tuesday_),[16] unrelated to the musical film and stage play scored by the Sherman Brothers)
-   An original, which became _Climb High_

None of the "assignment" musicals were produced professionally. _High Tor_ and _Mary Poppins_ have never been produced: The rights holder for the original _High Tor_ refused permission, and _Mary Poppins_ was unfinished.[17]

College and early career

Sondheim began attending Williams College, a liberal arts college in Williamstown, Massachusetts whose theatre program attracted him.[18] His first teacher there was Robert Barrow:

   ... everybody hated him because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.[19]

The composer told Meryle Secrest, "I just wanted to study composition, theory, and harmony without the attendant musicology that comes in graduate school. But I knew I wanted to write for the theatre, so I wanted someone who did not disdain theatre music."[20] Barrow suggested that Sondheim study with Milton Babbitt, whom Sondheim described as "a frustrated show composer" with whom he formed "a perfect combination".[21] When he met Babbitt, he was working on a musical for Mary Martin based on the myth of Helen of Troy. Sondheim and Babbitt would meet once a week in New York City for four hours (at the time, Babbitt was teaching at Princeton University). According to Sondheim, they spent the first hour dissecting Rodgers and Hart or George Gershwin or studying Babbitt's favorites (Buddy DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson). They then proceeded to other forms of music (such as Mozart's Jupiter Symphony), critiquing them the same way.[22] Babbitt and Sondheim, fascinated by mathematics, studied songs by a variety of composers (especially Jerome Kern). Sondheim told Secrest that Kern had the ability "to develop a single motif through tiny variations into a long and never boring line and his maximum development of the minimum of material". He said about Babbitt, "I am his maverick, his one student who went into the popular arts with all his serious artillery".[23] At Williams, Sondheim wrote a musical adaption of _Beggar on Horseback_ (a 1924 play by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, with permission from Kaufman) which had three performances.[24] A member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, he graduated _magna cum laude_ in 1950.

"A few painful years of struggle" followed, when Sondheim auditioned songs, lived in his father's dining room to save money and spent time in Hollywood writing for the television series _Topper_.[25] He devoured 1940s and 1950s films, and has called cinema his "basic language";[26] his film knowledge got him through _The $64,000 Question_ contestant tryouts. Sondheim dislikes movie musicals, favoring classic dramas such as _Citizen Kane_, _The Grapes of Wrath_ and _A Matter of Life and Death_: "Studio directors like Michael Curtiz and Raoul Walsh ... were heroes of mine. They went from movie to movie to movie, and every third movie was good and every fifth movie was great. There wasn't any cultural pressure to make art".[27]

At age 22, Sondheim had finished the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Julius and Philip Epstein's _Front Porch in Flatbush_, unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by Lemuel (Lem) Ayers. Ayers approached Frank Loesser and another composer, who turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; Julius Epstein flew in from California and hired Sondheim, who worked with him in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled _Saturday Night_, was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of leukemia in his early forties. The rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned;[28] it opened off-Broadway in 2000. Sondheim later said, "I don't have any emotional reaction to _Saturday Night_ at all – except fondness. It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, leave it. It's my baby pictures. You don't touch up a baby picture – you're a baby!"[29]

Early Broadway success

Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, and knew no one else well. He saw a familiar face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of _Saturday Night_, and they began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of _Romeo and Juliet_ with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from _Saturday Night_ and he could audition for Bernstein. The following day, Sondheim met and played for Bernstein, who said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later.[30] In 1957, _West Side Story_ opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on _Candide_, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of _West Side Story_{{'}}s music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from _West Side Story_ during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off.[31] Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished "someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage".[32]

After _West Side Story_ opened, Shevelove lamented the lack of "low-brow comedy" on Broadway and mentioned a possible musical based on Plautus' Roman comedies. When Sondheim was interested in the idea he called a friend, Larry Gelbart, to co-write the script. The show went through a number of drafts, and was interrupted briefly by Sondheim's next project.[33]

In 1959, Sondheim was approached by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished _Happy Hunting_ with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music.[34] Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience. Sondheim agreed; _Gypsy_ opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.[35]

Hammerstein's death

In 1960, Sondheim lost his mentor and father figure, Oscar Hammerstein.[36] He remembered that shortly before Hammerstein's death, Hammerstein had given him a portrait of himself. Sondheim asked him to inscribe it, and said later about the request that it was "weird ... it's like asking your father to inscribe something". Reading the inscription ("For Stevie, My Friend and Teacher") choked up the composer, who said: "That describes Oscar better than anything I could say."[37]

When he walked away from the house that evening, Sondheim remembered a sad, sinking feeling that they had said their final goodbye. He never saw his mentor again; three days later, Hammerstein died of stomach cancer and Hammerstein's protégé eulogized him at his funeral.


As composer and lyricist

The first musical for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_, which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances. The book, based on farces by Plautus, was written by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Sondheim's score was not well received; although the show won several Tony Awards (including best musical), he did not receive a nomination.

Broadway failures and other projects

Sondheim had participated in three straight hits, but his next show – 1964's _Anyone Can Whistle_ – was a nine-performance failure (although it introduced Angela Lansbury to musical theatre). _Do I Hear a Waltz?_, based on Arthur Laurents' 1952 play _The Time of the Cuckoo_, was intended as another Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Mary Martin in the lead. A new lyricist was needed,[38] and Laurents and Rodgers' daughter, Mary, asked Sondheim to fill in. Although Richard Rodgers and Sondheim agreed that the original play did not lend itself to musicalization, they began writing the musical version.[39] The project had many problems, Rodgers' alcoholism among them; Sondheim, calling it the one project he regretted, then decided to work only when he could write both music and lyrics.[40] He asked author and playwright James Goldman to join him as bookwriter for a new musical. Inspired by a _New York Times_ article about a gathering of former Ziegfeld Follies showgirls, it was entitled _The Girl Upstairs_ (and would later become _Follies_).[41]

In 1966, Sondheim semi-anonymously provided lyrics for "The Boy From...," a parody of "The Girl from Ipanema" in the off-Broadway revue _The Mad Show_. The song was credited to "Esteban Ria Nido",[42] Spanish for "Stephen River Nest", and in the show's playbill the lyrics were credited to "Nom De Plume". That year Goldman and Sondheim hit a creative wall on _The Girls Upstairs_, and Goldman asked Sondheim about writing a TV musical. The result was _Evening Primrose_, with Anthony Perkins and Charmian Carr. Written for the anthology series _ABC Stage 67_ and produced by Hubbell Robinson, it was broadcast on November 16, 1966. According to Sondheim and director Paul Bogart, the musical was written only because Goldman needed money for rent. The network disliked the title and Sondheim's alternative, _A Little Night Music_.[43]

After Sondheim finished _Evening Primrose_, Jerome Robbins asked him to adapt Bertolt Brecht's _The Measures Taken_ despite the composer's general dislike of Brecht's work. Robbins wanted to adapt another Brecht play, _The Exception and the Rule_, and asked John Guare to adapt the book. Leonard Bernstein had not written for the stage in some time, and his contract as conductor of the New York Philharmonic was ending. Sondheim was invited to Robbins' house in the hope that Guare would convince him to write the lyrics for a musical version of _The Exception and the Rule_; according to Robbins, Bernstein would not work without Sondheim. When Sondheim agreed, Guare asked: "Why haven't you all worked together since _West Side Story_?" Sondheim answered, "You'll see". Guare said that working with Sondheim was like being with an old college roommate, and he depended on him to "decode and decipher their crazy way of working"; Bernstein worked only after midnight, and Robbins only in the early morning. Bernstein's score, which was supposed to be light, was influenced by his need to make a musical statement.[44] Stuart Ostrow, who worked with Sondheim on _The Girls Upstairs_, agreed to produce the musical (now entitled _A Pray By Blecht_ and, later, _The Race to Urga_). An opening night was scheduled, but during auditions Robbins asked to be excused for a moment. When he did not return, a doorman said he had gotten into a limousine to go to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Bernstein burst into tears and said, "It's over"; Sondheim said, "I was ashamed of the whole project. It was arch and didactic in the worst way."[45] He wrote one-and-a-half songs and threw them away, the only time he has ever done that. Eighteen years later, Sondheim refused Bernstein and Robbins' request to retry the show.[46]

I_Stephen_Sondheim_House,_New_York_City,_NY,_USA_(2).jpg, New York]] He has lived in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing _Gypsy_ in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard a knock on the door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" and told him "You have been keeping me awake all night!" (she was practicing for her musical debut in _Coco_). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, "My guess is that she wanted to stand there in her bare feet, suffering for her art".[47]

Collaborations with Hal Prince (1970–1981)

After finishing _Do I Hear a Waltz?_, Sondheim devoted himself to composing and writing lyrics for a variety of musicals. He collaborated with producer-director Hal Prince on six musicals from 1970 to 1981, beginning with the 1970 concept musical _Company_. Without a straightforward plot, _Company_ (with a book by George Furth) centered on a set of characters and themes. It opened on April 26, 1970 at the Alvin Theatre, where it ran for 705 performances after seven previews, and won Tony Awards for best musical, best music and best lyrics. It was revived on Broadway in 1995 and 2006.

_Follies_ (1971), with a book by James Goldman, opened on April 4, 1971 at the Winter Garden Theatre and ran for 522 performances after 12 previews. The plot centers on a reunion, in a crumbling Broadway theatre scheduled for demolition, of performers in Weismann's _Follies_ (a musical revue, based on the _Ziegfeld Follies_, which played in that theatre between the world wars). _Follies_ focuses on two couples: Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer, and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone. The show enjoyed two revivals on Broadway in 2001 and 2011.

_A Little Night Music_ (1973), with a more traditional plot based on Ingmar Bergman's _Smiles of a Summer Night_ and a score primarily in waltz time, was one of the composer's greatest successes. _Time_ magazine called it "Sondheim's most brilliant accomplishment to date".[48] "Send in the Clowns", a song from the musical, was a hit for Judy Collins. _A Little Night Music_ opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on February 25, 1973 and closed on August 3, 1974, after 601 performances and 12 previews. It moved to the Majestic Theatre on September 17, 1973, where it finished its run. The show received a Broadway revival in 2009.

_By Bernstein_ premiered at the off-Broadway Westside Theatre on November 23, 1975 and closed on December 7, running for 40 previews and 17 performances. Its lyrics and music were by Leonard Bernstein, with additional lyrics by others (including Sondheim). Conceived and written by Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Norman L. Berman and directed by Michael Bawtree, _By Bernstein_ featured Jack Bittner, Margery Cohen, Jim Corti, Ed Dixon, Patricia Elliott, Kurt Peterson and Janie Sell. The two Sondheim contributions were "In There" (from the adaptation of _The Exception and the Rule_) and a song cut from _West Side Story_, "Kids Ain't (Like Everybody Else)".[49]

_Pacific Overtures_ (1976), with a book by John Weidman, was the most non-traditional of the Sondheim-Prince collaborations. The show explored the westernization of Japan and was originally presented in Kabuki style, and was revived on Broadway in 2004.

_Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ (1979), Sondheim's most operatic score and libretto (which, with _Pacific Overtures_ and _A Little Night Music_, has been produced in opera houses), explores an unlikely topic: murderous revenge and cannibalism. The book, by Hugh Wheeler, is based on Christopher Bond's 1973 stage version of the Victorian original.[50][51][52][53][54] The show has since been revived on Broadway twice (1989, 2005), and has been performed in musical theaters and opera houses alike. It ran off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre until August 26 2018.

_Merrily We Roll Along_ (1981), with a book by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more traditional scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." Although _Merrily_ closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs ... But [despite] that there is nothing ordinary about the music."[55] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will for lack of a better word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail."[56]

Collaborations with James Lapine (1984–1994)

_Merrily_{{'}}s failure greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theatre and do movies, create video games or write mysteries: "I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal."[57] Sondheim and Prince's collaboration was suspended from _Merrily_ to the 2003 production of _Bounce_, another failure.

However, Sondheim decided "that there are better places to start a show" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's _Twelve Dreams_ off-Broadway in 1981: "I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered _Twelve Dreams_ at the Public Theatre";[58] Lapine has a taste "for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular". Their first collaboration was _Sunday in the Park with George_ (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.

They collaborated on _Into the Woods_ (1987), a musical based on several Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Although Sondheim has been called the first composer to bring rap music to Broadway (with the Witch in the opening number of "Into the Woods"), he attributes the first rap in theatre to Meredith Willson's "Rock Island" from _The Music Man_.[59] The show was revived on Broadway in 2002.

Sondheim and Lapine's last work together was the rhapsodic _Passion_ (1994), adapted from Ettore Scola's Italian film _Passione D'Amore_. With a run of 280 performances, _Passion_ was the shortest-running show to win a Tony Award for Best Musical.[60]

Later work

_Assassins_ opened off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on December 18, 1990, with music and lyrics by Sondheim and its book by John Weidman. The musical closed on February 16, 1991, after 73 performances. Its idea derived from Sondheim's days as a panelist at producer Stuart Ostrow's Musical Theater Lab, when he read a script by playwright Charles Gilbert. He asked Gilbert for permission to use his idea; although Gilbert offered to write the book, Sondheim had Weidman in mind.[61] The show finally opened on Broadway in 2004.

_Saturday Night_ was shelved until its 1997 production at London's Bridewell Theatre. The following year, its score was recorded; a revised version, with two new songs, ran off-Broadway at Second Stage Theatre in 2000 and at London's Jermyn Street Theatre in 2009.[62]

During the late 1990s, Sondheim and Weidman reunited with Hal Prince for _Wise Guys_, a musical comedy following brothers Addison and Wilson Mizner. A Broadway production, starring Nathan Lane and Victor Garber, directed by Sam Mendes and planned for the spring of 2000,[63] was delayed. Renamed _Bounce_ in 2003, it was produced at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Although after poor reviews _Bounce_ never reached Broadway, a revised version opened off-Broadway as _Road Show_ at the Public Theater on October 28, 2008. Directed by John Doyle, it closed on December 28, 2008.

Asked about writing new work, Sondheim replied in 2006: "No ... It's age. It's a diminution of energy and the worry that there are no new ideas. It's also an increasing lack of confidence. I'm not the only one. I've checked with other people. People expect more of you and you're aware of it and you shouldn't be."[64] In December 2007 he said that in addition to continuing work on _Bounce_, he was "nibbling at a couple of things with John Weidman and James Lapine".[65]

Lapine created a multimedia production, originally entitled _Sondheim: a Musical Revue_, which was scheduled to open in April 2009 at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta; however, it was canceled due to "difficulties encountered by the commercial producers attached to the project ... in raising the necessary funds".[66][67] A revised version, _Sondheim on Sondheim_, was produced at Studio 54 by the Roundabout Theatre Company; previews began on March 19, 2010, and it ran from April 22 to June 13. The revue's cast included Barbara Cook, Vanessa L. Williams, Tom Wopat, Norm Lewis and Leslie Kritzer.[68]

Sondheim collaborated with Wynton Marsalis on _A Bed and a Chair: A New York Love Affair_, an Encores! concert on November 13–17, 2013 at New York City Center. Directed by John Doyle with choreography by Parker Esse, it consisted of "more than two dozen Sondheim compositions, each piece newly re-imagined by Marsalis".[69] The concert featured Bernadette Peters, Jeremy Jordan, Norm Lewis, Cyrille Aimée, four dancers and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra conducted by David Loud.[70] In _Playbill_, Steven Suskin described the concert as "neither a new musical, a revival, nor a standard songbook revue; it is, rather, a staged-and-sung chamber jazz rendition of a string of songs ... Half of the songs come from _Company_ and _Follies_; most of the other Sondheim musicals are represented, including the lesser-known _Passion_ and _Road Show_".[71]

Sondheim wrote additional songs for the film adaptation of _Into the Woods_, including "Rainbows" (which he included in his second book).[72][73]

Forthcoming projects

In February 2012 it was announced that Sondheim would collaborate on a new musical with David Ives, and he had "about 20–30 minutes of the musical completed".[74][75][76][77][78] The show, tentatively called _All Together Now_, was assumed to follow the format of _Merrily We Roll Along_. Sondheim described the project as "two people and what goes into their relationship ... We'll write for a couple of months, then have a workshop. It seemed experimental and fresh 20 years ago. I have a feeling it may not be experimental and fresh any more".[79] On October 11, 2014, it was confirmed the Sondheim and Ives musical would be based on two Luis Buñuel films (_The Exterminating Angel_ and _The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie_) and would reportedly open (in previews) at the Public Theater in 2017.[80]

In August 2016 a reading for the musical was held at the Public Theater, and it was reported that only the first act was finished, which cast doubt on the speculated 2017 start of previews.[81] There was a workshop in November 2016, with the participation of Matthew Morrison, Shuler Hensley, Heidi Blickenstaff, Sierra Boggess, Gabriel Ebert, Sara Stiles, Michael Cerveris and Jennifer Simard.[82] The working title was reported to be _Buñuel_ by the New York Post and other outlets, but Sondheim later clarified that this was an error and that they still had no title.Wong, Wayman.

Conversations with Frank Rich and others

The Kennedy Center held a Sondheim Celebration, running from May to August 2002, consisting of six of Sondheim's musicals: _Sweeney Todd_, _Company_, _Sunday in the Park With George_, _Merrily We Roll Along_, _Passion_ and _A Little Night Music_.[83][84][85] On April 28, 2002, in connection with the Sondheim Celebration Sondheim and Frank Rich of _the New York Times_ had a conversation.[86][87] They appeared in four interviews, entitled "A Little Night Conversation with Stephen Sondheim",[88][89] in California[90][91][92] and Portland, Oregon in March 2008[93] and at Oberlin College in September. The _Cleveland Jewish News_ reported on their Oberlin appearance: "Sondheim said: 'Movies are photographs; the stage is larger than life.' What musicals does Sondheim admire the most? _Porgy and Bess_ tops a list which includes _Carousel_, _She Loves Me_, and _The Wiz_, which he saw six times. Sondheim took a dim view of today's musicals. What works now, he said, are musicals that are easy to take; audiences don't want to be challenged".[94][95] Sondheim and Rich had additional conversations on January 18, 2009 at Avery Fisher Hall,[96] on February 2 at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia,[97] on February 21 at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia[98] and on April 20 at the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio.[99] The conversations were reprised at Tufts and Brown University in February 2010, at the University of Tulsa in April[100] and at Lafayette College on March 8, 2011.[101] Sondheim had another "conversation with" Sean Patrick Flahaven (associate editor of _The Sondheim Review_) at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach on February 4, 2009, in which he discussed many of his songs and shows: "On the perennial struggles of Broadway: 'I don't see any solution for Broadway's problems except subsidized theatre, as in most civilized countries of the world.'"[102]

On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former _Salt Lake Tribune_ theatre critic Nancy Melich before an audience of 1,200 at Kingsbury Hall. Melich described the evening:

  He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, "Children Will Listen" and "Sunday", and then returned to reprise "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the University of Utah's opera program, our backs to the audience, and I could see tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a sudden, he raised his arms and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their eyes locked with his, until the final "on an ordinary Sunday" was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.[103]

On March 13, 2008, _A Salon With Stephen Sondheim_ (which sold out in three minutes) was hosted by the Academy for New Musical Theatre in Hollywood.[104][105]

Work away from Broadway

An avid fan of games, in 1968 and 1969 Sondheim published a series of cryptic crossword puzzles in _New York_ magazine. In 1987 _Time_ called his love of puzzlemaking "legendary in theater circles," adding that the central character of Anthony Shaffer's play _Sleuth_ was inspired by the composer. According to a rumor (denied by Shaffer in a March 10, 1996 _New York Times_ interview), _Sleuth_ had the working title _Who's Afraid of Stephen Sondheim?_[106] His love of puzzles and mysteries is evident in _The Last of Sheila_, an intricate whodunit written with longtime friend Anthony Perkins. The 1973 film, directed by Herbert Ross, featured Dyan Cannon, Raquel Welch, James Mason, James Coburn and Richard Benjamin.

Sondheim tried playwriting one more time, collaborating with _Company_ librettist George Furth on _Getting Away with Murder_ in 1996, but the unsuccessful Broadway production closed after 29 previews and 17 performances. His compositions have included a number of film scores, including a set of songs written for Warren Beatty's 1990 film version of _Dick Tracy_. One of Sondheim's songs for the film, "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)," sung in the movie by Madonna, won him an Academy Award.

Unfinished and canceled works

According to Sondheim, he was asked to translate _Mahagonny-Songspiel_: "But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better than I do his stuff before ... I love _The Threepenny Opera_ but, outside of _The Threepenny Opera_, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America – when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway."[107] He turned down an offer to musicalize Nathanael West's _A Cool Million_ with James Lapine around 1982.[108][109]

Sondheim worked with William Goldman on _Singing Out Loud_, a musical film, in 1992, penning the song "Water Under the Bridge".[110][111] According to the composer, Goldman wrote one or two drafts of the script and Sondheim wrote six-and-a-half songs when director Rob Reiner lost interest in the project. "Dawn" and "Sand", from the film, were recorded for the albums _Sondheim at the Movies_ and _Unsung Sondheim_.[112] Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein wrote _The Race to Urga_, scheduled for Lincoln Center in 1969, but when Jerome Robbins left the project it was not produced.[113]

In 1991 Sondheim worked with Terrence McNally on a musical, _All Together Now_. McNally said, "Steve was interested in telling the story of a relationship from the present back to the moment when the couple first met. We worked together a while, but we were both involved with so many other projects that this one fell through". The story follows Arden Scott, a 30-something female sculptor, and Daniel Nevin (a slightly-younger, sexually attractive restaurateur). Its script, with concept notes by McNally and Sondheim, is archived in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.[114]

In August 2003, Sondheim expressed interest in the idea of a creating a musical adaption of the 1993 comedy film _Groundhog Day_.[115] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of _Groundhog Day_ would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[116] The musical was later created and premiered in 2016 with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and book by Danny Rubin (screenwriter of the film) with Sondheim's blessing.[117]

Books

Sondheim's 2010 _Finishing the Hat_ annotates his lyrics "from productions dating 1954–1981. In addition to published and unpublished lyrics from _West Side Story_, _Follies_ and _Company_, the tome finds Sondheim discussing his relationship with Oscar Hammerstein II and his collaborations with composers, actors and directors throughout his lengthy career".[118][119] The book, first of a two-part series, is named after a song from _Sunday in the Park With George_. Sondheim said, "It's going to be long. I'm not, by nature, a prose writer, but I'm literate, and I have a couple of people who are vetting it for me, whom I trust, who are excellent prose writers".[120][121] _Finishing the Hat_ was published in October 2010. According to a _New York Times_ review, "The lyrics under consideration here, written during a 27-year period, aren't presented as fixed and sacred paradigms, carefully removed from tissue paper for our reverent inspection. They're living, evolving, flawed organisms, still being shaped and poked and talked to by the man who created them".[122] The book was 11th on the _New York Times_{{'}} Hardcover Nonfiction list for November 5, 2010.[123]

Its sequel, _Look, I Made a Hat: Collected Lyrics (1981–2011) with Attendant Comments, Amplifications, Dogmas, Harangues, Digressions, Anecdotes and Miscellany_, was published on November 22, 2011. The book, continuing from _Sunday in the Park With George_ (where _Finishing the Hat_ ended), includes sections on Sondheim's work in film and television.[124]

Mentoring

After he was mentored by Oscar Hammerstein II[125] Sondheim has returned the favor, saying that he loves "passing on what Oscar passed on to me".[126] In an interview with Sondheim for _The Legacy Project_, composer-lyricist Adam Guettel (son of Mary Rodgers and grandson of Richard Rodgers) recalls how as a 14-year-old boy he showed Sondheim his work. Guettel was "crestfallen" since he had come in "sort of all puffed up thinking [he] would be rained with compliments and things", which was not the case since Sondheim had some "very direct things to say". Later, Sondheim wrote and apologized to Guettel for being "not very encouraging" when he was actually trying to be "constructive".[127]

Sondheim also mentored a fledgling Jonathan Larson, attending Larson's workshop for his _Superbia_ (a musical version of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_). In Larson's musical _Tick, Tick... Boom!_, the phone message is played in which Sondheim apologizes for leaving early, says he wants to meet him and is impressed with his work. After Larson's death, Sondheim called him one of the few composers "attempting to blend contemporary pop music with theater music, which doesn't work very well; he was on his way to finding a real synthesis. A good deal of pop music has interesting lyrics, but they are not theater lyrics". A musical-theatre composer "must have a sense of what is theatrical, of how you use music to tell a story, as opposed to writing a song. Jonathan understood that instinctively."[128]

Around 2008, Sondheim approached Lin-Manuel Miranda to work with him translating _West Side Story_ lyrics into Spanish for an upcoming Broadway revival.[129][130] Miranda then approached Sondheim with his new project _Hamilton_, then called _The Hamilton Mixtape_, which Sondheim gave notes on.[131][132] Sondheim was originally wary of the project saying he was "worried that an evening of rap might get monotonous". However, Sondheim believed Miranda's attention to, and respect for, good rhyming made it work.[133]

Dramatists Guild

A supporter for writers' rights in the theatre industry, Stephen Sondheim is an active member of the Dramatists Guild of America. In 1973, he was elected as the Guild's sixteenth president, and he continued his presidency for the non-profit organization until 1981.

Presidential Medal of Freedom

In November 2015, Sondheim was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.[160][161]


Legacy

Sondheim founded Young Playwrights Inc. in 1981 to introduce young people to writing for the theatre, and is the organization's executive vice-president.[162] The Stephen Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts, at the Fairfield Arts and Convention Center in Fairfield, Iowa, opened in December 2007 with performances by Len Cariou, Liz Callaway, and Richard Kind (all of whom had participated in Sondheim musicals).[163][164]

The Stephen Sondheim Society was established in 1993 to provide information about his work, with its _Sondheim - the Magazine_ provided to its membership. The society maintains a database, organizes productions, meetings, outings and other events and assists with publicity. Its annual Student Performer of the Year Competition awards a £1,000 prize to one of twelve musical-theatre students from UK drama schools and universities. At Sondheim's request, an additional prize is offered for a new song by a young composer. Judged by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, each contestant performs a Sondheim song and a new song.

Most episode titles of the television series _Desperate Housewives_ refer to Sondheim's song titles or lyrics,[165][166][167][168] and the series finale is entitled "Finishing the Hat".[169] In 1990 Sondheim, as the Cameron Mackintosh chair in musical theatre at Oxford,[170] conducted workshops with promising musical writers including George Stiles, Anthony Drewe, Andrew Peggie, Paul James, Kit Hesketh-Harvey and Stephen Keeling. The writers founded the Mercury Workshop in 1992, which merged with the New Musicals Alliance to become MMD (a UK-based organization to develop new musical theatre, of which Sondheim is a patron).

Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia established its Sondheim Award, which includes a $5,000 donation to a nonprofit organization of the recipient's choice, "as a tribute to America's most influential contemporary musical theatre composer". The first award, to Sondheim, was presented at an April 27, 2009 benefit with performances by Bernadette Peters, Michael Cerveris, Will Gartshore and Eleasha Gamble.[171][172][173] The 2010 recipient was Angela Lansbury, with Peters and Catherine Zeta-Jones hosting the April benefit.[174] The 2011 honoree was Bernadette Peters.[175] Other recipients were Patti LuPone in 2012,[176] Hal Prince in 2013, Jonathan Tunick in 2014,[177] and James Lapine in 2015.[178] The 2016 awardee was John Weidman[179] and the 2017 awardee was Cameron Mackintosh.[180]

Henry Miller's Theatre, on West 43rd Street in New York City, was renamed the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on September 15, 2010 for the composer's 80th birthday. In attendance were Nathan Lane, Patti LuPone and John Weidman. Sondheim said in response to the honor, "I'm deeply embarrassed. Thrilled, but deeply embarrassed. I've always hated my last name. It just doesn't sing. I mean, it's not Belasco. And it's not Rodgers and it's not Simon. And it's not Wilson. It just doesn't sing. It sings better than Schoenfeld and Jacobs. But it just doesn't sing". Lane said, "We love our corporate sponsors and we love their money, but there's something sacred about naming a theatre, and there's something about this that is right and just".[181]

According to _The Daily Telegraph_, Sondheim is "almost certainly" the only living composer with a quarterly journal published in his name;[182] _The Sondheim Review_, founded in 1994, chronicles and promotes his work.[183]


Musical style

According to Sondheim, when he asked Milton Babbitt if he could study atonality, Babbitt replied: "You haven't exhausted tonal resources for yourself yet, so I'm not going to teach you atonal".[184] Sondheim agreed, and despite frequent dissonance and a highly-chromatic style, his music is tonal.

He is noted for complex polyphony in his vocals, such as the five minor characters who make up a Greek chorus in 1973's _A Little Night Music_. Sondheim uses angular harmonies and intricate melodies. His musical influences are varied; although he has said that he "loves Bach", his favorite musical period is from Brahms to Stravinsky.[185]


Personal life

Sondheim has been described as introverted and solitary. In an interview with Frank Rich, he said, "The outsider feeling—somebody who people want to both kiss and kill—occurred quite early in my life".[186] He lived with dramatist Peter Jones for eight years in the 1990s.[187] As of 2010, the composer was in a relationship with Jeff Romley.[188][189] In a 2019 interview, satirical songwriter Randy Rainbow (who was introduced to Sondheim by his friend Jeff Romley) referred to Romley as Sondheim's husband.[190]
