_HEPTRANCHIAS HOWELLI_, the SEVENGILL SHARK, is a nektonic carnivore in the genus _Heptranchias_. It is an extinct species that ranged from 37.2 to 20.43 Ma.[1]


Fossil record

Teeth from _Heptranchias howelli_ have been found in Europe. An antero-lateral tooth and an upper lateral tooth were found in Faxe, Denmark in 2014 . In addition, two incomplete antero-lateral teeth and an upper anterior tooth are kept in a private collection.[2] A 2015 study in yielded a complete lower tooth, 17 incomplete lower teeth, and an unidentified broken tooth.[3]


Description

Teeth

The upper lateral teeth of the species have a long, acute, strongly sigmoid main cusp. This cusp is serrated and has a dispal cusplet. The main cusp of the antero-lateral teeth is triangular and carries eight mesial cusplets that increase in size along the lower mesial face. The antero-lateral teeth have six main cusplets, the sixth of which is very small. The first cusplet is slightly lower than the others.[4] The cusps are inclined at about a 45 degree angle distally.

The largest tooth found in Trelde Naes was mesio-distally, apico-basally and labio-langually. The root height ranged from .[5]
