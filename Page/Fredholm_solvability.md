In mathematics, FREDHOLM SOLVABILITY encompasses results and techniques for solving differential and integral equations via the Fredholm alternative and, more generally, the Fredholm-type properties of the operator involved. The concept is named after Erik Ivar Fredholm.

Let be a real -matrix and b ∈ ℝ^(n) a vector.

The Fredholm alternative in ℝ^(n) states that the equation Ax = b has a solution if and only if b^(T)v = 0 for every vector v ∈ ℝ^(n) satisfying A^(T)v = 0. This alternative has many applications, for example, in bifurcation theory. It can be generalized to abstract spaces. So, let E and F be Banach spaces and let T : E → F be a continuous linear operator. Let E^(*), respectively F^(*), denote the topological dual of E, respectively F, and let T^(*) denote the adjoint of T (cf. also Duality; Adjoint operator). Define

    (ker T^(*))^(⊥) = {y ∈ F : (y, y^(*)) = 0 for every y^(*) ∈ ker T^(*)}

An equation Tx = y is said to be normally solvable (in the sense of F. Hausdorff) if it has a solution whenever y ∈ (ker T^(*))^(⊥). A classical result states that Tx = y is normally solvable if and only if T(E) is closed in F.

In non-linear analysis, this latter result is used as definition of normal solvability for non-linear operators.
