BARROW PARK ROAD STADIUM was a greyhound racing and speedway stadium in Park Road, Barrow-in-Furness.


Opening

Local businessman Cliff Hindle built a new stadium at Park Road, which opened halfway through the 1977 season for a short series of speedway open meetings. In 1978 a team was entered under the name Furness Flyers, but finished bottom of the National League. Crowds were poor and the speedway track closed after only one season.[1]


Greyhound racing

Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place at the Park Road Stadium from 24 April 1987 until March 1991.[2] The owner was Chris Roynon and racing was held every Tuesday and Friday. The hare system was an 'Inside Sumner' and the race distances were 250, 415 and 595 metres. There was car parking for 500 vehicles, a bar and mobile snack bar.[3]


Closure

In 1993 the stadium was demolished to make way for a candle factory.[4]
