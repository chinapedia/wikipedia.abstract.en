The line of control which lies between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Kashmir and Jammu is the de facto boundary which is generally respected by both sides. Indian and Pakistani troops have on occasion tried to alter the areas under their control in large scale operations. There have also been punitive expeditions across the border. This is a list of all reported instances since the re-designation of the cease fire line as the line of control.

Acts of brutality and mutilation are a regular occurrence along the Line of Control. Armed teams of soldiers and militants are known to cross the border, outnumber a post and inflict heavy casualties and utilize beheading as an act of humiliation. Both sides have blamed each other for carrying out such cross-border attacks and denied their participation in such raids.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
