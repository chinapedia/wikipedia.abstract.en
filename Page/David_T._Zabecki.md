Zabecki is an author, editor and translator of several books on military history. The 2014 English edition of _The Schieffen Plan: International Perspectives on the German Strategy for World War I_, edited by , Michael Epkenhans, and and translated by Zabecki, received the Arthur Goodzeit Book Award from the New York Military Affairs Symposium.[4] Along with Bruce Condell, he translated and edited _Truppenführung_ ("Handling of Combined-Arms Formations"), the 1933−1934 German Army field manual, published in English by Lynne Rienner Publishers in 2001 as _On the German Art of War: Truppenführung: German Army Manual for Unit Command in World War II_.[5]

Zabecki served as editor in chief of the four-volume encyclopedia _Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History_ published in 2014 and 2014 by ABC-CLIO. Reviewing the work for the publication of the Reference and User Services Association, Michael Hawkins of the Kent State University notes that the scope of the project that covers "Federal Republic of Germany today, its predecessor states, and the component kingdoms and principalities that combine to form Imperial Germany" is unique. The reviewer writes: "This set does not offer anything new to the field of Germany military history; however, it does a good job of compiling information together into one location. While there are other works that compile sections of German military history into one edited work, this one covers a unique timeline others do not."[6]
