Critical reception

_123Telugu_ wrote "On the whole, Mosagallaku Mosagadu will provide a decent relief for Sudheer Babu’s career. A slow first half and predictable nature of the script are basic drawbacks. If you manage to sit through the first half an hour and stop looking for logics, you can easily give this film a shot for its decent comedy in the second half."[1] _Telugucinema_ wrote "The movie has not much runtime but as there is no story, the film just drags. Many romantic sequences can be edited. New director has grip over technical aspects but he should have focused more on writing".[2] _Greatandhra_ has given 2.75 rating and called it a time-pass movie.[3]
