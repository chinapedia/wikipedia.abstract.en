_THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW_ is a 1975 musical horror comedy film by 20th Century Fox produced by Lou Adler and Michael White and directed by Jim Sharman. The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor Richard O'Brien, who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 musical stage production _The Rocky Horror Show_, with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a parody tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick and is narrated by Charles Gray with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre, and Belasco Theatre productions including Nell Campbell and Patricia Quinn.

The story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparent mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.

The film was shot in the United Kingdom at Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its earlier use by Hammer Film Productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many kitsch science fiction and horror films, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly affected the development of punk rock fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.[1]

Although largely critically panned on initial release, it soon became known as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This "shadow cast" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-synching their character's lines. Still in limited release four decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It is often shown close to Halloween. Today, the film has a large international cult following. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.


Plot

A criminologist narrates the tale of the newly engaged couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy late November evening, somewhere near Denton In 1974. Seeking a telephone, the couple walk to a nearby castle where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed "sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania." The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.

In his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the "secret to life itself". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank and Columbia's ex-lover, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie then proceeds to seduce Columbia, get the Transylvanians dancing and singing and intrigue Brad and Janet. When Rocky starts dancing and enjoying the performance, a jealous Frank kills Eddie with an pickaxe. Columbia screams in horror, devastated by Eddie's death. Frank justifies killing Eddie as a "mercy killing" to Rocky and they depart to the bridal suite.

Brad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, who she discovers, via a television monitor, is in bed with Frank. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.

After discovering that his creation is missing, Frank returns to the lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him; Brad denies any knowledge of it, and Dr. Scott assures Frank that Brad is totally not involved in UFOs. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.

Rocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the Medusa Transducer, transforming them into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costume, Frank "unfreezes" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an RKO tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader.

Riff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia and Frank, who has "failed his mission". An enraged Rocky gathers Frank in his arms, climbs to the top of the tower, and plunges to his death in the pool below. Riff Raff and Magenta release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface, "lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning".

Production

Concept and development

Rocky_Horror_throne_screencap.jpg Richard O'Brien was living as an unemployed actor in London during the early 1970s. He wrote most of _The Rocky Horror Show_ during one winter just to occupy himself.[2][3] Since his youth, O'Brien had loved science fiction and B horror movies. He wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle flicks, and fifties rock and roll into his musical.[4] O'Brien conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself in British popular culture in the 1970s.[5] Allowing his concept to come into being, O'Brien states "glam rock allowed me to be myself more".[6]

O'Brien showed a portion of the unfinished script to Australian director Jim Sharman, who decided to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, Chelsea, London, which was used as a project space for new work.[7] O'Brien had appeared briefly in a stage production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's _Jesus Christ Superstar_, directed by Sharman, and the two also worked together in Sam Shepard's _The Unseen Hand_. Sharman would bring in production designer Brian Thomson.[8] The original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane, musical director Richard Hartley, and stage producer Michael White, who was brought in to produce. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title, _They Came from Denton High_, was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to _The Rocky Horror Show_.[9][10]

Having premiered in the small sixty-seat Royal Court Theatre, it quickly moved to larger venues in London, transferring to the 230-seat Chelsea Classic Cinema on Kings Road on 14 August 1973, before finding a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King's Road Theatre from 3 November 1973, running for six years.[11] The musical made its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in 1974 before being played in New York City as well as other cities.[12] Producer and Ode Records owner Lou Adler attended the London production in the winter of 1973, escorted by friend Britt Ekland. He immediately decided to purchase the U.S. theatrical rights. His production would be staged at his Roxy Theatre in L.A.[13] In 1975, _The Rocky Horror Show_ premiered on Broadway at the 1,000-seat Belasco Theatre.[14]

Filming and locations

Oakley_Court.jpg The film was shot at Bray Studios and Oakley Court, a country house near Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, and at Elstree Studios[15] for post production,[16] from 21 October to 19 December 1974. Oakley Court, built in 1857 in the Victorian Gothic style, is known for a number of Hammer films.[17][18] Much of the location shooting took place there, although at the time the manor was not in good condition.[19] Much of the cast were from the original London stage production, including Tim Curry, who had decided that Dr Frank N. Furter should speak like the Queen of England, extravagantly posh.[20] Fox insisted on casting the two characters of Brad and Janet with American actors, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon.[21] Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions worse. During filming, Sarandon fell ill with pneumonia.[22] Filming of the laboratory scene and the title character's creation occurred on 30 October 1974.[23]

The film is both a parody and tribute to many of the science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s.[24] The film production retains many aspects from the stage version such as production design and music, but adds new scenes not featured in the original stage play.[25] The film's plot, setting, and style echo those of the Hammer Horror films, which had their own instantly recognizable style (just as Universal Studios' horror films did).[26] The originally proposed opening sequence was to contain clips of various films mentioned in the lyrics, as well as the first few sequences shot in black and white, but this was deemed too expensive and scrapped.[27]

Costumes, make-up, and props

In the stage productions, actors generally did their own make-up; however, for the film, the producers chose Pierre La Roche, who had previously been a make-up artist for Mick Jagger and David Bowie, to redesign the make-up for each character.[28] Production stills were taken by rock photographer Mick Rock, who has published a number of books from his work.[29] In _Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult_, designer Sue Blane discusses the _Rocky Horror_ costumes' influence on punk music style, opining "[It was a] big part of the build-up [to punk]." She states that ripped fishnet stockings, glitter, and coloured hair were directly attributable to _Rocky Horror_.[30] Columbia_top_hat_and_tux.jpg worn by Little Nell, recreated by fan Mina Credeur of Houston, Texas.]] Some of the costumes from the film had been originally used in the stage production. Props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer Horror productions and others. The tank and dummy used for Rocky's birth originally appeared in _The Revenge of Frankenstein_ (1958). These references to earlier productions, in addition to cutting costs, enhanced the cult status of the film.[31]

Costume designer Sue Blane was not keen on working for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of _The Maids_, for which Curry had worn a woman's corset. Blane arranged for the theatre to loan her the corset from the other production for _Rocky Horror_.[32] Blane admits that she did not conduct research for her designing, had never seen a science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.

The budget for the film's costumes was US$1,600,[33] far more than the stage production budget, but having to double up on costumes the film production was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.[34]

Blane was amazed by the recreation and understanding of her designs by fans.[35] When she first heard that people were dressing up, she thought it would be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. _Rocky Horror_ fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that "the best part is when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that there's "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you".[36] The film still plays at many theatre locations and _Rocky Horror_ costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.[37]

Title sequence

The film starts with the screen fading to black and oversized, disembodied female lips appear overdubbed with a male voice,[38][39] establishing theme of androgyny to be repeated as the film unfolds.[40] The opening scene and song, "Science Fiction/Double Feature", consists of the lips of Patricia Quinn (who appears in the film later as the character Magenta (in addition to the latter, appeared as 'Trixie the Usherette' in the original London production who sang the song)), but has the vocals of actor and _Rocky Horror_ creator, Richard O'Brien (who appears as Magenta's brother Riff Raff). The lyrics refer to science fiction and horror films of the past and list several film titles from the 1930s to the 1960s, including _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (1951), _Flash Gordon_ (1936), _The Invisible Man_ (1933), _King Kong_ (1933), _It Came from Outer Space_ (1953), _Doctor X_ (1932), _Forbidden Planet_ (1956), _Tarantula_ (1955), _The Day of the Triffids_ (1962), _Curse of the Demon_ (1957), and _When Worlds Collide_ (1951).[41]


Music

The soundtrack was released in 1975 by Ode Records and produced by English composer Richard Hartley. The album peaked at No. 49 on the U.S. _Billboard_ 200 in 1978.[42] It reached No. 12 on the Australian albums chart[43] and No. 11 on the New Zealand albums chart.[44] The album is described as the "definitive version of the [_Rocky Horror_] score."[45]

Release

London_opening_poster_for_Rialto.jpeg The film opened in the United Kingdom at Rialto Theater in London on 14 August 1975 and in the United States on 26 September at the UA Westwood in Los Angeles, California. It did well at that location, but not elsewhere.[46] Before the midnight screenings' success, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York City opening on Halloween night was cancelled.[47] Fox re-released the film around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, Brian De Palma's _Phantom of the Paradise_ (1974), but again it drew small audiences.[48]

The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show.jpg'']] A second film poster was created using a set of red, lipstick painted lips with the tagline "A Different Set of Jaws", a spoof of the poster for the film _Jaws_ (which was also released in 1975).[49] The lips of former _Playboy_ model Lorelei Shark are featured on the poster.[50]

With _Pink Flamingos_ (1972) and _Reefer Madness_ (1936) making money in midnight showings nationwide, a Fox executive, Tim Deegan, was able to talk distributors into midnight screenings,[51] starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976.[52] The cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City.,[53] then spread to other counties in NYC, and to Uniondale, L.I. _Rocky Horror_ was not only found in the larger cities but throughout the United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the film's release included the U.A. Cinemas in Fresno and Merced, the Cinema J. in Sacramento, California, and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organised performance group was active with the release there as well as in such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.[54] UA_Cinema_Rocky_Horror_1978.jpg The film is considered to be the longest-running release in film history.[55] It has never been pulled by 20th Century Fox from its original 1975 release, and it continues to play in cinemas.[56][57]

Home media

A Super 8 version of selected scenes of the film was made available.[58] In 1983, Ode Records released _"The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Audience Par-Tic-I-Pation Album"_, recorded at the 8th Street Playhouse. The recording consisted of the film's audio and the standardised call-backs from the audience.[59]

A home video release was made available in 1987 in the UK.[60] In the US, the film (including documentary footage and extras) was released on VHS in 8 November, 1990, retailing for $89.95.[61]

The film was released on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary. A 35th Anniversary edition Blu-ray was released in the US on 19 October 2010. The disc includes a newly created 7.1 surround sound mix, the original theatrical mono sound mix, and a 4K/2K image transfer from the original camera negative. In addition, new content featuring karaoke and a fan performance were included.[62]


Reception, reaction and legacy

Critical reception

_Chicago Sun-Times_ critic Roger Ebert noted that when first released, _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ was "ignored by pretty much everyone, including the future fanatics who would eventually count the hundreds of times they'd seen it". He considered it more a "long-running social phenomenon" than a movie, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars.[63] Bill Henkin noted that _Variety_ thought that the "campy hijinks" of the film seemed labored, and also mentioned that the _San Francisco Chronicle_{{'s}} John Wasserman, who had liked the stage play in London, found the film "lacking both charm and dramatic impact". _Newsweek_ called the film "tasteless, plotless and pointless" in 1978.[64]

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 80% based on 41 reviews, and an average grade of 6.9/10, with the critical consensus reading "_Rocky Horror Picture Show_ brings its quirky characters in tight, but it's the narrative thrust that really drives audiences insane and keeps 'em doing the time warp again".[65] A number of contemporary critics find it compelling and enjoyable because of its offbeat and bizarre qualities; the BBC summarised: "for those willing to experiment with something a little bit different, a little bit outré, _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ has a lot to offer".[66] _The New York Times_ called it a "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" with "catchy" songs.[67] Geoff Andrew of _Time Out_ noted that the "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars.[68] Dave Kehr of the _Chicago Reader_ on the other hand considered the wit to be "too weak to sustain a film" and thought that the "songs all sound the same".[69]

In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[70][71]

Cult phenomenon

New York City origins

Dori_and_Sal.jpg at the Waverly Theatre in New York in 1977]] _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ helped shape conditions of cult film's transition from art-house to grind-house style.[72] The film developed a cult following in 1976 at the Waverly Theatre in New York, which developed into a standardised ritual. According to J. Hoberman, author of _Midnight Movies_, it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience. Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher who, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, "Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch." Originally, Louis and other _Rocky Horror_ pioneers - including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian - did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh. This quickly caught on with other theater goers and thus began this self-proclaimed "counter point dialogue", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.[73] Performance groups became a staple at _Rocky Horror_ screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast.[74] The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic Sal Piro and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr. Frank N. Furter and was one of several performers - including Will Kohler as Brad Majors, Nora Poses as Janet, and Lilias Piro as Magenta - in a flexible rotating cast.[75] The performances of the audience were scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters.[76]

On Halloween in 1976, people attended in costume and talked back to the screen, and by mid-1978, _Rocky Horror_ was playing in over 50 locations on Fridays and Saturdays at midnight. Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for _Rocky Horror_ conventions.[77] By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres.[78] The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. The fan publication _The Transylvanian_ printed a number of issues, and a semi-regular poster magazine was published as well as an official magazine.[79]

Los Angeles, Hollywood

Garrett3.jpg The Los Angeles area performance groups originated in 1977 at the Fox Theatre, where Michael Wolfson won a look-alike contest as Frank N. Furter, and won another at the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Wolfson's group eventually performed in all of the L.A. area theaters screening _Rocky Horror_, including the Balboa Theater in Balboa, The Cove at Hermosa Beach, and The Sands in Glendale. He was invited to perform at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona.

At the Tiffany Theatre, the audience performance cast had the theater's full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The fan playing Frank for this theatre was a transgender performer,[80] D. Garret Gafford, who was out of work in 1978 and trying to raise the funds for a gender reassignment while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany.[81] Presently, the live action rendition of _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ is available for attendance in various locations in Los Angeles, typically Saturday nights at midnight.

San Francisco

In 1978, _Rocky Horror_ moved from an earlier location to the Strand Theatre located near the Tenderloin on Market Street.[82] The performance group there, Double Feature/Celluloid Jam, was the first to act out and perform almost the entire film, unlike the New York cast at that time. The Strand cast was put together from former members of an early Berkeley group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio, who, in 1979, attracted many of the older performers from Berkeley. Other members included Mishell Erickson and her twin sister Denise Erickson as Columbia and Magenta, Kathy Dolan as Janet, and Linda "Lou" Woods as Riff Raff. The Strand group performed at two large science fiction conventions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, were offered a spot at The Mabuhay, a local punk club, and performed for children's television of Argentina.[83] Strand_Theater_Rocky_Horror.jpg

Fan following

Annual _Rocky Horror_ conventions are held in varying locations, lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with "El Fishnet Fiesta", and "Queens of the Desert" held in 2006.[84] Vera Dika wrote that, to the fans, _Rocky Horror_ is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend.[85] The audience call-backs are similar to responses in church during a mass.[86] Many theatre troupes exist across the United States that produce shadow-cast performances where the actors play each part in the film in full costume, with props, as the movie plays on the big screen in a movie theatre.[87][88]

The film has a global following and remains popular.[89] Subcultures such as _Rocky Horror_ have also found a place on the Internet.[90] Audience participation scripts for many cities are available for download from the Internet.[91] The Internet has a number of _Rocky Horror_ fan-run websites with various quizzes and information, specializing in different content, allowing fans to participate at a unique level.[92]

Cultural influence

_The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ has been featured in a number of other feature films and television series over the years. Episodes of _The Simpsons_, _The Venture Bros._, _The Boondocks_, _Glee_, _The Drew Carey Show_, _That '70s Show_, and _American Dad!_ spotlight _Rocky Horror_, as do films such as _Vice Squad_ (1982), _Halloween II_ (2009), and _The Perks of Being a Wallflower_ (2012).[93] The 1980 film _Fame_ featured the audience reciting their callback lines to the screen and dancing the Time Warp,[94] the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a novelty dance at parties.[95] Director Rob Zombie cited _Rocky Horror_ as a major influence on his film _House of 1000 Corpses_ (2003),[96] while the film's fan culture of cosplaying and audience participation during screenings laid the groundwork for the similarly influential cult following surrounding Tommy Wiseau's _The Room_ (2003).[97][98] _Rocky Horror_ also inspired John McPhail's zombie musical _Anna and the Apocalypse_ (2018).[99]

LGBT Influence

Members of the queer community comprised a large part of the _Rocky Horror_ cult following: they identified with the embrace of sexual liberation and androgyny, and attended show after show, slowly forming a community. Judith A. Peraino compares Brad and Janet’s initiation into Frank N. Furter’s world to the self-discovery of queer identity, and to the traditional initiation of ‘virgins’ in the shadow screenings[100]. June Thomas describes the midnight screenings in Delaware as a ‘very queer scene’, which increased visibility for the queer community: “The folks standing in line outside the State in fishnets and makeup every Saturday night undoubtedly widened the sphere of possibilities for gender expression on Main Street.”[101][102]

_The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ remains a cultural phenomenon in both the U.S. and U.K.[103][104] Cult film participants are often people on the fringe of society that find connection and community at the screenings,[105] although the film attracts fans of differing backgrounds all over the world.[106]

"Bisexuality, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Me", by Elizabeth Reba Weise, is a piece in _Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out_ (1991), an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka'ahumanu which is one of the seminal books[107][108] in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement.[109]


Sequel

In 1979, O'Brien wrote a projected sequel to the film entitled _Rocky Horror Shows His Heels_. This script would have featured the return of all of the characters from the original film, and O'Brien wished to largely use the original production team to make the new film; however, Sharman did not wish to revisit the original concept so directly, and Tim Curry did not wish to reprise his role.

Instead, in 1981, Sharman reunited with O'Brien to film _Shock Treatment_, a stand-alone feature that was not a direct sequel to the original film.[110] This film was originally conceived and written in 1980 under the title 'The Brad and Janet Show', using most of the songs from the original project _Rocky Horror Shows His Heels_ with lyrical adjustments, and depicting the characters' continuing adventures in the town of Denton; however, these plans had to be adjusted due to a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would entail the entire film being shot within a sound stage. _Shock Treatment_ was poorly received by critics and audiences upon release (in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning) but over time has built a small cult following, though not nearly as strong as the first film.[111]

Ten years later, O'Brien wrote another script intended as a direct sequel to the cult classic, entitled _Revenge of the Old Queen_.[112] Producer Michael White had hoped to begin work on the production and described the script as being "in the same style as the other one. It has reflections of the past in it."[113] _Revenge of the Old Queen_ had apparently commenced pre-production; however, after studio head Joe Roth was ousted from Fox in 1993, the project was shelved indefinitely. Although the script has not been published, bootleg copies can be read on the Internet, and one song from the project's original demo tape circulates among fans. The script is currently owned by Fox, which produced the two original films. Most individuals associated with the project, including O'Brien, agree that the film will probably never be made, owing to the failure of _Shock Treatment_ and the aging of the original cast.[114]

Between 1999 and 2001, O'Brien was working on a third attempted sequel project with the working title _Rocky Horror: The Second Coming_[115], first to be made as a stage production, with an option to create a film if met with success. This script would largely integrate plot elements from _Rocky Horror Shows His Heels_, but with all-new songs. O'Brien completed a first draft of this script (which was read by Terry Jones[116]) but had difficulties finalizing anything beyond the first act, and little more has been heard of this project since the mid-2000s.

In 2015, O'Brien produced _Shock Treatment_ for the theatrical stage. The production premiered at the King’s Head theatre in Islington, London in the United Kingdom in the spring.[117][118]


Remake

"The Rocky Horror Glee Show" aired on 26 October 2010, as part of the second season of the TV series _Glee_, which recreated several scenes from the film, including the opening credits. It featured Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf in cameo roles.[119]

On 10 April 2015, it was announced that the Fox Broadcasting Company would air a modern-day reimagining of the film, titled _The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again_.[120][121] On 22 October 2015, it was announced that the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter would be played by actress Laverne Cox.[122] Ryan McCartan and Victoria Justice play the roles of Brad and Janet, alongside Reeve Carney as Riff Raff and singer/model Staz Nair as Rocky.[123] Adam Lambert portrays Eddie.[124] Tim Curry, who portrayed Dr. Frank N. Furter in the film, portrays the Criminologist.[125] On 1 February 2016, it was announced that Broadway veteran Annaleigh Ashford would portray Columbia.[126] On 5 February 2016, Ben Vereen joined the cast as Dr. Everett von Scott.[127]

Kenny Ortega, best known for the _High School Musical_ franchise and _Michael Jackson's This Is It_ (2009), directed, choreographed and executive-produced the remake; Lou Adler, who was an executive producer of the original film, has the same role for the new film. The film premiered on Fox on 20 October 2016.[128]
