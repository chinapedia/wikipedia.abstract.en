_FRAGILITY_ is a 2016 Swedish documentary film directed by Ahang Bashi.[1]


Synopsis

Just when her career is at its peak, the filmmaker Ahang Bashi falls into a deep hole of panic disorder and depression. With the camera as her companion, Ahang explores anxiety's vertiginous world of both darkness and hope. The film depicts her worst moments as well as the most loving gestures from the surroundings. It also takes us back in time, to her escape to Sweden and to the little girl who didn't understand. In 2016 the film was a nominee for _Tempo Documentary Award_ on Tempo Film Festival and won the _Stockholm Prize_ through Nöjesguiden. One year later it was awarded _Newcomer of the year_ at Swedish Guldbaggegalan, and it won _Best Swedish Feature – The City Of Gothenburg Award_, at the Gothenburg Film Festival.
