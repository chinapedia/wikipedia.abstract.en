GEORGE RAYMOND RICHARD MARTIN[1] (born GEORGE RAYMOND MARTIN, September 20, 1948),[2] also known as GRRM,[3] is an American novelist and short story writer in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres, screenwriter, and television producer. He is best known for his series of epic fantasy novels, _A Song of Ice and Fire_, which was adapted into the HBO series _Game of Thrones_ (2011–2019).

In 2005, Lev Grossman of _Time_ called Martin "the American Tolkien",[4] and in 2011, he was included on the annual _Time_ 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5][6]


Early life

George Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)[7] was born on September 20, 1948,[8] in Bayonne, New Jersey,[9] the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and his wife Margaret Brady Martin. He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. His mother was of half Irish ancestry.[10] He also acknowledges French, English, Welsh and German roots,[11] which were confirmed on the television series _Finding Your Roots_. However, while he also believed he was a quarter Italian because of who he was told was his paternal grandfather, a DNA test on the show confirmed his Irish and other ancestries but excluded any Italian ancestry, showing instead he is approximately a quarter Ashkenazi Jewish.[12]

The family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[13] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[14] Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[15] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; "Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien."[16] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of _Fantastic Four_ was printed in issue No. 20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., _Fantastic Four_ #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[17] he was the first to register for an early comic book convention held in New York in 1964.[18] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best fan fiction for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier".[19]

In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating _summa cum laude_; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[20] Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status;[21] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.[22]


Teaching

In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their _Children of the Dusk_.[23]

In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive", from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.[24] From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.[25]

While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. He resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1979.[26]


Writing career

Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to _Galaxy_ magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award[27] and Nebula Awards was "With Morning Comes Mistfall", published in 1973 in _Analog_ magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in _Epoch_, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, _Dying of the Light_, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of _Star Wars_ had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.[28]

The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit, but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer's victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.[29][30]

Martin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998. In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the novella _The Storms of Windhaven_, co-written with Lisa Tuttle.[31] Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm".

In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered _Sandkings_ (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella _Nightflyers_ (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, _Nightflyers_, with a screenplay co-written by Martin.[32] Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.[33] While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.[34] He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, "Night of the Vampyres", collected in Harry Turtledove's anthology _The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century_ (2001).[35]

In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled _Fevre Dream_ set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in _Fevre Dream_ vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised _Fevre Dream_ for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: "This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time".[36] Martin followed up _Fevre Dream_ with another horror novel, _The Armageddon Rag_ (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of _The Armageddon Rag_ "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled.

In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel _Black and White and Red All Over_, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of _The Armageddon Rag_, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in _Tuf Voyaging_, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt _The Armageddon Rag_ into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of _The Twilight Zone_, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.[37][38][39] At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant. After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series _Max Headroom_. He worked on scripts and created the show's "Ped Xing" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series _Beauty and the Beast_; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.

In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in _Portraits of His Children_. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author _Wild Cards_ book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In _Second Person_, Martin "gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his _Wild Cards_ shared-world anthologies".[40] An important element in the creation of the multiple author series was a campaign of Chaosium's role-playing game _Superworld_ (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque.[41] Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his "lost year", but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in _Superworld_ could somehow become profitable.[42] Martin's own contributions to _Wild Cards_ have included Thomas Tudbury, "The Great and Powerful Turtle", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying "shell" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. , 21 _Wild Cards_ volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, _Low Ball_ (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd _Wild Cards_ volume, _High Stakes_, which was released in August 2016.[43]

In August 2016 Martin announced that Universal Cable Productions had acquired the rights to adapt the _Wild Cards_ novels into a television series.[44] In 2017, Martin confirmed he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the 2010 novel _Who Fears Death_ by Nnedi Okorafor.[45] Martin also contributed to an upcoming video game titled _Elden Ring_, writing the overarching lore and worldbuilding aspects for it.[46][47]

_A Song of Ice and Fire_

, 1998]] In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[48] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[49] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination.[50] Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[51]

This eventually turned into his epic fantasy series: _A Song of Ice and Fire_, which was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, _The Accursed Kings_[52] and _Ivanhoe_. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes,[53] it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, _A Game of Thrones_, was published in 1996, followed by _A Clash of Kings_ in 1998 and _A Storm of Swords_ in 2000. In November 2005, _A Feast for Crows_, the fourth novel in this series, became _The New York Times_ No. 1 Bestseller.[54] The fifth book, _A Dance with Dragons_, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List[55] and many others; it remained on the _New York Times_ list for 88 weeks. In 2012, _A Dance With Dragons_ made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award,[56] World Fantasy Award,[57] Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award;[58] the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[59] Two more novels are planned in the series: _The Winds of Winter_ and the final volume _A Dream of Spring_. On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, _Fire & Blood_, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018.[60]

HBO adaptation

HBO Productions purchased the television rights for the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series in 2007 and began airing the fantasy series on their US premium cable channel on April 17, 2011. Titled _Game of Thrones_, it ran weekly for ten episodes, each approximately an hour long.[61] Although busy completing _A Dance With Dragons_ and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.

The first season was nominated for 13 Emmy Awards, ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for Peter Dinklage as Best Supporting Actor.

The first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the World Science Fiction Society each year at the annual Worldcon; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for _Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form_, at Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to _Game of Thrones_ show-runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.

The second season, based on the second _A Song of Ice and Fire_ novel _A Clash of Kings_, began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second season episode "Blackwater", written by Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the _Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form_ category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the 71st World Science Fiction Convention. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.

Seasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.[62]

By the end of 2016, all seasons up to season 6 (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray[63] for home viewing (see List of _Game of Thrones_ episodes). The company confirmed on July 18, 2016 that season 7 would consist of seven episodes instead of the usual ten, and would premiere later than usual, in mid-2017, because of the later filming schedule. This was necessary in order to be shooting during the winter season in Europe.[64] Season 7 was expected to air in mid 2017. The first footage from the season was revealed in a new promotional video that featured clips from its new and returning original shows for the coming year on November 28, 2016, showcasing Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark.[65][66] Like the previous season, it would largely consist of original content not found in Martin's _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series, but also adapts material from the upcoming sixth and seventh novels: _The Winds of Winter_ and _A Dream of Spring_.[67]

For season 8, in November 2016, President of Programming Casey Bloys indicated that he had had preliminary discussions about a prequel spinoff to the _Game of Thrones_ series with Martin.[68] In May 2017, HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and Bryan Cogman – to develop individual spin-offs. All of the writers are to be working individually with Martin.[69][70] According to Casey Bloys, Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts.[71] The first episode of season 8 was broadcast on April 14, 2019.[72] This season had a total of six episodes.

Themes

Martin's work has been described as having "complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing" by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer.[73] Dana Jennings of the _New York Times_ described Martin's work as "fantasy for grown ups"[74] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical.[75] Martin's first novel, _Dying of the Light_, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: "Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic."[76] The overall gloominess of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere."[77] However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of "realness" and "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:

  There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.[78]

Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. _Publishers Weekly_ writes of his ongoing epic fantasy _A Song of Ice and Fire_: "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates."[79] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".[80]

In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic "good versus evil" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent "heroic knights and chivalry" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as "Disneyland Middle Ages",[81] which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as "the American Tolkien" by literary critics.[82] While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien's legacy,[83] he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien's "medieval philosophy" of "if the king was a good man, the land would prosper" to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: "We look at real history and it's not that simple ... Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king."[84] Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an "anti-Tolkien" approach to fantasy writing which,[85] according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien's idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien's work.[86][87] The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker "says he wouldn't have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first".[88] Similarly, Mark Lawrence, author of _Prince of Thorns_, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.[89]

The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies[90] that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as _A Song of Ice and Fire_ is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,[91] not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; "If you look at _The Lord of the Rings_, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series."[92] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner,[93] he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.[94]

In 2018, Martin called _The Lord of the Rings_, _The Great Gatsby_, _Gone with the Wind_, _Great Expectations_, _Lonesome Dove_, _Catch-22_, and _Charlotte's Web_ "favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life".[95]


Relationship with fans

Blog

(June 2011)]] Martin actively contributes to his blog, _Not a Blog_; in April 2018 he moved his blog from Livejournal to his own website.[96] He still does all his "writing on an old DOS machine running Wordstar 4.0".[97]

Conventions

Martin is known for his regular attendance at science fiction conventions and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer Thomas Disch identified Martin as a member of the "Labor Day Group", writers who regularly congregated at the annual Worldcon, usually held on or around the Labor Day weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions, and since 1986 Martin has participated annually in Albuquerque's smaller regional convention Bubonicon, near his New Mexico home.[98][99] He was the Guest of Honor at the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, held in 2003.[100][101]

In December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series _A Song of Ice and Fire_.[102]

Fan club

Martin's official fan club is the "Brotherhood Without Banners", which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his _A Song of Ice and Fire_ fantasy series. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.[103]

Criticism

Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, _A Feast for Crows_ (2005), and the fifth volume, _A Dance with Dragons_ (2011).[104][105] The previous year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.[106] Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, "George R. R. Martin is not your bitch". Gaiman later went on to state that writers are not machines and that they have every right to work on other projects if they want to.[107]

Fan fiction

Martin is opposed to fan fiction, which he views as copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in worldbuilding and character development.[108][109]


Personal life

(the 71st World Science Fiction Convention), 2013]]

In the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote _Windhaven_.[110]

While attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979, without issue.[111] On February 15, 2011, Martin married his longtime partner Parris McBride during a small ceremony at their Santa Fe home. On August 19, 2011, they held a larger wedding ceremony and reception at Renovation, the 69th World Science Fiction Convention.[112]

He and McBride are supporters of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico.[113] In early 2013, he purchased Santa Fe's Jean Cocteau Cinema and Coffee House, which had been closed since 2006. He had the property completely restored, including both its original 35 mm capability to which was added digital projection and sound; the Cocteau officially reopened for business on August 9, 2013.[114] Martin has also supported Meow Wolf, an arts collective in Santa Fe, having pledged $2.7 million towards a new art-space in January 2015.[115][116]

In response to a question on his religious views, Martin replied: "I suppose I'm a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic. I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn't the end and there's something more, but I can't convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever."[117]

Martin is a fan of the New York Jets, the New York Giants and the New York Mets.[118][119][120] He is also a fan of the Grateful Dead, and says that the band's music may have influenced his work.[121]

Martin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode, "El Skeletorito", of the Adult Swim show _Robot Chicken_.

He also appeared in SyFy's _Z Nation_ as a zombie version of himself in season two's "The Collector", where he is still signing copies of his new novel.[122][123]


Philanthropy

In 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and "killed off" in an upcoming _A Song of Ice and Fire_ novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.[124][125]

In 2017 Martin announced that he was funding The Miskatonic Scholarship. The Miskatonic Scholarship allows a writer of Lovecraftian cosmic horror to attend the Odyssey workshop, a six week writing workshop held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.[126][127]


Politics

Growing up, Martin avoided the draft to the Vietnam War by being a conscientious objector and did two years of alternative service. He generally opposes war and thought the Vietnam War was a "terrible mistake for America". He has also written about the glory of war and tries to realistically describe war in his books.[128]

In 2014, Martin endorsed Democratic Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.[129]

In the midst of pressure to pull the 2014 feature film _The Interview_ from theatres, the Jean Cocteau Theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has been owned by Martin since 2013, decided to show the film. Theatre manager Jon Bowman told the _Santa Fe New Mexican_: "Martin feels strongly about the First Amendment and the idea of artists having the ability to speak their minds and not having to worry about being targets."[130]

On November 20, 2015, writing on his LiveJournal blog, Martin advocated for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States.[131] Immediately following Bernie Sanders' defeat in the U.S. Democratic primary election, he supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general 2016 United States presidential election, and criticized Donald Trump during the election and following her defeat, commenting that Trump would "become the worst president in American history".[132][133][134][135]

In May 2019, Martin endorsed Joe Biden for President in 2020.[136]

'My four years at Marist High School were not the happiest of my life,' the author admits, although his growing enthusiasm for writing comics and superhero stories first emerged during this period."
