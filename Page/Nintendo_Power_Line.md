The NINTENDO POWER LINE was a hotline that provided readers of _Nintendo Power_ magazine hints to their favorite video games on Nintendo consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.[1] It ran from the publishing of the first issue publication of Nintendo Power to June 2010, due to the Internet becoming more widespread.[2] It was revived from November 11 to November 13, 2016 in celebration of the release of the NES Classic Edition.[3] The messages of the revived format, however, were automated rather than being live.[4]
