_DEATH RATTLE_ was an American black-and-white horror anthology comic book series published in three volumes by Kitchen Sink Press in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. _Death Rattle_ is not related to the Australian one-shot comic _Death Rattle_, published by Gredown in c. 1983.[1]

Starting out as an underground comix homage to classic horror comics like _Tales from the Crypt_,[2][3] _Death Rattle_ did not fall under the purview of the Comics Code, allowing the title to feature stronger content — such as profanity, nudity, and graphic violence — than other comparable horror titles.[4]


Publication history

_Death Rattle_ volume 1 was published from June 1972–June 1973 under the Krupp Comic Works imprint, putting out three issues in all.

Twelve years later, _Death Rattle_ was revived for volume 2, publishing 18 issues between October 1985–October 1988 under the Kitchen Sink Comix imprint. The first five issues were in full color, but for issue #6 onwards the title reverted to black-and-white.

_Death Rattle_ volume 3 ran five issues from Dec. 1995–June 1996, again under the Kitchen Sink Comix imprint.


_Death Rattle_ Vol. 1

The early 1970s saw a number of underground publishers putting out horror comics, from the San Francisco Comic Book Company's _Bogeyman_; Rip Off Press' _Skull_ and _Up From the Deep_; Richard Corben's _Fantagor_; the Print Mint's _Insect Fear_ and _Deviant Slice_; Shroud's _Gory Stories_ ; and Last Gasp's _Two Fisted Zombies_.[5] Kitchen Sink Press joined the wave with _Death Rattle_.

The first volume of _Death Rattle_ featured the work of Tim Boxell as well as contributions from a number of other creators, including Richard Corben, Peter Poplaski, John M. Pound, Mike Vosburg, and Tom Veitch.


_Death Rattle_ Vol. 2

_Death Rattle_ volume 2 was notable for being one of the few horror titles published during the 1980s, rivaled only by DC Comics' _Swamp Thing_ and FantaCo Enterprises's _Gore Shriek_.

The second volume of _Death Rattle_ was lead-edited by Dave Schreiner; the series is most notable for Jaxon's 11-part, 126-page "Bulto… The Cosmic Slug", about a space creature's effect on the people of the ancient Southwest. Rand Holmes did many of the covers. Mark Schultz's story "Xenozoic!", published in _Death Rattle_ #8 (Dec. 1986), launched its own title, _Xenozoic Tales_, shortly thereafter.[6]

Other notable contributors to the second volume of _Death Rattle_ were Charles Burns, Charles Dallas, Richard Corben, Will Eisner, Steve Stiles, Mike Baron, Sam Kieth, Basil Wolverton, Stephen R. Bissette, Spain Rodriguez, William Stout, Joe Coleman, Al Williamson, Wally Wood, Don Simpson, Dan Burr, and Frank Miller (who illustrated the cover of the final issue).

The letters page was known was "Fang Mail."


_Death Rattle_ Vol. 3

Contributors to the third volume of _Death Rattle_ included Brian Biggs, Mark Schultz, Mark A. Nelson, John Wagner, Alexander Maleev, James O'Barr, Tony Millionaire, John Wooley, Tom Sutton, Matt Howarth, and Thomas Ott.

_Death Rattle_ volume 3 was edited by Phil Amara, N. C. Christopher Couch, and Catherine Gornie; it was nominated for the 1997 Harvey Award for Best Anthology.[7]
