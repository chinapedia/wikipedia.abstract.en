ČESTIBOR ([1]) was a 9th-century King of the Lusatian Serbs (Sorbs). He was a vassal of Louis the German. In 856 he led the Sorbs into battle alongside King Louis against the Glomacze tribe, defeating them and putting them under German rule. Shortly after in 859, the Sorbs had risen against Čestibor and killed him, causing a rebellion against King Louis.[2]
