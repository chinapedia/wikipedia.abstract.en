Plot

Tina's ideas of love and romance are tested when she volunteers at a nursing home to earn her next Thunder Girls badge. Meanwhile, Bob makes new friends who lead him to make some questionable choices.


Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode a B+, he explained his rating by saying, "Still, “Secret Admiral-er” is a Tina episode, and perhaps it’s because Tina’s character arc has flattened now that her stories aren’t quite as consistently amazing as they were a couple years ago. The main story is solid, especially since the show gives itself a relatively high degree of difficulty with how it plays Meryl’s senility. There’s nothing inherently wrong with playing a nonagenarian’s mental state for laughs—well, I suppose you could argue there is, but I’m looking to keep my amoral, value-neutral reviewer pose going, you know?—but this is slightly harsher material than Bob’s Burgers usually goes in for, and it takes a little finesse to balance the various comedic targets."[1]

The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.23 million people.[2]
