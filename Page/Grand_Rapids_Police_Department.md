The GRAND RAPIDS POLICE DEPARTMENT is the second-largest municipal police department in the state of Michigan.[4] The department is staffed by 294 sworn personnel and 104 civilian employees.[5] In 2016, the department responded to 63,422[6] calls for service in a city of over 196,000.[7]


History

Establishment

The Grand Rapids Police Department was established in 1871.[8] Prior to this, the city was protected by five constables and two night watchmen employed by local merchants and reportedly "addicted to drunkenness and laziness."[9] After a local newspaper published a series of articles on incompetence and dishonesty in the city's private police force, the city charter was amended and a municipal police department consisting of a police chief and eight patrolmen was created.[10]

Headquarters Locations

To date, the GRPD headquarters has been in four different buildings; none of the previous sites remain standing today.[11] The first police headquarters consisted of a two-room office suite located over a grocer at 101 Monroe Avenue in downtown Grand Rapids.[12] In 1882, the department moved to the intersection of Lyon and Campau.[13] In 1892, a new headquarters was built at the intersection of Crescent and Ottawa designed by notable Detroit-based architect Elijah E. Meyers.[14] This location was expanded in 1915 and occupied for over 70 years before being demolished.[15][16] In 1967, the department moved to the newly built Hall of Justice, located on the site of the present-day DeVos Place convention center on Monroe Avenue.[17] In 2001, the department moved into the current headquarters, a renovated Herpolsheimer's department store located at 1 Monroe Center NW.[18][19]

Fallen Officers

A total of fifteen GRPD officers have been killed since the department's first recorded death in 1895.[20] Fourteen of those officers died on-duty, while one was killed off-duty attempting to rescue an electrocution victim.[21] Of those killed on-duty, eight were killed by gunfire and six were killed in traffic accidents.[22]


Equipment

Patrol Vehicles

The GRPD utilizes the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (CVPI) and Ford Police Interceptor Utility SUV as its primary marked patrol vehicles. The department began replacing its aging fleet of 80 Crown Victorias in 2013, when the Ford Motor Company announced that it would no longer be producing the model.[23] The department announced that it would phase in the Police Interceptor Utility over four years as existing vehicles reached the end of their service life.[24]

The department also utilizes a number of other platforms for specialized patrol functions, including bicycles,[25] segways,[26] and horses.[27]

Firearms

The GRPD issues the 9mm Glock 17 as its primary service weapon. The department chose the Glock in 2014 as a replacement for the previously issued .40 caliber Sig Sauer P229 pistol.[28]

In 2015, the department began deploying Colt M4 semi-automatic rifles in marked patrol vehicles to supplement the shotguns that were already carried.[29]

Less-Lethal

GRPD officers carry a number of less-lethal options, including pepper spray, collapsible batons, and tasers.[30]

Body Cameras

All GRPD uniformed patrol officers wear Axon 2 body cameras.[31]


In popular culture

Films

-   The GRPD is featured briefly in the 2011 film "30 Minutes or Less" during a car chase.[32] The film uses "fake" patrol vehicles and the livery is not entirely accurate; while actual GRPD marked patrol vehicles are solid blue, the vehicles depicted in the film are black and white.[33]
-   The GRPD is featured at various points in the 2011 film "House of the Rising Sun."
