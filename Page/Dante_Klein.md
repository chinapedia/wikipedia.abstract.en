MAX KRUL, also known professionally as DANTE KLEIN, is a Dutch DJ and record producer.[1] He is best known for his collaboration with Canadian group Cheat Codes for the single "Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)".


Career

At the age of 10, he began learning to use some DJ equipment and production software.[2] The stage name Dante Klein is from Krul's word selection of Klein which means "little" in Dutch and his father's suggestion of Dante. He went to the Herman Brood Academy, a school for musical artists.[3] In 2015, he released the song "Ertesuppe" which was described as a "blend of a deep and lush landscape of sound, fingerplucked guitar lines, and a tropical and mellow vibe."[4] The song was his debut single on Spinnin' Deep, a sub-label of the then-independent dance music record label Spinnin' Records. He later collaborated with Sam Feldt for the single "Feels Like Home". In 2016, the collaborative single titled "Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)" with Cheat Codes was released.[5]
