1.  The first part is directly inspired by the film '' Shoah '' by Claude Lanzmann, where the Polish resistant Karski is interviewed.
2.  The second part summarizes in approximately 80 pages the testimony of Karski published in English in 1944 under the title _Story of a secret state_.
3.  The third part depicts Karski's feelings and relates dialogues that are presented by the author as a fiction.

Claude Lanzmann published a vigorous criticism of the novel of which he described the third part as a "falsification of history".[3] He reproached Haenel for having plagiarized the dialogues of his film without having asked for authorization.
