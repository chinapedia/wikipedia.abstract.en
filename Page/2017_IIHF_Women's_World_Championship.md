Relegation round

The third and fourth placed team from Group B played a best-of-three series to determine the relegated team. The IIHF opted to expand the World Championship to ten teams starting in 2019, so no team was relegated after all.

Switzerland won series 2–1

Threatened boycott by US players

On 15 March 2017, the U.S. team announced that unless concessions were made by USA Hockey, they would boycott the World Championship to protest inequitable support and conditions for women's hockey.[6] The players were publicly supported by the players' associations for the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NFL, and the NHL.

After several days of stalled negotiations and attempts to field a team of non-boycotting players, causing concern over such a team being competitive, an agreement was struck with USA Hockey to increase player pay and support for women's development; the original players immediately agreed to play in the World Championship.[7][8][9]
