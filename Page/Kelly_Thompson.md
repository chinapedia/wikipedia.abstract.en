I think we had at least half a dozen legitimate companies inquiring about the rights. We also had some more intimate interest from writers and smaller producers, a couple film agents also came calling.".[8][9]

In December 2014, it was revealed that she would write a Jem and the Holograms comic based on the television of the same name, it was meant to be modern re-imagining of the series.[10] the series ended on June 14, 2017, with issue #26.[11] During the 2015 "Secret Wars" storyline, she co-wrote her first Marvel comic, a four issue tie-in series titled _Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps_ with Kelly Sue DeConnick.[12] In 2016, Thompson and Brenden Fletcher wrote a spin-off six issue Power Rangers mini-series titled _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink_ for Boom!
