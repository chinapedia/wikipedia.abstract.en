Character

Although noble-born girls usually go to the convent to learn how to be noblewomen, Alanna and her twin brother Thom devise a plan to send her to learn to be a knight instead. Alanna is a stubborn tomboy with a temper, but she earns the trust of her fellow knights in training; George Cooper, the king of thieves; and Jonathan, prince of Tortall. Alanna often questions her own character because of her double identity, small size, and magical abilities, but she learns to overcome that as she becomes a knight. As a grown woman, she was a talented warrior, but neglected being a part of her children's lives growing up because of her work. [1] Alanna has coppery red hair and purple eyes, with purple magic to match. As mentioned before, she is of small stature, but to make up for that, she has a great amount of speed which helped her in her training to become a knight of Tortall. She has a matching personality to her hair: fiery and spunky and loves to get into trouble with her fellow squires and knights. However, despite her disguise of a male appearance, she still loves to have a feminine side every once in awhile. Alanna was never close with her birth father because he neglected his children after his wife died, locking himself away in his studies, leaving Alanna and her twin brother Thom to be raised by Coram and Maude. Eventually Lord Alan dies and while Alanna mournes for him, she has to continue on and she mostly forgets about him. In "The Woman Who Rides Like A Man" Alanna, Coram, and one of Alanna's teachers Myles of Olau journey into the desert to find the Bahir people. There, the people of the Bloody Hawk tribe adopt them and Alanna is adopted by Myles. She also becomes Myles' heir.
