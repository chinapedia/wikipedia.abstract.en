THE CHICAGO COMMUNITY TRUST (THE TRUST), headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a community foundation made to (according to their website) "give local residents an opportunity to support their community in perpetuity".[1]


History

The Chicago Community Trust was founded in 1915 by bankers Norman Wait Harris and Albert Wadsworth Harris, and was initially presented to the board of Harris Trust & Savings Bank. The Trust's first donation was $200,000.[2] Norman died the following year,[3] with his son Albert taking over the Trust.

An early history of the Trust was written by Frank D. Loomis, an early leader of the Trust. It covers the Trust and its development during 1915â€“1962.[4] However, this account does not criticize the Trust or the motives of any of its trustees.[5]

Loomis later wrote a more detailed piece on the development of community foundations, after his retirement from the Trust. In this piece, Loomis mentioned how he thinks banks shouldn't be handling non-profit organizations as it points to their greedier motives, and raised the question: "A bank is a corporation organized for profit; should it also manage and control a charitable institution organized not-for-profit?"[6]

The Chicago Community Trust is also the second oldest and one of the largest community foundations in the United States.[7][8]
