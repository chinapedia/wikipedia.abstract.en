MERIDIAN SECONDARY SCHOOL is a government co-educational secondary school in Pasir Ris, Singapore. It was formed by a merger between two secondary schools – Coral Secondary and Siglap Secondary in 2017.


History

Coral Secondary School (1999–2016)

Coral Secondary School opened in January 1999 with 6 Secondary one classes (3 classes of Express; 2 classes of Normal [Academic] and 1 class of Normal [Technical]). The initial staff comprised 17 teaching staff and 8 support staff. The school began its lessons at Siglap Secondary School and moved to its new premises on 15 November 1999. RAdm Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defence, officially opened it on 19 May 2001.

The original name of the school in Chinese is a literal translation of the word 'coral'. However, it had been changed to 'Yunhai', which can be interpreted and written in two versions: the original or the simplified form. The original version literally means cloud and sea. It is believed that corals grow well in the sea with a cloudy sky. The Chinese characters emphasises the importance of tradition and culture as well as the beauty of art and music. Hence, the school has adopted the original version of the interpretation of 'coral'.

Siglap Secondary School (1955–2016)

SIGLAP SECONDARY SCHOOL (Abbreviation: SSS) was Singapore's first co-educational secondary school. It was also among one of the first schools in Singapore to offer Malay-medium secondary classes.[1][2] The school was founded in 1955 and shifted from its original location of Cheviot Hill in Siglap to its current location of Pasir Ris in the eastern part of Singapore.[3]

In 2000, the school moved from its old campus at Siglap Road to the new premises at Pasir Ris. The newer campus included upgraded facilities to hold more classes in a morning session and became a single-session school in the same year.[4]

Merger as Meridian Secondary School

In December 2015, the Ministry of Education announced that due to lack of demand, Siglap Secondary School would not receive a new cohort of Secondary 1 students in 2016.[5] This was followed by an announcement in March 2016 that Siglap Secondary School would be merged with Coral Secondary School from January 2017 onwards.[6] The school was renamed to Meridian Secondary School with the absorbing of Siglap Secondary School.[7]
