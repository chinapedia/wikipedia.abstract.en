Qualification

Singles

Eight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:[4]

1.  First, the top 7 players in the ATP Race to London on the Monday after the final tournament of the ATP World Tour, that is, after the 2017 Paris Masters.
2.  Second, up to two 2017 Grand Slam tournament winners ranked anywhere 8th-20th, in ranking order
3.  Third, the eighth ranked player in the ATP rankings

In the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.[5]

Provisional rankings are published weekly as the _Emirates ATP Race to London_, coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP World Tour, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Futures tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the previous years Tour Finals excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:

-   The 4 Grand Slam tournaments
-   The 8 mandatory ATP Masters tournaments
-   The best results from any 6 other tournaments that carry ranking points

All players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2016 in the world's top 30 are _commitment players_ who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP.[6] Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.

Players may have their ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:

1.  600 tour level matches (as of January 1, 2017), including matches from Challengers and Futures played before year 2010;
2.  12 years of service;
3.  31 years of age (as of January 1, 2017).

If a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.[7]

Doubles

Eight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles.[8] The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP.[9] Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.
