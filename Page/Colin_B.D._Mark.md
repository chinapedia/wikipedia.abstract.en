He holds an undergraduate degree in Classics from the University of Aberdeen. He taught for nearly 40 years in a number of schools in the South-East and North-East of Scotland.

His _Gaelic verbs systemised and simplified_ (2006) received widespread praise including from Ruairidh MacIlleathain, BBC Alba journalist and writer, who praised the book's attention to idiom.[2]

His _Gaelic to English Dictionary_ (2002) is one of a small number of Scottish Gaelic dictionaries in the modern era and has received praise for its practical and user friendly nature. David Stifter, who reviewed the dictionary in Language (journal) the journal of the Linguistic Society of America praised the dictionary's comprehensiveness, including over 90,000 entries gathered from twenty years of study, in his opinion unparalleled except by older dictionaries by Edward Dwelly and Malcolm MacLennan.[3][4] The dictionary was also recommended by Victor Price.[5]
