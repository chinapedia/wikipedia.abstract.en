History

ROI Hunter platform was developed as an in-house solution at Business Factory, an online marketing agency founded in 2007,[2] to manage large scale of ads without being limited by native Facebook tools e.g. Ads Manager. In September 2014, Business Factory received a Preferred Marketing Developer badge (now Facebook Marketing Partners program[3]) in a field of ad technology for its in-house platform, now called ROI Hunter.[4] Their clients are advertising in more than 88 countries around the world.[5]


Product

Platform works as SaaS model and is highly focused on ROI performance, automated ads creation, optimisation and DATA INTEGRATION (Google Analytics, Adjust, AppsFlyer mobile measurement partners). Their solution for e-commerce is based on INTEGRATING PRODUCT FEEDS with hundreds of items and connecting Google Analytics data to identify the best performing products and ads supporting CROSS-DEVICE REMARKETING.[6][7] ROI Hunter was among the first Facebook Marketing Partners to test advanced Dynamic Product Ads which will help advertisers to dynamically reach new potential customers who haven't visited retailer's website yet as a new way of PROSPECTING MARKETING strategy. These campaigns can be targeted to any audience such as lookalikes, custom audience from CRM etc.[8][9]

A new tool for DYNAMIC IMAGE TEMPLATES combines product feed tags and layers as in Photoshop, and managed to decrease cost per click and increase CTR and conversions.[10][11]
