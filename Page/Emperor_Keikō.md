, also known as was the 12th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.[1][2] His reign is conventionally dated as 71–130 AD.[3]


Legendary narrative

His legend was recorded in _Kojiki_ and _Nihon Shoki_, but the accounts of him are different in these two sources. In the _Kojiki_, he sent his son Prince Ōsu (Yamato Takeru) to Kyūshū to conquer local tribes. In the _Nihon Shoki_, Keikō himself went there and won battles against local tribes. According to both sources, he sent Yamato Takeru to Izumo Province and eastern provinces to conquer the area and spread his territory.[4]

According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the .[5] The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.[6] The _Nihon Shoki_ explains that this move occurred in the 51st year of Keiko's reign, but the shrine tradition also dates this event in the 1st year of Emperor Chūai's reign.[7]


Known information

Emperor Keikō is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study.[8] The name Keikō_-tennō_ was assigned to him posthumously by later generations..[9] His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Keikō, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the _Kojiki_.[10] While the actual site of Keikō's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Keikō's mausoleum, and is formally named _Yamanobe no michi no e no misasagi_.[11][12]

Outside of the _Kiki_, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates.[13] The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.[14]
