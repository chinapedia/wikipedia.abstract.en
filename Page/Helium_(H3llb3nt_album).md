_HELIUM_ is the second studio album by the electronic band H3llb3nt. It was released in 1998 on Re-Constriction Records.[1]


Reception

_CMJ_ critic David Avery gave the album a positive write-up saying "Helium takes the elements industrial holds dear — sinister, breathy vocals, brutal beatscapes and slicing guitar riffs — and augments them with intelligently programmed rhythmss and a wide range of electro influences."[2] _Aiding & Abetting_ was also enthusiastic, saying despite re-using previously released tracks that fans of the band's debut "will find plenty here to get you going once more."[3]
