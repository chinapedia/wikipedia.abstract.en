Travis_Shallow_in_the_woods.jpg TRAVIS SHALLOW (born TRAVIS LEIGH SHALLOW; July 31, 1984) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and recording artist.[1]

He is best known for his prolific solo career, and as a former member of alternative country band A FEW GOOD LIARS, with whom he recorded one studio album in 2011 titled, _Battered Wooden Body_. "That album showcases the harmony vocal power of the group and Shallow sings songs that can be tender and those that traffic in darkness. In all he does so with restraint, whether on country tinged acoustic ballads (the excellent "Amen") or aching confession-drenched numbers"[2] "Battered Wooden Body" was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi at TWEED RECORDING STUDIO and was engineered by ANDREW RATCLIFFE whose discography includes (The Black Crows, The Damnwells, American Aquarium)

In 2012, Shallow left A Few Good Liars and started writing and recording songs that would later be released as his first solo self-titled album, _Travis Shallow_, to regional critical acclaim in the southeastern United States.

Shallow went back to Tweed Recording Studio with Andrew Ratcliffe engineering to record his solo debut album. This solo album was acoustically driven with an accompanying band to highlight the songwriting and lyrical prowess. "Shallow is a singer whose vocal personality is ultimately a category unto itself, like a Willie Nelson, an Otis Redding. He could sing anything and make it sound great, make it well worth listening to. His self-titled album has seven songs like that."[3] Shallow's solo album has a maturity to it that catapulted Shallow into being a weathered musician's musician.

After the release of his self-titled album in March 2016, Shallow took the show to the people performing intimate shows, stripped down with him and an acoustic guitar. Shallow also landed himself some national opening spots after releasing his debut solo album with legend Gregg Allman from The Allman Brothers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real (son of legend Willie Nelson), The Marcus King Band, Jerry Joseph, Todd Snider, and fellow native North Carolina band, American Aquarium.

Shallow is now writing for and fronting a new line-up, TRAVIS SHALLOW & THE DEEP END, with a studio album titled, THE GREAT DIVIDE, released on October 31, 2017. This 8-song album is a mix of Americana, soul, and rock and roll, recorded analog to two-inch tape at OVERDUB LANE in Durham, North Carolina with JASON MERRITT engineering.

THE GREAT DIVIDE was featured in Relix Magazine upon release. "Emerging from NC- Travis Shallow & The Deep End dive into The Great Divide with their eyes wide open. Their debut release seamlessly weaves genres, adding a touch of surprise, yet staying hauntingly familiar. Shallow is a musician’s musician, and his new release, The Great Divide, is your window in."[4]

Shallow has been compared vocally to Kris Kristofferson on a couple of choice ballad tracks from The Great Divide. "THE GREAT DIVIDE: A whole host of memories of my time in the south-land (mostly in Huntsville, Alabama & lower Tennessee) are stirred up by Travis’s superbly crafted songs and guitar work… he has a voice that (somehow) reminds me of another of my Americana heroes, Kris Kristofferson… as you listen to his extraordinary lyrics & vocal work on the soul-filled “River That Sings“, you’ll realize why I say that…" [5]
