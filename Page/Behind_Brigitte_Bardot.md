_BEHIND BRIGITTE BARDOT_ (subtitled _COOL SOUNDS FROM HER HOT SCENES_) is an album by composer, arranger and conductor Pete Rugolo featuring performances of tunes associated with the films of Brigitte Bardot recorded in late 1959 and first released on the Warner Bros. label.[1]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Jason Ankeny noted: "the precise raison d'être behind the album is a mystery, but it's nevertheless a charmer, boasting some of Pete Rugolo's lushest and loveliest arrangements ... wry, cool-toned jazz melodies heavy on innuendo and late-night appeal. Whatever the notion behind the session, the execution's delightful".[2]
