WRECK AND REFERENCE is an experimental rock group based in Los Angeles, California. Their sound is characterized by experimentation with a wide variety of vocal styles over electronic instrumentation, composed of samples and synthesizers, and acoustic drums. The group has been closely associated with San Francisco-based record label The Flenser.


History

Wreck and Reference (sometime stylized Wreck & Reference or W&R) begun as a garage project in Davis, CA in 2009.[1] The band began drawing mainstream attention after the release of the _Y̶o̶u̶t̶h̶_ LP and the _C̶o̶n̶t̶e̶n̶t̶_ EP (pronounced "No Youth" and "No Content") in 2012.[2][3] In 2014 their second full length _Want_ was met with some critical acclaim and featured on "The Best Metal Albums of 2014" list by Pitchfork.[4][5][6] _Want_ was followed by a 75 track online-only release of the samples used to create the electronic instrumentals on the record.[7] Common themes on the albums include depression, anxiety, and pessimism, drawing influence largely from personal events, philosophy, and literature, especially Cormac McCarthy.[8][9] The band has a notable Twitter account.[10][11]
