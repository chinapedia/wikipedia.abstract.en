MIMI FERZT was a contemporary art space in SoHo, New York City. It exhibited Eastern European artists such as Mihail Chemiakin,[1] Nikolai Makarov and Oscar Rabine, as well maintained a roster of Soviet dissident artists[2] who were seeking refuge in the United States. It is permanently closed.[3]

The gallery helped establish the careers and expand the cultural footprint for members of the Soviet non-conformist art movement.
