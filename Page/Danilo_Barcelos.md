Club career

Danilo was born in Coronel Fabriciano, Minas Gerais. An América Mineiro youth graduate, he made his senior debut while on loan at Francana in 2011; subsequent loans followed, at Poços de Caldas and Anápolis.

Danilo returned to _Coelho_ in 2013, and made his first team debut on 25 May 2013 by starting and being sent off in a 0–1 away loss against Guaratinguetá for the Série B championship.[1] He finished the campaign with 35 appearances and one goal, against Bragantino on 6 October.

On 10 February 2014, Danilo was loaned to Série A club Sport Recife until the end of the year.[2] He made his debut in the competition on 27 April, coming on as a second-half substitute for Renan Oliveira in a 2–1 home win against Chapecoense.[3]

Danilo scored his first goal in the main category of Brazilian football on 31 August 2014, netting the last in a 2–0 home win against Criciúma.[4] He only returned to América in 2016, with the club in the top tier.

Danilo played 51 games and scored ten gols for América during the 2016 season, three of them in the finals of the 2016 Campeonato Mineiro, against Atlético Mineiro, playing a key role in the club's first state league trophy in 15 years.[5] On 21 December of that year, however, he was announced as new player of Atlético Mineiro for the upcoming season.[6]

After failing to make his breakthrough at _Galo_, Danilo subsequently served loans at Ponte Preta (two stints) and Vasco da Gama.
