CROOKED CREEK is a stream in Johnson and Pettis counties of the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Muddy Creek.

The stream headwaters arise at [2] in western Pettis County about 125 feet east of the Pettis-Johnson county line approximately five miles north of Windsor. The stream flows generally due north parallel to the county line and routes B and AA past the community of Owsley. The stream veers west into Johnson County for the last half mile before entering Muddy Creek at [3] about three miles southeast of Whiteman Air Force Base.[4]

Crooked Creek was so named due to the frequent meanders along its course.[5]
