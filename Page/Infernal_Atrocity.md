Critical reception

"_Infernal Atrocity_ is one of the best contemporary death metal albums... The album, bland title notwithstanding, is traditional in spirit and approach, but contemporary and cutting-edge on all other fronts. It is a welcome return for Jayson Sherlock who managed in transcending obscurity after the demise of Paramaecium. With Mortification considered a spent force creatively, it’s heartening to see one of the driving forces behind said band make such a convincing return. Hopefully this translates into opportunities for Revulsed so that they can build their own legacy. _Infernal Atrocity_ should appeal to modern – as well as traditional genre fans." writes Wouter Roemers.[4] Czech reviewer Prepil rated it as 8 out of 10 and explained, after being translated "And I'm glad I by chance stumbled on this band, and I think that certainly deserves your attention... [It's] full of brutal, yet dynamic Death Metal, which entertains even during continuous playback.."[5] "a musical, colorful, varied, extremely hard and content enjoyable profound album." writes Daniel F. ooriginally in German.[6] Batu Cetin reports "This album 2015 new album is considered that the end to be correct, the Australian group actually old mortification group of drummer Jason Sherlock's considered a new group of connoisseurs know 90 s Nuclear Blast Records former death metal legends Blaster Group mortification then, but this group Revulsed flour that has no relevance former group mortification la the album is really good, especially the album tons of mix master s etc perfect, there Konner we know from vocal Defeated Sanity, arrangement of parts and especially drummer Jason s distinctive style is recognized directly, so head pressing, the mid-tempo, blast heat and without full gas one of the last period in the best album you want to listen to an album cover one of the best cover is made by Par Olofsson and I think it did, we can summarize this group as formerly had a group legend is an American Gutted -Bleed for us tol with ive- called legendary album this is not the same style, but an overwhelming Revulsed groups, and that the gas full power, after listening to this album gutted I will understand what I mean who know very well. 32 minutes and 9-track album from start to finish is very energetic, especially 2. introduction of Part - agonizing Putrid Self Infliction's - and 3 part input pestilential Articulation head broke waving the neck, the kind that breaks the head, albums, those who miss the sound of bass guitar like me, this album grains bass guitar, guitar, and drums will be able to hear what is playing pleasure."[7] "A throwback to early 90s death metal. This album sounds like a lost Suffocation album that came right after "Effigy of the Forgotten". In fact, some of the riffs can be almost directly compared, like the intro to 'Enticement To Carnivorous Impoverishment' is almost identical to the intro to the song 'Breeding The Spawn'. But despite the lack of originality, this album has many great riffs, its a great performance, the production quality is clear (although like other early 90s metal, not as polished as it can be made now), and I'm still giving it a thumbs up. I guess many of the people in this band came from the new defunct InExordium, which was also all about recreating that origins of death metal sound, so in that respect, they have done a great job." writes Soul Killer.[8]
