_ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK_ is a 1981 American dystopian science fiction action film co-written, co-scored and directed by John Carpenter. It stars Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasence, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film is set in what was then the near-future year of 1997, in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum-security prison. When Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists and crashes into New York City, ex-soldier and federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Russell) is given 24 hours to rescue the President of the United States.

Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the Watergate scandal. After the success of _Halloween_, he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri, on an estimated budget of $6 million.[1][2] Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in _Halloween_.

_Escape from New York_ was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office.[3] The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and was followed by a sequel, _Escape from L.A._ (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell, but was much less favorably received.


Plot

In 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A wall surrounds the island, bridges have been mined, and all prisoners are sentenced to life.

In 1997, NATO is engaged in an escalating war with the Soviet Union across much of Europe, which threatens to become a nuclear holocaust. While traveling to a peace summit, Air Force One is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a stewardess. The President is given a tracking bracelet and is handcuffed to his briefcase, containing an audiotape describing the secret to using nuclear fusion for electricity generation, intended to be a gift to bring peace. He ejects in an escape pod, landing in Manhattan just before the plane crashes.

Police are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the overall crime boss, warns that the Duke has the President, who will be killed if any further rescue attempts are mounted. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former Special Forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve; if Snake rescues the President and the audiotape, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture his arteries within 22 hours; if Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.

Snake uses a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, then follows the tracking bracelet to a vaudeville theater, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man. Convinced the President is dead, Snake radios Hauk, but is told that he will be shot down if he comes out empty-handed.

Snake meets "Cabbie", who stayed to drive an armored taxi after Manhattan became a prison. Cabbie takes Snake to Harold "Brain" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake's. Brain is a brilliant engineer and has established an oil well and a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars. Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the Queensboro Bridge, using the President as a human shield and following a landline map that Brain drew. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at Grand Central Terminal. He finds the President, but is captured himself.

While Snake is forced to fight in a deathmatch against "Slag", Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag, then takes Brain, Maggie, and the President to the World Trade Center to use the glider to escape. After a band of crazies destroys it, the group returns to the street and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the audiotape, the President demands it, but Snake takes it.

The Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Cabbie, but they hit a mine and the latter is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's car until he runs her down. Snake and the President reach the wall, and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards, but the President kills the Duke with a guard's machine gun. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives are neutralized after he hands the audiotape over to Hauk.

As the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake asks for is how he feels about the people who died saving him, but the President only offers half-hearted regret. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake keeps walking. The President's speech commences, and he plays the audiotape; to his embarrassment, it is Cabbie's audiotape of the song "Bandstand Boogie". As Snake walks away, he unravels the audiotape with the President’s intended message.


Cast

In addition, frequent Carpenter collaborators Nancy Stephens and Buck Flower appeared as the stewardess/hijacker and the drunk with the President’s tracker, respectively, while then-active professional wrestler Ox Baker played Slag. Actor Joe Unger filmed scenes as Snake's partner-in-crime Taylor, but they were cut from the final film.


Production

Development

Carpenter originally wrote the screenplay for _Escape from New York_ in 1976, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it "because, according to Carpenter, "it was too dark, too violent, too scary, and too weird."[4] He had been inspired by the film _Death Wish_, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy, but liked how it conveyed "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science-fiction film along these lines".[5]

IFI agreed to provide 50% of the budget. Goldcrest Films signed a deal with them. They ended up providing £720,000 of the budget and making a profit of £672,000 from their investment after earning £1,392,000.[6]

Casting

AVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's financial backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the "lightweight" screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness."[7] All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.[8]

Pre-production

Carpenter had just made _Dark Star_, but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making _Escape_ later. After the success of _Halloween_, Avco-Embassy signed producer Debra Hill and him to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was _The Fog_. Initially, the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was _The Philadelphia Experiment_, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see."[9] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at University of Southern California, who played "The Shape" in _Halloween_. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.[10]

The film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semidestroyed version of New York City on a shoe-string budget.The film's production designer Joe Alves and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot."[11] They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), "on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America," producer Debra Hill remembers.[12]

Bernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois, because it was filled with old buildings "that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality" that the team was looking for.[13] East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, "block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away."[14] Also, Alves found an old bridge to double for the "69th St. Bridge". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, "so that they wouldn't have any liability," Hill remembers.[15] Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated,[16] as well as the building that would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.

Filming

Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange."[17] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape."[18] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system.[19] In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".[20]

Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England".[21] Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special-effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional wireframe animation.[22][23]


Reception

_Escape from New York_ opened in New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981.[24] The film grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981.[25] The film received generally positive reviews. As of March 3, 2019, it had a rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes from 60 reviews, with the critical consensus "Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, _Escape from New York_ is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness". _Newsweek_ magazine wrote of Carpenter "[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility - which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however".[26] In _Time_ magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, "John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It's a trip worth taking".[27] Vincent Canby, in his review for _The New York Times_, wrote, "[The film] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season."[28] In his review for the _Chicago Reader_, Dave Kehr, wrote "it fails to satisfy–it gives us too little of too much".[29]

Cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his novel _Neuromancer_. "I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot."[30] Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the film frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the _Metal Gear_ series. Solid Snake is partially influenced by Snake Plissken. In _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ Snake uses the alias "Pliskin" to hide his real identity during most of the game.[31] J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film _Cloverfield_, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for _Escape from New York_.[32] _Empire_ magazine ranked Snake Plissken #29 in their "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" poll.[33]

Videocassette releases

_Escape from New York_ was released numerous times on VHS during the 1980s and 1990s.

Laserdisc releases

_Escape from New York_ was released on Laserdisc 13 times between 1983 and 1998.[34] A 1994 Collector's Edition includes a commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell that is still included on more recent DVD releases of the film.[35]

DVD releases

_Escape from New York_ was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a high definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 Stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled _John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles_, and the 10-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.[36]

MGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had gone missing. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the Hutchinson, Kansas, salt-mine film depository. The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there."[37] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.[38]

Blu-ray release

On August 3, 2010, MGM Home Entertainment released _Escape From New York_ as a bare-bones Blu-ray.[39] Scream Factory, in association with Shout! Factory, released the film on a special edition Blu-ray on April 21, 2015.[40]

Novelization

In 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk — both disillusioned war veterans — deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world in which these characters exist, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.[41]

Comic books

Marvel Comics released the one-shot _The Adventures of Snake Plissken_ in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between _Escape from New York_ and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in _Escape from L.A._ Snake has robbed Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, "Why?" Snake just walks off, answering, "I don't need the competition".

In 2003, CrossGen published _John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles_, a four-part comic book miniseries.[42] The story takes place a day or so after the events of _Escape from New York_. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of _Escape from New York_ shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, _Captain Ron_). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.

In 2014, BOOM! Studios began publishing an _Escape From New York_ comic book by writer, Christopher Sebela.[43] The first issue of the series was released on December 3, 2014[44] and the story picks up moments after the end of the film.

BOOM! released a crossover comics miniseries between Snake and Jack Burton titled _Big Trouble in Little China / Escape from New York_ in October 2016.[45]

Board game

An _Escape from New York_ board game was released in 1981 by TSR, Inc.[46]

Anime

In 2003, Carpenter was planning an anime spin-off of _Escape from New York_, with _Outlaw Star_{{'}}s Mitsuru Hongo slated to direct.[47] Nothing came of those plans.


Sequel

A sequel, _Escape from L.A._, was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also acting as producer and co-writer.
