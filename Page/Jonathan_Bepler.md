JONATHAN BEPLER (born 1959) is an American composer of experimental music perhaps best known for his collaborative work with artists and choreographers, including 20 years of work with visual artist Matthew Barney. He is also multi-instrumentalist, singer, installation artist, and teacher.


Early life and education

Bepler was born in Media, Pennsylvania. He was self-taught in many instruments during his teen years. In 1993 he graduated from Bennington College in Vermont, where he studied composition with Louis Calabro, Joel Chadabe and Vivian Fine, singing with Frank Baker and Theodor Uppman as well as musical performance with Milford Graves, Bill Dixon und Min Tanaka. In the period of his studies he was involved in the production of Baroque opera such as Gluck's _Orfeo ed Euridice_. He served as both singer and director.


Career

From 1985 to 1996, Bepler served as a guitarist for the _Glenn Branca Ensemble_, touring with them through Europe, the United States and Asia. Starting in 1987, his first operas were composed. Since 1993, Bepler also dedicated himself to sound installations (_Source to Sound_) as well as to music for drama and ballet. He was the composer for The Cremaster Cycle, a series of films created in 1996 by Matthew Barney. In 1997, Bepler was a soloist at the world premiere of the opera _Der Venusmond_ by Burkhard Stangl at the Empire State Building. He also received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (1999).[1]

Starting in 2000, Bepler worked as a composer at the Berlin Schaub√ºhne am Lehniner Platz with Sasha Waltz and Lisa Densem. In 2003, together with John Jasperse he created the piece _California_ for the _Festival International de Danse a Cannes_. In 2006, the Ensemble Modern executed his piece _Fascia_ at the Schauspielhaus Frankfurt. The composer has collaborated again with Matthew Barney on the five-hour film _'River of Fundament_. This art film was produced in the years 2006 to 2014 and was presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music after its completion.[2]
