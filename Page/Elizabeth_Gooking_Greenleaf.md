ELIZABETH GOOKING GREENLEAF (November 11, 1681 â€“ November 11, 1762[1]) was the first female apothecary in the Thirteen Colonies.[2] She is considered to be the first female pharmacist in the United States.[3]


Biography

Elizabeth Gooking was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts Colony in 1681, the daughter of Samuel and Mary Gooking.[4] She married minister, physician, and apothecary Daniel Greenleaf (a Harvard graduate) in 1699.[5][6] The couple had twelve children.[7]

In 1727, Elizabeth moved to Boston to open an apothecary shop. Though this was a role which had been exclusively performed by men, Massachusetts did not have any laws in place to prevent women from practicing.[8] This made her the only woman among the 32 apothecaries working in New England at the time.[9]

Later in 1727, Daniel moved to Boston to join her after resigning his post as pastor of the Congregational Church in Yarmouth. They ran the shop together for several decades.[10]

Elizabeth Gooking Greenleaf died in 1762, followed by her husband in 1763.[11]

She was one of 17 women to be honored by the American Pharmacists Association in 2012, for "contributions to the profession and advancement of women in pharmacy."[12]
