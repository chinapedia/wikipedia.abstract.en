CHANDRA-RAJA II (r. c. 836-863 CE ) was an Indian king from the Shakambhari Chahamana dynasty. He ruled parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.

Chandra succeeded his father Govindaraja I (alias Guvaka I) on the Chahamana throne. The Bijolia inscription names Guvaka's successor as Shashi-nripa (IAST: Śaśinṛpa), which appears to be another name of Chandraraja II. Both the names - "Chandra-raja" and "Shashi-nripa" - literally mean "moon-king".

The _Prithviraja Vijaya_ eulogizes Chandra using vague terms, but little concrete information is available about his reign. He was succeeded by his son Govindaraja II (alias Guvaka II).
