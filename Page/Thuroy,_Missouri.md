THUROY is an unincorporated community in Ozark County, Missouri.[1] The village was located on a north flowing tributary to Barren Creek about 0.5 mile from the Missouri-Arkansas border and Missouri State Highway 101. Bakersfield is about four miles to the northeast. Barren Creek flows into Norfork Lake in Arkansas about four miles to the southwest.[2][3]


History

A post office called Thuroy was established in 1927, and remained in operation until 1936.[4] The community derives its name from Thursey Marshal, an early settler (a postal error accounts for the error in spelling, which was never corrected).[5]
