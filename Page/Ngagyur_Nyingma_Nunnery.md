In order to give equal opportunity to women in the study and practice of Dharma, Drubwang Padma Norbu Rinpoche established the nunnery in 1993, which is situated at a distance of one kilometer from Namdroling Monastery. There are 1397 nuns who have enrolled in this nunnery so far, of which more than 681 are currently resident. The older nuns engage themselves in the recitation and sadhanas of the Three Roots, as well as the Tsalung and Dzogchen practices. The younger nuns enter the Jr. High School at the nunnery and study the basic Tibetan grammars and basic Buddhist teachings, after which they enter the nuns' Institute.[1][2]
