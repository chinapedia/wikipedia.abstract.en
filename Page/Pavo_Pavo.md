History

Bagg and Hill met in a string quartet at Yale University.

Critical reception

_Young Narrator in the Breakers_ was met with generally positive reviews. Pitchfork gave it a 7.2, comparing Bagg to "a lovelorn alien reaching out from the farthest reaches of the galaxy,"[7] while AllMusic selected it as an Album Pick and wrote, "Pavo Pavo have achieved a collection that eschews the obvious, being undoubtedly hip yet simultaneous geeky in its references, and the resulting work is a real gem."[8]

In August 2016, _The Guardian_ featured Pavo Pavo in the "Band of the Week" column, describing in their music "an eerie washed-out playfulness, a wistful exuberance, that captures the sadness of a passing moment or era."

Economist and _The New York Times_ columnist Paul Krugman, is a noted fan of the band and has featured their music in his blog.[9]
