GEOFFREY NEVILL (1843 - 1885) was a malacologist and malacological author who worked in the Indian Museum in Kolkata. He was born in England and died in Switzerland. He was the younger brother of Hugh Nevill, the British civil servant who worked in Sri Lanka,[1] who also had a collection and who worked with Geoffrey on researching the mollusks of India. Some of Geoffrey's material is in the National Museum of Wales.[2]

The World Register of Marine Species lists 51 marine species named by Nevill, many of which were named together with his brother as "Nevill & Nevill" [3]
