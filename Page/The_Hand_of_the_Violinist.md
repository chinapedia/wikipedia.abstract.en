_THE HAND OF THE VIOLINIST (THE RHYTHMS OF THE BOW)_ is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist Giacomo Balla, depicting a musician's hand and the neck of a violin "made to look like it's vibrating through space"—blurred and duplicated to suggest the motion of frenetic playing.[1][2] The painting, representative of Futurism's first wave, exhibits techniques of Divisionism.[3]

Balla was inspired to use multiplication to imply motion by the photographic experiments of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey.[4] As with other Futurists, he was also inspired by Cubism's methods of capturing multiple perspectives; _The Hand of the Violinist_ has been said to bring the viewer "inside the reverberations of the instrument itself", and has earned comparison with Marcel Duchamp's _Nude Descending A Staircase_.[5]

From February to August 2014, the painting was part of the exhibit _Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe_, at the Guggenheim in New York.[6][7]
