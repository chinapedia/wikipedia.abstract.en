"RAIN" is a song by Australian-New Zealand rock group Dragon released in July 1983 as the first single ahead of their seventh studio album, _Body and the Beat_ (June 1984). It is co-written by the group's brothers, Marc and Todd Hunter with Johanna Pigott, Todd's then-domestic partner. "Rain" peaked at number 2 and stayed in the Kent Music Report singles chart for 26 weeks. The song reached number 88 on the United States _Billboard_ Hot 100 charts in mid-1984. For the original single version the group's Kerry Jacobson had provided drums and percussion; he left the group in September 1983 and was replaced by Terry Chambers, who is shown in promotional material including cover art and music videos.


Background

Dragon issued "Rain" in July 1983 almost a year after the group had reconvened in the previous August with the line-up of Marc and Todd Hunter, Robert Taylor, Paul Hewson and Kerry Jacobson.[1][2]

They undertook the Class Reunion tour in late 1982,[3] which was "ostensibly run to pay off outstanding debts, the tour proved so successful that the band re-formed on a permanent basis", according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane.[4] In October of that year they issued a single, "Ramona", which did not reach the top 50 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart.[5][6]

The group's bass guitarist, Todd, had started writing the instrumental portion of "Rain" at his home in Bondi when his domestic partner, Johanna Pigott, jokingly sang, "It's raining, it's pouring" from the children's nursery rhyme over the top of it.[7] This provided the lyrical focus for the work.[8] Pigott recalled, "[it] was written before Dragon even reformed. I didn't think it'd be a hit but Todd always thinks all his songs are hits."[9]

American producer, Alan Mansfield, who had worked with the group's lead singer, Marc, on his solo material was invited to work with Dragon.[10][11] At the first recording session, Jacobson, their drummer had a headache and took some over-the-counter medication. Together with Todd and Taylor, Jacobson, "laid down an aggressive bed to which overdubs could be added" on their third take.[12]

Mansfield told Jacobson to go home to recover while Todd, Marc and Pigott were asked to finish off the lyrics.[13] Meanwhile, Mansfield recorded Hewson's "low, menacing synthesiser parts."[14] The producer also provided his own keyboards, guitar and backing vocals. Upon hearing their work, after the first day's sessions, the Hunter brothers told Mansfield, "If this song doesn't make it to number one you'll have to join the band."[15]

"Rain" first charted in Australia on 15 August 1983, peaked at number 2 and stayed in the Kent Music Report singles chart for 26 weeks.[16][17] In September Jacobson injured his right index finger, he was temporarily replaced by Brent Eccles (on loan from The Angels) for two weeks of gigs in Sydney and Melbourne.[18] Jacobson left the group and was replaced by Terry Chambers (ex-XTC) on drums, soon after Mansfield joined the band on keyboards, guitar and vocals.[19][20]

Three music videos were filmed for the track – in the first, Marc's infant son appears below Hewson's keyboards.[21] For its United States release their label, PolyGram International, made a second version with the new band members, Chambers and Mansfield, appearing – the group disapproved of its "post-apocalyptic scenario" and a third one was commissioned.[22] This version also has Chambers and Mansfield as band members.[23] The song peaked at number 88 on the US _Billboard_ Hot 100 charts in mid-1984.[24][25]

The new line-up recorded a single, "Magic" (December 1983), which was also produced by Mansfield – it reached the top 40 in Australia.[26][27] Both singles were included on Dragon's seventh studio album, _Body and the Beat_ (June 1984), with Carey Taylor as producer for the new tracks.[28]
