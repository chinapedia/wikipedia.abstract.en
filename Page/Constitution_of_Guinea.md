GUINEA has had four CONSTITUTIONS.[1] The current constitution was approved by referendum on 19 April 2010 and formally adopted on 7 May.[2]


Background

A constitutional referendum was held on 28 September 1958 as part of a wider referendum across the French Union (and France itself) on whether to adopt the new French constitution; colonies voting to accept it would become part of the new French Community; if rejected, the territory would be granted independence.[3][4] More than 95% of voters of French Guinea voted against the constitution, with a turnout of 85.5%,[5] making it the only colony to vote no.[6]


History

Guinea became an independent nation on 2 October 1958. The first constitution was enacted immediately afterward[7] and was written in some haste.[8] A 15-person commission wrote a draft constitution in 10 days, which was approved by the new national assembly on 10 November 1958 after a mere two hours of debate.[9] However, during the dictatorial reign of the first president, Ahmed Sékou Touré, it was routinely ignored or altered.[10]

In 1982, bowing to both international and internal pressure, Guinea adopted a new constitution which included better protections for human rights.[11] After Touré's death in 1984, the government was toppled by a military coup d'état. Another constitutional referendum, held on 23 December 1990, was approved by 98.7% of the voters, paving the way for a third constitution.[12]

A 2001 referendum, which was boycotted by the opposition, amended this constitution, removing presidential term limits and lengthening the term from five years to seven.[13] Critics accused then-President Lansana Conté of seeking to remain in power longer.[14]

When Conté died in 2008, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara seized power in a coup d'état, but was shot in the head in December 2010.[15] He left the country to receive medical care and recuperate.[16] He later agreed not to come back, and Guinea returned to civilian rule.[17]

The current constitution was approved by referendum on 19 April 2010 and formally adopted on 7 May.[18]
