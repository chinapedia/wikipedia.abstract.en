Career

She worked as an art model, often for Abstract Expressionist painters, and at the age of 30 moved to Los Angeles, to try to start a movie career.[3]


Marriage

She first met the artist Man Ray in a Los Angeles nightclub:[4]

  After dinner we went to a night club where some of the best jazz of the period was being played. We danced. Juliet was like a feather in my arms.

In 1946, she married Man Ray, in a double wedding with their friends Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning. From 1951, they lived in a studio in Paris near the Luxembourg Gardens until his death in 1976 at the age of 86.[5]
