The term SOUPEUR is a word denoting several sexual practices whose main characteristic attraction to other male secretions.[1]


Definitions

First meaning: bread soaked in urine

This specific meaning refers to individuals who take pleasure in consuming food soaked in the urine of others,[2] in particular bread abandoned and later retrieved at public urinals.[3] This practice was popular in Paris and Marseille up until the 1960s and 1970s. There were numerous contemporary references in popular culture.

There existed a practical alternative where a public urinal is stopped in order to wait for it to fill. Then a person would enter it and submerge his penis into the urine of previous users. This was alternatively called dipping.

Second Definition: In brothels

The term alternatively describes the act of individuals visiting brothels to consume the semen left on the prostitutes by the customers. This act is also described as "do dinette."

In her autobiography One two two,[4] former prostitute Fabienne Jamet evokes this practice: "Back when I ruled the 122, I had a soupeur who could take thirty to forty loads at a time."

Sometimes prostitutes "fake" their performance by brushing their pubic hair with ersatz sperm made from a mixture of egg white, urine and a few drops of bleach.[5]
