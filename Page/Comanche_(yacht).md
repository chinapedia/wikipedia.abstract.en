Additionally, the _Comanche_ holds the Monohull Transatlantic sailing record for the fastest time of crossing the Atlantic Ocean, which they beat on the 28th of July, 2016. The current record is a time of 5 days, 14 hours, 21 minutes 25 second[4].

In December 2017, Comanche was sold to Australian Jim Cooney. [5]Comanche holds the fastest time for the Sydney to Hobart yacht race after winning the Sydney to Hobart 2017 in 1 day 9 hours 15 minutes 24 seconds.

Comanche was renamed to LDV Comanche when Jim Cooney purchased the yacht, due to a one-time sponsorship from SAIC Maxus Automotive Co's LDV brand. The yacht later returned to its original, unsponsored title of Comanche.
