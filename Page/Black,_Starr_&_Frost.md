History

Founded in 1810 by Isaac Marquand – a silversmith whose family immigrated from France – Black, Starr & Frost opened as Marquand & Co. in New York City, making it the oldest continuously operating jewelry firm in the United States. At that time, two store clerks – William Black and Henry Ball – eventually joined the firm, which became Black, Ball & Company. In 1912, the company – by then named Black, Starr & Frost – moved to New York City offices at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, known as the diamond district.

Black, Starr & Frost has had a number of notable clients, such as the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Guggenheims, Bunny Mellon, Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
