Biography

Count Mikhail Mikhailovich de Torby was the youngest child and only son of Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich and his morganatic wife Countess Sofia Nikolaevna Merenberg. The marriage was not only morganatic but also illegal under the Imperial house laws and caused a scandal at the Russian courtand he was forbidden to return to Russia for life, so the couple moved to England.

Mikhail was educated at Eton College. A gifted artist, his work is distinguished by "pleasant colors and free style." He had a special fondness for Chinese subjects and their works created mainly on rice paper in a thin Chinese-style. He was a collector of Chinese porcelain, which he often portrayed in his still lifes. He also served as a theater artist.

He took British citizenship in 1938, when he was forty years.

He died April 25, 1959 and did not leave offspring.
