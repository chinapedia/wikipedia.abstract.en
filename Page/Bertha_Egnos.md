Bertha_Egnos_South_African_musician.jpg BERTHA EGNOS (1 January 1913 – 2 July 2003) was a South African musician, director, and composer in musical theatre, best known as the co-creator and director of _Ipi Tombi_.


Early life

Bertha "BeBe" Egnos was born and raised in a Jewish family in a suburb of Johannesburg. She was always musical, and left school as a young teen to start playing piano in a performing group. Around 1934 she left South Africa to work for the BBC in London; she also studied jazz piano with Reginald Foresythe while she was in England, and made a few solo recordings.[1]


Career

Egnos returned to South Africa by 1936. During World War II, she started and led an all-woman Drum and Bugle Band. She also started writing and directing swing music revues, with titles including _Swing 1939_ and _Swing 1941_. After the war, she wrote musical comedies. Among her shows were _Bo-jungle_ (1959), _Dingaka_ (1961), _Eureka!_ (1968), and _Ipi-Tombi_ (1974, with her daughter Gail Lakier and 1988 “The New Generation” with nephew Geoffrey Egnos) based on an album they wrote called "The Warrior," featuring Margaret Singana.[2]

_Ipi-Tombi_ was a break-out global success, playing in London in 1975, and in New York in 1977, where it was picketed by anti-apartheid protesters;[3] at the peak of its popularity, there were multiple touring companies performing the show worldwide, with attendant claims of exploitation of the performers in the various casts.[4] Some of the songs from _Ipi-Tombi_ were first written for Eartha Kitt when she visited South Africa (Kitt declined to use them).[5].[6]Despite these criticisms, an updated version of the show continues to be performed, in South Africa and elsewhere, years after Egnos's death.[7]


Personal life

Bertha Egnos married Frank Lakier, a cinema owner in Sophiatown, in 1938. They had two daughters, Gail V. Lakier and Lucille Lakier Smith, a sports scientist. Egnos and Frank Lakier divorced. Egnos's second husband was Phil Godfrey. Bertha Egnos died in 2003, aged 90 years, in Johannesburg.[8]
