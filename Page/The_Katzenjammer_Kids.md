_THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS_ is an American comic strip created by Rudolph Dirks in 1897 and later drawn by Harold Knerr for 35 years (1914 to 1949).[1] It debuted December 12, 1897, in the _American Humorist_, the Sunday supplement of William Randolph Hearst's _New York Journal_. Dirks was the first cartoonist to regularly express comic characters' dialogue using speech balloons.[2] The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.

After a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization and began a new strip, first titled _HANS AND FRITZ_ and then _THE CAPTAIN AND THE KIDS_. It featured the same characters seen in _The Katzenjammer Kids_, which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when _The Captain and the Kids_ ended its six-decade run. _The Katzenjammer Kids_ published its last strip on January 1, 2006, but is still distributed in reprints by King Features Syndicate, making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication and the longest-running ever.[3]


History

Creation and early years

]] _The Katzenjammer Kids_ was inspired by _Max and Moritz_, a children's story of the 1860s by German author Wilhelm Busch.

_Katzenjammer_ translates literally as _the wailing of cats_ (i.e. "caterwaul") but is used to mean _contrition after a failed endeavor_ or _hangover_ in German (and, in the latter sense, in English too). Whereas Max & Moritz were grotesquely but comically put to death after seven destructive pranks, the Katzenjammer Kids and the other characters still thrive.

Dirks and Knerr

_The Katzenjammer Kids_ was so popular that it became two competing comic strips and the subject of a lawsuit. This happened because Dirks, in 1912, wanted to take a break after drawing the strip for 15 years, but the Hearst newspaper syndicate would not allow it. Dirks left anyway, and the strip was taken over by Harold Knerr. Dirks' last strip appeared March 16, 1913.[4] Dirks sued, and after a long legal battle, the Hearst papers were allowed to continue _The Katzenjammer Kids_, with Knerr as writer and artist. He took over permanently in the summer of 1914. However, Dirks was allowed to create an almost identical strip of his own for the rival Pulitzer newspapers,[5] although he had to use a different name for the strip.

Initially named _Hans und Fritz_ after the two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks' new feature was called _The Captain and the Kids_ from 1918 on. _The Captain and the Kids_ was very similar to _The Katzenjammer Kids_ in terms of content and characters, but Dirks had a looser and more verbal style than Knerr, who on the other hand often produced stronger, more direct gags and drawings. _The Captain and the Kids_ soon proved equal in popularity to _The Katzenjammer Kids_. It was later distributed by the United Feature Syndicate (while Hearst's King Features distributed _The Katzenjammer Kids_).[6]

1950s to the present

_The Captain and the Kids_ expanded as a daily strip during the 1930s, but it had only a short run. However, the Sunday strip remained popular for decades. From 1946, Dirks' son, John Dirks, gradually began doing more of the work on _The Captain and the Kids_. They introduced new characters and plots during the 1950s, including a 1958 science fiction storyline about a brilliant inventor and alien invasions. Even as John Dirks took over most of the work, Rudolph Dirks signed the strip until his death in 1968. John Dirks' drawing shifted slightly towards a more square-formed line, though it maintained the original style until _The Captain and the Kids_ ended its run in 1979.[7]

Knerr continued drawing _The Katzenjammer Kids_ until his death in 1949; the strip was then written and drawn by Charles H. "Doc" Winner (1949–56), with Joe Musial taking over in 1956. Musial was replaced on _The Katzenjammer Kids_ by Mike Senich (1976–81), Angelo DeCesare (1981–86), and Hy Eisman (1986–2006). Now syndicated in reprint form, the strip is distributed internationally to some 50 newspapers and magazines.[8] Eisman reused a lot of old gags and stories in later years.


Characters and story

_The Katzenjammer Kids_ (three brothers in the first strip but soon reduced to two) featured Hans and Fritz, twins who rebelled against authority, particularly in the form of their mother, Mama; der Captain, a shipwrecked sailor who acted as a surrogate father; and der Inspector, an official from the school system. Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain and his crew, and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting black jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island. Several of the characters spoke in stereotypical German-accented English.

The defining theme of the strip was Hans and Fritz pranking der Captain, der Inspector, Mama, or all three, for which the boys were often spanked, but sometimes shifted the blame to others. Other stories involved der Captain taking the Katzenjammers on treasure hunts or cargo voyages, sometimes aided by or competing with John Silver. Still other stories involved King Bongo enlisting the Katzenjammers to run errands or go on missions related to his kingdom; in both strips, by the mid-1930s, the family lived on Bongo's island—usually called Squee-Jee—and were readily at hand.

Knerr's version of _The Katzenjammer Kids_ introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year Twiddle's ex-pupil, "boy prodigy" Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.

_The Captain and the Kids_ also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and only talks in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of John Silver's.

Notable features of the later strips, at both syndicates, included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes bickered like friendly rivals rather than pranking each other outright. The King and his people, also in both strips, were now Polynesian rather than African.


In other media

_The Katzenjammer Kids_

The _Katzenjammer Kids_ characters initially appeared outside comics in a handful of live-action silent films, with the first released in 1898. This first film, titled _The Katzenjammer Kids In School_, was made for the Biograph Company by William George Bitzer. This film was followed in 1900 by another Bitzer-Biograph film, _The Katzenjammer Kids in Love._[9]

Between December 1916 and August 1918, a total of 37 _Katzenjammer Kids_ silent cartoon shorts were produced by William Randolph Hearst's own cartoon studio International Film Service, which adapted Hearst's well-known comic strips. The series was retired in 1918 at the height of the characters' popularity – partly because of the growing tension against titles with German associations after World War I. The comic strip was briefly renamed to _The Shenanigan Kids_ around this time, and in 1920 another five cartoons were produced under this title. All _Katzenjammer Kids_/_Shenanigan Kids_ cartoons from International Film Services were directed (and most likely also animated) by Gregory La Cava.

The Katzenjammer Kids also appeared (along with other King Features comic-strip stars) in Filmation's TV special _Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter_ (1972).

_The Captain and the Kids_

In 1938, _The Captain and the Kids_ became the subject of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's first self-produced series of theatrical short subject cartoons, directed by William Hanna, Bob Allen and Friz Freleng: _The Captain and the Kids_. Unlike the strip, which focused most of all on the gruesomely amusing antics of Hans and Fritz, the MGM cartoons often centered on the Captain. The series was overall unsuccessful, ending after one year and a total of 15 cartoons. Following that cancellation, Freleng returned to Warner Bros., where he had earlier been an animation director. The Captain was voiced by Billy Bletcher, Mama was voiced by Martha Wentworth, and John Silver was voiced by Mel Blanc.

_The Captain and the Kids_ version of the strip was also animated for television as a back-up segment on Filmation's _Archie's TV Funnies_ in 1971.


Cultural legacy

-   In July 2009 a street in Heide, Germany (where Dirks was born) was named after the cartoonist.[10]

_The Katzenjammer Kids_

-   _The Katzenjammer Kids_ are still very popular in the Scandinavian countries Denmark and Norway (where they are known as _Knoll og Tott_); in both countries, an annual comic book has been published almost every Christmas since 1911 (the only exceptions reportedly being the years 1913 and 1944). For the most part, Harold Knerr's version of the comic is used in these annual comic books. In Sweden, the annual Katzenjammer Kids comic book was also a tradition for many years, from 1928–1977.[11]
-   Art Clokey, the creator of Gumby, has claimed that _The Katzenjammer Kids_ inspired the creation of Gumby's nemeses, The Block-heads.[12]
-   _Playboy_ frequently featured in its late 1970s-early 1980s "Playboy Funnies" pages a spoof of _The Katzenjammer Kids_, called _The Krautzenbummer Kids_, with adult-style gags.
-   French dark cabaret band Katzenjammer Kabarett is thus named in a homage to the strip, as is the Norwegian symphonic pop/swing group _Katzenjammer_.
-   Deputy Barney Fife makes a reference to the Katzenjammer Kids in the third season of The Andy Griffith Show, in the episode titled “Andy and the New Mayor.”

_The Captain and the Kids_

-   _The Captain and the Kids_ has been published as an annual comic book in Norway since 1987. When no more reproducible material was available in 2001, Per Sanderhage, the editor of the Danish comic strip agency PIB, negotiated a deal where _Ferd'nand_ cartoonist Henrik Rehr would redraw 32 pages loosely based on old magazine clippings for the annual. In spite of the artistic/ethical questions this raises regarding the testament of Dirks' original work, the arrangement continues on to this day.
