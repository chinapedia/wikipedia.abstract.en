SHABAZZ FORD (born February 17, 1980), better known by his stage name FATT FATHER, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan.[1] He is a one fourth part of the Fat Killahz[2] (with Marv Won, Bang Belushi and King Gordy) and one half of Twin Towers[3][4] (with Marv Won).


Early life

Shabazz grew up in Detroit with his mother and two brothers, Sammie and Jerry. The oldest, Shabazz was forced at a young age to become the leading male role model he and his brothers never really had. Shabazz found himself with many different roles in the household. Roles that he wasn’t entirely comfortable playing at first. "I had to feel my way through life", he reflects. "But as you know, I grew up and I found my niche, which was music".

Studying at Denby High School, music became Shabazz’s salvation and escape from his problems at home. It was his way of venting. "It gave me an outlet", he said. "Because without that, I would have been out on the streets hustling, and doing what I needed to do in order to survive".[5]


Career

Fatt_Father.png June 2, 2016]] Fatt Father made his appearance on the Teamstaz debut album _Don't Cross The Line_ (2000, No Tyze Entertainment).[6]

Widely recognized as a core-member of the Detroit hip hop collective Fat Killahz (formed in 2001), Fatt Father has built a strong fan base via his work with the group, coupled with his own array of mixtapes and street projects ranging from the classic _Tales Of The Childless Father_ to _Father's Day_[7] on to the well-crafted _You Are The Father_ and _Fatherly Advice_; all of which garnered Fatt Father a lot of support and praise within the underground hip hop community.[8]

_Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?_, Fat Killahz debut album, paved the way for Fatt Father (along with his group) to share the stage with such hip hop royalty as Ice Cube, 50 Cent, Method Man & Redman as well as Detroit's own Royce Da 5'9", Nolan The Ninja, Danny Brown, Slum Village, D12 and Trick-Trick to name but a few.

His debut self-titled album, executive produced by himself alongside Trick-Trick, enabled Fatt Father to be recognized as a lyrical force even without his loyal comrades. Over the years Fatt Father has released soul touching music such as the unforgettable _My Kids Need A Coat_[9] which not only showcased his lyrical skill but also shined a light on his loyalty to his children. It was his sophomore album, _Fatherhood_, that solidified his figurative and literal place as a hip hop heavy-weight.

Fatt Father has also collaborated on records with lyrical all-stars such as Quelle Chris, Kuniva, Denmark Vessey, Guilty Simpson, Sean Price, Black Milk, Bishop Lamont, Roc Marciano, Ro Spit, Elzhi, and more.

Fatts stated Scarface, Notorious B.I.G., Royce Da 5'9", The Temptations and the Fat Killahz as his biggest influence.[10]


Personal life

Shabazz Ford is married and has two children.

In 2003, Shabazz’s younger brother Sam was killed at the age of 19, he died on their mother's birthday in 2003.[11]

He was a friend of now deceased rappers Chris Cobb and Proof.
