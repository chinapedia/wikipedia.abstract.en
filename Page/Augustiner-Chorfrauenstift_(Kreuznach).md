St._Peter_Kreuznach.jpg The AUGUSTINER-CHORFRAUENSTIFT was a Augustinian nunnery in what is now Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. It existed between 1140 and 1669. It was known in the Middle Ages as the _Monasterium_ or _coenobium S. Petri apud_ (or _prope_ or _iuxta_) _Crucenacum monialium ordinis S. Augustini_. In 1669 parts of it were converted into the Schloss Oranienhof, which was destroyed in 1689 and partly rebuilt early in the 19th century. From 1834/42 to 1929 the site was also occupied by the Hotel Oranienhof.

A late Gothic picture of grace (Pietà) of "Our Lady of Sorrow", for whose worship Pope Alexander VI had promised a 40-day indulgence in 1502, was located in the monastery church of St. Peter. The sculpture was taken by the nuns on their flight and was for a long time worshipped in St. Agnes in Mainz, then from 1802 until its destruction in 1942 in the parish church St. Quintin's Church, Mainz.[1]
