The 2017 CINCINNATI REDS SEASON was the 128th season for the franchise in Major League Baseball, and their 15th at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. The Reds opened the season with a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 3 at the Great American Ball Park[1] and finished the season on October 1 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The Reds were eliminated from postseason playoff consideration on September 14, 2017. They equaled their record from the previous season and finished last in their division for the third straight year and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year.


Offseason

On November 28, Reds claimed outfielder Gabby Guerrero from the Arizona Diamondbacks and catcher Juan Graterol from the Los Angeles Angels off waivers. Keyvius Sampson and Ramon Cabrera were designated for assignment to make room on the 40 man roster.[2][3] The latter two were later non-tendered, along with Guerrero, though he was later re-signed to a minor league deal.
