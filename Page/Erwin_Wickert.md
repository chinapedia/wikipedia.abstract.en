ERWIN WICKERT (7 January 1915 – 26 March 2008) was a German diplomat who, during the 1970s, served as the ambassador to Romania and China.[1]


Early life and education

Born in Bralitz and raised in Wittenberg, Wickert applied to join the _Sturmabteilung_ at the age of 18 before ultimately enrolling at the University of Berlin in 1934, where he studied philosophy. The following year, in 1935, he won a scholarship to Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and transferred there to complete his studies, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and political science in 1936.[2]

Wickert spent the year following graduation traveling the United States and Asia, before returning to Germany. During his travels, he worked odd jobs, including as a waiter in San Francisco and for a travel agency in New York City. In 1939 he completed a doctorate in philosophy at Heidelberg University.[3]

From 1947 Wickert worked as a freelance writer in Heidelberg. Upon the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955, Wickert resumed working for the foreign ministry, holding posts in Paris, London, and a domestic assignment in Bonn. From 1971 to 1976 he served as German ambassador to Romania and, from 1976 to 1980, as ambassador to the People's Republic of China.[6]

Wickert retired in 1980. Shortly after, he returned to Dickinson College for the first time since his graduation 44 years earlier and led a question-and-answer session at the college's Memorial Hall.[7]

During his life, Wickert wrote more than a dozen fiction and non-fiction books. In 1998 he edited the diaries of John Rabe.[8][9]
