The UNITED KINGDOM has had a significant film industry for over a century. While film production reached an all-time high in 1936,[1] the "golden age" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean,[2] Michael Powell, (with Emeric Pressburger)[3] and Carol Reed[4] produced their most critically acclaimed works. Many British actors have achieved worldwide fame and critical success, such as Maggie Smith, Roger Moore, Michael Caine,[5] Sean Connery,[6] Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet[7]. Some of the films with the largest ever box office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the third and fourth highest-grossing film franchises (_Harry Potter_ and _James Bond_).[8]

The identity of the British industry, particularly as it relates to Hollywood, has often been the subject of debate. Its history has often been affected by attempts to compete with the American industry. The career of the producer Alexander Korda was marked by this objective, the Rank Organisation attempted to do so in the 1940s, and Goldcrest in the 1980s. Numerous British-born directors, including Alfred Hitchcock and Ridley Scott,[9] and performers, such as Charlie Chaplin[10] and Cary Grant, have achieved success primarily through their work in the United States.

In 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom.[11] UK box-office takings totalled £1.1 billion in 2012,[12] with 172.5 million admissions.[13]

The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking what they consider to be the 100 greatest British films of all time, the BFI Top 100 British films.[14] The annual BAFTA awards hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts are considered to be the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.[15]


History

Origins and silent films

The first moving picture was shot in Leeds by Louis Le Prince in 1888[16][17] and the first moving pictures developed on celluloid film were made in Hyde Park, London in 1889 by British inventor William Friese Greene,[18] who patented the process in 1890.

, c. 1918]] The first people to build and run a working 35 mm camera in Britain were Robert W. Paul and Birt Acres. They made the first British film _Incident at Clovelly Cottage_ in February 1895, shortly before falling out over the camera's patent. Soon several British film companies had opened to meet the demand for new films, such as Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn.

Although the earliest British films were of everyday events, the early 20th century saw the appearance of narrative shorts, mainly comedies and melodramas. The early films were often melodramatic in tone, and there was a distinct preference for story lines already known to the audience, in particular, adaptations of Shakespeare plays and Dickens novels.

The Lumière brothers first brought their show to London in 1896. In 1898 American producer Charles Urban expanded the London-based Warwick Trading Company to produce British films, mostly documentary and news.

In 1898 Gaumont-British Picture Corp. was founded as a subsidiary of the French Gaumont Film Company, constructing Lime Grove Studios in West London in 1915 in the first building built in Britain solely for film production. Also in 1898 Hepworth Studios was founded in Lambeth, South London by Cecil Hepworth, the Bamforths began producing films in Yorkshire, and William Haggar began producing films in Wales.

In 1902 Ealing Studios was founded by Will Barker, becoming the oldest continuously-operating film studio in the world.

In 1902 the earliest colour film in the world was made; like other films made at the time, it is of everyday events. In 2012 it was found by the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford after lying forgotten in an old tin for 110 years. The previous title for earliest colour film, using Urban's inferior Kinemacolor process, was thought to date from 1909. The re-discovered films were made by pioneer Edward Raymond Turner from London who patented his process on 22 March 1899.[19]

In 1903 Urban formed the Charles Urban Trading Company, which produced early colour films using his patented Kinemacolor process. This was later challenged in court by Greene, causing the company to go out of business in 1915.

In 1903 Frank Mottershaw of Sheffield produced the film _A Daring Daylight Robbery_, which launched the chase genre.

In 1911 the Ideal Film Company was founded in Soho, London, distributing almost 400 films by 1934, and producing 80.

In 1913 stage director Maurice Elvey began directing British films, becoming Britain's most prolific film director, with almost 200 by 1957.

In 1914 Elstree Studios was founded, and acquired in 1928 by German-born Ludwig Blattner, who invented a magnetic steel tape recording system that was adopted by the BBC in 1930.

In 1920 Gaumont opened Islington Studios, where Alfred Hitchcock got his start, selling out to Gainsborough Pictures in 1927. Also in 1920 Cricklewood Studios was founded by Sir Oswald Stoll, becoming Britain's largest film studio, known for Fu Manchu and Sherlock Holmes film series.

In 1920 the short-lived company Minerva Films was founded in London by the actor Leslie Howard (also producer and director) and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel. Some of their early films include four written by A. A. Milne including _The Bump_, starring C. Aubrey Smith; _Twice Two_; _Five Pound Reward_; and _Bookworms_.[20]

By the mid-1920s the British film industry was losing out to heavy competition from the United States, which was helped by its much larger home market – in 1914 25% of films shown in the UK were British, but by 1926 this had fallen to 5%. The Slump of 1924 caused many British film studios to close, resulting in the passage of the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 to boost local production, requiring that cinemas show a certain percentage of British films. The act was technically a success, with audiences for British films becoming larger than the quota required, but it had the effect of creating a market for poor quality, low cost films, made to satisfy the quota. The "quota quickies", as they became known, are often blamed by historians for holding back the development of the industry. However, some British film makers, such as Michael Powell, learnt their craft making such films. The act was modified with the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 assisted the British film industry by specifying only films made by and shot in Great Britain would be included in the quota, an act that severely reduced Canadian and Australian film production.

Ironically, the biggest star of the silent era, English comedian Charlie Chaplin, was Hollywood-based.[21]

The early sound period

Scottish solicitor John Maxwell founded British International Pictures (BIP) in 1927. Based at the former British National Studios in Elstree, the facilities original owners, including producer-director Herbert Wilcox, had run into financial difficulties.[22] One of the company's early films, Alfred Hitchcock's _Blackmail_ (1929), is often regarded as the first British sound feature.[23][24] It was a part-talkie with a synchronized score and sound effects. Earlier in 1929, the first all-talking British feature, _The Clue of the New Pin_ was released. It was based on a novel by Edgar Wallace, starring Donald Calthrop, Benita Home and Fred Raines, which was made by British Lion at their Beaconsfield Studios. John Maxwell's BIP became the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933.[25] ABPC's studios in Elstree came to be known as the "porridge factory", according to Lou Alexander, "for reasons more likely to do with the quantity of films that the company turned out, than their quality".[26] Elstree (strictly speaking almost all the studios were in neighboring Borehamwood) became the center of the British film industry, with six film complexes over the years all in close proximity to each other.[27]

With the advent of sound films, many foreign actors were in less demand, with English received pronunciation commonly used; for example, the voice of Czech actress Anny Ondra in _Blackmail_ was substituted by an off-camera Joan Barry during Ondra's scenes.

Starting with John Grierson's _Drifters_ (also 1929), the period saw the emergence of the school of realist Documentary Film Movement, from 1933 associated with the GPO Film Unit. It was Grierson who coined the term "documentary" to describe a non-fiction film, and he produced the movement's most celebrated early films, _Night Mail_ (1936), written and directed by Basil Wright and Harry Watt, and incorporating the poem by W. H. Auden towards the end of the short.

Music halls also proved influential in comedy films of this period, and a number of popular personalities emerged, including George Formby, Gracie Fields, Jessie Matthews and Will Hay. These stars often made several films a year, and their productions remained important for morale purposes during World War II.

Many of the British films with larger budgets during the 1930s were produced by London Films, founded by Hungarian _emigre_ Alexander Korda. The success of _The Private Life of Henry VIII_ (1933), made at British and Dominion in Elstree, persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda's Denham Film Studios, which opened in May 1936, but both investors suffered losses as a result.[28] Korda's films before the war included _Things to Come_, _Rembrandt_ (both 1936) and _Knight Without Armour_ (1937), as well as the early Technicolour films _The Drum_ (1938) and _The Four Feathers_ (1939). These had followed closely on from _Wings of the Morning_ (1937), the UK's first three-strip Technicolour feature film, made by the local offshoot of 20th Century Fox. Although some of Korda's films indulged in "unrelenting pro-Empire flag waving", those featuring Sabu turned him into "a huge international star";[29] "for many years" he had the highest profile of any actor of Indian origin.[30] Paul Robeson was also cast in leading roles when "there were hardly any opportunities" for African Americans "to play challenging roles" in their own country's productions.[31]

Rising expenditure and over-optimistic expectations of expansion into the American market caused a financial crisis in 1937,[32] after an all-time high of 192 films were released in 1936. Of the 640 British production companies registered between 1925 and 1936, only 20 were still active in 1937. Moreover, the 1927 Films Act was up for renewal. The replacement Cinematograph Films Act 1938 provided incentives, via a "quality test", for UK companies to make fewer films, but of higher quality, and to eliminate the "quota quickies". Influenced by world politics, it encouraged American investment and imports. One result was the creation of MGM-British, an English subsidiary of the largest American studio, which produced four films before the war, including _Goodbye, Mr. Chips_ (1939).

The new venture was initially based at Denham Studios. Korda himself lost control of the facility in 1939 to the Rank Organisation, whose own Pinewood Studios had opened at the end of September 1936.[33] Circumstances forced Korda's _The Thief of Bagdad_ (1940), a spectacular fantasy film, to be completed in California, where Korda continued his film career during the war.

By now contracted to Gaumont British, Alfred Hitchcock had settled on the thriller genre by the mid-1930s with _The Man Who Knew Too Much_ (1934), _The 39 Steps_ (1935) and _The Lady Vanishes_ (1938). Lauded in Britain where he was dubbed "Alfred the Great" by _Picturegoer_ magazine, Hitchcock's reputation was beginning to develop overseas, with a _The New York Times_ feature writer asserting; "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world."[34] Hitchcock was then signed up to a seven-year contract by Selznick and moved to Hollywood.

Second World War

Humphrey Jennings began his career as a documentary film maker just before the war, in some cases working in collaboration with co-directors. _London Can Take It_ (with Harry Wat, 1940) detailed the blitz while _Listen to Britain_[35] (with Stewart McAllister, 1942) looked at the home front. The Crown Film Unit,[36] part of the Ministry of Information took over the responsibilities of the GPO Film Unit in 1940. Paul Rotha and Alberto Cavalcanti were colleagues of Jennings. British films began to make use of documentary techniques; Cavalcanti joined Ealing for _Went the Day Well?_ (1942),

Many other films helped to shape the popular image of the nation at war. Among the best known of these films are _In Which We Serve_ (1942), _We Dive at Dawn_ (1943), _Millions Like Us_ (1943) and _The Way Ahead_ (1944). The war years also saw the emergence of The Archers partnership between director Michael Powell and the Hungarian-born writer-producer Emeric Pressburger with films such as _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_ (1943) and _A Canterbury Tale_ (1944).

Two Cities Films, an independent production company releasing their films through a Rank subsidiary, also made some important films, including the Noël Coward and David Lean collaborations _This Happy Breed_ (1944) and _Blithe Spirit_ (1945) as well as Laurence Olivier's _Henry V_ (1944). By this time, Gainsborough Studios were releasing their series of critically derided but immensely popular period melodramas, including _The Man in Grey_ (1943) and _The Wicked Lady_ (1945). New stars, such as Margaret Lockwood and James Mason, emerged in the Gainsborough films.

Post-war cinema

as Sister Clodagh in _Black Narcissus_ (1947).]] Towards the end of the 1940s, the Rank Organisation, founded in 1937 by J. Arthur Rank, became the dominant force behind British film-making, having acquired a number of British studios and the Gaumont chain (in 1941) to add to its Odeon Cinemas. Rank's serious financial crisis in 1949, a substantial loss and debt, resulted in the contraction of its film production.[37] In practice, Rank maintained an industry duopoly with ABPC (later absorbed by EMI) for many years.

For the moment, the industry hit new heights of creativity in the immediate post-war years. Among the most significant films produced during this period were David Lean's _Brief Encounter_ (1945) and his Dickens adaptations _Great Expectations_ (1946) and _Oliver Twist_ (1948), Carol Reed's thrillers _Odd Man Out_ (1947) and _The Third Man_ (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's _A Matter of Life and Death_ (1946), _Black Narcissus_ (1947) and _The Red Shoes_ (1948), the most commercially successful film of its year in the United States. Laurence Olivier's _Hamlet_ (also 1948), was the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Ealing Studios (financially backed by Rank) began to produce their most celebrated comedies, with three of the best remembered films, _Whisky Galore_ (1948), _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ and _Passport to Pimlico_ (both 1949), being on release almost simultaneously. Their portmanteau horror film _Dead of Night_ (1945) is also particularly highly regarded.

Under the Import Duties Act 1932, HM Treasury levied a 75 per cent tariff on all film imports on 6 August 1947 which became known as Dalton Duty (after Hugh Dalton then the Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax came into effect on 8 August, applying to all imported films, of which the overwhelming majority came from the United States; American film studio revenues from the UK had been in excess of US$68 million in 1946. The following day, 9 August, the Motion Picture Association of America announced that no further films would be supplied to British cinemas until further notice. The Dalton Duty was ended on 3 May 1948 with the American studios again exported films to the UK though the Marshall Plan prohibited US film companies from taking foreign exchange out of the nations their films played in [38].

The Eady Levy, named after Sir Wilfred Eady was a tax on box office receipts in the United Kingdom in order to support the British Film industry. It was established in 1950 coming into effect in 1957. A direct governmental payment to British-based producers would have qualified as a subsidy under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and would have led to objections from American film producers. An indirect levy did not qualify as a subsidy, and so was a suitable way of providing additional funding for the UK film industry whilst avoiding criticism from abroad.

During the 1950s, the British industry began to concentrate on popular comedies and World War II dramas aimed more squarely at the domestic audience. The war films were often based on true stories and made in a similar low-key style to their wartime predecessors. They helped to make stars of actors like John Mills, Jack Hawkins and Kenneth More. Some of the most successful included _The Cruel Sea_ (1953), _The Dam Busters_ (1954), _The Colditz Story_ (1955) and _Reach for the Sky_ (1956).

The Rank Organisation produced some comedy successes, such as _Genevieve_ (1953). The writer/director/producer team of twin brothers John and Roy Boulting also produced a series of successful satires on British life and institutions, beginning with _Private's Progress_ (1956), and continuing with (among others) _Brothers in Law_ (1957), _Carlton-Browne of the F.O._ (1958), and _I'm All Right Jack_ (1959).

Popular comedy series included the "Doctor" series, beginning with _Doctor in the House_ (1954). The series originally starred Dirk Bogarde, probably the British industry's most popular star of the 1950s, though later films had Michael Craig and Leslie Phillips in leading roles. The Carry On series began in 1958 with regular instalments appearing for the next twenty years. The Italian director-producer Mario Zampi also made a number of successful black comedies, including _Laughter in Paradise_ (1951), _The Naked Truth_ (1957) and _Too Many Crooks_ (1958). Ealing Studios had continued its run of successful comedies, including _The Lavender Hill Mob_ (1951) and _The Ladykillers_ (1955), but the company ceased production in 1958, after the studios had already been bought by the BBC.

in _Dracula_ (1958).]] Less restrictive censorship towards the end of the 1950s encouraged B-film producer Hammer Films to embark on their series of commercially successful horror films. Beginning with adaptations of Nigel Kneale's BBC science fiction serials _The Quatermass Experiment_ (1955) and _Quatermass II_ (1957), Hammer quickly graduated to _The Curse of Frankenstein_ (1957) and _Dracula_ (1958), both deceptively lavish and the first gothic horror films in colour. The studio turned out numerous sequels and variants, with English actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee being the most regular leads. _Peeping Tom_ (1960), a now highly regarded thriller, with horror elements, set in the contemporary period, was badly received by the critics at the time, and effectively finished the career of Michael Powell, its director.

Social realism

(centre) who was active in the Free Cinema and the 'British New Wave']] The British New Wave film makers attempted to produce social realist films (see also 'kitchen sink realism') attempted in commercial feature films released between around 1959 and 1963 to convey narratives about a wider spectrum of people in Britain than the country's earlier films had done. These individuals, principally Karel Reisz, Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson, were also involved in the short lived Oxford film journal _Sequence_ and the "Free Cinema" documentary film movement. The 1956 statement of Free Cinema, the name was coined by Anderson, asserted: "No film can be too personal. The image speaks. Sounds amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude." Anderson, in particular, was dismissive of the commercial film industry. Their documentary films included Anderson's _Every Day Except Christmas_, among several sponsored by Ford of Britain, and Richardson's _Momma Don't Allow_. Another member of this group, John Schlesinger, made documentaries for the BBC's _Monitor_ arts series.

Together with future James Bond co-producer Harry Saltzman, dramatist John Osborne and Tony Richardson established the company Woodfall Films to produce their early feature films. These included adaptations of Richardson's stage productions of Osborne's _Look Back in Anger_ (1959), with Richard Burton, and _The Entertainer_ (1960) with Laurence Olivier, both from Osborne's own screenplays. Such films as Reisz's _Saturday Night and Sunday Morning_ (also 1960), Richardson's _A Taste of Honey_ (1961), Schlesinger's _A Kind of Loving_ (1962) and _Billy Liar_ (1963), and Anderson's _This Sporting Life_ (1963) are often associated with a new openness about working-class life or previously taboo issues.

The team of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph, from an earlier generation, "probe[d] into the social issues that now confronted social stability and the establishment of the promised peacetime consensus".[39] _Pool of London_ (1950).[40] and _Sapphire_ (1959) were early attempts to create narratives about racial tensions and an emerging multi-cultural Britain.[41] Dearden and Relph's _Victim_ (1961), was about the blackmail of homosexuals. Influenced by the Wolfenden report of four years earlier, which advocated the decriminalising of homosexual sexual activity, this was "the first British film to deal explicitly with homosexuality".[42] Unlike the New Wave film makers though, critical responses to Dearden's and Relph's work have not generally been positive.[43][44]

The 1960s

in _Lawrence of Arabia_ (1962)]] As the 1960s progressed, American studios returned to financially supporting British films, especially those that capitalised on the "swinging London" image propagated by _Time_ magazine in 1966. Films like _Darling_, _The Knack ...and How to Get It_ (both 1965), _Alfie_ and _Georgy Girl_ (both 1966), all explored this phenomenon. _Blowup_ (also 1966), and later _Women in Love_ (1969), showed female and then male full-frontal nudity on screen in mainstream British films for the first time.

At the same time, film producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli combined sex with exotic locations, casual violence and self-referential humour in the phenomenally successful James Bond series with Sean Connery in the leading role. The first film _Dr. No_ (1962) was a sleeper hit in the UK and the second, _From Russia with Love_ (1963), a hit worldwide. By the time of the third film, _Goldfinger_ (1964), the series had become a global phenomenon, reaching its commercial peak with _Thunderball_ the following year. The series' success led to a spy film boom with many Bond imitations. Bond co-producer Saltzman also instigated a rival series of more realistic spy films based on the novels of Len Deighton. Michael Caine starred as bespectacled spy Harry Palmer in _The Ipcress File_ (1965), and two sequels in the next few years. Other more downbeat espionage films were adapted from John le Carré novels, such as _The Spy Who Came in from the Cold_ (1965) and _The Deadly Affair_ (1966). '' (1963) was designed by Ken Adam]] American directors were regularly working in London throughout the decade, but several became permanent residents in the UK. Blacklisted in America, Joseph Losey had a significant influence on British cinema in the 1960s, particularly with his collaborations with playwright Harold Pinter and leading man Dirk Bogarde, including _The Servant_ (1963) and _Accident_ (1967). Voluntary exiles Richard Lester and Stanley Kubrick were also active in the UK. Lester had major hits with The Beatles film _A Hard Day's Night_ (1964) and _The Knack ...and How to Get It_ (1965) while Kubrick's _Dr. Strangelove_ (1963) and _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968). While Kubrick settled in Hertfordshire in the early 1960s and would remain in England for the rest of his career, these two films retained a strong American influence. Other films of this era involved prominent filmmakers from elsewhere in Europe, _Repulsion_ (1965) and _Blowup_ (1966) were the first English language films of the Polish director Roman Polanski and the Italian Michelangelo Antonioni respectively.

Historical films as diverse as _Lawrence of Arabia_ (1962), _Tom Jones_ (1963), and _A Man for All Seasons_ (1966) benefited from the investment of American studios. Major films like _Becket_ (1964), _Khartoum_ (1966) and _The Charge of the Light Brigade_ (1968) were regularly mounted, while smaller-scale films, including _Accident_ (1967), were big critical successes. Four of the decade's Academy Award winners for best picture were British productions, including six Oscars for the film musical _Oliver!_ (1968), based on the Charles Dickens novel _Oliver Twist_.

After directing several contributions to the BBC's _Wednesday Play_ anthology series, Ken Loach began his feature film career with the social realist _Poor Cow_ (1967) and _Kes_ (1969). Meanwhile, the controversy around Peter Watkins _The War Game_ (1965), which won the Best Documentary Film Oscar in 1967, but had been suppressed by the BBC who had commissioned it, would ultimately lead Watkins to work exclusively outside Britain.

1970 to 1980

in 1971.]] American studios cut back on British productions, and in many cases withdrew from financing them altogether. Films financed by American interests were still being made, including Billy Wilder's _The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes_ (1970), but for a time funds became hard to come by.

More relaxed censorship also brought several controversial films, including Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell's _Performance_, Ken Russell's _The Devils_ (1971), Sam Peckinpah's _Straw Dogs_ (1971), and Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_ (1971) starring Malcolm McDowell as the leader of a gang of thugs in a dystopian future Britain.[45]

Other films during the early 1970s included the Edwardian drama _The Go-Between_ (1971), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Nicolas Roeg's Venice-set supernatural thriller _Don't Look Now_ (1973) and Mike Hodges' gangster drama _Get Carter_ (1971) starring Michael Caine. Alfred Hitchcock returned to Britain to shoot _Frenzy_ (1972), Other productions such as Richard Attenborough's _Young Winston_ (1972) and _A Bridge Too Far_ (1977) met with mixed commercial success. The British horror film cycle associated with Hammer Film Productions, Amicus and Tigon drew to a close, despite attempts by Hammer to spice up the formula with added nudity and gore. Although some attempts were made to broaden the range of British horror films, such as with _The Wicker Man_ (1973), these films made little impact at the box office, In 1976, British Lion, who produced _The Wicker Man_, were finally absorbed into the film division of EMI, who had taken over ABPC in 1969. The duopoly in British cinema exhibition, via Rank and now EMI, continued.

(pictured in 1986) starred as Hercule Poirot in _Death on the Nile_ (1978)]] Some British producers, including Hammer, turned to television for inspiration, and big screen versions of popular sitcoms like _On the Buses_ (1971) and _Steptoe and Son_ (1972) proved successful with domestic audiences, the former had greater domestic box office returns in its year than the Bond film, _Diamonds Are Forever_ and in 1973, an established British actor Roger Moore was cast as Bond in ,_Live and Let Die_, it was a commercial success and Moore would continue the role for the next 12 years.Low-budget British sex comedies included the _Confessions of ..._ series starring Robin Askwith, beginning with _Confessions of a Window Cleaner_ (1974). More elevated comedy films came from the Monty Python team, also from television. Their two most successful films were _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ (1975) and _Monty Python's Life of Brian_ (1979), the latter a major commercial success, probably at least in part due to the controversy at the time surrounding its subject.

Some American productions did return to the major British studios in 1977–79, including the original _Star Wars_ (1977) at Elstree Studios, _Superman_ (1978) at Pinewood, and _Alien_ (1979) at Shepperton. Successful adaptations were made in the decade of the Agatha Christie novels _Murder on the Orient Express_ (1974) and _Death on the Nile_ (1978). The entry of Lew Grade's company ITC into film production in the latter half of the decade brought only a few box office successes and an unsustainable number of failures

1980 to 1990

in 1983.]] In 1980, only 31 British films were made,[46] a 50% decline from the previous year and the lowest number since 1914, and production fell again in 1981 to 24 films.[47] The industry suffered further blows from falling cinema attendances, which reached a record low in 1984, and the elimination of the 1957 Eady Levy, a tax concession, in the same year. The concession had made it possible for an overseas based film company to write off a large amount of its production costs by filming in the UK – this was what attracted a succession of big-budget American productions to British studios in the 1970s. These factors led to significant changes in the industry, with the profitability of British films now "increasingly reliant on secondary markets such as video and television, and Channel 4 ... [became] a crucial part of the funding equation."[48] The 1980s soon saw a renewed optimism, led by smaller independent production companies such as Goldcrest, HandMade Films and Merchant Ivory Productions. in 1985]] Handmade Films, which was partly owned by George Harrison, was originally formed to take over the production of _Monty Python's Life of Brian_, after EMI's Bernard Delfont (Lew Grade's brother) had pulled out. Handmade also bought and released the gangster drama _The Long Good Friday_ (1980), produced by a Lew Grade subsidiary, after its original backers became cautious. Members of the Python team were involved in other comedies during the decade, including Terry Gilliam's fantasy films _Time Bandits_ (1981) and _Brazil_ (1985), and John Cleese's hit _A Fish Called Wanda_ (1988), while Michael Palin starred in _A Private Function_ (1984), from Alan Bennett's first screenplay for the cinema screen.[49]

Goldcrest producer David Puttnam has been described as "the nearest thing to a mogul that British cinema has had in the last quarter of the 20th century."[50] Under Puttnam, a generation of British directors emerged making popular films with international distribution. Some of the talent backed by Puttnam — Hugh Hudson, Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, and Adrian Lyne — had shot commercials; Puttnam himself had begun his career in the advertising industry. When Hudson's _Chariots of Fire_ (1981) won 4 Academy Awards in 1982, including Best Picture, its writer Colin Welland declared "the British are coming!".[51] When _Gandhi_ (1982), another Goldcrest film, picked up a Best Picture Oscar, it looked as if he was right.

It prompted a cycle of period films – some with a large budget for a British film, such as David Lean's final film _A Passage to India_ (1984), alongside the lower-budget Merchant Ivory adaptations of the works of E. M. Forster, such as _A Room with a View_ (1986). But further attempts to make 'big' productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after _Revolution_ (1985) and _Absolute Beginners_ (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, Roland Joffé's _The Mission_ (also 1986), won the 1986 Palme d'Or, but did not go into profit either. Joffé's earlier _The Killing Fields_ (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joffé's first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam.

Mainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. Horace Ové's _Pressure_ (1975) had been funded by the British Film Institute as was _A Private Enterprise_ (1974), these being the first Black British and Asian British films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as Franco Rosso's _Babylon_ (1980), Menelik Shabazz's _Burning an Illusion_ (1981) and Po-Chih Leong's _Ping Pong_ (1986; one of the first films about Britain's Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed Channel 4, which had an official remit to provide for "minority audiences." Commercial success was first achieved with _My Beautiful Laundrette_ (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from Hanif Kureishi's first film script. _My Beautiful Laundrette_ features Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth and Rupert Everett, were dubbed the Brit Pack.[52]

With the involvement of Channel 4 in film production, talents from television moved into feature films with Stephen Frears (_My Beautiful Laundrette_) and Mike Newell with _Dance with a Stranger_ (1985). John Boorman, who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make _Hope and Glory_ (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute's Production Board, which backed three of Britain's most critically acclaimed filmmakers: Derek Jarman (_The Last of England_, 1987), Terence Davies (_Distant Voices, Still Lives_, 1988), and Peter Greenaway; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with _The Draughtsman's Contract_ (1982) and _The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover_ (1989). Stephen Woolley's company Palace Pictures also produced some successful films, including Neil Jordan's _The Company of Wolves_ (1984) and _Mona Lisa_ (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were Bill Forsyth's _Gregory's Girl_ (1981) and _Local Hero_ (1983), Lewis Gilbert's _Educating Rita_ (1983), Peter Yates' _The Dresser_ (1983) and Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut, _Henry V_ (1989).

1990 to 2000

at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival]]

Compared to the 1980s, investment in film production rose dramatically. In 1989, annual investment was a meagre £104 million. By 1996, this figure had soared to £741 million.[53] Nevertheless, the dependence on finance from television broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 meant that budgets were often low and indigenous production was very fragmented: the film industry mostly relied on Hollywood inward investment. According to critic Neil Watson, it was hoped that the £90 million apportioned by the new National Lottery into three franchises (The Film Consortium, Pathe Pictures, and DNA) would fill the gap, but "corporate and equity finance for the UK film production industry continues to be thin on the ground and most production companies operating in the sector remain hopelessly under-capitalised."[54]

These problems were mostly compensated by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a film studio whose British subsidiary Working Title Films released a Richard Curtis-scripted comedy _Four Weddings and a Funeral_ (1994). It grossed $244 million worldwide and introduced Hugh Grant to global fame, led to renewed interest and investment in British films, and set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including _Sliding Doors_ (1998) and _Notting Hill_ (1999). Other Working Titles films included _Bean_ (1997), _Elizabeth_ (1998) and _Captain Corelli's Mandolin_ (2001). PFE was eventually sold and merged with Universal Pictures in 1999, the hopes and expectations of "building a British-based company which could compete with Hollywood in its home market [had] eventually collapsed."[55]

Tax incentives allowed American producers to increasingly invest in UK-based film production throughout the 1990s, including films such as _Interview with the Vampire_ (1994), _Mission: Impossible_ (1996), _Saving Private Ryan_ (1998), _Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace_ (1999) and _The Mummy_ (1999). Miramax also distributed Neil Jordan's acclaimed thriller _The Crying Game_ (1992), which was generally ignored on its initial release in the UK, but was a considerable success in the United States. The same company also enjoyed some success releasing the BBC period drama _Enchanted April_ (1992) and _The Wings of the Dove_ (1997).

Among the more successful British films were the Merchant Ivory productions _Howards End_ (1992) and _The Remains of the Day_ (1993), Richard Attenborough's _Shadowlands_ (1993), and Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations. _The Madness of King George_ (1994) proved there was still a market for British costume dramas, and other period films followed, including _Sense and Sensibility_ (1995), _Restoration_ (1995), _Emma_ (1996), _Mrs. Brown_ (1997), _Basil_ (1998), _Shakespeare in Love_ (1998) and _Topsy-Turvy_ (1999).

After a six-year hiatus for legal reasons the James Bond films returned to production with the 17th Bond film, _GoldenEye_. With their traditional home Pinewood Studios fully booked, a new studio was created for the film in a former Rolls-Royce aero-engine factory at Leavesden in Hertfordshire.[56]

Mike Leigh emerged as a significant figure in British cinema in the 1990s, with a series of films financed by Channel 4 about working and middle class life in modern England, including _Life Is Sweet_ (1991), _Naked_ (1993) and his biggest hit _Secrets & Lies_ (1996), which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

Other new talents to emerge during the decade included the writer-director-producer team of John Hodge, Danny Boyle and Andrew Macdonald responsible for _Shallow Grave_ (1994) and _Trainspotting_ (1996). The latter film generated interested in other "regional" productions, including the Scottish films _Small Faces_ (1996), _Ratcatcher_ (1999) and _My Name Is Joe_ (1998).

2000 to 2010

, who produced all eight installments of the _Harry Potter_ film series]]

The first decade of the 21st century was a relatively successful one for the British film industry. Many British films found a wide international audience due to funding from BBC Films, Film 4 and the UK Film Council, and some independent production companies, such as Working Title, secured financing and distribution deals with major American studios. Working Title scored three major international successes, all starring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, with the romantic comedies _Bridget Jones's Diary_ (2001), which grossed $254 million worldwide; the sequel _Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason_, which earned $228 million; and Richard Curtis's directorial debut _Love Actually_ (2003), which grossed $239 million. Most successful of all, Phyllida Lloyd's _Mamma Mia!_ (2008), which grossed $601 million.

The new decade saw a major new film series in the Harry Potter films, beginning with _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ in 2001. David Heyman's company Heyday Films has produced seven sequels, with the final title released in two parts – _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1_ in 2010 and _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2_ in 2011. All were filmed at Leavesden Studios in England.[57]

Aardman Animations' Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit and the Creature Comforts series, produced his first feature-length film, _Chicken Run_ in 2000. Co-directed with Peter Lord, the film was a major success worldwide and one of the most successful British films of its year. Park's follow up, _Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_ was another worldwide hit: it grossed $56 million at the US box office and £32 million in the UK. It also won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

at the 68th Venice International Film Festival]]

However it was usually through domestically funded features throughout the decade that British directors and films won awards at the top international film festivals. In 2003, Michael Winterbottom won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for _In This World_. In 2004, Mike Leigh directed _Vera Drake_, an account of a housewife who leads a double life as an abortionist in 1950s London. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2006 Stephen Frears directed _The Queen_ based on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana, which won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and Academy Awards and the BAFTA for Best Film. In 2006, Ken Loach won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival with his account of the struggle for Irish Independence in _The Wind That Shakes the Barley_. Joe Wright's adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel _Atonement_ was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. _Slumdog Millionaire_ was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director (Danny Boyle), producer (Christian Colson), screenwriter (Simon Beaufoy) and star (Dev Patel)—the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador. It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film. _The King's Speech_, which tells the story of King George VI's attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by Tom Hooper and filmed almost entirely in London. It received four Academy Awards (including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay) in 2011.

The start of the 21st century saw Asian British cinema assert itself at the box office, starting with _East Is East_ (1999) and continuing with _Bend It Like Beckham_ (2002). Other notable British Asian films from this period include _My Son the Fanatic_ (1997), _Ae Fond Kiss... (2004)_, _Mischief Night (2006)_, _Yasmin_ (2004) and _Four Lions_ (2010). Some argue it has brought more flexible attitudes towards casting Black and Asian British actors, with Robbie Gee and Naomie Harris take leading roles in _Underworld_ and _28 Days Later_ respectively. The year 2005 saw the emergence of The British Urban Film Festival, a timely addition to the film festival calendar, which recognised the influence of _Kidulthood_ on UK audiences and consequently began to showcase a growing profile of films in a genre previously not otherwise regularly seen in the capital's cinemas. Then in 2005 _Kidulthood_, a film centring on inner-city London youth had a limited release. This was successfully followed up with a sequel _Adulthood_ (2008) that was written and directed by actor Noel Clarke. Several other films dealing with inner city issues and Black Britons were released in the 2000s such as _Bullet Boy_ (2004), _Life and Lyrics_ (2006) and _Rollin' with the Nines_ (2009).

Like the 1960s, this decade saw plenty of British films directed by imported talent. The American Woody Allen shot _Match Point_ (2005)[58][59] and three later films in London. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón helmed _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ (2004) and _Children of Men_ (2006); New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion made _Bright Star_ (2009), a film set in 19th century London; Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made _Bronson_ (2008), a biopic about the English criminal Michael Gordon Peterson; the Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directed _28 Weeks Later_ (2007), a sequel to a British horror film; and two John le Carré adaptations were also directed by foreigners—_The Constant Gardener_ by the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles and _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ by the Swedish Tomas Alfredson. The decade also saw English actor Daniel Craig became the new James Bond with _Casino Royale_, the 21st entry in the official Eon Productions series.

Despite increasing competition from film studios in Australia and Eastern Europe, British studios such as Pinewood, Shepperton and Leavesden remained successful in hosting major productions, including _Finding Neverland_, _Closer_, _Batman Begins_, _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, _United 93_, _The Phantom of the Opera_, _Sweeney Todd_, _Fantastic Mr. Fox_, _Robin Hood_, _X-Men: First Class_, _Hugo_ and _War Horse_.

In November 2010, Warner Bros. completed the acquisition of Leavesden Film Studios, becoming the first Hollywood studio since the 1940s to have a permanent base in the UK, and announced plans to invest £100 million in the site.[60][61]

A study by the British Film Institute published in December 2013 found that of the 613 tracked British films released between 2003 and 2010 only 7% made a profit. Films with low budgets, those that cost below £500,000 to produce, were even less likely to gain a return on outlay. Of these films, only 3.1% went into the black. At the top end of budgets for the British industry, under a fifth of films that cost £10million went into profit.[62]

2010 to present

, who has starred in major Hollywood films and smaller independent productions]]

On 26 July 2010 it was announced that the UK Film Council, which was the main body responsible for the development of promotion of British cinema during the 2000s, would be abolished, with many of the abolished body's functions being taken over by the British Film Institute. Actors and professionals, including James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Pete Postlethwaite, Damian Lewis, Timothy Spall, Daniel Barber and Ian Holm, campaigned against the Council's abolition.[63][64] The move also led American actor and director Clint Eastwood (who had filmed _Hereafter_ in London) to write to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in August 2010 to protest the decision to close the Council. Eastwood warned Osborne that the closure could result in fewer foreign production companies choosing to work in the UK.[65][66] A grass-roots online campaign was launched[67] and a petition established by supporters of the Council.

Countering this, a few professionals, including Michael Winner and Julian Fellowes, supported the Government's decision.[68][69][70] A number of other organisations responded positively.

At the closure of the UK Film Council on 31 March 2011, _The Guardian_ reported that "The UKFC's entire annual budget was a reported £3m, while the cost of closing it down and restructuring is estimated to have been almost four times that amount."[71] One of the UKFC's last films, _The King's Speech_, is estimated to have cost $15m to make and grossed $235m, besides winning several Academy Awards. UKFC invested $1.6m for a 34% share of net profits, a valuable stake that will pass to the British Film Institute.[72]

In April 2011, The Peel Group acquired a controlling 71% interest in The Pinewood Studios Group (the owner of Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios) for £96 million.[73][74] In June 2012, Warner opened the re-developed Leavesden studio for business.[75] The most commercially successful British directors in recent years are Paul Greengrass, Mike Newell, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott and David Yates.[76]

in 2007. He is one of the top 20 highest-grossing actors in North America, as of 2019.[77]]]

In January 2012, at Pinewood Studios to visit film-related businesses, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that his government had bold ambitions for the film industry: "Our role, and that of the BFI, should be to support the sector in becoming even more dynamic and entrepreneurial, helping UK producers to make commercially successful pictures that rival the quality and impact of the best international productions. Just as the British Film Commission has played a crucial role in attracting the biggest and best international studios to produce their films here, so we must incentivise UK producers to chase new markets both here and overseas."[78]

The film industry remains an important earner for the British economy. According to a UK Film Council press release of 20 January 2011, £1.115 billion was spent on UK film production during 2010. A 2014 survey suggested that British-made films were generally more highly rated than Hollywood productions, especially when considering low-budget UK productions.


Art cinema

cinema]] Although it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the British Film Institute's foundation of a production board in 1964—and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards—enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of Bill Douglas's Trilogy _My Childhood_ (1972), and of Terence Davies' Trilogy _Childhood_ (1978), via Peter Greenaway's earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of _The Draughtsman's Contract_ (1982)) and Derek Jarman's championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI's new scheme was Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's _Winstanley_ (1975), while others included _Moon Over the Alley_ (1975), _Requiem for a Village_ (1975), the openly avant-garde _Central Bazaar_ (1973), _Pressure_ (1975) and _A Private Enterprise_ (1974) -- the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features.

The release of Derek Jarman's _Jubilee_ (1978) marked the beginning of a successful period of UK art cinema, continuing into the 1980s with filmmakers like Sally Potter. Unlike the previous generation of British film makers who had broken into directing and production after careers in the theatre or on television, the Art Cinema Directors were mostly the products of Art Schools. Many of these filmmakers were championed in their early career by the London Film Makers Cooperative and their work was the subject of detailed theoretical analysis in the journal _Screen Education_. Peter Greenaway was an early pioneer of the use of computer generated imagery blended with filmed footage and was also one of the first directors to film entirely on high definition video for a cinema release.

With the launch of Channel 4 and its Film on Four commissioning strand, Art Cinema was promoted to a wider audience. However the Channel had a sharp change in its commissioning policy in the early 1990s and Greenaway and others were forced to seek European co-production financing.


Film technology

.]] In the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as _Superman_ (1978), _Alien_ (1979), and _Batman_ (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for Gerry Anderson. Thanks to the Bristol-based Aardman Animations, the UK is still recognised as a world leader in the use of stop-motion animation.

British special effects technicians and production designers are known for creating visual effects at a far lower cost than their counterparts in the US, as seen in _Time Bandits_ (1981) and _Brazil_ (1985). This reputation has continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century with films such as the James Bond series, _Gladiator_ (2000) and the Harry Potter franchise.

From the 1990s to the present day, there has been a progressive movement from traditional film opticals to an integrated digital film environment, with special effects, cutting, colour grading, and other post-production tasks all sharing the same all-digital infrastructure. The London-based visual effects company Framestore, with Tim Webber the visual effects supervisor, have worked on some of the most technically and artistically challenging projects, including, _The Dark Knight_ (2008) and _Gravity_ (2013), with new techniques involved in _Gravity_ realized by Webber and the Framestore team taking three years to complete.[79]

The availability of high-speed Internet Protocol networks has made the British film industry capable of working closely with U.S. studios as part of globally distributed productions. As of 2005, this trend is expected to continue with moves towards (currently experimental) digital distribution and projection as mainstream technologies. The British film _This is Not a Love Song_ (2003) was the first to be streamed live on the Internet at the same time as its cinema premiere.
