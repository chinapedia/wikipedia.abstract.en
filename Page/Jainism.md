JAINISM (),[1] traditionally known as _JAIN DHARMA_ is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called "Jains", a word derived from the Sanskrit word _jina_ (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths by destroying the karma through an ethical and spiritual life.[2] Jainism is a transtheistic religion,[3] and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as _tirthankaras_, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, as Matsya the twenty-third being Parshvanatha in 900 BCE, and twenty-fourth being the Mahāvīra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal _dharma_ with the _tirthankaras_ guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology.

The main religious premises of Jainism are _ahiṃsā_ (non-violence), _anekāntavāda_ (many-sidedness), _aparigraha_ (non-attachment) and _asceticism_. Devout Jains take five main vows: _ahiṃsā_ (non-violence), _satya_ (truth), _asteya_ (not stealing), _brahmacharya_ (celibacy or chastity or sexual continence), and _aparigraha_ (non-attachment). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. _Parasparopagraho Jīvānām_ (the function of souls is to help one another) is the motto of Jainism. _Ṇamōkāra mantra_ is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.

Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. Jain mendicants are found in all Jain sub-traditions except Kanji Panth sub-tradition, with laypersons (_śrāvakas_) supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.

Jainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in India. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in Canada, Europe, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Suriname, Fiji, and the United States. Major Jain festivals include Paryushana and Daslakshana, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, and Dipawali.


Main principles

Non-violence (_ahimsa_)

The principle of _ahimsa_ (non-violence or non-injury) is a fundamental tenet of Jainism. It believes that one must abandon all violent activity and without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless. In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".

Jain texts such as _Acaranga Sūtra_ and _Tattvarthasūtra_ state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable. Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly. Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought. It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, "all living creatures must help each other". Violence negatively affects and destroys one's soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.

The idea of reverence for non-violence (_ahiṃsā_) is founded in Hindu and Buddhist canonical texts, and it may have origins in more ancient Brahmanical Vedic thoughts.[4][5] However, no other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism.

The theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to "be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures", but resulting from "continual self-discipline", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development which ultimately affects one's salvation and release from rebirths. Causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one's rebirth, future well being and suffering.[6]

Late medieval Jain scholars re-examined the _Ahiṃsā_ doctrine when one is faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns. According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadatta Suri wrote during a time of Muslim destruction of temples and persecution that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance". However, such examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.

Many-sided reality (_anekāntavāda_)

The second main principle of Jainism is _anekāntavāda_ or _anekantatva_, a word derived from _anekānta_ ("not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness" or "manifoldness") and _vada_ ("doctrine", "way").[7]

The _anekāntavāda_ doctrine states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is _Naya_, explained as "partial expression of the truth". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahāvīra, language returns and not the other way round.[8] One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is _syāt_, or valid "in some respect" but it remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".[9] In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced. Since reality is many-sided, the great error, according to Jainism, is belief in _ekānta_ (one-sidedness) where some relative truth is treated as an absolute truth and the complete reality, to the exclusion of others.[10]

The _anekāntavāda_ premise of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the _Samaññaphala Sutta_. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (_syāt_). These texts identify _anekāntavāda_ doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mahāvīra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is", and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality. _Syādvāda_ (predication logic) and _nayavāda_ (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of _anekāntavāda_. _Syādvāda_ recommends the expression of _anekānta_ by prefixing the epithet _syād_ to every phrase or expression describing the "permanent being". There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as _jiva_ (soul) and _ajiva_ (matter) within a dualistic _anekāntavāda_ framework.

According to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the _anekāntavāda_ doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahāvīra's teachings. The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahāvīra is a doctrine about the nature of absolute reality and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine. However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right". The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps" or "that is just one perspective" about them. Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism had a disagreement of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.

Non-attachment (_aparigraha_)

The third main principle in Jainism is _aparigraha_ which means non-attachment to worldly possessions. For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity. According to Natubhai Shah, _aparigraha_ applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one's personality.

Jainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence. According to the _aparigraha_ principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments. The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the Śvētāmbara tradition.

In addition, Jain texts mention that "attachment to possessions" (_parigraha_) is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (_ābhyantara parigraha_), and attachment to external possessions (_bāhya parigraha_). For internal possessions, Jainism identifies four key passions of the mind (_kashaya_): anger, pride (ego), deceitfulness, and greed. In addition to the four passions of the mind, the remaining ten internal passions are: wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, neuter sex-passion), and the six defects (laughter, like, dislike, sorrow, fear, disgust).

Jain ethics and five vows

Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called _anuvratas_ (small vows) for Jain laypersons, and _mahavratas_ (great vows) for Jain mendicants. For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a _guru_ (teacher, counsellor), _deva_ (Jina, god), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits. Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:

1.  _Ahiṃsā_, "intentional non-violence" or "noninjury": The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals). This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one's actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one's speech and thoughts.[11]
2.  _Satya_, "truth": This vow is to always speak the truth. Neither lie, nor speak what is not true, and do not encourage others or approve anyone who speaks an untruth.[12]
3.  _Asteya_, "not stealing": A Jain layperson should not take anything that is not willingly given. Additionally, a Jain mendicant should ask for permission to take it if something is being given.
4.  _Brahmacharya_, "celibacy": Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one's partner.[13]
5.  _Aparigraha_, "non-possessiveness": This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed. Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.


Practices

Asceticism

Of all the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest austerity-driven ascetic tradition, and it is an essential part of a mendicant's spiritual pursuits. Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance, and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching _siddha_ and _moksha_ (liberation from rebirths", and "salvation).

Jain texts like _Tattvartha Sūtra_ and _Uttaradhyayana Sūtra_ discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft-repeated in later Jain texts. According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation). Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.

Lists of internal and external austerities in Jainism varies with the text and tradition. Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and a means to purify the _jiva_ (soul). The _tirthankaras_ of Jainism, such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example of leading an ascetic life by performing severe austerities for twelve years.[14]

Food and fasting

The practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being vegetarian. Devout Jains practice lacto-vegetarianism, meaning that they eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. Veganism is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare. Jain monks and nuns do not eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being.

Jains fast on different occasions throughout the year, particularly during festivals. This practice is called _upavasa_, _tapasya_ or _vrata_. According to Singh, this takes on various forms and may be practised based on one's ability. Some examples include Digambara fasting for _Dasa-laksana-parvan_ where a Jain layperson eats only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last day of the festival. With these practices the layperson mimics the practices of a Jain mendicant during the festival. A similar practice is found among Śvētāmbara Jains on eight day _paryusana_ with _samvatsari-pratikramana_.

The fasting practice is believed to remove karma from one's soul and allow one to gain merit (_punya_). A "one day" fast in Jain tradition lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after the sunrise the day after. Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, where it is believed that this shows her piety, religious purity, gains her and her family prestige, leads to merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for her family. Some religious fasts are observed as a group where Jain women bond socially and support each other. Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.

Meditation

Jainism considers meditation (_dhyana_) a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions. Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.

According to Padmanabh Jaini, _Sāmāyika_ is a practice of "brief periods in meditation" in Jainism that is a part of _siksavrata_ (ritual restraint). The goal of _Sāmāyika_ is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second _siksavrata_. The _samayika_ ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as _Puja_ in a Jain temple and doing charity work. According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, _samayika_ connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of "assuming temporary ascetic status".

The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his _Pravacanasara_ states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on "I, the pure self". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as "I am this, this is mine" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and "I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge" is on the right road to meditating on the "soul, the pure self".

Rituals and worship

Shravanbelgola_Gomateshvara_feet_prayer1.jpg]]

There are many rituals in Jainism's various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is "heavily imbued with ascetic values", where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of Tirthankaras, or mendicants, or progressively get closer to psychologically and physically living ever more like an ascetic. The ultimate ritual is _sallekhana_, a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks. The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the details differ from Śvētāmbaras, and according to Dundas, the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to the liturgy found among Hindu traditions. The overlap in Jain and Hindu rituals is largely in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, according to Padmanabh Jaini, and likely one that developed over time because Jains and Hindus societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular ceremonies.

Jains do not believe in a creator god, but do ritually worship numerous deities. The Jinas are prominent and a large focus of this ritualism, but they are not the only _deva_ in Jainism. A Jina as _deva_ is not an avatar (incarnation) in Jainism, but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic _tirthankara_ achieved. Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jain devotional worship is predominantly addressed to four: Mahāvīra, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and Rishabhanatha. Among the non-_tirthankara_ saints, devotional worship is common for Bahubali among the Digambaras. Some of Jaina rituals remember the five life events of the _tirthankaras_, called the _Panch Kalyanaka_, are rituals such as the _Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava_, _Panch Kalyanaka Puja_ and _Snatrapuja_.

A_Jain_ritual_offerings_and_puja_recital_at_a_temple,_worship_in_Jainism.jpg The basic worship ritual practised by Jains is _darsana_ (seeing) of _deva_, which includes Jina, or other yaksas, gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (Sarasvati, Lakshmi, others). The Terapanthi sub-tradition of Digambaras do not worship many of the deities popular among mainstream Digambaras, and they limit their ritual worship to Tirthankaras. The worship ritual is called the _devapuja_, is found in all Jaina sub traditions, which share common features. Typically, the Jaina layperson enters the temple inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet, with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the namaskara, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.

Jain practices include performing _abhisheka_ (ceremonial bath) of the images. Some Jain sects employ a _pujari_ (also called _upadhye_) for rituals, who may be a non-Jain (a Hindu), to perform special rituals and other priestly duties at the temple. More elaborate worship includes ritual offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.

The traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of mantras and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual.[15] The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the "five homage" (_panca namaskara_) mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first ford-maker's time. The medieval era Jain worship practices, according to Ellen Gough, also developed tantric diagrams of the _Rishi-mandala_ where the _tirthankaras_ are portrayed.[16] The Tantric traditions within Jainism use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.

Festivals

Das_Lakshana_(Paryusana)_celebrations,_New_York_City_Jain_temple_2.JPG (Paryusana), Jain Center of America, New York City]] Jains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the _comasu_ (Sanskrit: _chaturmasa_) period of the calendar. It is the four month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The _comasu_ period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances.

The most important annual Jain festival is called the _Paryushana_ by Svetambaras and _Dasa lakshana parva_ by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of waning moon in the traditional luni-solar month of Bhadrapada in the Indian calendar. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar. It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras. It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time. Svetambaras recite the _Kalpasūtras_, while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing slaughter of animals.

The last day involves a focused prayer/meditation session known as _Samvatsari_. Jains consider this as a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends. Forgiveness is asked by saying "_Micchami Dukkadam_" or "_Khamat Khamna_" to others. This means, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness." The literal meaning of _Paryushana_ is "abiding" or "coming together".

Mahavir Jayanti celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the luni-solar month of Chaitra in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in Bihar, north of Patna, special events are held by Jains.

Dipawali is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra's attainment of _moksha_. The Hindu festival of Diwali is also celebrated on the same date (_Kartika Amavasya_). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and _diyas_ (small oil lamps). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, _Nirvan Ladoo_ is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali. Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are Akshaya Tritiya and Raksha Bandhan, similar to those in the Hindu communities.

Monasticism

Jainism monastic organization is a part of Jain society called _sangh_. A _sangh_ has a four-fold order, or _caturvidh, sakal sangh_. This consists of _sadhu_ (male ascetics, _muni_), _sadhvi_ (female ascetics, _aryika_), _śrāvaka_ (laymen), and _śrāvikā_ (laywoman). The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called _gacch_ or _samuday_, in autonomous regional Jain congregations.

Digambar tradition has two main monastic orders Mula Sangh and the Kashtha Sangh, both led by Bhattarakas. Other notable monastic orders include the Digambara Terapanth which emerged in the 17th century.[17] Śvētāmbaras have their own _sanghs_, but unlike Digambaras which have had predominantly _sadhu sanghs_ (male monastic organizations), they have major _sadhu_ and _sadhvi_ _sanghs_ (monks and nuns).

According to Śvētāmbara Jain texts, from _Kalpasūtras_ onwards, its monastic community has had more _sadhvis_ than _sadhus_ (female than male mendicants). In _Tapa Gacch_ of the modern era, the ratio of _sadhvis_ to _sadhus_ (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1. In contrast to Śvētāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male. In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul's liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism. The Śvētāmbaras disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from _Saṃsāra_ through ascetic practices.

The Jain monastic organization shares many parallels with those found in Buddhist and Brahmanical-Hindu monasticism. They all have similar rules, hierarchical structure, practices such as not traveling during the four-month monsoon season and celibacy. According to William Johnston, this is not likely from mutual borrowing of ideas, but because these traditions emerged from the same ancient Indian monastic traditions that preceded the Buddha and the Mahāvīra. There are some differences. For example, the Jain and Hindu monastic community has been traditionally more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a _sangha_ (monastery) and staying in its premises. Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha's distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls. In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required no clothes (Digambara) or white clothes (Śvētāmbara) and they have disagreed on the legitimacy of the wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl by Jain monks.[18] The Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as monastic equipment such as the _Dandasan_ – a long stick with woollen threads – to gently remove ants and insects that may come in their path.

Supplementary vows and _Sallekhana_

_Doddahundi nishidhi inscription_, depicting the vow of _sallekhana_, 14th century, Karnataka|thumb Jainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows which include three _guņa vratas_ (merit vows) and four _śikşā vratas_.

The _Sallekhana_ (or _Santhara_) vow is a "religious death" ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age. In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one's life by choice and with dispassion, In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul's future rebirths.


Traditions and sects

Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras

The Jain community is divided into two major denominations, Digambara and Śvētāmbara. Monks of the Digambara (sky-clad) tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white sarees and are referred to as _Aryikas_. Śvētāmbara (white-clad) monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.

During Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Jain tradition states that _Acharya_ Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. Sthulabhadra, a pupil of _Acharya_ Bhadrabahu, stayed in Magadha. Later, when followers of _Acharya_ Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked. This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes. Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of _aparigraha_ which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the 5th-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara have ever since rejected. This council solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism. The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit _Suttapahuda_ of Kundakunda.

Other than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:

-   Śvētāmbaras trace their practices and dress code to the teachings of Parshvanatha, the 23rd _tirthankara_, which they believe taught only Four restraints (a claim, scholars say are confirmed by the ancient Buddhist texts that discuss Jaina monastic life). Mahāvīra taught Five vows, which Digambara follow. The Digambara sect disagrees with the Śvētāmbara interpretations, and reject the theory of difference in Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra's teachings.
-   Digambaras believe that both Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra remained unmarried, whereas Śvētāmbara believe the 23rd and 24th did indeed marry. According to the Śvētāmbara version, Parshva married Prabhavati, and Mahāvīra married Yashoda who bore him a daughter named Priyadarshana. The two sects also differ on the origin of Trishala, Mahāvīra's mother, as well as the details of Tirthankara's biographies such as how many auspicious dreams their mothers had when they were in the wombs.
-   Digambara believe Rishabha, Vasupujya and Neminatha were the three _tirthankaras_ who reached omniscience while in sitting posture and other _tirthankaras_ were in standing ascetic posture. In contrast, Śvētāmbaras believe it was Rishabha, Nemi and Mahāvīra who were the three in sitting posture.
-   Digambara monasticism rules are more rigid.
-   Digambara iconography are plain, Śvētāmbara icons are decorated and colored to be more lifelike.

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the Kushan Empire (c.1st century CE). _Tirthankara_ represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the _Ardhaphalaka_ (half-clothed) mentioned in texts. The Yapaniyas, believed to have originated from the _Ardhaphalaka_, followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs.

Other sub-traditions

Both of the major Jain traditions evolved into sub-traditions over time. For example, the devotional worship traditions of Śvētāmbara are referred to as _Murti-pujakas_, those who live in and around Jain temples became _Deravasi_ or _Mandira-margi_. Those who avoid temples and pursue their spirituality at a designated monastic meeting place came to be known as _Sthānakavāsī_.[19] About the 18th century, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara traditions saw an emergence of separate Terapanthi movements.[20] Some scholars such as Malvaniya state that these ideas entered Jainism from an influence of Islam, while others such as Dundas state that these ideas, debates and movements can be traced in more ancient texts than the start of Islam.

In the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jaina religious movements that are a "primarily devotional form of Jainism" have developed which resemble "Jain Mahayana" style devotionalism.

Gender and spiritual liberation

A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. In the Digambara traditional belief, women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation. However, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Śvētāmbara sect that believes that women too can achieve spiritual liberation from rebirths in _Saṃsāra_. The _Śvētāmbaras_ state the 19th _Tirthankara_ Māllīnātha was female. However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.


Beliefs and philosophy

_Dravya_ (Substance)

Dravya.jpeg The _dravya_ in Jainism are fundamental entities, called _astikaya_ (literally, 'collection that exists'). They are believed to be eternal, and the ontological building blocks that constitute and explain all existence, whether perceived or not.

According to the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism, there are five eternal substances in existence: Soul (_jiva_), Matter (_pudgala_), Space (_akasha_), motion (_Dharma_) and rest (_Adharma_).[21] To this list of five, the Digambara Jain tradition adds "Time" (_kala_) as the sixth eternal substance.[22] In both traditions, the substance of space is conceptualized as "world space" (_lokakasha_) and "non-world space" (_alokiakasha_). Further, both soul and matter are considered as active ontological substances, while the rest are inactive.[23] Another categorization found in Jain philosophy is _jiva_ and _ajiva_, the latter being all _dravya_ that is not _jiva_.

_Jīva_ (Soul), _Ajīva_ (Non-Soul)

_Jiva_ means "soul" in Jainism, and is also called _jivatman_. It is a core concept and the fundamental focus of the Jain theology. The soul is believed to be eternal, and a substance that undergoes constant modifications, in every life, after every rebirth of a living being. _Jiva_ consists of pure consciousness in the Jain thought, has innate "free will" that causes it to act but is believed to be intangible and formless. It is the soul that experiences existence and gains knowledge, not mind nor body both believed to a heap of matter. Jain philosophy further believes that the soul is the mechanism of rebirth, and karma accumulation. It is the same size in all living beings, such as a human being, a tiny insect and a large elephant. _Jiva_ is everywhere, filling and infused in every minuscule part of the entire _loka_ (realm of existence), according to Jainism. The soul has the potential to reach omniscience and eternal bliss, and end the cycles of rebirth and associated suffering, which is the goal of Jain spirituality.

The _jiva_ is believed to rely on other _dravya_ to function. The Jain philosophy completely separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness).[24] Souls reside in bodies and journey endlessly through _saṃsāra_ (that is, realms of existence through cycles of rebirths and redeaths). _Jivas_ are believed to be of two types: stationary and mobile. Illustration of the former are plants, while moving _jivas_ include examples such as human beings, animals, gods, hell beings and insects. _Jivas_ are further classified in Jain philosophy by an assigned number of senses which range from one to five sensory organs. Inert world such as air, fire or clod of dirt, considered non-sensate in contemporary science, are asserted in historic texts of Jainism to be living and with sensory powers.[25]

_Ajiva_ consists of everything other than _jiva_. Life processes such as breath, means of knowledge such as language, all emotional and biological experiences such as pleasure and pain are all believed in Jainism to be made of _pudgala_ (matter). These interact with _tattva_ or reality to create, bind, destroy or unbind karma particles to the soul.

According to Dundas, _Dharma_ as a metaphysical substance in Jain philosophy may be understood as "that which carries" instead of the literal sense of ordinary physical motion. Thus, _dharma_ includes all verbal and mental activity that contributes to karma and purification of the soul.

_Tattva_ (Reality)

Tattva.jpg of Jain philosophy]] _Tattva_ connotes "Reality, Truth" in Jain philosophy, and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven _tattvas_, while Śvētāmbaras believe in nine _tattvas_:

-   The sentient (_jiva_, soul)
-   The insentient (_ajiva_)
-   The karmic influx (_Āsrava_) to the soul
-   Good karma (_punya_, merits), found in the _tattva_ theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
-   Bad karma (_papa_, negatives), found in the _tattva_ theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
-   The bondage (_Bandha_) of karmic particles to the soul, thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths
-   The stoppage (_Saṃvara_) of karmic influx
-   The dissociation and wiping away of past karmic particles (_Nirjarā_) from the soul
-   The liberation (_Moksha_)

The true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as "faith in the _tattvas_". The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach _moksha_ for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons and ascetics it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.

Soul and Karma

According to Jainism, the existence of "a bound and ever changing soul" is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven. There are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (_Guṇa_): consciousness (_caitanya_, the most important), bliss (_sukha_) and vibrational energy (_virya_). The vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul.

Karma, like in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the _jiva_ in the _lokas_. Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology. Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths. Karma is thus an efficient cause (_nimitta_) in Jain philosophy, but not the material cause (_upadana_). The soul is believed to be the material cause.

_Tirthankara-nama-karma_ is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a _tirthankara_.

Jiva.jpg Jain texts state that souls exist as "clothed with material bodies", where it entirely fills up the body. There are five types of bodies in the Jaina thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing).

Jain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (_ayus_), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many. Every living being has one to five senses, three _balas_ (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration. All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts. Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, are also provided in the Jain texts.[26] All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions.

Saṃsāra

Gati_or_existences.jpgs are reborn in various realms of existence depending on their karmas, according to Jainism.]] The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (_jiva_) is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions. It is not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism. The Jaina theosophy, unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through _Saṃsāra_. As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives. With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through _Saṃsāra_. Some evolve to a higher state; some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma. Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist _Abhavya_ (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain _moksha_ (liberation). The _Abhavya_ state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act. Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to _Advaita_-style (not two) nondualism of Hinduism, or _Advaya_-style nondualism of Buddhism. A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond _Saṃsāra_, is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a _Siddha_.

Cosmology

Jain_universe.JPG

Jain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal _lokas_ (realms of existence). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, Jain cosmology believes both time and the universe are eternal without beginning and end, and that the universe is transient (impermanent in attributes) at the same time. The universe, body, matter and time are considered in Jain philosophy as separate from the soul (_jiva_ or _jivatman_). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth.

Jain_Cosmic_Time_Cycle.jpg According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively _urdhva loka_, _madhya loka_, and _adho loka_. As with the realms of existences, _Kāla_ (time) is without beginning and eternal; the cosmic wheel of time, called _kālachakra_, rotates ceaselessly. According to Jain texts, in this part of the universe, there are six periods of time within two aeons (_ara_), and in the first aeon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates. Thus, the worldly cycle of time is divided into two parts or half-cycles, _utsarpiṇī_ (ascending) and _avasarpiṇī_ (descending). _Utsarpiṇī_ is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while _avasarpiṇī_ is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. According to Jain cosmology, it is currently the fifth _ara_ of _avasarpiṇī_ (half time cycle of degeneration). The present age is one of sorrow and misery, of religious decline, where the height and shape of living beings shrink. Jain thought holds that after the sixth _ara_, the universe will be reawakened in the new cycle and the start of _utsarpiṇī_ _aras_.

According to Jain texts, sixty-three illustrious beings, called _śalākāpuruṣas_, are born on this earth in every _Dukhama-sukhamā_ _ara_. The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons. They comprise twenty-four _Tīrthaṅkaras_, twelve _chakravartins_, nine _balabhadra_, nine _narayana_, and nine _pratinarayana_.

A _chakravartī_ is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm. Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. Jain _puranas_ give a list of twelve _chakravartins_ (universal monarchs). They are golden in complexion. One of the _chakravartins_ mentioned in Jain scriptures is Bharata Chakravartin. Jain texts like _Harivamsa Purana_ and Hindu Texts like _Vishnu Purana_ state that Indian subcontinent came to be known as _Bharata varsha_ in his memory.

There are nine sets of _balabhadra_, _narayana_, and _pratinarayana_. The _balabhadra_ and _narayana_ are brothers. _Balabhadra_ are nonviolent heroes, _narayana_ are violent heroes, and _pratinarayana_ the villains. According to the legends, the _narayana_ ultimately kill the _pratinarayana_. Of the nine _balabhadra_, eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. On death, the _narayana_ go to hell because of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.

Jain cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts (_avasarpiṇī_ and _utsarpiṇī_). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four _tīrthaṅkaras_ are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era. The word _tīrthankara_ signifies the founder of a _tirtha_, which means a fordable passage across a sea. The _tīrthaṅkaras_ show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Rishabhanatha is said to be the first _tīrthankara_ of the present half-cycle (_avasarpiṇī_). Mahāvīra (6th century BC) is revered as the twenty fourth _tīrthankara_ of _avasarpiṇī_. Jain texts state that Jainism has always existed and will always exist.

In Jainism, perfect souls _with_ the body are called _arihant_ (victors) and perfect souls _without_ the body are called _Siddhas_ (liberated souls).

God

Jain_24-Tirthankaras.jpg, ]] According to Jainism, the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, does not require a creator nor any superior power to govern it, nor a judge nor destroyer. In this belief, it is distinct from the monotheistic Abrahamic religions; it is similar to Buddhism. It shares premises with the non-theistic part of the spectrum of diverse beliefs found in different traditions within Hindu philosophy and distinct from theistic Hindu traditions.

Jain texts reject the idea of a creator, ruler or destroyer god and postulate an eternal universe. However, Jainism believes in the world of gods and hell beings who are born, and who die to be reborn like living beings in the earthly realm of existence. Those souls who live in the body of a god do so because of their positive karma. They have a metamorphic body, that is they are believed in Jain thought to be able to change their body at will. The gods live a life of happiness, fun and frolic, whose wishes are automatically fulfilled. They also possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms. However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, the souls leave the "god body" and are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings.

Epistemology

Jain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (_pramana_). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (_pratyaksa_), inference (_anumana_) and testimony (_sabda_ or the word of scriptures).[27][28] These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as _Tattvarthasūtra_, _Parvacanasara_, _Nandi_ and _Anuyogadvarini_.[29] Some Jain texts add analogy (_upamana_) as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to epistemological theories found in other Indian religions.

In Jainism, _jnāna_ (knowledge) is said to be of five kinds – _Kevala Jnana_ (Omniscience), _Śrutu Jñāna_ (Scriptural Knowledge), _Mati Jñāna_ (Sensory Knowledge), _Avadhi Jñāna_ (Clairvoyance), and _Manah prayāya Jñāna_ (Telepathy). According to the Jain text _Tattvartha sūtra_, the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.

Salvation, liberation

MahaveeJi.jpg (top) of a Jain temple represents _Ratnatraya_ (three jewels)]]

According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels:

1.  _Samyak darśana_ (Correct View) Faith in basic tenets of Jainism, acceptance of the self-evident truth of soul (_jīva_)
2.  _Samyak jnana_ (Correct Knowledge) Knowledge of the _tattvas_ without any doubt or misapprehension
3.  _Samyak charitra_ (Correct Conduct) behavior consistent with the Five vows

Jain texts often add _samyak tap_ (Correct Asceticism) as the fourth jewel, thereby emphasizing their belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation (moksha). The four jewels of orthodox Jain ideology are called _moksha marg_. According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (_Siddha_) goes up to the summit of universe (_Siddhashila_) and dwells there in eternal bliss.


Scriptures and texts

Suryaprajnapati_Sutra.jpg Jain_Agamas.jpeg Pravachanasara4.png text along with English Translation]] Tattvarthsutra.jpg text along with English Translation]]

Jain scriptures are called _Agamas_. They are believed to have been verbally transmitted by the oral tradition from one generation to the next, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts. The Jain tradition believes that their religion is eternal, and the teachings of their first _Tirthankara Rishabhanatha_ were their scriptures millions of years ago. The mythology states that the _tirthankara_ taught in a divine preaching hall called _samavasarana_, which were heard by the gods, the ascetics and laypersons. The discourse delivered is called _Śhrut Jnāna_ and comprises eleven _angas_ and fourteen _purvas_. The discourse is remembered and transmitted by the _Ganadharas_ (chief disciples), and is composed of twelve _angas_ (departments). It is symbolically represented by a tree with twelve branches.

According to the Jain tradition, an _araha_ (worthy one) speaks meaning that is then converted into _sūtra_ (_sutta_) by his disciples, and from such _sūtras_ emerge the doctrine. The creation and transmission of the _Agama_ is the work of disciples in Jainism. These texts, historically for Jains, have represented the truths uttered by their _tirthankaras_, particularly the Mahāvīra. In every cycle of Jain cosmology, twenty-four _tirthankaras_ appear and so do the Jain scriptures for that _ara_. The spoken scriptural language is believed to be _Ardhamagadhi_ by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains. These then become coded into _duvala samgagani pidaga_ (twelve limbed baskets by disciples), but transmitted orally. In the 980th year after Mahāvīra's death (~5th century CE), the texts were written down for the first time by the Council of Valabhi.

The Śvētāmbaras believe that they have the original Jain scriptures. The Śvētāmbara belief is denied by the Digambaras, who instead believe the scriptures were lost. The Śvētāmbaras state that their collection of 45 works represent a continuous tradition, though they accept that their collection is also incomplete because of a lost Anga text and four lost Purva texts. The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that Āchārya Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara _Āchāryas_ recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four _anuyoga_. According to von Glasenapp, the Digambara texts partially agree with the enumerations and works of older Śvētāmbara texts, but in many cases there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions.

The Śvētāmbara consider their 45 text collection as canonical. The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics. This four-set collection is called the "four _Vedas_" by the Digambaras.

The most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the _Kalpa Sūtras_ are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region, and created their tradition. Śvētāmbaras disagree, and they believe that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal, not into peninsular India. Both traditions, however, consider his _Niryuktis_ and _Samhitas_ as important texts. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by Umaswati called the _Tattvarthasūtra_ is considered authoritative Jain philosophy text by all traditions of Jainism. His text has the same importance in Jainism as _Vedanta Sūtras_ and _Yogasūtras_ have in Hinduism.

In the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential. Other important Jain texts include: _Samayasara_, _Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra_, and _Niyamasara_.

Influence on Indian literature

Mangulam_inscription.jpg inscription dated 2nd century BCE]] Parts of the Sangam literature in Tamil are attributed to Jaina authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas. Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature were added about or after the 8th-century CE, and they are not the ancient layer.

Tamil Jain texts such as the _Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi_ and _Nālaṭiyār_ are credited to Digambara Jain authors. These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445-verse poem into _Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi_ in the 12th century. The Tamil Jain literature, according to Dundas, has been "lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains". The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the _Silapadikkaram_, have an embedded influence of Jainism.

Jain scholars also contributed to Kannada literature. The Digambara Jain texts in Karnataka are unusual, in that they were written under the patronage of kings and regional aristocrats. These Jain texts describe warrior violence and martial valor as equivalent to a "fully committed Jain ascetic". They thus set aside the religious premise of absolute non-violence, possibly reflecting an effort to syncretise various doctrines and beliefs found in Hinduism and Jainism.

Jain manuscript libraries, called _bhandaras_ inside Jain temples, are the oldest surviving in India. Jain libraries, including the Śvētāmbara collections at Patan, Gujarat and Jaiselmer, Rajasthan, as well as the Digambara collections in Karnataka temples, have a large number of well-preserved manuscripts.[30] The manuscripts in the Jain libraries include Jaina literature, as well as Hindu and Buddhist texts. Almost all their texts have been dated to about, or after, the 11th century CE. The largest and most valuable libraries are found in the Thar Desert, hidden in the underground vaults of Jain temples. These collections have witnessed insect damage, and only a small portion of these manuscripts have been published and studied by scholars.


Comparison with Buddhism and Hinduism

All three religions share concepts and doctrines such as karma and rebirth, and have similar ritual festival grammar, mythologies and monastic traditions. They do not believe in eternal heaven or hell or judgment day. Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important, and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (_moksha_).

Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of _anatta_ (non-self", "no eternal self or soul). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging _atman_ (self", "soul), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a _jiva_ (self", "soul) that is both eternal and changing. In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal _jivas_, predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become _siddhas_ (a perfect one). In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from nondualism where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to dualism where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas. Further, in Hindu thought, Jainism-style asceticism is not emphasized, rather liberation is achievable through alternate paths such as Jnana yoga, Karma yoga and Bhakti yoga.

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe "soul exists" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and constant (_vibhu_), but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and Brahman through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in epistemically rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe "soul exists" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism. Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.

Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism. Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which "mainly Western authors are responsible". A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society. According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, "caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms. According to Padamnath Jaini, the 8th-century Digambara scholar Jinasena stated that Jain king Bharata, the son of first _tirthankara_ named Rishabhanatha, invented the caste system by performing the _ahiṃsā_ (non-violence) test, with Jain Brahmins being those who followed the non-violence precept.


Art and architecture

Thirakoil-Parsava_nathar.JPG, Tamil Nadu]] Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of _tirthankara_ or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. _Yakshas_ and _yakshinis_, attendant spirits who guard the _tirthankara_, are usually shown with them. The earliest known Jain image is in the Patna museum. It is dated approximately to the 3rd century BCE. Bronze images of Pārśva can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna museum; these are dated to the 2nd century BCE. Jain_votive_plaque.jpg, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh]] KHANDAGIRI_AND_UDAYGIRI_Cave_Inscriptions_1.jpg.[31]]] _Ayagapata_ is a type of votive tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the _stupa_, _dharmacakra_ and _triratna_. They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like Kankali Tila near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.[32][33][34]

_Samavasarana_, a preaching hall of _tirthankaras_ with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.

The Jain tower in Chittor, Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture. Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology. Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as _Panch Kalyanaka_, from the life of the _tirthankara_. Rishabha, the first _tirthankara_, is usually depicted in either the lotus position or _kayotsarga_, the standing position. He is distinguished from other _tirthankara_ by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures. In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and Indra marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi. Each of the twenty-four _tirthankara_ is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as _Tiloyapannati_, _Kahavaali_ and _Pravacanasaarodhara_.

Temples

A Jain temple, _Derasar_ or _Basadi_ is a place of worship for Jains.[35] Jain temples are built with various architectural designs, but there are mainly two type of Jain temples:

1.  Shikar-_bandhi_ Jain temple (one with a dome)
2.  _Ghar_ Jain temple (Jain house temple – one without a dome).

There is always a main deity also known as _moolnayak_ in every Jain temple placed inside a sanctum called _"Gambhara"_ (Garbha Griha). A _manastambha_ (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

There are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around Madurai. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil.[36]

Ancient Jain monuments include the Udaigiri Hills near Bhelsa (Vidisha) in Madhya Pradesh, the Ellora in Maharashtra, the Palitana temples in Gujarat, and the Jain temples at Dilwara Temples near Mount Abu, Rajasthan.[37] Chaumukha temple in Ranakpur is considered one of the most beautiful Jain temples and is famous for its detailed carvings.[38] According to Jain texts, Shikharji is the place where twenty of the twenty-four Jain _Tīrthaṅkaras_ along with many other monks attained _moksha_ (died without being reborn, with their soul in _Siddhashila_). The Shikharji site in northeastern Jharkhand is therefore a revered pilgrimage site. The Palitana temples are the holiest shrine for the Śvētāmbara Murtipujaka sect. Along with Shikharji the two sites are considered the holiest of all pilgrimage sites by the Jain community.[39]

The Jain complex, Khajuraho and Jain Narayana temple are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[40][41] Shravanabelagola, Saavira Kambada Basadi or _1000 pillars_ and Brahma Jinalaya are important Jain centers in Karnataka.

The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves dating back to the 2nd–1st century BCE are dedicated to Jainism. They are rich with carvings of Jain _tirthanakars_ and deities with inscriptions including the _Hathigumpha_ inscription (Elephant Cave" inscription).[42] Jain cave temples at Badami, Mangi-Tungi and the Ellora Caves are considered important.

The Sittanavasal Cave temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as _"Eladipattam"_, a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct Tamil-Brahmi inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the Holy Sramana Abode until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks.[43] The 8th century Kazhugumalai temple marks the revival of Jainism in South India.[44]

Pilgrimages

Jain _Tirtha_ (pilgrim) sites are divided into the following categories:

-   _Siddhakshetra_Site of the _moksha_ of an _arihant_ (_kevalin_) or _tirthankara_, such as: Ashtapada, Shikharji, Girnar, Pawapuri, Palitana, Mangi-Tungi, and Champapuri (capital of Anga).
-   _Atishayakshetra_Locations where divine events have occurred, such as: Mahavirji, Rishabhdeo, Kundalpur, Tijara, and Aharji.
-   _Puranakshetra_ Places associated with the lives of great men, such as: Ayodhya, Vidisha, Hastinapur, and Rajgir.
-   _Gyanakshetra_ Places associated with famous _acharyas_, or centers of learning, such as Shravanabelagola.

Outside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as Nagarparkar, Sindh (Pakistan). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a "major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage" for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before "the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition".[45]

Statues and sculptures

Jain sculptures are mainly images depicting _tīrthaṅkaras_. A sculpture could depict any of the twenty-four _tīrthaṅkaras{{'}}s_ images. Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular. These _tīrthaṅkaras_ usually depicted in the lotus position or _kayotsarga_. Sculptures of _chaumukha_ (quadruple) images are also popular in Jainism. Sculptures of Arihant, Bahubali, and protector deities like Ambika are also found. _Tirthanakar_ idols look similar and are differentiated by the symbol belonging to each _tirthanakar_ except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on head. There are a few differences between the Digambara and the Śvētāmbara depictions of idols. Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments.

A monolithic, statue of Bahubali, referred to as _Gommateshvara_, built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander Chavundaraya, is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district of Karnataka state. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by _The Times of India_.[46] The Statue of Ahiṃsā (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the Nashik district in 2015; it is tall.[47] Idols made from _Ashtadhatu_ (literally "eight metals), Akota Bronze, brass, gold, silver, stone monoliths, rock cut, and precious stones are popular in Jainism.[48][49]

A large number of _ayagapata_, votive tablets for offerings and the worship of _tīrthankara_, were excavated from Kankali Tila, Mathura. These sculptures date from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE.

Symbols

Jain_Prateek_Chihna.svg Jain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as swastika, om, and the _Ashtamangala_.

Swastika

The swastika is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals). This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by _bhavachakra_ in Buddhism. It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as _Tattvartha sūtra_ and _Uttaradhyayana sūtra_: correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul.

Symbol of _Ahiṃsā_

The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes _ahimsā_ in Jainism with _ahiṃsā_ written in the middle. The wheel represents the _dharmachakra_ (Wheel of the Dharma), which stands for the resolve to halt the _saṃsāra_ (wandering) through the relentless pursuit of _ahimsā_ (compassion).

_Om_

Om_jaïn_orange.svg in Jainism]] In Jainism, _Om_ is considered a condensed form of reference to the _Pañca-Parameṣṭhi_, by their initials _A+A+A+U+M_ (__). According to the _Dravyasamgraha_ by Acharya Nemicandra, _AAAUM_ (or just _Om_) is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "_Arihant_, _Ashiri_, _Acharya_, _Upajjhaya_, _Muni_".[50] The _Om_ symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the _Ṇamōkāra_ Mantra.

Jain emblem

In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism. The overall shape depicts the three _loka_ (realms of rebirth) of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes _Siddhashila_, which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of _Ahiṃsā_ in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, _Parasparopagraho Jīvānām_. According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means "all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence". According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati's _Tattvarthasūtra_, and it means "souls render service to one another".[51]

Jain flag

Jain_flag.jpg The five colours of the Jain flag represent the _Pañca-Parameṣṭhi_ and the five vows, small as well as great:

-   White – represents the _arihants_, souls who have conquered all passions (anger, attachments, aversion) and have attained omniscience and eternal bliss through self-realisation. It also denotes peace or _ahiṃsā_ (non-violence ).
-   Red – represents the _Siddha_, souls that have attained salvation and truth. It also denotes _satya_ (truthfulness)
-   Yellow – represents the _acharya_ the Masters of Adepts. The colour also stands for _achaurva_ (non-stealing).
-   Green – represents the _upadhyaya_ (adepts), those who teach scriptures to monks. It also signifies _brahmacharya_ (chastity).
-   Black – represents the Jain ascetics. It also signifies _aparigraha_ (non-possession).

_Ashtamangala_

The _Ashtamangala_ are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and Śvētāmbar traditions.

In the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are Chatra, _Dhvaja_, _Kalasha_, Chaamara, Mirror, Chair, Hand fan and Vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, these are Swastika, _Srivatsa_, _Nandavarta_, _Vardhmanaka_ (food vessel), _Bhadrasana_ (seat), _Kalasha_ (pot), _Darpan_ (mirror) and pair of fish.


History

Photo_of_lord_adinath_bhagwan_at_kundalpur.JPG, believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the traditional founder of Jainism.]]

Origins

The origins of Jainism are obscure. The Jains claim their religion to be eternal, and consider Rishabhanatha to be the founder in the present time cycle, the first of 24 Jain _tirthankaras_ in Jain belief, and someone who lived for 8,400,000 purva years. According to the hypothesis of the philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed. According to historians, the first 22 of the 24 _tirthankaras_ were mythical figures. These figures were supposed to have lived more than 85,000 years ago. They were five to hundred times taller than average human beings and lived for thousands of years.[52] The 23rd _tirthankara_, Parshvanatha, is generally accepted to be based on an ancient historic human being of uncertain dates, possibly the eighth to sixth century BCE.[53]

Some Indian history scholars such as Parikh have hypothesized that images such as those of the bull in Indus Valley Civilization seal are related to Jainism. Jainism, like Buddhism, is one of the _Śramaṇa_ traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the Vedas.[54]

There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BC, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE. Statues of Jain _tirthankara_ have been found dating back to the second century BC.

Political history

Udayagiri_Caves_-_Rani_Gumpha_01.jpg built by King Kharavela of Mahameghavahana dynasty in 2nd century BCE]] Information regarding the political history of Jainism is uncertain and fragmentary. Jains consider the king Bimbisara (c. 558–491 BCE), Ajatashatru (c. 492–460 BCE), and Udayin (c. 460–440 BCE) of the Haryanka dynasty as a patron of Jainism.

Jain tradition states that Chandragupta Maurya (322–298 BCE), the founder of the Mauryan Empire and grandfather of Ashoka, became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic Bhadrabahu during later part of his life. According to historians, Chandragupta's story appears in various versions in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts. Broadly, Chandragupta was born into a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of Chanakya of _Arthashastra_ fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.[55][56][57] According to Jain history, late in his life, Chandragupta renounced the empire he built and handed over his power to his son, became a Jaina monk, and headed to meditate and pursue spirituality in the Deccan region, under the Jaina teacher Bhadrabahu at Shravanabelagola. There state Jain texts, he died by fasting, a Jaina ascetic method of ending one's life by choice (_Sallenkana vrata_).[58][59] The 3rd century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions several ancient Indian religious groups including the _Niganthas_ (Jaina).

According to another Jain legend, King Salivahana of the late 1st century CE was a patron of Jainism, as were many others in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. But von Glasenapp states that the historicity of these stories is difficult to establish. Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain centre between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE show that the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara had already taken place.

King Harshavardhana of the 7th century grew up in Shaivism, following his family, but he championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism. King Ama of the 8th century converted to Jainism, and the Jaina pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era. Mularaja, the founder of Chalukya dynasty, constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain.

In the second half of the 1st century CE, Hindu kings sponsored and helped build major Jaina cave temples. For example, the Hindu Rashtrakuta dynasty started the early group of Jain temples,[60] and the Yadava dynasty built many of the middle and later Jain group of temples at the Ellora Caves between 700 and 1000 CE.[61][62][63]

Interaction with other religions

Shrine_with_Four_Jinas_(Rishabhanatha_(Adinatha)),_Parshvanatha,_Neminatha,_and_Mahavira)_LACMA_M.85.55_(1_of_4).jpg Mahāvīra and Buddha are generally accepted as contemporaries (circa 5th century BCE).[64] The interaction between Jainism and Buddhism began with the Buddha. Buddhist texts refer to Mahāvīra as _Nigantha Nataputta_.

Beyond the times of the Mahāvīra and the Buddha, the two ascetic _sramana_ (seeker) religions competed for followers as well as the merchant trade networks that sustained them.[65] Their mutual interaction, along with those of Hindu traditions, have been significant. In some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are the same or similar but present different doctrines.

Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as the decline of Jainism. The Pallava King Mahendravarman I (600630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of Appar. His work _Mattavilasa Prahasana_ ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics. Sambandar converted the contemporary Pandya king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, Basava, a minister to the Jain Kalachuri king Bijjala, succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the Lingayat Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use. The Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana (c.11081152 CE) became a follower of the Vaishnava sect under the influence of Ramanuja, after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.

La_grotte_Jain_Indra_Sabha_Ellora_Caves,_India.jpg, are co-located with Hindu and Buddhist monuments.]] Jainism and Hinduism influenced each other. Jain texts declare some of the Hindu gods as blood relatives of legendary _tirthankara_. Neminatha, the 22nd _tirthankara_ for example is presented as a cousin of Krishna in Jain Puranas and other texts.[66] However, Jain scholars such as Haribhadra also wrote satires about Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically.[67] The Hindu gods are presented by some Jain writers as persecuting, tempting, afraid of, or serving a legendary Jina before he gains omniscience. In other stories, the Hindu deities such as Vishnu, or Rama and Sita come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.

The Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting. Some Hindu temples have included a Jain _Tirthankara_ within its premises in a place of honour.[68] Similarly numerous temple complexes feature both Hindu and Jain monuments, with Badami cave temples and Khajuraho among some of the most well known.[69]

Gori_Mandar.jpg in Nagarparkar, Pakistan, a pilgrimage site before 1947.[70]]] Jainism faced persecution during and after the Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent. Muslims rulers, such as Mahmud Ghazni (1001), Mohammad Ghori (1175) and Ala-ud-din Muhammed Shah Khalji (1298) further oppressed the Jain community. They vandalised idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. There were significant exceptions, such as Emperor Akbar (15421605) whose legendary religious tolerance, out of respect for Jains, ordered the release of caged birds and banned the killing of animals on the Jain festival of Paryusan. After Akbar, Jains faced an intense period of Muslim persecution in the 17th century.[71]

The Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.

Colonial era

Colonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as either a sect of Hinduism[72] or Buddhism, or as a distinct religion.[73][74] According to Padmanath Jaini, Christian missionaries expressed extreme frustration at Jain people without pagan creator gods refusing to convert to Christianity, while colonial era Jain scholars such as Champat Rai Jain defended Jainism against criticism and misrepresentation by Christian activists. Missionaries of Christianity and Islam considered Jain traditions as idolatrous and a false religion,[75] characterizing Jain temples and icons, such of those of Jina, as false idols and superstitious practices. These criticisms, states John Cort, were flawed and also ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.

The British colonial government in India, as well as Indian princely states, passed laws that made monks roaming naked in streets a crime, one that led to arrest. This law particularly impacted the Digambara monks. The Akhil Bharatiya Jaina Samaj opposed this law, and argued that it interfered with the religious rights of Jains. Acharya Shantisagar entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces. Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the British Raj and prompted their discontinuance. The colonial era laws that banned naked monks remained effective through World War II, but they were abolished by India after it gained independence.


Jains in the modern era

Pakbirra_Jain_Shrine_of_Purulia_03.jpg ]] Followers of the path practised by the Jinas are known as Jains. The majority of Jains currently reside in India. With four to five million followers worldwide, Jainism is relatively small compared to major world religions. Jains form 0.37% of India's population. Most of them are concentrated in the states of Maharashtra (1.4 million in 2011,[76] 31.46% of Indian Jains), Rajasthan (13.97%), Gujarat (13.02%) and Madhya Pradesh (12.74%). Karnataka (9.89%), Uttar Pradesh (4.79%), Delhi (3.73%) and Tamil Nadu (2.01%) also have significant Jain populations.[77] Outside India, Jain communities can be found in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and Kenya.

According to the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015–16, Jains form the wealthiest community in India.[78] Jains have the highest literacy rate (87%) in India, in the 7-years to oldest age group, according to its 2011 census. The Jaina community also has the highest number of college graduates.[79] Excluding the retired senior citizens, Jain literacy rate in India exceeded 97%. The female to male child sex ratio in the 0–6 year age was second lowest for Jains (870 girls per 1,000 boys), higher than Sikhs in India. Further, Jain males have the highest work participation rates, while Jain females have the lowest work participation rates in India.[80]
