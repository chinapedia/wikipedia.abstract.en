The FOURTH SEASON of _AUSTRALIAN SURVIVOR_ is a television series based on the international reality game show franchise _Survivor_. It is the second season to air on the Network Ten, following the network acquiring the broadcast rights to the _Australian Survivor_ franchise in late 2015. The season premiered on 30 July 2017.[1]

Like the previous season, the program was filmed on the Samoan island of Upolu and featured 24 Australian castaways competing for 55 days in the Samoan jungle for a grand prize of A$500,000. Jonathan LaPaglia returned to host the series for his second season.

On the 10th of October, 2017, Jericho Malabonga was revealed to be the winner over Tara Pitt by a vote of 6–3.


Production

Casting

The series was renewed on 23 October 2016. Upon the announcement of renewal, a casting call was made for potential contestants for the new season.[2] Over 20,000 people applied for the new season.[3]

Twists

This season featured multiple game-play twists for the first time in the series. This season introduced the super-idol which had the power to nullify the use of any other idol at one tribal council (not to be confused with the post-vote negating idol seen first in the American format's Panama season). This season also introduced several 'moral dilemmas' into the game which forced contestants to choose between two luxuries; one that benefits the entire tribe and one that only benefits the finder.

This season also saw the return of non-elimination episodes from season 3, the first of which saw a double tribal council where two contestants were sequentially voted out and sent to the opposing tribe. The following day, two contestants of the other tribe were then required to volunteer to switch to the tribe to replace them. The second non-elimination episode saw the contestants of one tribe vote for one of their members to receive a reward. The third featured a Tribal Council mutiny and the fourth featured a juror elimination.

This season also introduced a variety of twists previously seen on the American format including the initial marooning, the hiding of an immunity idol at challenges (first seen in _Cambodia_), tribal mutiny (first seen in _Thailand_) and jury member elimination (as seen in _Kaôh Rōng_).

: List of _Australian Survivor (season 4)_ contestants

Future appearances

Luke Toki competed in the second iteration of _Australian Survivor: Champions vs. Contenders_ as part of the Champions tribe.


Season summary

The twenty-four castaways were split into two tribes of twelve. On Asaga, Samantha, Mark, Sarah, Henry and Jacqui came into a power position and eliminated Joan after she faltered at the puzzle at the first immunity challenge, despite the attempts of Luke and Jericho to foil their plans. Meanwhile, at Samatau, A.K. was at the bottom for his very aggressive strategic play, and two factions emerged: one led by Locky with Anneliese, Aimee, Peter and Jarrad; and another led by Adam with Tessa, Kate, Tarzan, Tara and Ziggy. However, Adam’s domineering attitude led A.K. and Tara to ultimately join Locky’s side to vote off Adam. Ziggy also flipped to Locky’s side and they eliminated the other members of Adam’s alliance until only Tessa remained. After Samatau lost another immunity challenge, A.K. seized control of the tribe by pulling in Tessa, Ziggy, Jarrad and Peter to eliminate Locky’s closest ally Aimee. Meanwhile, at Asaga, Henry and Jacqui found a hidden immunity idol, and took control of Asaga by turning on their allies and greatest threats in the power couple of Samantha and Mark. Luke and Jericho again tried to upset the balance of power in the tribe, but to no avail.

After losing another immunity challenge, the dominant alliance of five in Samatau voted out outsiders Tara and Anneliese in a fake double elimination, but the two girls were instead sent to Asaga in a tribe swap. Asaga chose their replacements to be sent to Samatau; Ben volunteered alongside Henry, who viewed that if he took control of Samatau he could have a great chance of winning the game, taking the idol with him and leaving Jacqui exposed. Luke and Jericho seized the opportunity and recruited Michelle and Sarah with Tara and Anneliese to take control of the tribe and eliminate Jacqui and her closest ally Kent. A.K. meanwhile, recruited Ben into his alliance while Henry and Locky aligned but remained on the outside. They were saved, however, as they won every immunity challenge. Ziggy was also voted by tribe to receive an “ultimate reward”, which turned out to be a hidden immunity idol, and a super idol which could cancel out another contestant’s hidden immunity idol.

Another tribe swap left most of the contestants on their current tribe, except A.K. and Peter who joined Asaga, and Michelle and Anneliese who joined Samatau. Tara took her revenge by turning Asaga against A.K, while Michelle convinced Samatau that Ben was untrustworthy. While Peter was Asaga’s next intended target, Asaga fractured after Luke and Sarah viewed the other as disloyal and turned on each other, leaving the camp in drama and disarray. While Sarah attempted to align with Peter to create a majority against Luke, a mutiny twist left Peter to rejoin Samatau and Sarah was exposed. However, she decided to realign with Luke and convinced him to vote out floater Odette.

The merge left the Samatau members (led by Jarrad) in the majority, and they intended to pick off the Asaga members. However, Jarrad’s turning on Henry led Henry and Locky to flip to the Asaga side, and they formed a majority with Michelle who viewed that she was on the bottom of the Samatau alliance. They eliminated Jarrad and Anneliese, after Ziggy also flipped to Asaga and used her super idol once Anneliese attempted to save herself by using a hidden immunity idol. However, a spa reward won by Tessa at an auction allowed her to align with Michelle and Luke and they, with their respective allies Peter, Sarah and Jericho, managed to make a majority and vote out Henry despite Locky urging him to play his idol.

Despite seemingly being in the majority, Luke’s spying showed him that Tessa was plotting against his closest ally Jericho with Ziggy. After Tessa decided to split the vote between Locky and Tara, Luke seized the opportunity to again overthrow the majority and recruited Jericho and Sarah to vote out Tessa. Michelle, however, was upset at being left out of the plan and convinced everyone to turn against Sarah. At this point, Tara, worried that Locky was too much of a physical and jury threat, decided to turn against her closest ally. Her plans were foiled, however, when Locky went on a streak of winning immunity challenges. This forced the elimination of other threats Luke and Ziggy. After Michelle was able to very narrowly defeat Locky in a combined reward and immunity challenge, Locky attempted to deflect the vote to Peter by claiming he had a hidden immunity idol by using Anneliese’s “congratulations” note, but it was to no avail and he was voted out.

At the Final 4, Jericho won an advantage to remove a member of the jury. He chose Tessa, believing her to be the least likely to vote for him to win, despite her saying that she viewed Tara as the weakest player. Peter was the next intended target, but after he won immunity, he lobbied for Jericho’s elimination. This was foiled after Jericho uncovered the plan and Tara, paranoid after Tessa’s statements, decided to make a big move and force a fire-making challenge between Jericho and Michelle. Jericho ended up winning, and thus Michelle was eliminated. Jericho then won the final immunity challenge and decided to stay true to his new alliance with Tara, voting out Peter.

At the Final Tribal Council, Tara was commended for her strong social game, playing from a minority position and her orchestration of Locky and A.K’s elimination, but chastised for riding Locky’s coattails for far too long, not making enough strategic decisions, and being weak in challenges. Meanwhile, Jericho was congratulated for his very effective method of making alliances and using shields, playing under-the-radar, and winning challenges when he needed to. However he was criticized for his cruelty and hypocrisy, claiming to be a benevolent religious person despite unnecessarily being nasty to Jarrad and Sarah when they were eliminated, riding on Luke’s coattails, and making bad decisions such as removing Tessa from the jury and taking Tara to the end, despite Tessa saying she would be very unlikely to vote for Tara to win. However, Jericho’s strong strategic and physical game was rewarded over Tara’s underdog status, and he was awarded the title of Sole Survivor with six jury votes to Tara’s three.
