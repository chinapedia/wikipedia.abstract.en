_THE SAME SKY_ (original title: ) is a 2017 German TV miniseries set in Cold War Germany and portrays the fate of two families on either side of the Berlin Wall.[1][2] The story revolves around the relationship between an East German "Romeo" agent – a spy who uses seduction as a way to unearth secrets — and his female target in the West.[3]

The series was screened as three feature-length episodes or as six hour-long episodes, depending on the broadcasting service. It was written by Paula Milne and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and stars Sofia Helin and Tom Schilling.[4] The scripts were written in English and translated into German by the director.[5] The series was produced by UFA Fiction in co-production with Beta Film for ZDF and Czech TV in association with Rainmark Films.[6] It was filmed from 24 August 2015 to 6 December 2015 in Prague. The music score was written by Walter Mair and Vesselina Tchakarova. The series was originally broadcast in Germany in March 2017.

The interest by Amazon and Netflix in acquiring the rights to carry _The Same Sky_ was kindled by the earlier success of another series also featuring a young Stasi agent dispatched to West Germany under an assumed identity, _Deutschland 83_.[7][8]
