KOONOONA is a rural locality in the Mid North region of South Australia, situated in the Regional Council of Goyder.[1] It was established in August 2000, when boundaries were formalised for the "long established local name".[2] It occupies the north-western corner of the cadastral Hundred of Apoinga.[3]

The area was originally the territory of the Ngadjuri people.[4] It was named after the Koonoona Station and Merino stud, which was established in 1863 by Walter Duffield and T. S. Porter.[5][6] Koonoona Station was described in 1929 as "one of the oldest estates in this district" and "noted for the breed of its merino sheep"; another correspondent in 1933 labelled it "one of the most important [Merino studs] in the Commonwealth".[7][8]

Koonoona Provisional School opened in 1894, was declared half-time with Gum Creek in 1903, and closed in 1915.[9]
