The KARA-BALTA is a river of northern Kyrgyzstan. It is a tributary of the Chu River[1] and originates in the Sosnovka Gorge, flowing through the Chuy Valley from south to north.[2]

In 2014, due to rising levels of the Syr Darya, sulfate and nitrite nitrogen levels in the Chu and Kara-Balta Rivers increased.[3]
