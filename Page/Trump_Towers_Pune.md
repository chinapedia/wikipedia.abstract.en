TRUMP TOWERS PUNE is a complex of two 23-story residential buildings in Pune, India.[1] The development is in the city's Kalyani Nagar region.[2] One apartment is located on each floor.[3]


Overview

The Trump Towers Pune property is not owned by or developed by The Trump Organization, and The Trump Organization has not invested any money in the project. The project has received the rights to use the name 'Trump' under a real estate licensing deal with Trump. The exact terms of the deal are not public.[4]

The 'Trump Towers Pune' project "is the subject of two investigations by the Pune state government and local police, after discrepancies were found in documents related to the land on which the luxury apartment block is being built."[5]

In November 2016, the then President-elect of the United States Trump met with three Indian property developers, Sagar and Atul Chordia (his business partners on the Trump Towers Pune project) and Kalpesh Mehta (another Indian businessman), at Trump Tower in New York, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest arising from his dual roles as a businessman and president.[6][7]

On 30 November 2016, Politico reported that an individual working for the building’s developer told BuzzFeed that the building is taking precautionary measures since the 2016 United States presidential election.[8]


Notable residents

In 2015, _The Economic Times_ reported that Bollywood actors Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor have both purchased luxury apartments in the development.[9]
