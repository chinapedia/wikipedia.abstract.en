ARTHUR STEIN (10 June 1871, in Vienna – 15 November 1950, in Prague) was an Austrian-Czech historian and epigrapher.

From 1892 to 1897 he studied history, archaeology and epigraphy at the University of Vienna, where his teachers were Eugen Bormann, Otto Benndorf and Emil Szántó. Following graduation, he took an extended study trip to Bulgaria, Italy, Greece and Asia Minor. In 1915 he obtained his habilitation for classical history and archaeology at the University of Prague, where in 1922 he was named a full professor of Roman archaeology and epigraphy.[1] Because of his Jewish heritage, he was imprisoned at Theresienstadt concentration camp from July 1942 to May 1945.[2]

With Edmund Groag, he published three volumes of the second edition of the _Prosopographia Imperii Romani_ (1933–43).[3]
