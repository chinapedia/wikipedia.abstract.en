Treatment of Michael Jackson

Farshchian is best known on a worldwide basis for his treatment of pop superstar Michael Jackson from April 2001 until December 2003. He initially treated Jackson for an ankle injury that hampered his ability to perform, but after a close personal friendship developed, Farshchian attempted to intervene and cure Jackson of his addiction to Demerol.[3] Farshchian convinced Jackson and his family that an implant chip of the medication Naltrexone, which inhibits the effects of narcotics such as Demerol, could help the singer wean himself off Demerol. The treatment was successful. During his treatment, Jackson traveled multiple times to Miami, where he stayed in a private room created for him in Farshchian's garage. Farschian also visited Jackson and his family at the celebrity's Neverland Ranch in Southern California.

Unfortunately, Jackson's use of the general anesthetic Propofol, administered by Dr. Conrad Murray, eventually led to his death on June 25, 2009. After Jackson's death, the Sheriff of Santa Maria, California, where Neverland Ranch was located, released to the public personal letters Farshchian had sent Jackson, pleading with him to fight his addiction to Demerol. One of the letters included a package that began Jackson detoxification therapy.[4] In March 2003, Jackson and Farshchian zeroed in on the eight-story Victoria Medical Center, a health care condominium, located at 955 N.W. Third St., in the Little Havana area of Miami as a potential location for a planned ventilator hospital project called Michael Jackson international children's hospital.[5]
