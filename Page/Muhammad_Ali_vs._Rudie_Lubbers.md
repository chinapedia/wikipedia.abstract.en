Muhammad Ali and Rudie Lubbers fought a twelve-round boxing match in Jakarta on October 20, 1973. Ali dominated the fight and won the bout through a unanimous decision on points.[1][2][3][4][5]

The Ali-Lubbers fight is notable for the interview Ali gave to Reg Gutteridge during the interval between rounds of the televised bout with Gutteridge leaning through the ropes of the ring.[6][7][8][9] This is believed to be the only interview of its kind.[10]
