DEMANUFACTURE is a process where a product after extensive usage is then disassembled into components, the components are classified as to functionality and components suitable for reuse are again to returned to a product for reuse. Demanufacturing was proposed to be used in all industries as a means reduce the environmental footprint while preserving economic viability of the processes involved. This term was first coined by Professor Walter W. Olson and Professor John W. Sutherland in 1993.[1]

In the case of waste electronics demanufacture involves dismantling them into their components.[2] In the case of material demanufacture this may be a chemical process, such as in treatment of waste plastics breaking down long polymers into smaller polymers.[3]

Demanufacture and recycling of the recovered parts can be thought of, collectively, as the treatment method for e-waste. Five to 10 percent of discarded computers undergo this demanufacture and are then fitted with new drives, circuitry, and ...."
