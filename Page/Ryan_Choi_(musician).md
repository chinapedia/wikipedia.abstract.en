RYAN CHOI (born December 2, 1984 in Honolulu, Hawai'i) is a composer and multi-instrumentalist.


Biography

Choi was classically trained on the double bass from an early age and took up the ukulele in high school.[1] Self-taught as a composer, he first came to international recognition for a series of releases for the baritone ukulele[2] that were notable for being the first to showcase the instrument's avant-garde potential.[3][4][5] His debut album, Three Dancers, created after a years-long absence from music,[6] won the 2016 Independent Music Award for Best Instrumental EP [7] and featured the composer on prepared baritone ukulele, percussion and electronics.[8] His work, favoring improvisation and experimentation, is often dense, intricate, and mathematically complex,[9] utilizing advanced harmony and drawing on a range of visual, literary, and musical sources.[10] He also makes extensive use of preparations and alternative tunings.[11][12][13] He has collaborated with Kommissar Hjuler and Mama Baer.[14][15] He lives and works in Honolulu, Hawai'i.
