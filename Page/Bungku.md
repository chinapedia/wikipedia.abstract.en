BUNGKU is a town and the administrative centre of the Regency of Morowali, in Central Sulawesi Province of Indonesia.[1]

Bungku was originally not the capital of Morowali. In 1999, the capital of Morowali was Kolonodale. In 2004, the plan to shift the Morowali capital southeast from Kolonodale to Bungku left non-Bungku residents, both Protestant and Muslim, feeling further disenfranchised.[2]

The city is served by Maleo Airport, opened in March 2017.[3]
