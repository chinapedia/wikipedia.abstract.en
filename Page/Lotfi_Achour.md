He was born in Bab Souika, an emblematic cultural area of the Medina of Tunis. Achour arrived in France at age twenty, where he attended Sorbonne University to pursue cinema and theater. He took part in the Varan workshops on documentary filmmaking.


Career

He associated with the author Natacha Pontcharra, with whom he created a dozen texts in residence in various drama centers and national scenes, including La Chartreuse de Villeneuve Lez Avignon, where he directed three shows, including _L’Angélie_, a show created at the Avignon Festival in 1998, and billed as "The best show in Avignon festival", by _Le Soir_ in Belgium.
