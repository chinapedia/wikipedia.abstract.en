THE WOMAN'S EYE PHOTOGRAPHY GROUP established to oppose the continuous cliché of male artist - female model in nude art history. They stand against this cliché by photographing male models for the first time in Turkey by breaking taboos.

They began working for this project by the lead of photography artist Niko Guido in 2012.

These twenty-two women photographers realized their work in the light of body perception, social gender and privacy concepts.

They volunteered for this project and worked with their own resources. When they first started the project they were about 200 women but most of them left for several reasons. Now there are 22 women in this project and they will exhibit their works abroad. One day, they hope to exhibit in their home country as well.
