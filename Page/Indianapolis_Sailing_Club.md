The INDIANAPOLIS SAILING CLUB is a private yacht club located in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the shore of Geist Reservoir (US).[1]


History

In November, 1954 a group of sailors gathered to discussed the possibility of organizing a sailing club on the Geist Reservoir, created by the Indianapolis Water Company in 1943. The group met regularly during the next months to formulate a constitution, by-laws, a set of strict safety rules, and legal documents to lease land from the Indianapolis Water Company for a clubhouse site and docking facilities. On February 24, 1955 a 10-year lease with the Indianapolis Sailing Association granting the use of around 13 acres of land and sailing privileges on Geist Reservoir was signed. On June 19, 1955 a Grand Opening was held on the present clubhouse grounds. The original classes of sailboats at ISC were Snipes, Lightnings, Thistles and Y flyers. On March 11, 1957 at the annual meeting, ISC members voted to change the name to Indianapolis Sailing Club.[2]
