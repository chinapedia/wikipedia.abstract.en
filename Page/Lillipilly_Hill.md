_LILLIPILLY HILL_ (1960) is a novel for children by Australian author Eleanor Spence. It was commended for the Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers in 1961.[1]


Story outline

The novel follows the story of Harriet Wilmot and her family who go to live in a house in the NSW town of Barley Creek at the end of the nineteenth-century. They had previously lived in London and had inherited the house from a relative.

Harriot is very accepting of the new country though the rest of her family struggles with the heat and isolation. The book is a coming of age story, not just for Harriet but for her brother Aidan and for the rest of the family as well.


Critical reception

Reviewing the Text Publishing release for _Readings_ Alexa Dretzke was very happy to see the book re-issued and noted: "_Lillipilly Hill_ is still a compelling read and the characters are well developed. Though the odd word may be a little dated, girls who have loved the Our Australian Girl series will find plenty to enjoy here."[2]


Notes

Text Publishing re-issued the novel in 2013 as a part of their "Text Classics" series, with an introduction by Ursula Dubosarsky.[3]
