_PETER PAN GOES WRONG_ is a play by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer, and Henry Shields of the Mischief Theatre Company (creators of _The Play That Goes Wrong_). The premise, as in _The Play That Goes Wrong_, is that the actors and crews are members of the fictitious Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society presenting their production of the J.M. Barrie classic _Peter Pan_, and ruin it through amateurism and personal rivalries.


Production history

The play made its premiere at the Pleasance Theatre in London in December 2013 before touring the UK in 2014. The production transferred to the West End in London at the Apollo Theatre for a Christmas season run in 2015.[1] It featured the original cast of _The Play That Goes Wrong_ reprising their cast and crew characters from the original production, with the addition of Ellie Morris as Robert's niece Lucy, who is subjected to increasingly serious injuries over the course of the show.

It returned to the Apollo Theatre the following year for another Christmas season run from October 2016 making it the third show running in the West End from the Mischief Theatre Company after _The Play That Goes Wrong_ and _The Comedy About A Bank Robbery_.

Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity benefited from royalties of the play, in accordance to the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 which granted them a right to royalty in perpetuity from adaptations of the story of _Peter Pan_ on stage, publication and film in the UK.

It was announced in April 2019 that the show would embark on a UK Tour starting in October 2019 at The Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham before visiting Cardiff, Cambridge, Brighton, Salford and stopping in London at the Alexandra Palace for a Christmas run from 13th December 2019 till 5th January 2020. The tour will continue into 2020 after the 3 week Christmas run.


Reception

Like _The Play That Goes Wrong_, _Peter Pan Goes Wrong_ received positive reviews. WhatsOnStage.com gave it five out of five stars.[2]

The original West End run was nominated for the 2016 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy but lost to _Nell Gwynn_.[3]


Television special

The play was adapted into a one-hour television special which was broadcast on 31 December 2016 on BBC One, guest-starring David Suchet as the narrator.[4] and featuring the original cast, with the exception of Rob Falconer. It was filmed in front of a live audience at Pinewood Studios[5] and featured additional footage of other BBC television sets being accidentally invaded.
