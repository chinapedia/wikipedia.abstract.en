"_Lone Star State of Mine_" is an unreleased song by American actor, singer and songwriter River Phoenix. The lyrics and musical composition are attributed to Phoenix.[1] The song was performed by Phoenix in the film The Thing Called Love (1993),[2][3] but was not included on the soundtrack album for the film.[4]


Background and history

Phoenix expressed his wishes to release music for a film with his band Aleka's Attic, but the group disbanded in early 1992.

Phoenix began writing songs for the film in July 1993, Commenting on the musical direction, Phoenix said _"The music has everything to do with me having the best understanding of the character and the movie"._

In August 1993, Phoenix described "Lone Star State of Mine", _"It originated from deep emotion and solitude and many days of being alone and in LA and a lot of childhood memories. It’s an ode to solitude and preservation of one’s independence and I guess, self-confidence."_

In an August 93 issue, Journalist Malissa Thompson from Seventeen described his singing, although underscored with anger, as sounding amazingly urgent and sweet.[5]
