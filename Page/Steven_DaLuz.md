Window_final_fb.jpg STEVEN DALUZ (born 1953) is a contemporary American Neoluminist artist known for using chemically induced patinas on metal leaf and mixed media to produce figurative works and imagined landscapes often reflecting upon the sublime as a pictorial theme.[1][2]

DaLuz was born in Hanford, California. His works have been published in art periodicals, such as _American Art Collector_,[3] Fine Art Connoisseur,[4] The Artist,[5] Professional Artist,[6] The Huffington Post[7] and Poets and Artists magazine, where he received the cover for the Nov 2009 Issue.[8] Considered "ethereal and transcendent", his artwork has been said to combine "a spectacular dissertation on light and shadow with a brilliant collection of colors".[9] DaLuz holds degrees in Social Psychology (BA, Park University 1979), Management ((MA, Central Michigan University, 1981)), Graphic Design (AAS, San Antonio College, 2001), and Fine Arts (BFA, University of Texas at San Antonio, 2003).[10][11]
