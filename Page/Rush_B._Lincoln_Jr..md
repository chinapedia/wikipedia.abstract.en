United States Army

In 1932, Lincoln graduated at the top of his class at the United States Military Academy.[5] He was appointed as a second lieutenant on June 10, 1932. He was promoted to first lieutenant on September 22, 1935 and by 1942 was a lieutenant colonel.[6]

Lincoln was promoted to colonel on September 13, 1944. During World War II, Lincoln took part in the seven conferences between the heads of state and the combined chiefs of staff (Washington, the first and Second Quebec Conferences, Cairo, Tehran, Malta, and Yalta).[7][8] He was also a member of the Joint Staff Planning and the Army Forces Western Pacific, headquartered in Manila.[9] During the final months of the war, Lincoln served as the chief of transportation in the Pacific Theatre.[10]

Post-war

Lincoln remained in Manila for a year after the war and then attended the Armed Forces Staff College, where he was a member of the school's first class. He was then assigned as the Assistant Commandant of the Transportation School. In 1950 he graduated from the National War College and was assigned as a special assistant to General Frank A. Heilman, the Army's Chief of Transportation. In April 1951, Lincoln was assigned to the newly formed Logistics Division at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. The Logistics Division's mission was to develop facilities to enhance the military readiness of NATO countries as well as coordinate and develop plans to increase emergency preparedness.[11] On October 2, 1954 he was promoted to Brigadier general in that December he was assigned as the commanding general of Fort Eustis.

Decorations and badges

Lincoln was awarded the Legion of Merit with two Oak leaf clusters and the Distinguished Service Medal.[13]


Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority

In 1965, Lincoln turned down a promotion to Lieutenant general to become the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). He retired from the Army on January 31, 1965 and took over at the MBTA the following day. His appointment was championed by General James McCormack, the chairman of the MBTA board of directors and a former West Point classmate of Lincoln's.[14]

During his tenure with the MBTA, Lincoln had difficulties with officials under him, who were appointed based on political affiliations and did not hold allegiance to Lincoln. He was publicly critical of deputy general managers Edward F. McLaughlin Jr. and Michael J. Powell, who he felt undercut his authority by dealing directly with the board of directors.[15]

By 1967, the MBTA's deficit had grown to over $32 million annually and Lincoln came under pressure to resign. Lincoln resigned in September 1967, citing a "lack of understanding on the part of some people as how the affairs of the authority should be conducted and a lack of appreciation of the time it takes to plan and do a job so that it is done right the first time."[16]


Later life and death

Lincoln resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts following his retirement from the Army and remained there until his death on August 15, 2002.[17][18]
