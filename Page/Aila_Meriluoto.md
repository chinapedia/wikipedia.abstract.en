AILA MERILUOTO (born 10 January 1924) is a poet, writer and translator from Finland.

Meriluoto published her first collection of poems, _Lasimaalaus_ in age of 22. It was a success among critics and readers.[1] She became the most celebrated and widely read female poet of post-war Finland. The central themes of her early poems are art and femininity.[2] Her first collections reflect the influence of Austrian opera Rainer Maria Rilke. In collection _Pahat unet_ (1956) some of the poems have a free form. The next collection, _Portaat_, came five years later, and there Meriluoto has found her own modern style of expression.[3]

Meriluoto lived for 13 years in Sweden. In 1974 she moved back to Finland, and the language of her poetry changed again to more close to a talking voice.[4]

In addition to poems, Meriluoto has written novels, and books for young people.[5] She has translated works by Harry Martinson, Rainer Maria Rilke, Shakespeare and Goethe.[6]

Meriluoto was married 1948-1956 to another poet, Lauri Viita. She described him and their stormy marriage in a biographical novel.[7]
