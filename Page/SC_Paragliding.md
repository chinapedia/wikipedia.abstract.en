SC PARAGLIDING was a Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer based in Kharkiv. The company specialized in the design and manufacture of paragliders in the form of ready-to-fly aircraft.[1]

The company seems to have been founded in the early 2000s and gone out of business before 2016.[2][3]

In 2002 the company had introduced two models of paragliders, with just one size each. A year later, in 2003, they had a line that included the Discovery in seven sizes including two sizes for two-place flight training and the Scorpion in four sizes.[4]

Reviewer Noel Bertrand in 2003 noted that the company was one of very few in that year offering a paraglider design for sale under â‚¬1,000.[5]
