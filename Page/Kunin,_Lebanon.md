History

In 1875, Victor Guérin gives the population of this place at 400, divided between Moslems and Metawileh.[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as: "A village, built of stone, containing about 200 Metawileh ; it is situated on ridge, with olives and arable land around ; water from cisterns in the village and from a large _birket_."[3] They further noted: "There are two round and two octagonal pillars at this village, remains of old materials, and a lintel measuring 17' long and bearing a Greek inscription. There are also several cisterns and a large birkeh. The inscription on the lintel is probably the common formula, KYPIE BOHΘH ("Help, Lord")."[4]
