Early life and education

Dawn Hampton was born on June 8, 1928, in Middletown, Ohio, to Laura and Clarke "Deacon" Hampton. Clarke Hampton was born in Batavia, Ohio, in 1877, to William and Elizabeth Hampton, and studied music and art while attending a military academy in Xenia, Ohio. He married Laura Burford in 1908.[1]

The Hamptons were a musical family. Both parents played musical instruments: Clarke played saxophone and drums; Laura played piano.[2][3] The family included twelve children, three of whom died young. The nine surviving children included four daughters (Carmalita, Aletra, Virtue, and Dawn) and five sons (Clarke Jr. "Duke", Marcus, Russell "Lucky", Maceo, and Locksley "Slide"). The siblings were trained by their parents to play musical instruments. Dawn learned to play the alto saxophone and later became a vocalist who specialized in ballads.[4][5] Under their father's leadership the Hampton children began performing in the family band at a young age. Dawn joined the family band and its vaudeville act at the age of three, beginning her long career as a musical performer.[6][7]

The Hampton family settled in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1938, when Dawn was tens years old. She attended Indianapolis Public Schools, including Crispus Attucks High School, but left to perform with the Hampton family band.[8][9][10] Although she did not have professional music training, four of her brothers (Marcus, "Lucky", Maceo, and "Slide") took lessons as the MacArthur Conservatory of Music.[11][12]

The family traveled the Midwest, especially in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana, performing at fairs, carnivals, tent shows, and private parties. In addition to dancing and presenting comedy skits, the band performed a variety of musical genres, including ragtime, blues, dixieland, polka, and jazz music.[16][17][18] In 1938, after an unsuccessful trip to California to find work in the Hollywood film industry, the family relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Hamptons continued to tour and perform in local clubs.[19][20]

The fourteen-piece group included the nine surviving Hampton siblings, as well as several well-known Indiana Avenue musicians such as Alonzo "Pookie" Johnson and Bill Penick on saxophone, trombonist/bass player Eugene Fowlkes, and drummers Sonny Johnson, Dick Dickerson, and Thomas Whitted. Dawn Hampton was also a member of the group when it later became house band at the Cotton Club in Cincinnati, Ohio.[24][25]
