History

Minami-Nagasaki Sports Park is an urban planning park that was built on the site of the former Nagasaki Junior High School (), which was completed in May 1950. The school closed in 2006 due to a fall in the number of students. Based on answers to an Internet questionnaire, the park was made a sports and disaster-prevention location. The park contains a memorial plaque to Nagasaki Junior High School.


Facilities

There is a sports center, football (soccer) pitch (multipurpose square), open space with a lawn, and in summer there is a small fountain and water area (called _Jabu-Jabu Ike_ (Splashing Pond)). There is play equipment for children including swings and slides. As a disaster-prevention facility, the park has a water-sampling port, a manhole that can serve as a temporary toilet, and a bench that can be used as a small oven. The park also offers access to existing disaster-prevention wells and fire-prevention water tanks.
