Critical reception

The _Los Angeles Times_ praised Mazzoli's score, calling it "seductive, meditative, spiritually elusive and subversive. With it, we can welcome a new natural for the art form."[9]

For _The New York Times_ Steve Smith wrote that "in the electric surge of Ms. Mazzoliâ€™s score you felt the joy, risk and limitless potential of free spirits unbound."[10]

Lauren Alfano of _I Care If You Listen_ called it a "masterpiece of modern opera."[11]
