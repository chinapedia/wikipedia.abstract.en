DHARMA (;[1] , ; , translit. _dhamma_) is a key concept with multiple meanings in Indian religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and others.[2] There is no single-word translation for _dharma_ in Western languages.[3]

In Hinduism, _dharma_ signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with _·πöta_, the order that makes life and universe possible,[4] and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living".see:

-   "Dharma", _The Columbia Encyclopedia_, 6th Ed. (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, ;
-   Steven Rosen (2006), Essential Hinduism, Praeger, , Chapter 3. In Buddhism, _dharma_ means "cosmic law and order",[5] and is also applied to the teachings of Buddha.[6] In Buddhist philosophy, _dhamma/dharma_ is also the term for "phenomena".[7] Dharma in Jainism refers to the teachings of _tirthankara_ (_Jina_)[8] and the body of doctrine pertaining to the purification and moral transformation of human beings. For Sikhs, the word _dharm_ means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.[9]

The word _dharma_ was already in use in the historical Vedic religion, and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia.[10] The ancient Tamil moral text of _Tirukkural_ is solely based on _a·πüam_, the Tamil term for dharma. The antonym of dharma is _adharma_.


Etymology

word "_Dha-·πÉ-ma_"/ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´ (Sanskrit: Dharma ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ) in the Brahmi script, as inscribed by Emperor Ashoka in his Edicts of Ashoka (3rd century BCE).]] The Classical Sanskrit noun _dharma_ (‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ) or the Prakrit Dha·πÉma (ëÄ•ëÄÅëÄ´) are a derivation from the root _dh·πõ_, which means "to hold, maintain, keep",. Hence, _dharma_ holds one falling down or falling to hell. Therefore, takes the meaning of "what is established or firm", and hence "law". It is derived from an older Vedic Sanskrit _n_-stem _dharman-_, with a literal meaning of "bearer, supporter", in a religious sense conceived as an aspect of Rta.

In the Rigveda, the word appears as an _n_-stem, __, with a range of meanings encompassing "something established or firm" (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means "sustainer" and "supporter" (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek _Themis_ ("fixed decree, statute, law").[11] In Classical Sanskrit, the noun becomes thematic: __.

The word _dharma_ derives from Proto-Indo-European root

-   _*d ∞er-_ ("to hold"),[12] which in Sanskrit is reflected as class-1 root _dh·πõ_. Etymologically it is related to Avestan dar- ("to hold"), Latin _firmus_ ("steadfast, stable, powerful"), Lithuanian _derƒóÃÅti_ ("to be suited, fit"), Lithuanian _dermƒó_ ("agreement")[13] and _darna_ ("harmony") and Old Church Slavonic _dr—ä≈æati_ ("to hold, possess").
-   Classical Sanskrit word _dharmas_ would formally match with Latin o-stem _firmus_ from Proto-Indo-European _d ∞er-mo-s_ "holding", were it not for its historical development from earlier Rigvedic n-stem.

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the Vedic Sanskrit of the Atharvaveda, the stem is thematic: __ (DevanƒÅgarƒ´: ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ). In Prakrit and PƒÅli, it is rendered _dhamma_. In some contemporary Indian languages and dialects it alternatively occurs as _dharm_.

Ancient translations

When the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka wanted in the 3rd century BCE to translate the word "Dharma" (he used Prakrit word _Dha·πÉma_) into Greek and Aramaic,[14] he used the Greek word _Eusebeia_ (Œµ·ΩêœÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒµŒπŒ±, piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription and the Kandahar Greek Edicts, and the Aramaic word _Qsyt_ ("Truth") in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription.[15]


Definition

Dharma is a concept of central importance in Indian philosophy and religion.[16] It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.[17] It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for _dharma_, as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations.[18] There is no equivalent single-word synonym for _dharma_ in western languages.See:

-   Ludo Rocher (2003), The Dharmasastra, Chapter 4, in Gavin Flood (Editor), _The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism_, .
-   Alban G. Widgery, "The Principles of Hindu Ethics", _International Journal of Ethics_, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Jan. 1930), pp. 232‚Äì245.

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word _dharma_ into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch,[19] has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann's[20] translation of Rig-veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, Karl Friedrich Geldner in his translation of the Rig-veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as "law", "order", "duty", "custom", "quality", and "model", among others.[21] However, the word _dharma_ has become a widely accepted loanword in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word _dharma_ is "dhri", which means "to support, hold, or bear". It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant.[22] Monier-Williams, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offerssee:

-   "Dharma" Monier Monier-Williams, _Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary_ (2008 revision), pp. 543‚Äì544;
-   Carl Cappeller (1999), _Monier-Williams: A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Etymological and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages_, Asian Educational Services, , pp. 510‚Äì512. numerous definitions of the word _dharma_, such as that which is established or firm, steadfast decree, statute, law, practice, custom, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, ethics, religion, religious merit, good works, nature, character, quality, property. Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while the combination of these translations does not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, _dharma_ means "right way of living" and "path of rightness".[23]

The meaning of the word _dharma_ depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, _dharma_ meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas and the Epics, the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.see:

In certain contexts, _dharma_ designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level.[24][25]see:

-   "...the order and custom which make life and a universe possible, and thus to the behaviours appropriate to the maintenance of that order". citation in _The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions_
-   _Britannica Concise Encyclopedia_, 2007. _Dharma_ encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or morally upright.see:

The antonym of _dharma_ is _adharma_ (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ),see

-   adharma Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2009). meaning that which is "not dharma". As with _dharma_, the word _adharma_ includes and implies many ideas; in common parlance, adharma means that which is against nature, immoral, unethical, wrong or unlawful.see:

In Buddhism, _dharma_ incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, the Buddha.


History

According to the authoritative book _History of Dharmasastra_, in the hymns of the Rigveda the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch,[26] the word dharma has its origin in the myths of Vedic Hinduism. The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.[27][28] The gods, mainly Indra, then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability ‚Äì actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.[29] In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch,[30] that has a dynamic functional sense in Atharvaveda for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and "dharmani" is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that gods used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.[31] Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.[32][33]

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism.[34] According to Brereton,[35] _Dharman_ occurs 63 times in Rig-veda; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as _satyadharman_, and once as _dharmavant_, 4 times as _dharman_ and twice as _dhariman_.

Indo-European parallels for "Dharma" are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian _darmƒÅn_ "remedy", the meaning of which is rather removed from Indo-Aryan _dh√°rman_, suggesting that the word "Dharma" did not have a major role in the Indo-Iranian period, and was principally developed more recently under the Vedic tradition.[36] However, it is thought that the _Daena_ of Zoroastrianism, also meaning the "eternal Law" or "religion", is related to Sanskrit "Dharma".[37] Ideas in parts overlapping to _Dharma_ are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese Tao, Egyptian Maat, Sumerian Me.[38]

Eusebeia and dharma

is from Indian Emperor Asoka in 258 BC, and found in Afghanistan. The inscription renders the word _Dharma_ in Sanskrit as Eusebeia in Greek, suggesting _dharma_ in ancient India meant spiritual maturity, devotion, piety, duty towards and reverence for human community.[39]]] In mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered in Afghanistan, the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription. This rock inscription contains Greek and Aramaic text. According to Paul Hacker,[40] on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia.[41] Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate gods, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one's parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[42] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one's duty toward the human community.[43]

Rta, maya and dharma

The evolving literature of Hinduism linked _dharma_ to two other important concepts: _·πöta_ and _MƒÅyƒÅ_. ·πöta in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.[44][45] MƒÅyƒÅ in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder,[46] thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch[47] suggests ·πöta and dharma are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while MƒÅyƒÅ and dharma are also correlative concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.[48][49]

Day proposes dharma is a manifestation of ·πöta, but suggests ·πöta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of dharma, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner. The following verse from the Rigveda is an example where _rta_ and dharma are linked:


Hinduism

Dharma is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts.[50] It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics.[51] Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.[52] Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,[53] is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the dharma of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow.[54] In terms of humanity, dharma is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life.[55][56]

In Hinduism, _dharma_ includes two aspects ‚Äì _sanƒÅtana dharma_, which is the overall, unchanging and abiding principals of dharma and is not subject to change, and _yuga dharma_, which is valid for a yuga, an epoch or age as established by Hindu tradition.

In Vedas and Upanishads

The history section of this article discusses the development of dharma concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of dharma continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to _satya_ (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç, truth),[57][58] in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

In the Epics

The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims Daniel Ingalls,[59] places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.

In the Second Book of Ramayana, for example, a peasant asks the King to do what dharma morally requires of him, the King agrees and does so even though his compliance with the law of dharma costs him dearly. Similarly, dharma is at the centre of all major events in the life of Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana, claims Daniel Ingalls.[60] Each episode of Ramayana presents life situations and ethical questions in symbolic terms. The issue is debated by the characters, finally the right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. For this reason, in Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as "dharmaraja".[61]

In Mahabharata, the other major Indian epic, similarly, dharma is central, and it is presented with symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.[62] The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,[63] because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:[64] one answer is of Bhima, which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of Yudhishthira, which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective Arjuna, which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of dharma.There is considerable amount of literature on dharma-related discussion in Hindu Epics: of Egoism versus Altruism, Individualism versus Social Virtues and Tradition; for examples, see:

-   Johann Jakob Meyer (1989), Sexual life in ancient India, , Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 92‚Äì93; Quote ‚Äì "In Indian literature, especially in Mahabharata over and over again is heard the energetic cry ‚Äì Each is alone. None belongs to anyone else, we are all but strangers to strangers; (...), none knows the other, the self belongs only to self. Man is born alone, alone he lives, alone he dies, alone he tastes the fruit of his deeds and his ways, it is only his work that bears him company. (...) Our body and spiritual organism is ever changing; what belongs, then, to us? (...) Thus, too, there is really no teacher or leader for anyone, each is his own Guru, and must go along the road to happiness alone. Only the self is the friend of man, only the self is the foe of man; from others nothing comes to him. Therefore what must be done is to honor, to assert one's self..."; Quote ‚Äì "(in parts of the epic), the most thoroughgoing egoism and individualism is stressed..."
-   Raymond F. Piper (1954), "In Support of Altruism in Hinduism", _Journal of Bible and Religion_, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1954), pp. 178‚Äì183
-   J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pp. 119‚Äì135. There is extensive discussion of dharma at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism, observes Ingalls; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, ultimately concluding that the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny.[65] The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of dharma, they are a means of communicating dharma with metaphors.[66]

According to 4th century Vatsyayana

According to Klaus Klostermaier, 4th century Hindu scholar VƒÅtsyƒÅyana explained dharma by contrasting it with adharma.[67] VƒÅtsyƒÅyana suggested that dharma is not merely in one's actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to VƒÅtsyƒÅyana:[68][69]

1.  Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one's partner)
2.  Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
3.  Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
4.  Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self study)
5.  Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
6.  Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

According to Patanjali Yoga

In the Yoga system the dharma is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.[70]

Dharma is part of yoga, suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga.[71] Patanjali explained dharma in two categories: _yama_ (restraints) and _niyama_ (observances).[72]

The five yama, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures , abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others.[73] The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.[74]

The five niyama (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one's means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.[75]

Sources

Dharma is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism.[76][77] For example, Apastamba Dharmasutra states:

In other texts, three sources and means to discover dharma in Hinduism are described. These, according to Paul Hacker, are:[78] First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one's teacher. Second, observing the behavior and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one's education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, "atmatusti" is the source of dharma in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.[79]

Dharma, life stages and social stratification

Some texts of Hinduism outline _dharma_ for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is _Manusmriti_, which describes the four _Varnas_, their rights and duties.[80] Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss _dharma_ with no mention of _Varna_ (caste).[81] Other dharma texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas.[82] Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. Bhrigu, in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that dharma does not require any varnas.[83] In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their asramas of life, in search of moksa.[84]see:

-   Van Buitenen, J. A. B. (1957). "Dharma and Moksa". _Philosophy East and West_, Volume 7, Number 1/2 (April ‚Äì July 1957), pp. 38‚Äì39
-   Koller, J. M. (1972), "Dharma: an expression of universal order", _Philosophy East and West_, 22(2), pp. 131‚Äì144. While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the dharma of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate dharma with varna system of India.[85][86] In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves "protectors of varnasramadharma" ‚Äì that is, dharma of varna and asramas of life.[87][88]

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline four ƒÅ≈õramas, or stages of life as individual's dharma. These are:[89] (1) brahmacƒÅrya, the life of preparation as a student, (2) g·πõhastha, the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) vƒÅnprastha or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) sannyƒÅsa, the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism.[90] Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are Artha ‚Äì the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; Kama ‚Äì the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and Moksa ‚Äì the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu dharma.see:

-   Karl H. Potter (1958), "Dharma and Mok·π£a from a Conversational Point of View", _Philosophy East and West_, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (April ‚Äì July 1958), pp. 49‚Äì63.
-   William F. Goodwin, "Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy", _Philosophy East and West_, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan. 1955), pp. 321‚Äì344.

Dharma and poverty

Dharma being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles,[91] Shatapatha Brahmana 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and _dharma_ through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow Dharma ‚Äì moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to dharma.[92]

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and dharma reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress.[93][94] Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.[95]

Dharma and law

The notion of _dharma_ as duty or propriety is found in India's ancient legal and religious texts. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per dharma. The Dharmashastra is a record of these guidelines and rules.[96] The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of dharma related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras.[97] Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars.[98][99] These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of dharma in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.[100]


Buddhism

In Buddhism _dharma_ means cosmic law and order,[101] but is also applied to the teachings of the Buddha.[102] In Buddhist philosophy, _dhamma/dharma_ is also the term for "phenomena".[103] In East Asia, the translation for dharma is Ê≥ï, pronounced _f«é_ in Mandarin, _choe ‡ΩÜ‡Ωº‡Ω¶‡ºã_ in Tibetan, _beop_ in Korean, _h≈ç_ in Japanese, and _ph√°p_ in Vietnamese. However, the term dharma can also be transliterated from its original form.

Buddha's teachings

For practicing Buddhists, references to "dharma" (_dhamma_ in Pali) particularly as "the Dharma", generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddha-Dharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.

The status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the "three realms" (Sanskrit: _tridhatu_) and the "wheel of becoming" (Sanskrit: _bhavachakra_), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian logos: this is known as _Dharmakaya_ (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the essence of the "84,000 different aspects of the teaching" (Tibetan: _chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong_) that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various schools of Buddhism have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the "truth", or the ultimate reality of "the way that things really are" (Tibetan: _Cho_).

The Dharma is one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the Buddha, meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the Dharma, meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the Sangha, meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.

Chan Buddhism

Dharma is employed in Ch'an in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in Dharma transmission.


Jainism

The word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas,[104] or teachings of any competing spiritual school,[105] a supreme path,[106] socio-religious duty,[107] and that which is the highest _mangala_ (holy).[108]

The term _dharma_ also has a specific ontological and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six dravya (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of _jiva_ (soul, atman) and _ajiva_ (non-soul), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (pudgala), space (akasha), time (kala), principle of motion (dharma), and principle of rest (adharma).[109][110] The use of the term _dharma_ to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.[111]

The major Jain text, _Tattvartha Sutra_ mentions _Das-dharma_ with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues". These are forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy. AcƒÅrya Am·πõtacandra, author of the Jain text, _Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya_ writes:


Sikhism

For Sikhs, the word _dharam_ () means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.[112] Guru Granth Sahib in hymn 1353 connotes dharma as duty.[113] The 3HO movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.[114]


Dharma in symbols

The importance of _dharma_ to Indian sentiments is illustrated by India's decision in 1947 to include the Ashoka Chakra, a depiction of the _dharmachakra_ ( the "wheel of dharma"), as the central motif on its flag.[115]

Wennerberg 1981: 95f.), but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian _darmƒÅn_ 'remedy', which has little bearing on Indo-Aryan _dh√°rman_. There is thus no evidence that IIr. *dharman was a signiÔ¨Åcant culture word during the Indo-Iranian period." (p.449) "The origin of the concept of dharman rests in its formation. It is a Vedic, rather than an Indo-Iranian word, and a more recent coinage than many other key religious terms of the Vedic tradition. Its meaning derives directly from dhr 'support, uphold, give foundation to' and therefore 'foundation' is a reasonable gloss in most of its attestations." (p.485)
