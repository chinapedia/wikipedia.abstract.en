In mathematics, a binary relation _R_ on a set _X_ is ANTISYMMETRIC if there is no pair of _distinct_ elements of _X_ each of which is related by _R_ to the other. More formally, _R_ is antisymmetric precisely if for all _a_ and _b_ in _X_

    if _R_(_a_, _b_) with _a_ ≠ _b_, then _R_(_b_, _a_) must not hold,

or, equivalently,

    if _R_(_a_, _b_) and _R_(_b_, _a_), then _a_ = _b_.

(The definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether _R_(_a_, _a_) actually holds or not for any _a_.)

The divisibility relation on the natural numbers is an important example of an antisymmetric relation. In this context, antisymmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if _n_ and _m_ are distinct and _n_ is a factor of _m_, then _m_ cannot be a factor of _n_. For example, 12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12.

The usual order relation ≤ on the real numbers is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers _x_ and _y_ both inequalities _x_ ≤ _y_ and _y_ ≤ _x_ hold then _x_ and _y_ must be equal. Similarly, the subset order ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets _A_ and _B_, if every element in _A_ also is in _B_ and every element in _B_ is also in _A_, then _A_ and _B_ must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:

_A_ ⊆ _B_ ∧ _B_ ⊆ _A_ ⇒ _A_ = _B_

Partial and total orders are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., the equality relation), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the "preys on" relation on biological species).

Antisymmetry is different from asymmetry, which requires both antisymmetry and irreflexivity. Thus, every asymmetric relation is antisymmetric, but the reverse is false.
