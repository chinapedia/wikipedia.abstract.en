MICHEL RIGAL (Paris April 6, 1914-August 11, 1978 in Flims, Switzerland) was General Commissioner of the Scouts de France from 1952 to 1970, a period of crises and reforms during which he endeavored to maintain the unity of the movement.[1]

In opposition to Rigal, Pierre Delsuc resigned from the National Council of the Scouts de France in 1958. Their opposition became public in June 1960 when Delsuc denounced Rigal's position in a letter published by _France catholique_, a moderate Catholic weekly, over the Algerian War.
