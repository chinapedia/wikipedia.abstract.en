JAMES SLACK is the Downing Street Press Secretary and a former British journalist.[1] Previously Home Affairs editor of the _Daily Mail_, he was appointed political editor of the newspaper in October 2015 in succession to James Chapman, who had been appointed as spokesman for George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer.[2]

Slack wrote the controversial "Enemies of the People" front page article on 4 November 2016 which criticised senior judges in England's High Court of Justice who had made a decision the British _Daily Mail_ newspaper did not agree with.

At the _Daily Mail_, as Home Affairs editor, Slack was involved in the campaign to stop Gary McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, from being extradited to the United States to face charges relating to computer hacking.[3][4][5]

At the end of January 2017 it appeared that Slack was to be appointed as the Prime Minister's Official Spokesperson,[6][7] which was confirmed on 10 February 2017.[8] Following the resignation of Lizzie Loudon on 18 April 2017, Slack assumed the position of Downing Street Press Secretary.[9]
