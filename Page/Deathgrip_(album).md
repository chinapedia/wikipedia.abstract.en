_DEATHGRIP_ is the fourth album by the metalcore band Fit for a King.


Critical reception

Natasha Van Duser of New Noise Magazine wrote "The only real flaw of Deathgrip is that it leaves the listener wanting more, which isn’t a bad thing, but it would be interesting to see a more experimental sound come from the band on a song or two in the future. Fit For A King’s obvious ability to layer a record with an ever growing range of styles is the highlight of this album as a whole, and their keen eye for detailing in song structure is definitely their biggest strength. If you’re looking for a heavy album that has a lot of instrumental dynamics and vocal value, then _Deathgrip_ is the perfect solution."[1]

Sound Fiction said "Overall _Deathgrip_ is a massive triumph as Fit For A King takes every successful element of their previous records and combines it all on this one. Whether you are a fan of massive breakdowns, bouncy riffs, metalcore one liners or melodic choruses, this album will not disappoint. Fit For A King are poised to make big waves with _Deathgrip_, so be sure to keep your eye on the band in years to come."[2] Nick Abela of Metal Injection reports "All in all Deathgrip is a solid release. It's the same style of music that Fit For A King has been writing for half of a decade now but better. The breakdowns, the riffs, the drumming, the clean vocals to the entire feel of the whole record is a great example of how metalcore is still alive and well in 2016. Though there are a few less surprises than anticipated with the album there are still some moments that are unexpected and makes it a record that you can find yourself listening to more than once."[3]

Connor Welsh of New Transcendence wrote "Previous efforts from Fit for a King were varying shades of solid—engaging, catchy and aggressive, but all plagued by errant monotony that made each release wear thin rather quickly. _Deathgrip_ does away with that—stripping out some of the more superfluous aspects of the band’s dynamic to give a raw, relentless display of comprehensive metal-turned-hardcore mastery that demands to be acknowledged. With dissonant, downtuned bruisers like “Stacking Bodies” to send mosh pits into full-swing contrasted by more emotionally riveting songs like “Cold Room,” telling the story of the death of a child and the struggle to feel complete as a parent thereafter, Deathgrip devastates with its heaviness, but also does a number on the listener’s emotional sensibilities as well. Fit for a King are as furious as we’ve ever heard them—but ten times more mature, energetic, dynamic and explosive, making Deathgrip an album that, after years of growth, is truly fit for a king."[4] Randy Shatkowski of Antihero Magazine replied "As an album, Deathgrip isn’t perfect. It’s familiar, often too familiar. When that’s the only noticeable problem with an album this strong, though, that familiarity is easily forgivable. The long and short of it is, yes, a couple tracks here are weak, but more than twice that many songs are highlights, not just of the album, or even the band, but the genre as a whole. That’s worth a little filler."[5]

Lucas Munachen of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote "Deathgrip just does everything right. It's not only heavy, but incredibly engaging, choosing to keep the dynamics interesting rather than monotonous, something previous releases too often fell claim to. It's a powerful result of continued dedication and commitment, and one the band should be immensely proud of. Admitting its thematic content may deter more sensitive listeners, Deathgrip deserves nothing but praise.",[6] while Scott Fryberger also of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote "Lots of heavy riffs, guttural growls, and breakdowns; these things are fine, and I'm sure they make for an excellent and engaging live show, but they don't help my waning interest in heavy music."[7] Finally, Philip Trapp of HM Magazine stated "Few are truly ready for death’s grip, yet we’ll all feel it eventually as dust always returns to the earth. Something can be said for not fearing those who kill the body — as ISIL did in Paris last year — since they cannot kill the soul. Fit for a King knows this. Still, those may seem futile words for the families of those who lost their lives at the hands of terrorists. Alongside FFAK, we should all be pissed off at it. Are we ready?"[8] Mason Beard of Indie Vision Music wrote "Overall, it’s a slamming record. If you are into heavy and melodic music, go buy this thing. Amazing music!"[9]


Lyrical themes

The song "Pissed Off" is written, after the band was scheduled to play a show with Eagles of Death Metal when the November 2015 Paris attacks occurred.[10]
