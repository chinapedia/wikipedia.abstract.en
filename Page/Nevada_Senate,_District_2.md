History

The present second senatorial district came into existence when the senatorial districts were reapportioned after the 2010 Census.[2] The revised borders went into effect on January 1, 2012 for filing for office, and for nominating and electing senators. They became effective for all other purposes on November 7 of the same year â€“ the day after Election Day, when most senator terms began. In the Nevada Revised Statutes, the area of District 2 is defined using census tracts, block groups, and blocks.[3]

The first elections in the district were held in 2014, and were won by Mo Denis.[4] In the period between 2012 and 2014, when the new District 2 was in use, it was represented by Mo Denis, who was elected senator of the former District 2 in 2010.[5][6] During the 2013 session, he was the Senate Majority Leader.[7] When Denis was elected in 2010, the second district didn't include Downtown Las Vegas.[8]
