JANICZA MICHELLE BRAVO FORD (born 25 February 1981) is an American writer, director, and photographer.[1][2]


Early life

Bravo was born in New York City, the daughter of Ana María Ford and Rafael Ángel Landers.[3] Her parents, who are tailors, are both from Latin America. From the time she was three months old to a teenager, she grew up on an Army base in Panama City, Panama, until she was 13 years old, when her family moved back to the United States.[4] She spent time going back and forth between the United States and Panama throughout her childhood.[5]

Bravo attended New York University, where she majored in directing and design for theater, which included costume and set design.[6][7] She also studied acting at New York University's Playwrights Horizons Theater School.[8]


Career

After graduating from college Bravo worked as a stylist and wardrobe designer.[9]

Bravo got her start writing and directing a series of short films. Her first film, _Eat_, which debuted at the 2011 SXSW Film Festival and was picked up by Vice, and starred Katherine Waterston and Brett Gelman. The film told the story of a woman who is locked out of her apartment and meets an odd neighbor.[10][11]

Her second film, the 2013 dark comedy named _Gregory Go Boom_, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and featured Michael Cera as a paraplegic who lives near the Salton Sea.[12] The film was shot on location in Bombay Beach and Slab City, California.[13] Bravo worked with JASH to produce and release the film online.[14][15] The film's title was inspired by the 1976 François Truffaut film, _Small Change_, where the boy falls out the window yet survives.[16]

Her third short film, 2014's _Pauline Alone_, features Gaby Hoffmann as a Craigslist-obsessed woman.[17][18]

In 2014, she was named one of _Filmmaker_ magazine's "25 New Faces of Independent Film".[19]

In 2015, Bravo shot a featurette on Victoria Beckham for _Glamour_{{'}}s 25th Anniversary Women of the Year Awards called "Victoria Beckham Is Living a Life Filled with Style and Grace".[20][21]

In 2016, Bravo released the short film, _Hard World for Small Things_, a live-action virtual reality film that was a "day in the life" depiction of South Central. The project was grant funded by Eve Cohen and James Kaelan of Seed and Spark.[22] The film was inspired by the death of a cousin, visiting from Panama, who in the summer of 1999 was asphyxiated by the police in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn is a case of mistaken identity.[23] It was shot using GoPro cameras for the virtual reality company Wevr, and was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, and the AFI Festival Los Angeles.[24][25] The title of the film was inspired by a line of dialog in the 1955 film noir film, _The Night of the Hunter_,[26] and marked a distinct departure in theme, as it focused on race and politics.[27]

Also in 2016, Bravo took the short, _Woman in Deep_, to the 2016 SXSW Film Festival. The film stars Alison Pill and was grant-funded via The Nantucket Project.[28]

In 2016, Bravo directed her first feature, an independent film called _Lemon_, which she co-wrote with Brett Gelman.[29] The film stars Gelman, Michael Cera, and Judy Greer, and includes performances by Nia Long, Fred Melamed, Shiri Appleby, Rhea Perlman, David Paymer, Gillian Jacobs, Megan Mullally, Martin Starr, Jeff Garlin, and Marla Gibbs. After a somewhat turbulent pre-production process, the film was picked up by Killer Films and Burn Later Productions and premiered at Sundance in 2017.[30]

In addition to creating her own work, Bravo directed season 1 episode 9, "Juneteenth", of the FX television show _Atlanta_, which stars and was created by Donald Glover, as well as season 3 episode 5, "Bertie's Birthday", of the Netflix television show _Love_, which was created by and stars Paul Rust.[31]
