Production

In December 2014, director Thulasidas announced that he would make a bilingual Malayalam and Tamil horror thriller titled _Girls_ featuring actress Iniya in the lead role.[1] Initially titled _Ini Varum Naatkal_ in Tamil, seven more actresses, Anusree, Aparna Nair, Archana, Muktha Bhanu, Subiksha and Seetha Lekshmi were signed in January 2015 to play other roles, with the shoot beginning thereafter in Wagomon.[2][3] As the film progressed, some actresses dropped out and were replaced by actresses including Reshma, Sabitha, Sajitha Madathil and Neena Kurup, while Nadhiya also joined in late 2015 to play a significant character.[4]


Release

The Times of India gave the Tamil version of the film a negative review, citing "the pre-release buzz around _Thiraikku Varaadha Kadhai_ has mostly centred around a lesbian angle in the film, but that proves to be counter-productive", adding that "the film is also irresponsible in a way because it furthers the negative stereotyping of LGBTs as persons with low moral values and murderers".[5] Similarly, The New Indian Express stated "it was a knot that had the potential to turn into a riveting thriller, but itâ€™s opportunity lost here".[6] Likewise, the Malayalam version garnered similar reviews, with a reviewer noting "Thulasidas is a veteran who has directed around 25 films as well as some long running popular serials. So he is not short on experience but his latest bi-lingual offering, _Girls_, seems an amateurish attempt by someone in the initial days of his directing career".[7]
