ZUME PIZZA is an automated pizza delivery restaurant in Mountain View, California. It was founded in 2015[1] by Chairman and CEO[2] Alex Garden,[3] and by Julia Collins.[4][5]

The company uses robots for many stages of pizza production.[6][7] Initially, humans shaped the pizza dough and added toppings; the pizzas are cooked en route in a van equipped with 56 GPS-equipped automated ovens, timed to be ready shortly before arrival at the address, and are then sliced by a self-cleaning robot cutter.[8][9][10] The company has secured a patent on the cooking of food during delivery,[11][12] which includes predictive algorithms to anticipate customer choices, and plans to partner with other businesses to also provide other robot-prepared meal components, such as salads and desserts.[13]

Zume is reported to have raised $6Â million in Series A investment funding in 2016, some from Jerry Yang[14] and some from SignalFire, a venture capital firm that identifies investment opportunities using machine learning.[15] In the fall of 2017, Zume Pizza raised $48M in Series B funding.[16]

In April 2018, Zume announced that they would be expanding their concepts beyond pizza and planned to begin licensing their technology.[17]

In November 2018, the company raised $375 million from SoftBank, giving the company a valuation of $2.25 billion.[18]
