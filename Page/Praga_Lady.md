It was most common as a four-door saloon but also available with two doors or as a convertible and pick-up truck.

The car re-entered production after the end of World War II, with about 400 more being built.[6] The now nationalized concern built this small series for official use. Praga proceeded to concentrate exclusively on trucks and buses.
