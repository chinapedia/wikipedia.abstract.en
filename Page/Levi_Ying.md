LEVI YING (; 1949â€“2013) was a Taiwanese politician.


Early life and legal career

Ying was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1949.[1] He received a bachelor's degree in political science from National Taiwan University and obtained a master's degree in East Asian studies from National Chengchi University.[2] Ying then moved to the United States, and earned a SJD from Whittier Law School in California, setting up a law practice there prior to launching a political career in his native Taiwan.[3]


Political career

Ying served in the National Assembly as a member of the Kuomintang.[4] He renounced U.S. citizenship to take up the position.[5] He was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1998 as a New Party politician, and lost reelection in 2001,[6] as all New Party legislative incumbents failed to retain their legislative seats.[7][8]


Later life

After Ying's term ended, he moved back to the U.S. on a green card sponsored by his wife, who had remained a U.S. citizen, and he eventually naturalized as a U.S. citizen once again.[9] He died on April 29, 2013, aged 64.[10] His funeral was held at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.[11]
