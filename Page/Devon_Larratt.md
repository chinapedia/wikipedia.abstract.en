DEVON "NO LIMITS" LARRATT (born 24 April 1975 in Victoria, British Columbia) is a Canadian professional armwrestler.[1]


Life and career

Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Larratt's interest in armwrestling began in the early teens. After joining the Canadian Special Forces at the age of 21, Larratt still managed to train and compete, and he credits the experience gained at different military bases as a large part of his success.[2] In 2013, Larratt had surgery on his right arm and elbow, forcing him to compete left-handed only. He also had the same surgery on his left elbow in 2016, but recovered much faster that time, as he won the World Armwrestling League (WAL) with that arm the same year.[3]

Larratt has, amongst other things, been known for defeating the armwrestler John Brzenk. He is also the first armwrestler to be the world champion at both right and left hand at the same time.[4]

In 2015, Larratt won the WAL Left-Arm Heavyweight (196–225 lb) title. He also took third place in the Right-Arm.[5] In 2016, Larratt successfully defended his WAL Left-Arm title, and also won the WAL Right-Arm Heavyweight championship claiming two "hammers".[6] In 2017 he repeated this result by winning the WAL Championships again, in both the Right-Arm Heavyweight and Left-Arm Heavyweight categories. In 2018 he lost the WAL Championship Right-Arm Super Heavyweights final against Michael Todd. Later that year, during Armfight 50, he lost a left-hand match-up against Denis Cyplenkov 6-0. Devon Larratt currently weighs a whopping 268 lb going into his match up against Dave Chaffee, which Larratt won 3-1.
