METHANDRIOL BISENANTHOYL ACETATE (brand name NOTANDRON-DEPOT), or METHYLANDROSTENEDIOL BISENANTHOYL ACETATE, also known as 17Α-METHYLANDROST-5-ENE-3,17Β-DIOL 3,17Β-DI(3-OXONONANOATE), is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 5-androstenediol.[1][2] It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C3,17β di(3-oxononanoate) (or dienanthoylacetate) ester of methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol) – and acts as a prodrug of methandriol in the body.[3] Methandriol bisenanthoyl acetate is administered by intramuscular injection and, relative to methandriol, has an extended duration via this route due to a depot effect afforded by its ester.
