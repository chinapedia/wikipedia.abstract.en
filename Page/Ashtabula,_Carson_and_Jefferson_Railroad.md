The ASHTABULA, CARSON & JEFFERSON RAILROAD or ASHTABULA, CARSON & JEFFERSON SCENIC RAILROAD is a Class III railroad that operates from a junction in Carson to Jefferson in Ashtabula County, Ohio. ACJR operates freight along with a tourist operation.[1] The main commodities hauled on the line are fertilizer, paper for corrugated boxes, and plastic pellets used in injection molding.[2]


History

ACJR operates on one of the few remaining portions of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway's Franklin Division. The line was built by the LS&MS between 1871 & 1872, and serviced communities south of Ashtabula including Plymouth, Griggs, Jefferson, Leon, and Andover. These communities were serviced with heavy freight and passenger service to and from Ashtabula. What used to be a dayâ€™s travel to Ashtabula could be done in an hour or less.[3]


The birth of the AC&J Railway

The Ashtabula Carson & Jefferson Railroad Company (AC&J) was chartered in 1984 by local businessman, working with the State of Ohio, to preserve the Jefferson Industrial Track. Since 1984, the AC&J has developed business locally, and primarily hauls fertilizer, paper used in the manufacturing of corrugated boxes, and plastic pellets used in injection molding. Freight operations occur 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Additionally, the AC&J transloads bulk commodities from rail car to truck for shipment locally. The fertilizer and plastic pellet shipments are examples of this business segment. The AC&J hauls 1200 cars per year.[4]

The AC&J Railroad's sister company, AC&J Scenic Line, Inc., has been operating passenger excursions since 1991, reintroducing area residents and tourists to the pleasures of railroad passenger service. AC&J Scenic Line offers charter services and has special events through out the year, in addition to the regularly scheduled weekend passenger trains.[5]


Today

The ACJR still operates freight out of Jefferson, Ohio. The scenic railroad and its excursion service was terminated in 2014.[6]
