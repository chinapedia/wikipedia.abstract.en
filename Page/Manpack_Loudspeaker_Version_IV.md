The MANPACK LOUDSPEAKER VERSION IV (MLX4) is a military loudspeaker. It is known to be used by the Civil Military Operations Group (CMOG) of the Philippine Army which developed the equipment used for Information Support Affairs operations.[1]


History

The equipment was used by the CMOG at the Zamboanga City crisis of 2013 where it was used to broadcast to Moro National Liberation Front members the procedure for surrendering to government forces. It was also used to broadcast military songs to boost the morale of government troops in the operation. The use of the MLX4 is the first in the history of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) but according to the Military Information Support Team of the US Army the use was the first of its kind in the world.[2]

The MLX4 was also used in the same year as part of the AFPâ€™s Disaster Response Operations following the onslaught of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The equipment was used to relay messages to victims seeking to receive relief goods as well as provide moral support by playing Christmas and other inspirational songs in December of that year.[3]
