History

Historical_photo_of_Desjardin_S.A.S._from_the_19th_century,_still_named_"A._Desjardins".jpg The Paris-based company was launched by the Desjardins family in 1848, during the formation of the French Constitution and in the middle of the industrial revolution under the name A. Desjardins. The company later changed the firm's name to "Desjardin". The company produced packaging that served food preservation.

Desjardin used tin cans from its launch. It also manufactured tinware such as pots and pans. By the late nineteenth century, the company worked with film studios to provide metal cans designed to preserve 16mm and 35 mm films.[3] Desjardin-metal-tin-19th-century-Image1.png The company established relationships with filmmakers and has played a role in protecting film throughout the twentieth century. It provided tin for Eastman Kodak and Agfa Geveart for many years. As a partner with Laboratories Ã‰clair, LTC, Desjardin provided movie theaters with tins as well.

In the 1900s Desjardin expanded the number of industries it served to include biscuits and confectionary. After moving to the Paris suburb of Gonesse in 1963, the Desjardins family continued to run the business until 1981, when current President Pierre Gachot took over. Since then Gachot has introduced new packaging automation tools, such as the Caviar box vacuum closer in 1988.[4][5]

Vacuum packaging performed by its semi-automatic machine, the Vacuum Closing Machine (VCII), has allowed Desjardin to conserve offset printing inks.[8]

As a manufacturer of packaging for the cosmetics industry, Desjardin offers containers to accommodate cream, balm, powder, oil, sprays and other cosmetics. The company commonly makes aluminum containers with screw on lids for cosmetics. Desjardin provides pharmaceutical packaging for products such as lipgloss, or gel. Typical containers are round with screw lids made of aluminum and metal tins. The company makes larger boxes for the food industry to package biscuits, confectionary and chocolates. They also make tin round containers for tea, coffee and spices.[9][10]


Sustainability and the Environment

Desjardin states that they mainly use Tinplate and aluminum as primary materials due to their environmentally friendly properties of easy recycling and lack of wasteful byproducts.[11][12] Desjardin has been emphasizing the environmental benefits of aluminum, which include abundance, flexibility (engineering) and durability.[13][14] While aluminum manufacturers must still deal with mining, chemical and landfill issues, Desjardin encourages recycling and is participates in the debate on developing more sustainable solutions. The company argues that aluminum is both lightweight and strong, making is highly efficient with minimal damage to the environment. Aluminum helps lower both shipping costs and greenhouse gas emissions.[15]
