NEWLAY AND HORSFORTH RAILWAY STATION, until 1889 and from 1961 called NEWLAY STATION, was a station on the route of the former Leeds and Bradford Railway (now part of the Airedale Line and the Wharfedale Line), located on the right bank of the River Aire and on the left bank of the Leeds and Liverpool canal between Horsforth in the north and Bramley in the south. It was accessed from Pollard Lane, which still crosses the railway on a bridge there, and served mainly the southern parts of Horsforth in West Yorkshire, England.


History

Newlay_&_Horsforth_2_railway_geograph-2168599.jpg The station was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway in 1846. The latter was later absorbed by the Midland Railway), which became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway upon the 1923 Grouping. In 1905 the station was expanded with a second pair of tracks and a goods shed south of the line.[1] During World War I the station served in particular the National Ordnance Factory in Newlay.[2] Upon nationalisation, the station became part of the network of the Eastern Region of British Railways in 1948. It was closed on 22 March 1965 by the British Railways Board as a consequence of the Beeching Axe,[3] together with the stations Armley Canal Road, Kirkstall, Calverley & Rodley and Apperley Bridge on the same line.
