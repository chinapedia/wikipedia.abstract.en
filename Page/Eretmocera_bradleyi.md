_ERETMOCERA BRADLEYI_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Hans Georg Amsel in 1961. It is found in the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[1][2]

The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are dark brown with a diffuse, pale yellow costal spot at the beginning of the costal fringe, and a similar dorsal spot obliquely below the costal one. The hindwings are pale red, but appear darker at the extreme apex due to some brownish scales. Adults have been recorded on wing in February.[3]
