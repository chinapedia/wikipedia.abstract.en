_COMPOSITION NO. 94 FOR THREE INSTRUMENTALISTS_ is a live album by composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton featuring two variations of the title piece recorded in Italy in 1980 and first released on the Golden Years of New Jazz label in 1999.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Steve Loewy stated: "the results should please even the most discerning critic of free jazz. Surprises abound, as this is one of the finest examples of extraordinary free music from the 1980s. The poor sound quality diminishes the thrill somewhat, but this CD remains an important document and a major contribution to Braxton's discography."[3] On _All About Jazz_ Glenn Astarita noted "Much of the interplay is fascinating via multitonal instrumentation and imaginative improvisation. As usual, Braxton's perspectives and deeply personal if not scholarly approach defies categorization as his bandmates also give it their all! Anthony Braxton’s _Composition No.94 For Three Instrumentalists (1980)_ is an important edition to a form of music which evolves yet beckons rediscovery".[4] _Jazz Review_{{'}}s Lee Prosser said: "This is avant guard jazz, futuristic in the sense it is utilizing alternative sound combinations in harmonic counterpoint. An unusual work, one that reflects the creative mind of Anthony Braxton."[5]
