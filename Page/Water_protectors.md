Water protectors are primarily members of Indigenous communities in North America and do not consider themselves to be protesters, but performing a sacred duty through non-violent resistance to activities which endanger water.[1] Water protectors reject the term "protester" because of its links to colonialism and other negative connotations.[2] Water is considered sacred by Indigenous peoples as it is necessary for all living things on earth.[3] Their actions are considered a duty to honour ancestors, to current peoples, and future generations.

Water protectors played an important role in the resistance and protests to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the United States. Water protectors continue to play an active and increasingly visible role in subsequent actions intended to protect, honor, and make visible the importance of water. There are strong connections between the water protection movement and the land protector movement and Indigenous environmental activism.[4] Water protectors resist the installation of pipelines, fossil fuel industries[5] and resource extraction activities such as fracking because these actions can lead to the contamination of water. Water protectors resist activities that harm water, especially across traditional territories.

Activism can come in the form of the erection of blockades on reserve lands or traditional territories to block corporations from resource extraction activities.[6] Water and land protectors also erect camps as a way to occupy traditional territories and strengthen cultural ties.[7] In May 2018 Mi'kmaq peoples in Nova Scotia blocked the Alton Gas company from work on a project to pump water from the Shubenacadie River for a natural gas project.[8] Action has also been taken across Canada, including Muskrat Falls hydro dam project in Labrador[9][10], Burnaby Mountain over the Trans Mountain pipeline[11], and the Wet’suwet’en peoples construction of resistance camps, including Unist’ot’en Camp and action against the construction of a Coastal GasLink pipeline in Northern British Columbia.[12]

Water protectors are a community role primarily taken on by women.[13][14] In some Indigenous cultures in North America women are considered to have a special relationship with water because of women's connection to water through the act of pregnancy and birth.[15] In Anishinaabe culture women perform ceremonies to honour water and water is considered to be alive and have a spirit.[16]

The water protectors are connected to other initiatives to make the importance of water more visible, such as the ongoing series of water walks[17] in the Great Lakes region started by Josephine Mandamin.

Well-known water protectors include: Autumn Peltier, Wikwemikong First Nation[18][19][20]; Josephine Mandamin, Marjorie Flowers, Inuk, Nunatsiavut, Labrador[21][22]
