_WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS_ is the second comedy album by the duo Proctor and Bergman of the Firesign Theatre. It was originally released in September 1975 on Columbia Records, and was among the Firesign Theatre's last Columbia albums, along with _In the Next World, You're on Your Own_ and _Forward Into The Past_. It was recorded from a live performance at The Bottom Line which contained material adapted or re-used from their 1973 studio album _TV or Not TV_, plus a few new sketches.


Title and cover art

The title is taken from a song Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman wrote, which parodies Vice President Thomas R. Marshall's famous quote, "What this country needs is a good five-cent cigar". The song says what this country needs is "a good five-cent _joke_". The album's cover art mimics a cardboard cigar box lid, with a painting of Proctor dressed as a field worker in jean overalls and a straw hat, with Bergman dressed in a suit as the plantation owner. Proctor holds up a wad of cash, while Bergman holds a handful of cigars. The picture provides another joke, as the crop appears to be marijuana (some of which sticks out of Proctor's hip pocket) rather than tobacco.
