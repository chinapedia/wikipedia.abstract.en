(1807). Hesiod cites inspiration from the Muses while on Mount Helicon.]] HESIOD (;[1] _Hēsíodos_) was a Greek poet generally thought by scholars to have been active between 750 and 650 BC, around the same time as Homer.[2][3] He is generally regarded as the first written poet in the Western tradition to regard himself as an individual persona with an active role to play in his subject.[4] Ancient authors credited Hesiod and Homer with establishing Greek religious customs.[5] Modern scholars refer to him as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought (he is sometimes considered history's first economist),[6] archaic Greek astronomy and ancient time-keeping.


Life

The dating of Hesiod's life is a contested issue in scholarly circles (_see § Dating below_). Epic narrative allowed poets like Homer no opportunity for personal revelations. However, Hesiod's extant work comprises several didactic poems in which he went out of his way to let his audience in on a few details of his life. There are three explicit references in _Works and Days_, as well as some passages in his _Theogony_ that support inferences made by scholars. The former poem says that his father came from Cyme in Aeolis (on the coast of Asia Minor, a little south of the island Lesbos) and crossed the sea to settle at a hamlet, near Thespiae in Boeotia, named Ascra, "a cursed place, cruel in winter, hard in summer, never pleasant" (_Works_ 640). Hesiod's patrimony there, a small piece of ground at the foot of Mount Helicon, occasioned lawsuits with his brother Perses, who seems, at first, to have cheated him of his rightful share thanks to corrupt authorities or "kings" but later became impoverished and ended up scrounging from the thrifty poet (_Works_ 35, 396).

Unlike his father, Hesiod was averse to sea travel, but he once crossed the narrow strait between the Greek mainland and Euboea to participate in funeral celebrations for one Athamas of Chalcis, and there won a tripod in a singing competition.[7] He also describes a meeting between himself and the Muses on Mount Helicon, where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a laurel staff, a symbol of poetic authority (_Theogony_ 22–35). Fanciful though the story might seem, the account has led ancient and modern scholars to infer that he was not a professionally trained rhapsode, or he would have been presented with a lyre instead.[8]

'' (1891), by Gustave Moreau. The poet is presented with a lyre, in contradiction to the account given by Hesiod himself in which the gift was a laurel staff.]]

Some scholars have seen Perses as a literary creation, a foil for the moralizing that Hesiod develops in _Works and Days_, but there are also arguments against that theory.[9] For example, it is quite common for works of moral instruction to have an imaginative setting, as a means of getting the audience's attention,[10] but it could be difficult to see how Hesiod could have travelled around the countryside entertaining people with a narrative about himself if the account was known to be fictitious.[11] Gregory Nagy, on the other hand, sees both _Pérsēs_ ("the destroyer" from , _pérthō_) and _Hēsíodos_ ("he who emits the voice" from , _híēmi_ and , _audḗ_) as fictitious names for poetical personae.[12]

It might seem unusual that Hesiod's father migrated from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, the opposite direction to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west had something to do with that, since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family.[13] The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.[14]

In spite of Hesiod's complaints about poverty, life on his father's farm could not have been too uncomfortable if _Works and Days_ is anything to judge by, since he describes the routines of prosperous yeomanry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (_Works and Days_ 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441–6), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.).[15] One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in _Theogony_ (337–45), listening to his father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant.[16] The father probably spoke in the Aeolian dialect of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are no words that are certainly Boeotian. His basic language was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's Ionian.[17]

It is probable that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the _Works_ were engraved.[18] If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps as an aid to memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission.[19] Possibly he composed his verses during idle times on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.[20]

The personality behind the poems is unsuited to the kind of "aristocratic withdrawal" typical of a rhapsode but is instead "argumentative, suspicious, ironically humorous, frugal, fond of proverbs, wary of women."[21] He was in fact a misogynist of the same calibre as the later poet Semonides.[22] He resembles Solon in his preoccupation with issues of good versus evil and "how a just and all-powerful god can allow the unjust to flourish in this life". He recalls Aristophanes in his rejection of the idealised hero of epic literature in favour of an idealised view of the farmer.[23] Yet the fact that he could eulogise kings in _Theogony_ (80 ff., 430, 434) and denounce them as corrupt in _Works and Days_ suggests that he could resemble whichever audience he composed for.[24]

Various legends accumulated about Hesiod and they are recorded in several sources:

-   the story about the _Contest of Homer and Hesiod_;[25]
-   a _vita_ of Hesiod by the Byzantine grammarian John Tzetzes;
-   the entry for Hesiod in the _Suda_;
-   two passages and some scattered remarks in Pausanias (IX, 31.3–6 and 38.3 f.);
-   a passage in Plutarch _Moralia_ (162b).

Two different—yet early—traditions record the site of Hesiod's grave. One, as early as Thucydides, reported in Plutarch, the _Suda_ and John Tzetzes, states that the Delphic oracle warned Hesiod that he would die in Nemea, and so he fled to Locris, where he was killed at the local temple to Nemean Zeus, and buried there. This tradition follows a familiar ironic convention: the oracle that predicts accurately after all. The other tradition, first mentioned in an epigram by Chersias of Orchomenus written in the 7th century BC (within a century or so of Hesiod's death) claims that Hesiod lies buried at Orchomenus, a town in Boeotia. According to Aristotle's _Constitution of Orchomenus,_ when the Thespians ravaged Ascra, the villagers sought refuge at Orchomenus, where, following the advice of an oracle, they collected the ashes of Hesiod and set them in a place of honour in their _agora_, next to the tomb of Minyas, their eponymous founder. Eventually they came to regard Hesiod too as their "hearth-founder" (, _oikistēs_). Later writers attempted to harmonize these two accounts.

, as "cruel in winter, hard in summer, never pleasant."]]

Greeks in the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC considered their oldest poets to be Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod and Homer—in that order. Thereafter, Greek writers began to consider Homer earlier than Hesiod. Devotees of Orpheus and Musaeus were probably responsible for precedence being given to their two cult heroes and maybe the Homeridae were responsible in later antiquity for promoting Homer at Hesiod's expense.

The first known writers to locate Homer earlier than Hesiod were Xenophanes and Heraclides Ponticus, though Aristarchus of Samothrace was the first actually to argue the case. Ephorus made Homer a younger cousin of Hesiod, the 5th century BC historian Herodotus (_Histories_ II, 53) evidently considered them near-contemporaries, and the 4th century BC sophist Alcidamas in his work _Mouseion_ even brought them together for an imagined poetic _ágōn_ (), which survives today as the _Contest of Homer and Hesiod_. Most scholars today agree with Homer's priority but there are good arguments on either side.[26]

Hesiod certainly predates the lyric and elegiac poets whose work has come down to the modern era. Imitations of his work have been observed in Alcaeus, Epimenides, Mimnermus, Semonides, Tyrtaeus and Archilochus, from which it has been inferred that the latest possible date for him is about 650 BC.

An upper limit of 750 BC is indicated by a number of considerations, such as the probability that his work was written down, the fact that he mentions a sanctuary at Delphi that was of little national significance before c. 750 BC (_Theogony_ 499), and that he lists rivers that flow into the Euxine, a region explored and developed by Greek colonists beginning in the 8th century BC. (_Theogony_ 337–45).[27]

Hesiod mentions a poetry contest at Chalcis in Euboea where the sons of one Amphidamas awarded him a tripod (_Works and Days_ 654–662). Plutarch identified this Amphidamas with the hero of the Lelantine War between Chalcis and Eretria and he concluded that the passage must be an interpolation into Hesiod's original work, assuming that the Lelantine War was too late for Hesiod. Modern scholars have accepted his identification of Amphidamas but disagreed with his conclusion. The date of the war is not known precisely but estimates placing it around 730–705 BC, fit the estimated chronology for Hesiod. In that case, the tripod that Hesiod won might have been awarded for his rendition of _Theogony_, a poem that seems to presuppose the kind of aristocratic audience he would have met at Chalcis.[28]


Works

for _Hesiodi Ascraei quaecumque exstant_ (1701)]]

Three works have survived which are attributed to Hesiod by ancient commentators: _Works and Days_, _Theogony_, and _Shield of Heracles_. Only fragments exist of other works attributed to him. The surviving works and fragments were all written in the conventional metre and language of epic. However, the _Shield of Heracles_ is now known to be spurious and probably was written in the sixth century BC. Many ancient critics also rejected _Theogony_ (e.g., Pausanias 9.31.3), even though Hesiod mentions himself by name in that poem. _Theogony_ and _Works and Days_ might be very different in subject matter, but they share a distinctive language, metre, and prosody that subtly distinguish them from Homer's work and from the _Shield of Heracles_[29] (see Hesiod's Greek below). Moreover, they both refer to the same version of the Prometheus myth.[30] Yet even these authentic poems may include interpolations. For example, the first ten verses of the _Works and Days_ may have been borrowed from an Orphic hymn to Zeus (they were recognised as not the work of Hesiod by critics as ancient as Pausanias).[31]

Some scholars have detected a proto-historical perspective in Hesiod, a view rejected by Paul Cartledge, for example, on the grounds that Hesiod advocates a not-forgetting without any attempt at verification.[32] Hesiod has also been considered the father of gnomic verse.[33] He had "a passion for systematizing and explaining things".[34] Ancient Greek poetry in general had strong philosophical tendencies and Hesiod, like Homer, demonstrates a deep interest in a wide range of 'philosophical' issues, from the nature of divine justice to the beginnings of human society. Aristotle (_Metaphysics_ 983b–987a) believed that the question of first causes may even have started with Hesiod (_Theogony_ 116–53) and Homer (_Iliad_ 14.201, 246).[35]

He viewed the world from outside the charmed circle of aristocratic rulers, protesting against their injustices in a tone of voice that has been described as having a "grumpy quality redeemed by a gaunt dignity"[36] but, as stated in the biography section, he could also change to suit the audience. This ambivalence appears to underlie his presentation of human history in _Works and Days_, where he depicts a golden period when life was easy and good, followed by a steady decline in behaviour and happiness through the silver, bronze, and Iron Ages – except that he inserts a heroic age between the last two, representing its warlike men as better than their bronze predecessors. He seems in this case to be catering to two different world-views, one epic and aristocratic, the other unsympathetic to the heroic traditions of the aristocracy.[37]

_Theogony_

The _Theogony_ is commonly considered Hesiod's earliest work. Despite the different subject matter between this poem and the _Works and Days_, most scholars, with some notable exceptions, believe that the two works were written by the same man. As M.L. West writes, "Both bear the marks of a distinct personality: a surly, conservative countryman, given to reflection, no lover of women or life, who felt the gods' presence heavy about him."[38]

The _Theogony_ concerns the origins of the world (cosmogony) and of the gods (theogony), beginning with Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, and shows a special interest in genealogy. Embedded in Greek myth, there remain fragments of quite variant tales, hinting at the rich variety of myth that once existed, city by city; but Hesiod's retelling of the old stories became, according to Herodotus, the accepted version that linked all Hellenes.

The creation myth in Hesiod has long been held to have Eastern influences, such as the Hittite Song of Kumarbi and the Babylonian Enuma Elis. This cultural crossover would have occurred in the eighth and ninth century Greek trading colonies such as Al Mina in North Syria. (For more discussion, read Robin Lane Fox's _Travelling Heroes_ and Walcot's _Hesiod and the Near East._)

_Works and Days_

The _Works and Days_ is a poem of over 800 lines which revolves around two general truths: labour is the universal lot of Man, but he who is willing to work will get by. Scholars have interpreted this work against a background of agrarian crisis in mainland Greece, which inspired a wave of documented colonisations in search of new land. This poem is one of the earliest known musings on economic thought.

This work lays out the five Ages of Man, as well as containing advice and wisdom, prescribing a life of honest labour and attacking idleness and unjust judges (like those who decided in favour of Perses) as well as the practice of usury. It describes immortals who roam the earth watching over justice and injustice.[39] The poem regards labor as the source of all good, in that both gods and men hate the idle, who resemble drones in a hive.[40] In the horror of the triumph of violence over hard work and honor, verses describing the "Golden Age" present the social character and practice of nonviolent diet through agriculture and fruit-culture as a higher path of living sufficiently.[41]

Other writings

In addition to the _Theogony_ and _Works and Days_, numerous other poems were ascribed to Hesiod during antiquity. Modern scholarship has doubted their authenticity, and these works are generally referred to as forming part of the "Hesiodic Corpus" whether or not their authorship is accepted.[42] The situation is summed up in this formulation by Glenn Most: Of these works forming the extended Hesiodic corpus, only the _Shield of Heracles_ (, _Aspis Hērakleous_) is transmitted intact via a medieval manuscript tradition.

Classical authors also attributed to Hesiod a lengthy genealogical poem known as _Catalogue of Women_ or _Ehoiai_ (because sections began with the Greek words _ē hoiē,_ "Or like the one who ..."). It was a mythological catalogue of the mortal women who had mated with gods, and of the offspring and descendants of these unions.

Several additional hexameter poems were ascribed to Hesiod:

-   _Megalai Ehoiai_, a poem similar to the _Catalogue of Women_, but presumably longer.
-   _Wedding of Ceyx_, a poem concerning Heracles' attendance at the wedding of a certain Ceyx—noted for its riddles.
-   _Melampodia_, a genealogical poem that treats of the families of, and myths associated with, the great seers of mythology.
-   _Idaean Dactyls_, a work concerning mythological smelters, the Idaean Dactyls.
-   _Descent of Perithous_, about Theseus and Perithous' trip to Hades.
-   _Precepts of Chiron_, a didactic work that presented the teaching of Chiron as delivered to the young Achilles.
-   _Megala Erga_ or _Great Works_, a poem similar to the _Works and Days_, but presumably longer
-   _Astronomia_, an astronomical poem to which Callimachus (_Ep_. 27) apparently compared Aratus' _Phaenomena_.
-   _Aegimius_, a heroic epic concerning the Dorian Aegimius (variously attributed to Hesiod or Cercops of Miletus).
-   _Kiln_ or _Potters_, a brief poem asking Athena to aid potters if they pay the poet. Also attributed to Homer.
-   _Ornithomantia_, a work on bird omens that followed the _Works and Days_.

In addition to these works, the _Suda_ lists an otherwise unknown "dirge for Batrachus, [Hesiod's] beloved".[43]


Reception

-   Sappho's countryman and contemporary, the lyric poet Alcaeus, paraphrased a section of _Works and Days_ (582–88), recasting it in lyric meter and Lesbian dialect. The paraphrase survives only as a fragment.[44]

'', now conjectured to be an imaginative portrait of Hesiod.[45]]]

-   The lyric poet Bacchylides quoted or paraphrased Hesiod in a victory ode addressed to Hieron of Syracuse, commemorating the tyrant's victory in the chariot race at the Pythian Games 470 BC, the attribution made with these words: "A man of Boeotia, Hesiod, minister of the [sweet] Muses, spoke thus: 'He whom the immortals honour is attended also by the good report of men.'" However, the quoted words are not found in Hesiod's extant work.[46]
-   Hesiod's _Catalogue of Women_ created a vogue for catalogue poems in the Hellenistic period. Thus for example Theocritus presents catalogues of heroines in two of his bucolic poems (3.40–51 and 20.34–41), where both passages are recited in character by lovelorn rustics.[47]

Portrait bust

The Roman bronze bust, the so-called _Pseudo-Seneca,_ of the late first century BC found at Herculaneum is now thought not to be of Seneca the Younger. It has been identified by Gisela Richter as an imagined portrait of Hesiod. In fact, it has been recognized since 1813 that the bust was not of Seneca, when an inscribed herma portrait of Seneca with quite different features was discovered. Most scholars now follow Richter's identification.[48]


Hesiod's Greek

Hesiod employed the conventional dialect of epic verse, which was Ionian. Comparisons with Homer, a native Ionian, can be unflattering. Hesiod's handling of the dactylic hexameter was not as masterful or fluent as Homer's and one modern scholar refers to his "hobnailed hexameters".[49] His use of language and meter in _Works and Days_ and _Theogony_ distinguishes him also from the author of the _Shield of Heracles_. All three poets, for example, employed digamma inconsistently, sometimes allowing it to affect syllable length and meter, sometimes not. The ratio of observance/neglect of digamma varies between them. The extent of variation depends on how the evidence is collected and interpreted but there is a clear trend, revealed for example in the following set of statistics.

    _Theogony_ 2.5/1
    _Works and Days_ 1.5/1
    _Shield_ 5.9/1
    Homer 5.4/1[50]

Hesiod does not observe digamma as often as the others do. That result is a bit counter-intuitive since digamma was still a feature of the Boeotian dialect that Hesiod probably spoke, whereas it had already vanished from the Ionic vernacular of Homer. This anomaly can be explained by the fact that Hesiod made a conscious effort to compose like an Ionian epic poet at a time when digamma was not heard in Ionian speech, while Homer tried to compose like an older generation of Ionian bards, when it was heard in Ionian speech. There is also a significant difference in the results for _Theogony_ and _Works and Days_, but that is merely due to the fact that the former includes a catalog of divinities and therefore it makes frequent use of the definite article associated with digamma, oἱ.[51]

Though typical of epic, his vocabulary features some significant differences from Homer's. One scholar has counted 278 un-Homeric words in _Works and Days_, 151 in _Theogony_ and 95 in _Shield of Heracles_. The disproportionate number of un-Homeric words in _W & D_ is due to its un-Homeric subject matter.[52] Hesiod's vocabulary also includes quite a lot of formulaic phrases that are not found in Homer, which indicates that he may have been writing within a different tradition.[53]

Rhapsodes in post-Homeric times are often shown carrying either a laurel staff or a lyre but in Hesiod's earlier time, the staff seems to indicate that he was not a rhapsode, a professional minstrel. Meetings between poets and the Muses became part of poetic folklore: compare, for example, Archilochus' account of his meeting the Muses while leading home a cow, and the legend of Cædmon.
