_BLACK FOX_ is a 1995 American television miniseries based on Matt Braun's 1973 novel of the same name starring Christopher Reeve, Raoul Trujillo, Tony Todd and Nancy Sorel.[1] The miniseries was presented in three parts on CBS.


Plot

Black Fox tells the story of two "blood" brothers, Alan and Britt Johnson-one a former plantation owner, the other his childhood friend whom he freed from slavery-who, with their families, leave Carolina to settle in Texas in the 1860s in hopes of finding a new life. Alan and Britt Johnson, along with other pioneer families, are homesteading on the West Texas frontier.

With the outbreak of the Civil War, word arrives that two Indian tribes, the Comanches and the Kiowas, have joined forces under the leadership of Little Buffalo, whose goal is to drive the white man out of Texas.

In a surprise raid, while the men are away making preparations to defend their homes, the Indians attack, taking hostage every woman and child they can find. While not all the settlers agree, it is decided that because he is black, Britt will have the best chance to negotiate with the Indians for the return of their families and he takes off, alone, for a journey deep into hostile Indian territory.

Reception

TV Guide called it "a sturdy but not truly outstanding sagebrush miniseries" and says it is "admirable for its decision to craft a straightforward saga with serious undertones, this canters, but does not gallop, down a trail of Wild West formulas."[2]
